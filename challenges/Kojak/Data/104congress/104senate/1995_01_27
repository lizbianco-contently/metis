Mr. President, we will continue now the debate on \nSenate bill 1, our efforts to curb the unfunded Federal mandates.\n  Last night we were able to come to an agreement so that we can \nanticipate which amendments we will be debating today. We do not \nanticipate that there will be any votes prior to 11:30 this morning at \nwhich time we anticipate that there will be more than one vote so that \nwe will be voting en bloc.\n  Mr. President, at this point, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 175\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, amendment 175 I believe is now before the \nSenate, which is the provision that would provide that there be a \nsunset of this bill on December 31, 2002.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Michigan is recognized to offer his amendment No. 175.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair.\n  This amendment would provide a sunset of the language which we will \nbe adopting in S. 1 six years after the effective date of S. 1.\n  That is a pretty long sunset provision. We had a shorter sunset \nprovision in S. 993 last year. And the shorter sunset provision was \nadopted unanimously by the Governmental Affairs Committee last year.\n  There was a discussion in the Governmental Affairs Committee last \nyear relative to S. 993 as to whether or not a 3-, 4-, or a 5-year \nsunset was the appropriate length of time, and we finally agreed on \n1998, which I believe was a 4-year sunset at that time.\n  S. 1 has no sunset provision. It should. We are skating out on a new \npond, and I think probably every Member of this body wants to do a lot \nmore to force us to consider the impact of what we do on State and \nlocal and tribal governments. My hunch is that everybody in this body \nagrees that we should give greater consideration to what the impact is \nof our actions on the expenditure of taxpayer dollars at a State and \nlocal level. I have felt that for a long time. One of the reasons I \ncame to this body is because I felt that the Federal Government, the \nCongress, did not give adequate consideration to the impact of their \nactions on local government, in which I was an elected representative. \nI was president of a local city council in my hometown of Detroit and \ntook great umbrage at what the Federal Government was doing to our \nbudget as well as what its programs were doing to our neighborhood. I \ncame here with that instinct and it has grown.\n  The question is, How do we do it? How far do we go? To what extent do \nwe use our internal procedures to force consideration of these impacts? \nDo we go beyond forcing consideration of the estimates to make sure we \nhave the estimates of the impacts? Do we create points of order \naffecting points of order down the road? That is one of the key \ndifferences between S. 1 and S. 993.\n  I think all of us feel that we should and must do better and that we \nhave had too great an impact on local and State government. But there \nare procedures in these bills which are complicated, particularly, may \nI say, in S. 1. S. 1 goes significantly beyond S. 993, which had the \nsupport, by the way--S. 993 had the massive support of Governors and \nlocal officials last year. S. 1 goes beyond that and, of course, also \nhas the support of State and local officials.\n  But the new mechanisms that we have in S. 1 are complicated \nmechanisms. We added a new mechanism yesterday in order to avoid a \nproblem. We added a new mechanism in the Byrd amendment. And it was a \ngood amendment because it got Congress back doing the legislating \ninstead of the agencies down the road. But in order to do that, we \ncreated another process force, so we have a number of additional \ncomplicated processes in S. 1 now as amended. And we should make sure \nthat we can function OK with them. It is just, to me, sort of the right \nthing to do, that when you start out on a new road, you make sure that \nyou have a checkpoint along the way. We sunset legislation around here \nthat has been in place a long time to make sure the programs work. As a \nmatter of fact, one of the first votes that I cast to break a tie in \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee was to force the sunset of \nlegislation. It was kind of a controversial vote. I got a whole lot of \nmy supporters mad at me. It was one of the first votes I cast, a few \nmonths after I came here. I cast a tie-breaking vote which would have \nrequired us to sunset all these authorization bills on programs. The \npeople who supported all those programs were very unhappy because I had \na lot of support from them in my first election. They thought I would \nbe jeopardizing programs by sunsetting. I said we ought to review \nprograms every once in a while. It is a pretty good idea. We ought to \nmake sure programs are working. We ought to have action-forcing \nmechanisms to make sure this Congress, every once in a while, goes back \nand looks at how a program is operating, to make sure it is not \nwasteful, to make sure it is carrying out its purpose. I have been a \nsupporter of sunset since the day I came here. I think most of us have \ntalked about sunsetting laws.\n  It can be argued that this is a process, this is not a program. But \nwe sunsetted some processes around here and when you have a new \nprocess, such as this in S. 1, this is very different from that point \nof order under the Budget Act which looks at what the Federal \nGovernment is going to spend and makes an estimate. This is an effort \nto get an estimate on how much tens of thousands of local governments \nwill need to spend and puts great weight on that estimate, gives it a \ngreat effect down the road. Even with the Byrd amendment, it still has \na massive impact down the road.\n  I do not know why, if last year by unanimous vote the Governmental \nAffairs Committee put a 4-year sunset on S. 993, which was far less \ncomplicated than S. 1, we should not put a 6-year sunset on S. 1. We \nshould have some sunset provision. Now, I offered the sunset amendment, \nwhich was a lot shorter, in committee this year. It was a 3- or 4-year \nsunset. It was tabled, regrettably on a party-line vote.\n  I think part of the reason we have taken so much time on this floor, \nby the way, is because in committee we had a bill of this magnitude \nwhich was introduced on a Wednesday night a few weeks back, went to a \nhearing the next morning, was supposed to go to a markup the next \nmorning, and we delayed that for a day, then was supposed to come to \nthe floor a day later without a committee report. That kind of \ndiscipline which makes it difficult to legislate was enforced in a \nnumber of cases on a party-line vote, which is too bad because this was \na bipartisan bill, with the then ranking member of the committee, the \nprincipal cosponsor, and Senator Glenn, the principal sponsor of S. 993 \nlast year. Nonetheless, that is what happened in committee.\n  I believe it is reasonable that we have a sunset, just the way most \nof us, I believe, feel we should do an awful lot more in the area of \nforcing us to consider the impacts of what we do on State and local \ngovernments, since they are the folks who raise the taxes. We should be \nmuch more aware of the impact of what we do on their budgets. I think \nmost of us also support sunset. Most of the time we support sunset and \ntalk about it.\n  Why 2002? Well, two reasons. First of all, the sunset that was tried \nin committee which was tabled was too short. There was an argument \nraised that that could somehow or other affect the time that a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget would take effect. While \nI was not sure I followed the argument, nonetheless, there was an \nargument made. I have to believe, knowing this person who made that \nargument, that there was a connection that was perceived. That is not \nthe intent of a sunset. This is not to be connected with any effective \ndate in the event we adopt a constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget. One is that I want to disconnect the date from that issue and \nmake sure there is no \n[[Page S1641]] perception that there is some relationship between a \nsunset provision here and effective date on a balanced budget.\n So we need a longer sunset to take away that perception.\n\n  Second, we need a longer sunset than the one offered in committee, \nbecause 2002, which is the date that we would sunset this bill in this \namendment, 2002 is the time when the money runs out for the CBO to do \nthese analyses. We have to reauthorize dollars in 2002 to the CBO and \nthat is a logical time to review this process.\n  So there is a reason to do both the process review as well as to see \nhow much money it takes to keep the process going at the same time. And \nthose are the reasons we have chosen the date 2002 for this sunset \nprovision.\n  It may be argued that nothing prevents us from reviewing these \nprocesses like we can review any program at any time. ``We do not have \nto wait until 2002,'' it will be argued. ``You do not need a sunset to \nreview a program.'' And that is always true; that is an argument \nagainst sunset generically.\n  But nothing is much more difficult around here than to take away \nsomething that already exists. Unless it runs out on its own and you \nhave to review it, it is difficult to take it away, to change it. We \nmay not want to take it away. We may not want to change it. This thing \nmay work just absolutely beautifully.\n  My fear is that S. 1 goes too far and we are going to find ourselves \ntied up too often in either knots or in avoidance, and that we are \ngoing to concoct all kinds of boilerplate to evade something if it is \ntoo tight. If the shoes are going to fit too tightly, we are just going \nto find a new pair of shoes to get around it. And, believe me, there \nare ways to get around S. 1.\n  But we should not be pushed to evade. That should not be the purpose \nor the effect of what we are doing. The effect of what we are doing is \nfor us to consider the impacts of what we do on State and local \ngovernment, not to force us to find a way to evade that obligation and \nresponsibility because we have created a process which does not work \nwell. That is not what any of us I hope want to do around here.\n  But it is difficult to change. One way to make it easier, a little \neasier, is to sunset something. And, given a 6-year period that is in \nthis sunset provision, different from the one I offered in committee \nand longer than the one that was in S. 993, I think it is a reasonable \napproach to give us not only the opportunity but to make sure that we \nlook at this process and to make it a little easier for us to change it \none way or another. We may want to tighten it further. But if you bring \nit to an end and make yourself look at it, you can modify it a lot more \neasily.\n  So, for all those reasons, Mr. President, and my colleagues, I \nbelieve we should adopt the sunset provision. The 2002 date is longer \nthan the one that was in S. 993. It will permit us to do some review a \nlot more easily than we otherwise can, and will force us to do that \nreview, as well. We should make sure that we have not put into place \nsomething which is either not working because it is being evaded or \nsomething which is too tight and can be adjusted or something which \nmaybe should be tightened up in some regard because it has been too \neasily evaded.\n  I do hope we can adopt the sunset provision because, again, of all of \nthe uncertainties that exist in this bill, we should really want to \nreview at an earlier time. Let us make it easier on ourselves to do \nthat review by having this reasonable sunset.\n  Mr. President, I was sorry that I did not yield myself time, because \nwe are under a time agreement. I am wondering how much time I have \nremaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 14 minutes and 50 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho has 15 minutes.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMontana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank my friend and I thank the Chair.\n  My friend from Michigan makes a very persuasive argument on why we \nneed the sunset.\n  If there has been one thing that has changed the landscape of this \nbody and the other body over the last year, it has been the added \ningredient of more men and women being elected to this Congress who \nhave freshly been serving in local government. I think that is why you \nsee quite a lot of interest in this piece of legislation, and why the \nleader chose this bill to be S. 1.\n  I submit to my friend from Michigan that we have laws now that have \ncreated a lot of problems and still have sunsets, but yet the law and \nthe programs created under the law still continue.\n  A case in point is we have not reauthorized the Endangered Species \nAct, yet it has been funded and it comes on today. Many of those kinds \nof rules and regulations that we are going to have to deal with that \nreally have an impact on communities--wetlands, endangered species, \nclean water, all of these acts--are now being funded and are in place, \nbut have not been reauthorized by this Congress.\n  I suggest, if we have created a problem through this piece of \nlegislation, we can fix it or unfix it here. But when we rely on a \nsunset to fix the problem, it does not get fixed. In fact, it rolls on \nand it is a lot easier to say, ``Well, we will not reauthorize that \nthis year. We will continue it and we will continue to fund it.''\n  If there is one thing that really has the American people mad or made \nthem mad last November, it is this kind of a situation. So the sunset \nlaw really does not have much effect. But if there is no sunset law, it \nforces us to either fix or unfix the problem.\n  We have bills being funded now that should be brought up for \nreauthorization and debated on this floor of the Senate and in the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  So if we are trying to get away from this Federal Government, this \nWashington city, imposing unfunded mandates on local governments, then \nthere should be something that forces us to either fix or unfix a \nproblem created by this legislation.\n  I am not saying that there will not be some problems created by this \nlegislation, because I have never seen a perfect piece of legislation \ncome through this body or ever signed by the President. So let us make \nourselves either fix it or unfix it as time goes on.\n  I come out of county government. I want to congratulate my friend \nfrom Idaho, who has been recognized here for his leadership not only on \nthis piece of legislation, but I think we ought to recognize him for \nhis stamina. He says it has been very good for his diet that he went \noff of over the holidays; it has been good for him and now he is \ngetting back in shape.\n  Nonetheless, let Senators not take this piece of legislation and make \nit a meaningless piece of legislation because the Senator from Ohio \nsaid, ``This is a landmark piece of legislation.'' This is a new \ndirection. This makes the Senate take a look at what we do and the \nimpact it has on our State, county, and city governments. I appreciate \nthat.\n  I would submit that the sunset makes no difference at all. In fact, \nit alleviates us from taking the responsibility from what we really do \nin this body. I would not support my friend from Michigan although he \nmakes an argument that is very persuasive.\n  I would not support this amendment. I yield the floor. I thank my \nfriend from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I just wish to thank the Senator from \nMontana. I know of his experience as a local official in Montana, as a \ncounty commissioner, and I appreciate the support in not wanting to see \na sunset take place in this legislation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am happy to yield 6 minutes to the \nSenator.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I think this legislation may fall in the \ncategory where we put a lot of things that we considered on \nGovernmental Affairs Committee to be some of the grunt work of \nGovernment. It is not the spectacular consideration of B-2 and M1-A1 \ntanks and things like that that are easy to visualize mentally and get \na handle on.\n  I think the choice of the word ``sunset'' may be a very poor choice \nof words. The word might more properly be ``spotlight'' or \n``searchlight,'' that \n[[Page S1642]] we will reexamine this thing under a microscope to see \nwhether it is working or not working. It is not automatically \nterminated. Sunsetting, you are saying you are using that as a forcing \ndevice to say what we really will look at this thing and take a good \nlook at it and see what is working and what is not working.\n  The Senator from Michigan very wisely, I think, tailored this to fit \nexactly the money flow that is already programmed for CBO. That runs \nout to 2002. So, in effect, before we reauthorize the money for CBO, we \nwill have to take a look at it. This means that we really have to put \nthe thing under a spotlight, a microscope, and really consider what is \ngoing on.\n  We know around here unless we are forced to do something like that we \nonly rarely will go back and relook at a program and reanalyze it and \nmake sure it is working right. I would say the reason I think this is \nso important that we do this is that this is historic legislation. It \nmay be some of the grunt work of Government. It may be some of those \nmundane operations of Government that do not get that much public \nattention except a few editorials and the local officials who see this \nas being vitally important, as well as the State officials for the \nunfunded mandates that have been sent down to them over the years that \nare now just crushing them in, and crushing them in an economic vise \nfrom which they have no alternative but to do what they have been \ndoing, scream to the Federal Government for relief.\n  This is historic. I believe that this piece of legislation is truly \nthe first piece of legislation that is going to start redefining the \nFederal, State, and local relationships, the first such redefinition I \nthink since clear back in the New Deal days of Franklin Delano \nRoosevelt. Prior to Roosevelt, people took care of people. Communities \ntook care of their own people. Neighbors took care of neighbors then. \nWe were not a mobile, flowing society with people and families moving \nall over the country. In those days, most of the people lived in the \nsame community they grew up in and people took care of their own, and \nfamilies took care of families, and so on. Then in the days of the \nGreat Depression this country really lost control. The American \nexperience was in danger of going down the tubes. We had whole sections \nof the country moving out, the Okie going to California, people no \nlonger capable of families taking care of families and communities \ntaking care of themselves. The New Deal came in with all of its \nproposals that assumed many of those responsibilities that the local \ncommunities had had before.\n  That resulted over the last 60 years in a mass of programs, some went \ntoo far, some were absolutely vital to the survival, to the social \nnetwork and fabric of this country. So most of them were good. Some of \nthem went too far. Now, some of the Federal mandates have so hit the \nStates and local communities that they can no longer survive under this \nkind of an economic impact without saying the Federal Government has to \nfund those responsibilities being given to us, or we just can not do it \nanymore.\n  So this is truly landmark legislation. We have come to a point where \nwe are redefining this Federal, State, and local relationship. Now, I \ngive that little bit of background to say that is why I think what the \nSenator from Michigan has done is so important. Because I think to say \nthat if at the end of 6 years when the money runs out for this and we \nare getting ready to reauthorize the money for CBO to carry out their \nparticularly important responsibilities under this act, at that point, \nwe really will see how this relationship is working. That is all he is \nsaying.\n  ``Let's force ourself to look at it, something we never probably will \ndo unless we are forced to do it by some amendment like this,'' and say \nthat at that time period it will sunset, we will reauthorize and look \nat it. Nobody is proposing it will just go out of existence at that \ntime. What he is saying, it will sunset and we will have to reauthorize \nand make sure it is fine-tuned and doing the job it is supposed to do.\n  I see this only as common sense. That is the reason why I am so glad \nto cosponsor the amendment and speak in support of it. I think this \ntruly is landmark legislation, and I think it is only common sense that \nwe require ourselves to reexamine this new Federal-State relationship \nat the end of this first 6-year period. It will probably take a good \npart of that period, the first 3 or 4 years, to really get this system \nworking well.\n  We have forced upon ourselves the discipline here saying that we will \nno longer just pass things without taking into consideration in advance \nthe economic impact on the States and local communities. We are saying \nwe are forcing ourselves to do that, have to make these estimates and \nwe have to have a vote that is required. It is not funded or not \nauthorized for funding. Then we say a point of order will lie against \nit and we have to have a specific vote to go beyond that point and even \nconsider that legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time yielded has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am happy to yield one minute additional.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, we are saying we force ourselves to do \nthat. This is very complicated, what we have gotten into with the \nproposed amendments here on the floor. It is very, very complex, very, \nvery, intricate.\n  Dr. Weiss, our staff director on Governmental Affairs, drew up \novernight a flowchart which I wish we had a print of it but I know this \nproposal will not be visible on TV, but it shows the intricate pattern \nof what can happen to an amendment once it is submitted, and it either \ngoes through a ``yes'' track or a ``no'' track. This is a very \ncomplicated piece of legislation. I know flowcharts like this always \nlook more complicated than maybe are real and practical in every day \nlife, but this is not a simple bill. It redefines the whole Federal, \nState, and local relationship.\n  I think Senator Levin is quite right in saying we should force \nourselves, put in law that we know at the end of this period we will \ntruly have to reconsider this thing. That is exactly what we will do. \nAt that time we will fine-tune it and see where we will go from there. \nThis is redefining the whole Federal-State relationship. It is landmark \nlegislation. The least we can do is look at it at the end of this \nfunding period and make absolutely concern it is working. If not, we \nwill correct it then. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes now to my friend \nfrom Maine, who like me is also a former mayor.\n  Mr. COHEN. Thank you, Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the \namendment. I do so with some hesitation since I have very high regard \nfor the former chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, now \nranking member, and my good friend from Michigan, Senator Levin.\n  I must say that when the Senator from Ohio talked about this being \ngrunt work on the Governmental Affairs Committee, coming from him I \nthink that is a bit of an overstatement. A former marine-aviator-\nastronaut, we like to joke from time to time, saying what on Earth was \nhe doing, and the fact is he has done a lot. He has done a lot and he \ncontinues to do a lot on the Governmental Affairs Committee, but the \nnotion that somehow the Governmental Affairs Committee would not be \nreviewing and overseeing this particular piece of legislation, I think, \nis not entirely accurate.\n  I have worked with Senator Levin since I have been in the Senate. If \nthere is one thing we do, it is conduct oversight. Week after week \nafter week we conduct oversight on virtually every facet of our \nGovernment. I must say that they are correct, this is landmark \nlegislation. This is a new concept that we are undertaking. A new \nrelationship that we are trying to establish with the States and local \ncommunities.\n  But the notion that somehow, because we passed landmark legislation, \nthat it is cast in concrete, I think, is simply inaccurate. It is \nsubject to change each and every year. We can anticipate that there \nwill be complications developed in the implementation of this act. It \nwill be subject to the law of unintended consequences. We will see \npermutations and changes and complaints at certain points in terms of \nhow it is going to ultimately function. But that is what our \nresponsibility is on the Governmental Affairs Committee, to oversee \nexactly how a law is working and is being carried out through \nregulation and through its implementation.\n   [[Page S1643]] So the notion that we are passing this law and it \nwill never be subject to change is simply not a reflection of what goes \non in virtually every other statutory provision, and certainly not with \nsomething as controversial as this.\n  I am not fond of recalling our experience with the special prosecutor \nlaw. Senator Levin and I have worked on that for many years now, since \n1978, where it has come up for reauthorization every 5 years, and we \nhad a sunset provision. We have discussed on several occasions making \nthat law permanent because we felt we had a vital interest in seeing to \nit that we had a provision on the books that remained there and did not \nhave to go through that period of time where we were under the gun, the \nguillotine coming down to chop off that bill.\n  We knew it was subject to political pressures and, in fact, it \nhappened. At the very end of the Bush administration, because of the \nopposition that developed for political reasons--mostly on this side \nbut not all--we lost that bill. Nearly half a year or more went by \nbefore we could bring it back up because of the political complications \nthat developed with this administration.\n  So I would like to see the special prosecutor law made permanent and \nnot be subject to sunset because of exactly the kind of pressures that \nwere generated against that legislation.\n  Mr. President, we can repeal this law if we find that it is not \nworking, if we find that it is contrary to the best interests of our \ncountry. If it is not really establishing a proper balance between the \nFederal and State relationship, we can repeal it at any time. We can \nchange it, we can alter it, we can reshape it. We can do anything we \nwant provided we exercise proper oversight. That is the function of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. That is the function of the oversight \ncommittee that I now chair, with Senator Levin as the ranking member.\n  So the notion that somehow we need to have a cutoff period with the \nguillotine coming down unless we take action to reauthorize it, I \nthink, is a mistake. I am sure there will be opportunities for us to \nreshape and modify the law to make it consistent with our articulated \ngoals.\n  So for those reasons, I urge that we reject the amendment, or, if a \nmotion is going to be made to table, I urge my colleagues to, once \nagain, support the motion to table.\n  I want to reiterate my compliments to the Senator from Michigan for \noffering an amendment that relates to the bill, that is germane and \nrelevant and important.\n  My compliments also to the Senator from Ohio for his steadfast \nperformance on the Governmental Affairs Committee, doing the grunt work \nas well as the astronautic work he does and the more exotic items we \nshare in the Armed Services Committee and even the Intelligence \nCommittee.\n  Of course, I will conclude by commending my colleague who is managing \nthis bill. He has been on the floor, I think, at least a week and a \nhalf. It seems like 3 weeks. I commend him for his endurance and his \nsteadfastness in purpose in passing this legislation. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I just want to thank the Senator from \nMaine. Throughout the course of this debate, which has gone on for many \ndays, he has often been a strong voice on this legislation, S. 1, to \nhelp us curb these unfunded Federal mandates and to deal with mandates \nacross the board. I thank him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 7 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, let me thank my good friend from \nMaine for his usual courtesies. We disagree on this one. We actually \nagreed on this last year when the Governmental Affairs Committee \nunanimously put a sunset provision in S. 993. Senator Roth at that \ntime, who was the ranking member, said--now this relates to S. 993, a \nless complicated bill than S. 1 --Senator Roth said before we had that \nunanimous vote that:\n\n       It does strike me that a 5-year period is a pretty \n     reasonable time to test these proposals.\n\n  I am not suggesting Senator Roth supports the sunset in this bill, by \nthe way. I am simply saying that last year on a less complicated bill, \nwith an even shorter sunset, we had a unanimous vote on the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. And then Senator Roth last year said:\n\n       It is not that extended, and most sunset provisions that I \n     have been acquainted with have been on a 5-year basis.\n\n  Then we took a unanimous vote. In fact, I believe that the Senator \nfrom Idaho last year, who is the prime sponsor of the bill, original \nsponsor of the bill, brought a bill to the floor, and supported a bill \nthat had a sunset provision, a shorter sunset provision and a less \ncomplicated bill.\n  As a matter of fact, last year we received letters from all the \nmayors and all the Governors and everybody else saying, ``S. 993 is \njust terrific, don't amend it, don't amend S. 993,'' we were told. \nWell, S. 993, as it came to the floor, had a sunset provision in it \nlast year.\n  I am not a former mayor. I am only a former city council president, \nbut I have great respect for local officials, as a former local \nofficial, and even if I was not, I would have tremendous respect for \nlocal officials. I know what they go through. I know firsthand from 8 \nyears on that firing line. I have been through this grind. So I respect \nwhat we are trying to do, what the Senator from Idaho is trying to do \nand what the Senator from Ohio is trying to do.\n  I happen to think S. 1 goes too far in terms of a point of order that \nis going to tie up this place. In terms of its general purpose, I \nhappen to agree. But we have a national purpose to serve as well. We \nshould force ourselves to consider the impact of these bills on local \nand State governments. We have not done it sufficiently. We should \nforce ourselves to do it, to get these estimates.\n  But we should also realize that with a new mechanism--a new \nmechanism--this complicated that it makes sense to have a sunset \nprovision, for all the reasons that sunset provisions are put in laws.\n  I was intrigued when the Senator from Montana said, ``Well, we don't \nhave sunset provisions in all these other laws,'' like a bunch of \nenvironmental laws that he mentioned. I think we ought to. I would have \ncast votes for sunset provisions in those kind of laws.\n  As I said before my friend from Maine came to the floor, I cast a \ntie-breaking vote my first few months in office which got everybody \nback home who supported me mad at me because I wanted to put sunset \nprovisions in authorization bills to force us to take a look every once \nin a while and make it a little easier for us to cut back on some of \nthose authorizations.\n  No one has had more experience with the independent counsel law than \nthe Senator from Maine. My experience with him has only been for two \nreauthorizations, and he was on it right at the beginning. He was there \nat the birth. In fact, I think he was the midwife--I do not know if \nthat is the correct gender--but he helped bring it into existence.\n  On the first reauthorization of the independent counsel law--and we \nset a time limit on it--we made some changes which were important. I \nthink the history of the independent counsel law shows the value, \nactually, of setting a time limit. We have made some changes in that \nlaw. There was a gap which created a problem, and the Senator correctly \npoints that out, but we have also made some changes to make that a \nlittle more accountable. We had an independent counsel that frequently \nhas been subject to criticism, and I think legitimate criticism, for \ngoing too far, for spending money which he was not accountable for, for \nusing personnel, for using offices, for travel.\n And so we have reined in that independent counsel. At least we tried \nto in some ways. And the reason we did it is we were forced to do it. \nWe had a 5-year limit. Without that 5-year limit, would we have done \nit? Maybe. I hope so. My \n[[Page S1644]] friend from Maine is an optimist and an idealist in many \nways, too, and I think his hope and belief is we would have done it. He \nmay be right, but it would have been a lot harder if it had not run out \nand we were not forced to do it.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 1 minute and 20 \nseconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will simply close by saying that we had a bill last year \nwhich had a sunset, which was unanimously adopted by Governmental \nAffairs. It was a less complicated bill. It was a shorter sunset. I \nthink good government tells us now have a sunset so that after 6 years \nwe can take a look and either tighten it or loosen it.\n  By the way, some people assume that we would loosen it after 6 years. \nNot necessarily. There may be so many loopholes in this law we may want \nto tighten it after 6 years. And an action-forcing mechanism is a good \nthing when you have something this complicated. We ought to at least \nsunset it once--once--to make sure we are forced to come back to it and \ncan more easily change it. It is tough to change things around here, \nbut if they run out it is a lot easier to change things around here. \nWhen they expire, you have to do something. Then change becomes a \nlittle more easy.\n  I yield the floor, and if I have any time remaining, I reserve it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, with regard to the comment that the \nSenator from Ohio made, which I think sets the stage for the historic \nnature of this legislation, that is, that this is the first legislation \nsince the New Deal in which we are redefining this partnership between \nthe Federal Government, between the national, State, and local \ncomponents of that--when you put it in that context, it is even harder \nfor me to think that in 6 years we are going to wipe it off the books.\n  The Senator from Michigan has said that we ought to review programs \nevery once in awhile. Boy, I agree totally. S. 1 may need \nmodifications, but I would not be content, nor do I think would the \nSenator from Michigan nor do I think would the Senator from Ohio, or \nany Senator, to wait for 6 years until the point of sunset before we \nwould make those modifications if there was something that truly needed \nto be changed. We would not wait. I would not wait.\n  When you talk about what S. 1 provides, S. 1 is about \naccountability--accountability--so that we will know the cost and the \nimpact of these mandates before we enact them, so that we will know \nwhat funds need to be provided to the State and local governments.\n  So with this being based on accountability, why would you sunset \naccountability? I do not think that it follows. In our partnership that \nwe are forging in this new relationship with the Governors and mayors, \nI will tell you that I can stand here and quite enthusiastically affirm \nthat the mayors, the Governors, the county commissioners, the school \nboard administrators, do not want to see a sunset provision in S. 1.\n  If there is a problem, correct the problem. If there is a problem, \ncorrect the problem. But do not wipe the entire legislation off the \nbooks.\n  How long have we been working to deal with these unfunded Federal \nmandates? I remember at the joint hearing we had, my friend from \nMichigan, who was the president of the city council in Detroit, saying \none of the reasons he came to the Senate was to deal with these types \nof issues, these mandates. I know that my friend from New Hampshire, \nthe Presiding Officer of the Senate, has talked about this many times. \nWe all want to do something about unfunded Federal mandates. So why is \nit, now that we are finally going to do something about it, we want to \nsay in 6 years we will take this effort off the books?\n  What sort of a signal does that send to our State and local partners; \nwhat sort of signal does that send to the business leaders of this \ncountry that try to base their decisions on some predictability, to say \nthat, well, we will do that but only for 6 years, and then we will see \nwhat happens, because at that point who knows what happens.\n  Mr. President, the sunset is not the solution. The solution is to \nreview, make modifications when necessary, but not to wipe this off the \nbooks.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Idaho has \nexpired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. How much time do I have remaining? How many seconds do I \nhave remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 14 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will simply say that last year we were \ntold any amendment to last year's bill would be viewed as a bill \nkiller. That is what we were told by the National Governors \nAssociation, the legislatures, and counties. Last year's bill had a \nsunset in it. They opposed knocking out the sunset last year because \nthey opposed any amendment and sunset was in the bill.\n  What has changed since last year? The Senator from Idaho supported \nsunset last year. What has changed since last year? You do not have to \nwait until 6 years comes to change the bill. There is no implication in \na sunset amendment that you have to wait. You can change it tomorrow. \nIt just makes sure we can change things more easily if we decide to do \nso.\n  My time is up.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nyielded 1 minute, 30 seconds for me, 30 seconds for the Senator from \nOhio, so we can just conclude this comment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Clarification. The State and local partners last year \non S. 993 did not want weakening amendments. Also, last year in the \ndraft on S. 993, I never included a sunset. I did not support a sunset. \nI did not vote for a sunset last year. But I understand the process. \nThere were some things in S. 993 I may not have agreed to, sunset being \none of them, but S. 993 in its form was fine.\n  I will now yield 30 seconds to the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, last year in support of the Senator from \nMichigan, we had a letter from the National Governors Association, the \nNational Conference of State Lesislatures, the National Association of \nCounties, the National League of Cities, and the U.S. Conference of \nMayors.\n  In their letter to all Senators, they said:\n\n       Not only will we oppose any amendments not supported by the \n     bill managers, Senators Glenn, William Roth, and Dirk \n     Kempthorne, but we view all amendments as an attempt to \n     defeat our legislation. We urge the defeat of all partisan \n     and extraneous amendments.\n\n  The reason I support Senator Levin is not to say we are going to put \nthis out there and sunset it and there will not be any unfunded \nmandates in legislation. My view is that we put it out there as a \nforcing mechanism to make sure that we have to consider fine-tuning. We \nknow around here we have lethargy, we have inertia; we never get around \nto some of these things unless we put a forcing mechanism on ourselves. \nSo that is the reason I support this. It is not going to sunset it and \ndo away with unfunded mandates. We force ourselves to do it. We are \nforced to take a look at it.\n  I yield my time, if I have any remaining.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby the distinguished Senator from Michigan which would establish a \nsunset date for the unfunded mandates bill.\n  Mr. President, this is a fair and reasonable amendment. Quite \nfrankly, I was surprised that a sunset provision was not included in \nthe legislation before us today. I remind my colleagues that last \nsession's version of the unfunded mandates bill, S. 993, contained a \nsunset date.\n  It was my understanding, and also that of many of the negotiators who \nhammered out this bipartisan compromise, that we would have a sunset \ndate. It is unclear why it fell off the radar screen.\n  Mr. President, I believe a sunset provision is crucial to the success \nof this bill. A sunset provision will help--not \n[[Page S1645]] hurt--this important piece of legislation. Let me spell \nout a few of the reasons why.\n  First, sunset provisions are a common sight on the legislative \nlandscape. For example, the revenues used to fund the Superfund Program \nsunset this year. We have had sunset provisions in everything from the \ncrime bill to school-to-work to the 1990 farm bill. This is not an \nalien provision.\n  Second, we are dealing with brand, spanking new legislation. It is \nuntried and untested. Like a product coming off the assembly line for \nthe first time, this bill needs a trial period so that any problems and \nbugs can be worked out.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has expressed concern over the \nanalyses that are required by the bill. In testimony last year before \nthe Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, Director Reischauer gave \na candid assessment of the difficulty in completing these analyses on a \ntimely basis, not to mention, culling reliable information for them.\n  Now, a sunset provision in 1998 would allow Congress to pause and \nexamine the job that CBO has performed to date. We could then fine \ntune, and if necessary, retool that process to make this bill even more \neffective.\n  Third, a sunset provision is not going to kill the Unfunded Mandates \nProgram. This bill's time has come and I see nothing on the horizon to \nlead me to believe that it would be scrapped 4 years hence.\n  I would also point out that we have 57 cosponsors to date. If the \nlegislation lives up to expectations, we should have no problem \nmarshaling the same support we have today. if not, then Congress can \nbegin the process anew.\n  Fourth, Mr. President, the unfunded mandates bill does not operate in \na vacuum. We have to look at the unfunded mandates bill in the context \nof the Budget Act.\n  The caps and other major provisions of the act--including the \nsupermajority points of order--expire in 1998.\n  Since we will have to revisit the entire Budget Act in 1998, it makes \nsense to be consistent and provide for a 1998 sunset provision in this \npiece of legislation as well.\n  Mr. President, this is a reasonable, well-thought-out amendment. I \nbelieve most of our colleagues can support it. In no manner does the \nsunset provision diminish the effect of the legislation. It merely \ndemonstrates our commitment to quality legislation that meets not only \ntoday's needs, but tomorrow's as well.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I strongly oppose this amendment, which \nwould sunset the reforms of this legislation in the year 2002. There \nmay be changes we might want to make to the statute, after it has been \nin effect a few years. But requiring that it is be sunsetted is another \nmatter entirely.\n  This is not a Government program, whose value might become obsolete \nin the future. What we are talking about here mainly is establishing a \nprocess for congressional consideration of certain types of \nlegislation. I greatly doubt that the premises underlying this bill \nwill become irrelevant in the foreseeable future. We should always be \ncognizant of the potential harm of unfunded mandates, not just for a \nfew years.\n  What makes this amendment additionally objectionable is what it does \nto the chances of ratifying a balanced budget constitutional amendment. \nIt greatly hinders that likelihood. The Governors and State legislators \nhave spoken loud and clear on this issue. They have said that without \nprotection against unfunded Federal mandates, they have little \nincentive to ratify such an amendment.\n  They fear, perhaps not unreasonably, that we might balance our budget \non their backs--by shifting our costs to them through unfunded \nmandates. They would prefer that the protection against this be a part \nof the balanced budget amendment itself. They would certainly, at a \nminimum, want the statutory protections of this bill in place--and for \na period longer than a few years.\n  Every statute is of course repealable. But this one, especially, \nought not have that fact built into it. To do so would undercut the \nvery purpose of this legislation--to assure State, local, and tribal \ngovernments that they have gained respect at the Federal level.\n  Therefore, I strongly urge rejection of this amendment.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, as a strong proponent of sunset \nlegislation, it is with some irony that I stand today in opposition to \nthis amendment. But there is a clear distinction between sunset \namendments that promote fiscal responsibility and those that promote \npolitical gamesmanship. And I submit that this amendment is the latter.\n  Because I believe firmly that Congress must act as gatekeeper when it \ncomes to spending the taxpayers' hard-earned dollars, I authored the \nBudget Accountability Act as a Member of the House of Representatives. \nThis is sunset legislation that helps ensure greater accountability of \nFederal programs and Federal tax collections.\n  For far too long, Congress has conveniently opted out of its \noversight responsibilities. Without sunset legislation, Congress allows \nprograms to live on in perpetuity, unchecked, often far beyond any \nintended usefulness. And without better oversight of our revenue code, \nwe end up with excessive layering of taxes.\n  Under sunset legislation, revenue, and spending bills are reined in, \nno longer automatically renewed without regard to their viability or \nimpact on the deficit.\n  I successfully attached sunset amendments to nearly two dozen bills \nduring my 2 years in the House. But I cannot support my colleague's \nsunset amendment today. Mr. President, sunsetting the Unfunded Mandate \nRelief Act has nothing to do with fiscal responsibility. I fact, this \namendment runs counter to the principles of fiscal responsibility.\n  S. 1 is about relief--relief from Government waste, relief from an \noverreaching Federal Government that can't seem to get its hands out of \nour pockets. Sunsetting a bill which finally provides this desperately \nneeded relief doesn't make any sense, and distorts the original intent \nof sunset provisions.\n  Instead of sunsetting good legislation like the Unfunded Mandate \nRelief Act, we should be sunsetting the burdensome and inflexible \nmandates from which S. 1 is designed to protect us.\n  Mr. President, as everyone in my home State of Minnesota knows, you \nwon't stop a dog from barking by cutting off its tail. If we truly are \nserious about eliminating wasteful spending and providing tax relief, \nthen I invite the gentleman from Michigan to join me in introducing \nreal sunset legislation. In the meantime, I urge my colleagues to \nreject an amendment which is strong on politics, weak on policy, and \nruns counterproductive to the very agenda the American people sent us \nhere to carry out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I now move to table the amendment and ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 197\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, what is the regular order of business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote on the motion to table the Levin \namendment will be held at 11:30. Under the previous order, the question \nis on agreeing to amendment No. 197, offered by the Senator from Ohio. \nThere will be a period of 45 minutes for debate prior to a motion to \ntable, 30 minutes under the control of Senator Glenn, and 15 minutes \nunder the control of Senator Kempthorne.\n  Mr. GLENN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 197 at the desk \nand ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 197 is the pending question.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise to offer this amendment to ensure \nthe point of order requirements in S. 1 lie in only two places. One of \nthose would be just prior to final passage, before we are getting ready \nto vote on the bill, for its consideration once it has been through the \nwhole process. The other point where a point of order would lie would \nbe when the bill comes back from a conference where it might have been \nchanged somewhat, and so a point of order could lie at that point also.\n  I think we need to think about the purpose of this legislation. The \npurpose is to know what the total impact of a \n[[Page S1646]] bill is going to be on State and local governments. They \nare not really interested, as we go along, in each little piece of \nlegislative maneuvering that we do here in the Senate Chamber. What \nthey want to know when a bill is passed is does it hit them with a $1 \nbillion bill, no bill, or does it hit them with a new responsibility \nthey did not have before? States and local governments want to know \nwhat does this legislation do to them? That is what this unfunded \nmandates bill was all about.\n  This bill was not supposed to be designed to create a legislative \nquagmire, some great swamp of procedural difficulties, that would make \nit so difficult to get things passed that even the finest of \nlegislation would have trouble getting through.\n  A moment ago, I held up a flow chart that my staff director put \ntogether overnight that shows some of the procedures under this bill. I \nwish we had time to get this thing lined up in a better order on a \nchart so people could really see all the intricate maneuvers that go on \nhere with the introduction of a bill. Basically, each amendment under \nthe bill as it is now--this would be each amendment:\n  Step 1, the Parliamentarian would have a ruling on whether a mandate \nexists.\n  No. 2, there can be an appeal of that ruling.\n  No. 3 would be a vote on that appeal.\n  The fourth step an amendment would have to go through is the \nParliamentarian would make a ruling on whether the cost exceeds the $50 \nmillion threshold--determining once again if a mandate exists.\n  No. 5 would be an appeal of that ruling.\n  And No. 6 six would be a vote on the appeal of that ruling.\n  No. 7, the Parliamentarian would rule on whether requirements for \nfunding have been met.\n  No. 8 would be appeal of that ruling.\n  And No. 9 would be a vote on the appeal.\n  That is what is in the bill now, and I do not quarrel with that as a \nprocedure except to say what we are trying to do on each piece of \nlegislation is to find out what the total overall impact on the States \nand local governments will be. That is what they are interested in as a \nbottom line. That is the purpose of this legislation.\n  My concern in applying the point of order requirements for CBO cost \nestimates for State and local funding to floor amendments, as S. 1 \ncurrently does, is that the procedure has the serious potential of just \nunnecessarily bogging down the whole legislative process. Why, when the \nfinal total, the final checkout counter total is what we are really \ninterested in, do we want to go through all this self-flagellation of \nputting ourselves through a tortuous process where an amendment could \nhave a point of order against it when it is proposed and then, if it is \nstill approved, that will have an impact on it being included at as \npart of the bill because it has been approved. So then another point of \norder could lie back against the bill itself. We have had appeals from \nthose rulings of the Chair.\n  At each point, then, as I see it, you have a possibility--if someone \nis interested in setting up another means of filibuster, this would be \nan excellent means of doing it. All you have to do is put in a whole \nbunch of amendments that exceed the $50 million threshold and exceed \nthe point of order and you have bogged this Chamber down for days and \ndays on end. I guarantee it. I do not think there are many Members of \nthis Chamber who would vote to put in a new filibuster process, yet \nthat is basically what we are talking about doing.\n  We talk about the election last year. Everybody putting something \ndown hangs it on the election of last year, November 8, as to: We want \na leaner, better working Government. We want to cut out all the \ncomplexities of Government. We want to make Government flow. We want to \nmake Government efficient.\n  If I ever saw anything that is going to make Government inefficient \nhere in the Senate Chamber, it is a process such as we have before us \nnow that basically sets up a brandnew filibuster process. I know my \ncolleagues on the other side of this issue will say we have to have \naccountability. The accountability that I think we need to provide in \nthis bill is the final checkout counter accountability of saying we \nhave made our very best effort to assess the costs of legislation. We \nhave considered the costs on the Senate floor. Here is the relationship \nwith the States. And here is the final checkout counter tab, after all \nthe amendments have been considered.\n  I know they will say at each one of these points, if someone is \nthinking about putting in a $50 million addition to something or $75 \nmillion addition, the accountability requirements of having a point of \norder lie at that time will mean they will think twice before they put \nthat in.\n  I do not think that applies in this case. Because at each point where \nsomeone thinks about putting in an amendment like that, they are also \ngoing to have to consider that total at the time of reckoning at the \nend of consideration of all the amendments. We still will have a point \nof order lying against this whole process. In fact, in the amendment \nprocess someone may say, we think your $75 million back there was too \nmuch so we modify it to another amount by this amendment.\n  Why should we have gone through a point of order and all the other \nunnecessary legislative procedures along the way, when what we really \nwant is the final checkout tab? So the accountability requirement here, \nof making people think twice, I think, is just as strong under this as \nit would be if we kept this point of order lying at every point along \nthe way, which just sets up another potential filibuster procedure.\n  I want to pass an unfunded Federal mandate reform bill. I have been \nwed to this idea with both S. 993 last year and S. 1 this year. We have \nbeen on the floor now for 2 weeks with this legislation and much of it \nhas been misinterpreted. Some of this legislation has been \nmisinterpreted back home by some of our papers. I have been castigated \nas though I was delaying this, which I am not. I have fought and fought \nto get going on this legislation and get it through. But I want to do \nit right. I want to do it properly. However, I want it to be very clear \nI want to pass an unfunded Federal mandate reform bill.\n  I do not want, at the same time, to tie this legislative process in \nsuch a Gordian knot that it will delay good legislation unnecessarily, \nand I think that is the important point.\n  Applying points of order to floor amendments will just add \nbureaucratic overlay nonsense and accomplish very little in this whole \nprocess. I believe that kind of nonsensical bureaucratic overlay is not \nin the interests of the Senate nor is it in the interests of the State \nand local governments with whom we are trying to deal with in this \nlegislation. To set up new, unnecessary procedures that can be misused \nby someone who, even with very good legislation, might want to set up a \nfilibuster procedure by putting in new points of order and so on, just \ndoes not make any sense to me.\n  I understand points of order can currently be raised under the Budget \nAct on amendments that affect direct Federal spending but have not been \nscored by CBO. However, we are not talking about direct spending here; \nwe are talking about estimates.\n  CBO has already told us that estimates in some of these areas will be \nfuzzy estimates at best. But we are still required to consider the best \nestimates we can get up front in this legislation. That is the purpose \nof this whole legislation. Fuzzy estimates for mandates, which are a \ndifferent animal entirely, involve cost estimates for 87,000 different \nState and local jurisdictions.\n  Therefore, we should not overload the Senate with these new \nprocedural requirements that are just not necessary on floor \namendments. Nor should we at the same time overload CBO. CBO told my \nstaff there is no way they could score all amendments containing \npossible intergovernmental mandates under the short timeframe that \nmight be required on the floor. They might be able to provide a rough \nestimate, but it would require them a little longer timeframe to get a \nbetter estimate for us that could not be done in the time that \nlegislation completes its consideration here on the floor.\n I think leaving each amendment subject to a point of order is just a \nprescription \n[[Page S1647]] for additional slowing down of the legislative process \nfor possible real mischief if somebody's objective is to stop a good \npiece of legislation by overloading it with amendments that would \nexceed the $50 million threshold limitation.\n  My amendment would see that the points of order lie in two places. I \nthink this is a very logical. First would be after we know the cost of \nthe bill. We will know the cost of all of the amendments, will have \ntotaled them up and be able to say here is the cost, here is the impact \non State and local governments, and now we have to decide. Is that too \nmuch? At that point, prior to final passage, the point of order would \nlie. Then the legislation, if approved, goes to a conference with the \nHouse of Representatives and we come back out of that conference. \nSometimes the House has different money amounts involved, different \nrequirements.\n  The conference report, as it comes back after having been negotiated \nwith the House in conference, is sometimes different. At that point, it \nmay have changed dramatically. So we need a second point of order that \nwill lie at that point. That was the second point of order. The main \none, of course, was just for the legislation. We have completed it, and \nran through it. We have a point of order apply when we know what the \ntotal tab is. That is where the main point of order will lie. If it \ngoes to conference, comes back with no change or tiny changes, then the \npoint of order would probably not be required against it again. But if \nthere are big changes that come back out of conference, then a point of \norder would lie at that point also.\n  The amounts themselves that have been offered under my bill would not \nbe subject to individual points of order, as is the case in S. 1 where \nthis whole procedure can get so bogged down. My amendment would reduce \nthe potential burden on CBO. It gives them a little more time to refine \ntheir estimates as we are considering bills on the floor, and get them \nto us. This means we will probably have more accurate information. Most \nimportantly, it will prevent us from having the potential of playing a \n100-person game of negotiating a complex legislative labyrinth of some \nkind anytime we consider legislation with intergovernmental \nramifications.\n  Further, my amendment would ensure the conference reports would still \nbe scored, as is the case under S. 1. I have also indicated my \nwillingness to modify the amendment to have the point of order lie \nagainst only the mandates at the third reading rather than against the \nwhole bill. The bill would come out--a point of order could possibly \nlie against it at that point before you even get into amendments--then \ntake all of the amendments in toto and have a vote on the impact of all \namendments as a separate point of order.\n  So I would be willing to do that, if someone thought that was more \nsatisfactory. But there has been no agreement at this time by the other \nside. I repeat that I think what the States and local governments are \ninterested in is not our legislative quagmire here in the Senate and \nhow we may be able to use something like this as another way of \nfilibustering. What they want to know is--when the final deliberations \nhave been made--what is the total impact on the States and local \ngovernments? That is what they want, and that is what should be \nconcentrated on.\n  I do not agree that this is some great force mechanism of \naccountability on each person who will somehow hesitate to offer an \namendment for fear that they are going to be the ones that put us over \nthe limit of $50 million. I just do not think many people are going to \nbe persuaded that is a big consideration for them, and, in addition, \nthe points of order will be taken up later. A point of order will lay \nagainst the accumulation of all of these amendments anyway.\n  So they are under that same kind of accountability restraint whether \nthe point of order would lie on their individual amendment or the \ncumulative effect of all of the amendments considered for a point of \norder at the end of the amending process.\n  If we allow points of order to lie on each floor amendment as it \ncomes up, it seems to me we are sort of going down the road that will \nlead to a legislative traffic jam of grand proportions. Amendments will \nbottleneck legislation like cars on the beltway at rush hour here in \nWashington.\n  In trying to fix the problem with unfunded mandates, let us not go \ndown that road. Let us not create legislative gridlock. I believe that \nmy amendment makes sense. I urge its adoption.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I yield now to the chairman of the \nBudget Committee such time as he would need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you very much, Mr. President, and I thank the \nSenator from Idaho for yielding time.\n  How much time does Senator Glenn have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio has 15 minutes and 11 \nseconds, and the Senator from Idaho has 14 minutes and 35 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first, let me say to Senator Glenn that \nclearly I am not one--and I want to set the record straight from our \nside--accusing Senator John Glenn of delaying, as an instrumentality \nhere; that he has been on the floor trying not to have this happen. \nQuite to the contrary. I am reminded, one of the Republican Senators \nsaid yesterday, I believe at lunch, ``What are we in for this year when \nit takes almost 3 weeks on a measure that the Democrats are for?'' That \nis sort of befuddling. This is going to pass very heavily I believe. We \nhave been here an awful long time. This is an important bill. I want to \naddress it.\n  First of all, there should be no doubt, Mr. President, that this \nunfunded mandate legislation and its enforcement are intended to change \nthe culture of the United States Congress when it comes to voting out \nof committee and on the floor unfunded mandates as defined in this \nbill. This cannot be approached cavalierly, and there will be a very \nbig burden on committees that have jurisdiction over bills that come to \nthe floor that mandate costs on local government that we do not pay \nfor. Let me describe why I think what the bill does is precisely right \nand why what Senator Glenn offers is not what we ought to do because of \nthe basic philosophy of what we are trying to accomplish.\n  First, there should be no misunderstanding. Points of order are not \nself-executed. They are not self-executed. Somebody has to raise a \npoint of order; point No. 1. A manager of a bill has to be very, very \ncareful that the bill that is brought to the floor is not subject to a \npoint of order, or clearly that manager and that committee understands \nthat it is subject to a point of order, and could fail. That means \nthere will be a lot of care and a lot of political analysis before you \nbring the bill to the floor. That is number one.\n  No. 2, we used to say one of the great qualities of the Senate is \nthat if you think of an amendment here on the floor and you are smart \nenough, you just write it out; send it up there. There is no doubt \nabout that. That is one of the fantastic qualities. And the person I \nremember so vividly over the years that did that the best was Senator \nJacob Javits of New York. He did not need a staff. He would just write \none up.\n  What we are saying now is you can do that. You can dream up an \namendment while the bill is working its way through here. But we are \nchanging things a little bit as to one kind of legislation, legislation \nand amendments that mandate local governments to do things and we do \nnot want to pay for them. In that regard, we say you had better be \nprepared. You had better be prepared and get the estimated costs. And, \nif you do not have them or if they exceed the threshold, you had better \nbe prepared to defend on the basis that if someone raises that point of \norder the Senate of the United States would want to say on that \namendment, look, we want to waive it. We think it is so important and \nwe do not think we can quite work out how we pay for it and the like, \nwe think it is so important, we are going to waive it.\n  Frankly, I think it is important that we understand that the United \nStates Senate understands that after the adoption of this legislation, \nif the Glenn amendment fails--and I hope it is tabled--when you get \nready to offer amendments that affect mandates that are unfunded, you \nhad better be prepared to defend them against the costs \n[[Page S1648]] you are sending down. Having said that, if a bill comes \nto the floor and it exceeds the threshold, it is subject to a point of \norder. Frankly, then a point of order could be made, it would fail, \nfall, or it would not. But now we have another tree coming along, and \npeople want to offer an amendment.\n  If an amendment was subject to a point of order and the Senate, in \nits wisdom, waives it, then that amount of mandate is waived and there \ncannot be a point of order against the bill because that was added and \nincreased the threshold. We make the decision, and if we want to waive \nit, we waive it. If we waive it, then my understanding of what we have \ndone is you cannot then raise the point of order against the bill \nbecause the waived mandate makes the bill subject to the threshold \ndimensions.\n  On the other hand, it is true that if we do nothing and let the \namendment go through--and that is the prerogative of the Senate--then \nat some point in time, if it made the bill subject to a point of order, \nyou can still raise it at a later time, because that has never been \nwaived.\n  Frankly, I believe the Senator from Ohio is overly concerned about \nhow this is going to be used. I believe the way it is really going to \nbe used is that people are going to want to get their amendments \npassed, and they are going to do everything they can to make it right \nby the Senate and to make it right by this law, and if it is a \npolitical issue instead of a dollar issue, they are going to win it. \nThat will be a vote around here. Do you indeed want to do it, even \nthough it breaks the threshold?\n  I am very proud that we made that simple. There is only a simple \nmajority there, not a supermajority to do that waiving. I think that \nmeans that since we do not know the details of the future, we cannot \nguess everything in the future. We are giving Americans insurance that \nit can be voted in, if it is very important to America, even if it \nviolates the threshold requirement.\n  The whole theme of this bill is a process for accountability. \nHeretofore, at best, we did not know what we were doing in terms of the \nmandate costs. At worst, we knew it and we were cavalier about it. So \nwhat, change this Clean Air Act and if it costs the States $650 million \nover the next 3 years, so what. Anybody that likes that approach should \nnot like this bill. But we are not going to be doing that anymore.\n  So when you have a serious amendment and you bring it here to the \nfloor, it is at risk, I say to fellow Senators, if in fact it costs out \nsuch that it makes the bill subject to a point of order. And you have \nto work that. You cannot just come down here and say it is such a neat \nthing, I dreamt it up; I am running for office and I would like to get \nit down here. It is going to be put right up front, to the best of our \nability, to analyze and if some Senator is careful, he is going to \nstand up and say I raise a point of order. Again, this is not self-\nexecuting. The Senate can clearly, implicitly or explicitly, decide \nthat it does not want to do anything about the fact that we break the \nthreshold and order some mandates that are unfunded.\n  So in summary, I think we will too narrowly change the culture, \nchange it into a narrow way, and if we let in all the amendments and at \nthe end of it all, we address them. I think the culture has to be \nchanged such that amendments are subjected to the highest scrutiny in \nterms of the mandate. Essentially, that is the difference between the \ntwo. Yes, there is a little more difficulty and it could be a little \nmore cumbersome. But do we really want to make amendments heavily \nscrutinized and subject to a point of order then and there, or do we \nwant to do less and let them get through because under this amendment \nthere would be no point of order?\n  You could have a report saying it is a $300 billion mandate on an \namendment, and under this you wait until the end when everything is \nthere and then take it up. I think it ought to be done in a very \npowerful, direct attack on the kind of willy-nilly way that we have \nassigned these mandates to our cities, States and counties.\n  Therefore, I hope the Senate will leave the bill intact. I commend my \nfriend from Ohio for his thoughtfulness on this bill. I just believe \nthat we have a basic disagreement. The Senator from New Mexico has a \nbasic disagreement on this. I hope the Senate agrees with the Senator \nfrom New Mexico.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio has 15 minutes 11 \nseconds.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, we disagree, obviously, on this particular \namendment. I want to respond first to the comment of my distinguished \nfriend from New Mexico--and he is distinguished and he is head of the \nBudget Committee. He is very learned in that area and I appreciate \nthat. He commented in the Republican caucus yesterday that one of their \npersons said, ``If it takes this long for the Democrats to get \nsomething through that they want, what does that spell out for the rest \nof the year,'' or words to that effect.\n  I want to set the record straight on that, because I think there has \nbeen a great deal of gobbledygook about, and misrepresentation of, the \nDemocrats on this side with regard to what we have done on legislation \nthis year--deliberate misrepresentation, as the Congressional Record \nwill show. Last year, we passed S. 993. I was part of that, along with \nSenator Kempthorne. The mayors and Governors said: Do not amend it, do \nnot do anything, put it through. Senator Levin brought that up a little \nwhile ago. I read that into the Record. It was looked upon as very good \nlegislation. Why did we not get it through last fall? We had it out of \ncommittee in August, and the Republicans that now accuse us of all \nkinds of delay had a 3-month scorched-earth, do-not-let-anything-\nthrough policy that prevented consideration of unfunded mandates or the \nCongressional Coverage Act last year.\n  We finally got down to trying to get a unanimous consent requirement \nto let those two bills get through last year and could not do it. That \nis the reason we did not have unfunded mandates and congressional \ncoverage passed last fall, because there was a policy on the Republican \nside, apparently, to not let anything get through. One day, after one \nof the votes on an amendment, I followed one of the more vocal members \nof the Republican Party and happened to walk out by the elevators, and \nhe was saying, ``We beat another one.'' The press people out there \nsaid, ``What was it?'' He said, ``Who cares, we beat it.'' That was the \ngeneral attitude last fall that prevented unfunded mandates, which I \nwas all for. I worked with Senator Kempthorne, who took the lead in \nthis area, and we had that legislation ready and could not get it \nthrough. That was the policy last fall. That is the reason we did not \nget it through. Some of the press look at it this year as just tit-for-\ntat. The shoe is on the other foot, so we are doing the same thing back \nto them. That is not true.\n  When we came in this year, S. 1--which is the successor to S. 993--\nhad been made a priority and was given the prime designation of S. 1. \nIt was designated as the prime bill that we are going to put through \nthis year. I favored that. That designation is great, as far as I am \nconcerned, because I am for unfunded mandates legislation. But the way \nthey wanted to put it through was to ramrod it through with absolutely \nno changes, to show we are in some sort of legislative drag race with \nthe House, apparently, and that we can beat them. So what was the \nprocedure that was set up? It was set up this way: We will introduce \nthe bill one day, have a hearing the next day, a markup the third day, \nand include on that third day sending it back to the Senate. That meant \nwhen we got to committee, there was not time to do anything on it.\n  I go to markup usually considering, OK, let us deliberately look at \nthis and make sure we are doing the right job with this piece of \nlegislation. Yet, when we came to markup, they had the hearing the \nsecond day, went to markup the third day. We came over with some \nperfecting amendments. They were not delaying amendments. They were to \ntake care of some of the real problems with this bill. There were some \nthings that had been omitted. Color and race had been left out of the \ndiscrimination clauses--substantive matters that had to be taken care \nof. \n[[Page S1649]] We were told there would be no amendments. We tried to \nput amendments in. They were voted down on a party-line basis, straight \nacross the board. We were informed that there would no amendments \napproved that day, and we are going to vote this thing back to the \nfloor. They told us that on the floor you can put in all the amendments \nyou want-- we will consider all these things on the floor. That is what \nwe were told over and over again. OK. We could not do anything about \nthat. It was also stated we are not going to have a committee report.\n  Normally around here, for those that are not as familiar with Senate \nprocedure as others may be, a committee report is a very important \ndocument. These bills that are put in are in legalese, they refer to \ndifferent parts of the code, and you have to really decode them to know \nwhat you are doing. And so the committee report is what most people \nrely on to look through and see the provisions that are put in layman's \nlanguage so you can understand it.\n  They would not even put a committee report in. They said we are going \nto bypass that. The minority asked, ``How are you going to take care of \nexplaining this to people?'' They responded, ``Put something in the \nCongressional Record?'' ``How about minority views that are normally \nconsidered important?'' ``If you want to put minority views in, you \nshould put them in the Congressional Record.''\n  I have never seen such cavalier treatment of the minority since I \nhave been in the Senate, and that has been over 20 years now.\n  We object. We had a rollcall vote on the committee report and the \nminority lost. So it was voted out and brought back here to the Senate.\n  To show my commitment to unfunded mandates, I voted even then to send \nit out of committee and back to the floor. I voted with the Republicans \nto get it out of committee and back to the floor, even though I \nobjected strenuously to the whole procedure at that time.\n  Now, what happened when S. 1 came to the floor? This is where they \nsay we have been on the floor now 2 weeks with this thing. Actually, \nwhat happened is Senator Byrd took up the issue of the absence of a \nreport and objected to it, and for the first 2 to 2\\1/2\\ days, we had a \ndebate on the committee report.\n  The majority finally agreed that they would do a committee report. \n``We will have it for you by tomorrow evening.'' Tomorrow evening came \nand went and there was no report, so we had to wait another day to get \nthe committee report.\n  Then it turned out that the Budget Committee had not submitted its \nreport, and there was another day's wait.\n  So all these things on procedure could have been taken care of had we \nbeen able to consider this legislation in committee, as we should have \nbeen able to do. This representation that we have somehow delayed this \nlegislation is beginning to wear a little thin with me. That is how we \nlost the first week.\n  Then they wanted us to consider immediately taking up the bill \nbecause the report was filed. Well, people had not even had a chance to \nsee what was in the report. So it was finally agreed to put it off over \nthe weekend.\n  So the first whole week of consideration, all last week, was because \nof the way we were cavalierly treated in committee and because Senator \nByrd insisted on those reports being available so all Members would \nhave a chance to know what was in this landmark, historic legislation. \nAnd I view this bill as being that kind of legislation.\n  Now, once we got into the bill on the Senate floor and got past the \ncommittee report problem, then what happened? Then the majority said, \n``Let's limit amendments.'' Limit amendments.\n  We had been told repeatedly in committee that we would be able, on \nthe Senate floor, to go through the regular amending process. What \nhappened? Now they want us not to put in amendments. Now they want to \nmove the bill real quick, in a drag race with the House. And we \nobjected to that.\n  In spite of being told that we would be able to bring up anything we \nwanted on the floor, cloture was filed when we tried to bring things \nup.\n  Well, cloture then flushes out amendments all over the place. Because \nif cloture is invoked, you cannot put amendments in after that. So \neverybody had a pet amendment. And in the Senate, not having \ngermaneness rules, you can put in anything you want. We wound up with \n117 amendments, which was unnecessary. We could have taken care of the \nimportant ones in committee had we been permitted to do that, instead \nof having this legislative process where we were rolled on the minority \nside.\n  Then, meanwhile, negotiations were on as to what amendments were \nreally important. And so we finally wound up with the list being culled \ndown earlier this week, and the ones that are important, we will \nconsider those.\n  That is an abridgement of how we got to where we are right now.\n  So I tell you, I am wearing very thin on this thing. I have been \naccused back home by one of our major Ohio papers of being one who \nfavored this legislation last year but, for political reasons, opposes \nit this year. That just is flat not true. It just shows that they were \nnot paying attention to what was going on up here on the Hill during \nthe committee process, what we tried to do, my commitment to this \nlegislation, and working it out.\n  Finally, this week, we were able to work it out. Last night, working \nuntil after midnight, we finally got a time agreement on the final \namendments that are important. These are substantive amendments.\n  The Senator from Michigan, who has brought these issues up, is a pit \nbull on this. He goes into these discussions in committee on how the \nwording is going to affect the council back in Detroit, where he used \nto be on the council, and the States, Michigan and every other State \nacross this country.\n  These are substantive matters that are being proposed here. These are \nnot delay tactics.\n  If there were any delay tactics, it was because we were trying to get \na committee report out that could explain this legislation to every \nSenator, including the 11 new Senators on the Republican side that have \nnot been familiar with this process at all. There was objection during \nthat first week and that is how we lost the whole first week.\n  And so, when these little barbs keep flying across the aisle about \nhow we are delaying things, I will tell you, we are not being anti \nanything. I will tell you what the Democrats are being on this bill. We \nare being constructive, trying to put legislation through that has the \nfine points worked out in it so it is operable, so we can make these \nestimates, so we can make sure that States and local governments are \ntaken care of properly. That is the purpose of this legislation.\n  The delay that we have had for the first week was all because of the \nprocedures that were used in trying to ram this thing through. We were \nresponding by saying, ``OK, we want to have the normal procedures here \nso that every Senator will be informed.''\n  That is sort of how we got to where we are now.\n  To say that somehow the Democrats are at fault on this is incorrect. \nI will tell you what the Democrats are doing. They are trying to \nprotect Senate procedure that protects Republicans as well as \nDemocrats.\n  I am just as committed to getting this unfunded mandate legislation \nthrough as I was last year. I think we worked it out. The amendment \nthat Senator Byrd proposed took care of a lot of the problems, and I \nthink makes this legislation a better bill.\n  Was that substantive? Are we delaying because of the Byrd amendment \nthat was put through yesterday? No, that was excellent legislating of a \nvery important nature on a bill that is landmark legislation. The \nmajority said it was a delay mechanism when we changed the process of \nhow things operate when bills go over to an agency, and what they can \ndo, we would have given up our legislative authority to those agencies. \nIt was agreed on the other side that this was something that we should \ncorrect, and we corrected it. Was that substantive? You bet it was \nsubstantive; very important for this legislation.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator has 3 minutes and 17 \nseconds.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n   [[Page S1650]] Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, we have had these discussions from \ntime to time as to what side of the aisle brought up objections, what \nside of the aisle delayed progress, and what have you.\n  I refuse to engage in that, Mr. President, because we have in S. 1 an \neffort to stop unfunded Federal mandates. And, on behalf of the mayors, \nGovernors, county commissioners, school board administrators, and \nbusiness men and women of the country, I am not going to engage in what \nhas happened in the past on the fingerpointing.\n  It is time for us to use that finger and to draw a line in the sand \nand say, ``From this time forward, let us look to the future in what we \ncan do together.''\n  This is a bipartisan bill. The prime partner on this bill that I have \nhad has been the Senator from Ohio. I am a Republican; he is a \nDemocrat. This is a bipartisan bill.\n  It is about time that we quit just saying ``bipartisan'' if we do not \nmean it, but instead demonstrate to the American people that we can \nwork together, because that is what they told us they wanted us to do \non November 8: Stop the fingerpointing at one another and start looking \nto the future on behalf of the American public that sent us here to do \na job for them, instead of being on each other.\n  I could bring up that last year, when we tried to get S. 993 through, \nit was the Republicans that cleared the deck. They agreed, even though \nI had some that wanted desperately to offer amendments, they would \nwithhold all amendments. But we could not clear the deck on the \nDemocratic side, but it does not matter now.\n That is past. Maybe in different social settings we could go over \nthose war stories. I do not think the public wants the war stories \nright now. They want the Senate to enact this legislation.\n\n  So, Mr. President, with regard to the specifics of the amendment \nbefore the Senate, I have to defer to what the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee stated. He has pointed out why he feels this is an objection. \nI know the Senator from Ohio is sincere in thinking that this may pose \nanother filibuster tool. But in the 2 years I have been here, if there \nis one thing I have learned, it is that there are ample tools for \nfilibuster, if that is what a Senator wants to do. I do not think this \nwill be used as a new ploy in order to enact a filibuster because there \nare a variety of other opportunities to do that.\n  Mr. President, again, I would ask everyone, just as Senate bill 1 is \nprospective and not retroactive, let the Senate continue, in the \ndebate, to be prospective and not retroactive and show the American \npeople that we can take something that is bipartisan. Let Members pass \nit in this body today, send it to the House of Representatives, get \nbipartisan support there, send it to the President, and have him enact \nthis. Then the mayors and Governors and the American taxpayers will \nsay, ``Thank you, folks, you did what we asked you to do, and now why \nnot do it again on something else.''\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may require.\n  I could not agree more with the distinguished Senator from Idaho. He \nhas been an absolute delight to work with all through the last 2 years \non this legislation. We were very cooperative. We have not tried to \nbackstab each other. We have been upfront on every place we have had \ndifferences. In some areas we do have differences.\n  We have a little difference of opinion on this particular item. My \nproposal, I think, would improve the legislation. The other side does \nnot think that is quite the case, so we have a little difference of \nopinion. But the basic bill itself will go through.\n  All through the first part of this debate, through the first week of \nthis debate on the Senate floor, I outlined the procedure that was used \nto get this legislation through committee, which we objected to. But \nall through that first week on the Senate floor, I refrained from \ngetting into some of these partisan barbs back and forth and so did the \nSenator from Idaho. He did not take part in those remarks. All the \nthings that were coming up about the political nature of what the \nDemocrats are trying to do, as though this is a political hotfoot we \nare using to reply to last year's scorch policy of 3 months in the \nfall, I stayed out of that. There were many of those remarks back and \nforth.\n  I finally got involved with it because I thought it was so unfair. Lo \nand behold all that drumbeat, drumbeat, drumbeat of how bad the \nDemocrats were and how we were trying to stall this thing, drumbeat, \ndrumbeat, over and over, apparently had some effect, as one of our \nmajor papers back in Ohio made scathing remarks about me, sort of \nimplying that I have sold out. The paper implied that the only reason I \nam participating in the debate in this manner is because of some kind \nof party retaliation. That is not like me. Well, I would say to the \npapers, in reference to the little special they had on their editorial \npage, no, it is not like me, and that has not been me. If they had been \npaying attention to what was going on here, they would know that is not \nwhat was going on.\n  So when I hear my friend from New Mexico get up this morning and once \nagain make a crack about the Democrats being at fault, and will this be \nthe pattern all through the legislative session, that someone remarked \nto him about yesterday, obviously my skin is beginning to get a little \nthin on some of these things--blaming this particular delay just on the \nDemocrats, when I enunciated a little while ago the processes that were \nused in committee--high handed, cavalier. I cannot put any other words \nto it than that. I have never seen any minority treated like that in my \n20-some plus years here in the Senate.\n  So that is the reason that I wanted to use some of my time on this \namendment. My remarks did not apply directly to this amendment.\n  Let me say to my friend from Idaho, I think his remarks are exactly \non, and I hope he takes the opportunities in the conference to get some \nof the other people to stop making these zingers across the aisle that \nare so unwarranted because we know what happened in committee and we \nknow what happened last year.\n  He and I worked together to try to get this together. He said we \ncould not get it through on the Democratic side, we finally were \ndelayed, could not get it through the floor for regular debate as would \nnormally be the case. We were only able to get it on a unanimous \nconsent. And one Senator objected to unanimous consent at that time and \nthat prevented us from getting it through last year without amendments.\n  Mr. President, if this bill is enacted as currently written, with \npoints of order applied to amendments, it will be almost impossible to \nescape a point of order on an amendment whose cost estimate--assuming \nyou can get it--exceeds the threshold.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record what every amendment \nwill have to contain, according to section c(1)B of the bill, if it \ncontains a mandate of at least $50 million.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       ``(B) any bill, joint resolution, amendment, motion, or \n     conference report that would increase the direct costs of \n     Federal intergovernmental mandates by an amount that causes \n     the thresholds specified in subsection (b)(1)(A) to be \n     exceeded, unless--\n       ``(i) the bill, joint resolution, amendment, motion, or \n     conference report provides direct spending authority for each \n     fiscal year for the Federal intergovernmental mandates \n     included in the bill, joint resolution, amendment, motion, or \n     conference report in an amount that is equal to the direct \n     costs of such mandate;\n       ``(ii) the bill, joint resolution, amendment, motion, or \n     conference report provides an increase in receipts and an \n     increase in direct spending authority for each fiscal year \n     for the Federal intergovernmental mandates included in the \n     bill, joint resolution, amendment, motion, or conference \n     report in an amount equal to the direct costs of such \n     mandate; or\n       ``(iii) the bill, joint resolution, amendment, motion, or \n     conference report includes an authorization for \n     appropriations in an amount equal to the direct costs of such \n     mandate, and--\n       ``(I) identifies a specific dollar amount of the direct \n     costs of the mandate for each year or other period during \n     which the mandate shall be in effect under the bill, joint \n     resolution, amendment, motion or conference report, and such \n     estimate is consistent with \n     [[Page S1651]] the estimate determined under paragraph (5) \n     for each fiscal year;\n       ``(II) identifies any appropriation bill that is expected \n     to provide for Federal funding of the direct cost referred to \n     under subclause (III);\n       ``(III)(aa) provides that if for any fiscal year the \n     responsible Federal agency determines that there are \n     insufficient appropriations to provide for the estimated \n     direct costs of the mandate, the Federal agency shall (not \n     later than 30 days after the beginning of the fiscal year) \n     notify the appropriate authorizing committees of Congress of \n     the determination and submit either--\n       ``(1) a statement that the agency has determined, based on \n     a re-estimate of the direct costs of a mandate, after \n     consultation with State, local, and tribal governments, that \n     the amount appropriated is sufficient to pay for the direct \n     costs of the mandate; or\n       ``(2) legislative recommendations for either implementing a \n     less costly mandate or making the mandate ineffective for the \n     fiscal year;\n       ``(bb) provides expedited procedures for the consideration \n     of the statement or legislative recommendations referred to \n     in item (aa) by Congress not later than 30 days after the \n     statement or recommendations are submitted to Congress; and\n       ``(cc) provides that the mandate shall--\n       ``(1) in the case of a statement referred to in item \n     (aa)(1), cease to be effective 60 days after the statement is \n     submitted unless Congress has approved the agency's \n     determination by joint resolution during the 60 day period;\n       ``(2) cease to be effective 60 days after the date the \n     legislative recommendations of the responsible Federal agency \n     are submitted to Congress under item (aa)(2) unless Congress \n     provides otherwise by law; or\n       ``(3) in the case of a mandate that has not yet taken \n     effect, continue not to be effective unless Congress provides \n     otherwise by law.\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Could we have unanimous consent to have Senator Lieberman \nhave 1 minute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, and my colleagues, I just want to add a \nword to say, as this debate has gone on, the Senator from Ohio, as is \nnot just his habit but is at the very core of his nature, has conducted \nhimself in a most thoughtful and serious way. In the 6 years I have \nbeen privileged to be a Member of the U.S. Senate, I do not think I \nhave known a less partisan Member than John Glenn of Ohio.\n  This complicated bill, with ramifications on just about every section \nof the United States Code annotated, I think we made a better bill as \nthis process has gone on. A good part of the responsibility for making \nit better goes to the former chairman of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, on which I am privileged to serve, and now the ranking \nDemocrat, the Senator from Ohio. Whatever is being said in Ohio by any \nnewspaper, I do not know, but if they are critical of Senator Glenn in \nhis conduct on this bill, in my respectful opinion, they are wrong.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I yield back the remaining time. I \nmove to table the amendment and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 174\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question recurs \non amendment No. 174, offered by the Senator from Michigan. Debate will \nbe limited to 30 minutes equally divided and controlled by the Senator \nfrom Idaho and the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, acknowledging that we have a \nunanimous-consent agreement, I believe that votes would begin to occur \nat 11:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, could I make an inquiry on that. Do I \nunderstand that the vote on the first amendment whose debate has been \ncompleted pursuant to the unanimous-consent would begin at 11:30?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We have two votes beginning at 11:30.\n  Mr. LEVIN. But if debate is not completed with the time allotted by \nthe unanimous consent, the vote would occur on that amendment at a \nlater point, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In the opinion of the Chair, the Senator is \ncorrect.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, what I am suggesting is to offer \nanother unanimous-consent agreement that we would move the votes that \nhave been ordered, so that they would not occur at 11:30, but they \nwould move to a time after we have completed the debate on this next \namendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nprevious vote time, which was to occur at 11:30, be moved so that the \nfirst vote will occur after all time has been consumed in debate on the \nremaining two amendments.\n  Mr. GLENN. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, is \nthere any idea of how much that would move the vote forward?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It will be approximately 30 minutes before the \nnext vote.\n  Mr. GLENN. I will not object.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. It is my understanding it will be no later than 12 \no'clock noon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to ask a few questions of the \nmanager relative to the way in which amendments would be dealt with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises Senators time has been \ndeducted equally. There was not the suggestion of the absence of a \nquorum.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair. How many minutes do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two and a half minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, two questions I would like to ask my friend \nfrom Idaho about how the amendment process would work. It really goes \nback to the Glenn amendment. First, the bill says that the requirement \nthat there be an estimate apply to bills and resolutions. Is it the \nintent of the manager, the sponsor, that amendments offered on the \nfloor are not subject to a point of order because they fail, when they \nare offered, to have a cost estimate?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, that is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It is correct then that they would not be subject to a \npoint of order?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, not based strictly because they do not \nhave a cost estimate.\n  Mr. LEVIN. No, but a point of order would not lie for the failure of \nan amendment, as it is offered, to have a cost estimate in it, is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, that is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. However, a point of order might lie if an argument is made \nthat that amendment exceeds the threshold of $50 million, is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, that is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And if the Budget Committee is unable to make that \ndetermination and so informs the Chair, would a point of order lie? As \na general matter, would it lie?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, again, in looking to the Budget Act \nand what may be some precedent that we could point to, if in fact CBO \nwere to determine and so state that regardless of how much time they \nhad they simply could not come up with an estimate, the \nParliamentarian, as I understand it, may use that as a basis to \nrecommend that no point of order would lie because there would not be \nbasis.\n  However, it is not to suggest that that would exclude other elements \nthat the Parliamentarian might consider in still coming to the \nconclusion that a point of order could still lie.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is it fair to say that it is the understanding of the \nmanager that generally, if there is no basis upon which to rule that \nthe threshold is exceeded, if there is no basis to rule, that generally \na point of order would not lie? However, it is not your intention to \npreclude the Chair from ruling that a point of order would lie if the \nChair has information from other sources \n[[Page S1652]] than the Congressional Budget Office and the CBO that \nthe threshold is exceeded?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I would suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will restate my question.\n  I understood the Senator from Idaho to say that the Chair would not \nbe precluded basically from upholding a point of order, or ruling that \nthe threshold has been exceeded even if there is a statement from the \nCongressional Budget Office and the Budget Committee that it is unable \nto state that the threshold is exceeded. The Chair would not be \nprecluded, from what the Senator said.\n  However, my question is, is it his intention that it would generally \nbe the case that if the Chair has no basis to rule that a point of \norder would lie for the threshold being exceeded, that it would \ntherefore not rule that a point of order lies?\n  It is my intent to ask the chairman of the Budget Committee, by the \nway, these questions as well when he is able to return to the floor. \nBut I think it is important we get the intent of the manager on this \nquestion. It is a very important question as to whether this process \ncan function.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, in response, it is our intention that \nit would be the prerogative of the Parliamentarian to make that \ndetermination. We would not then establish here the parameters by which \nthe Parliamentarian would make his recommendation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I understand.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator has 5 additional minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am wondering if I could ask the Senator from Idaho on \nhis time since----\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I will yield 2 minutes, depending upon \nthe questions, to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair and my friend from Idaho.\n  Now, this is the situation I wish to give to the Senator. CBO and the \nBudget Committee say there is no basis that they have to make an \nestimate that the threshold is exceeded. They have no basis, and they \nso inform the Chair. This is relative to an amendment.\n  If there is a statement from the CBO and the Budget Committee that \nthere is no basis for them to state that the threshold is exceeded, \nthen what other sources would the Chair go to to have a basis to uphold \nthe point of order?\n  I ask this because the bill itself states on page 25, line 20, that \n``for purposes of this subsection, the levels of Federal mandates for a \nfiscal year shall be determined based on the estimates made by the \nCommittee on the Budget.'' That is what it says in the bill.\n  Now, if there is some other basis besides the Budget Committee or the \nCBO upon which a Chair could rule that a threshold is exceeded, I think \nthen we ought to have it in the bill. Does the Chair read newspapers or \ndoes the Chair--what are the other sources that the Chair would rule on \nif the Budget Committee and the CBO has told the Chair that there is no \nbasis upon which it can say that the threshold is exceeded?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, we have been instructed by the \nParliamentarian that two other elements that could be considered will \nbe the actual legislation from the committee itself, and it could be \nprecedent that has been established.\n  Mr. LEVIN. But the legislation would be available to the CBO and to \nthe Budget Committee, would it not? And precedent would be available to \nthe CBO and the Budget Committee, would it not?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I am sure that it would. I do not know it necessarily \nthen would be the only tool that CBO and the Budget Committee would use \nin determining the estimate, but again I would not preclude the \nParliamentarian from examining the legislation or precedents in their \npurview as to whether or not the point of order will lie.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, as I understand it we have 2 minutes \nremaining on the amendment that is pending before us?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I ask my friend from the State of Michigan if he \nwould like to use additional time remaining?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend. I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \nuse 3 minutes from my next amendment so I do not take up additional \ntime of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no further request for time, the Senator intends to use \nit now, 3 minutes to be extracted from then?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is correct.\n  I thank my friend for his offer, but I do not want to delay the \nSenate so I have pulled forward 3 minutes from my next amendment.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, just a parliamentary inquiry, it will \nbe my intention to move to table the amendment. But would I do that \nfollowing the expiration of the Senator's 3 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am just going to use a couple of minutes \nbecause I want my friend from Connecticut to at least have a minute. We \ncan pull forward more time from my next amendment. This amendment is \nintended to address the situation where there is a significant negative \ncompetitive impact on the private sector when you have a situation \nwhere there is competition, be it with a hospital, be it with a waste \ndisposal, be it with an incinerator--whatever it is.\n  The amendment I have offered says if the committee certifies that \nthere is a significant negative competitive impact on the private \nsector that then this special point of order would not lie. They would \nhave to make that certification that there is added protection in that \npoint of order, which takes us a step beyond last year's bill.\n  Where the committee itself certifies that there be a significant \ncompetitive disadvantage to the private sector if the public sector \nwere paid to do it, or if the mandate were waived as to the public \nsector, then this additional step should not be taken.\n  I have sought to modify my amendment to make it a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution. I have not been allowed to modify it. That is the rules of \nthe game. So we will be voting on my original amendment.\n  If I have run out of time--I ask the Chair if I have any time left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has about a minute and 15 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield that time to my friend from Connecticut, and if \nthe Senator from Connecticut needs additional time I then ask unanimous \nconsent to pull forward some additional time from my next amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nMichigan. I am glad to rise in support of the amendment that is \ncurrently being discussed, offered by the Senator from Michigan.\n  Last week I discussed at some length concerns that I have about the \ncompetitive disadvantage that will result to the private sector from \nthis legislation. In particular, I discussed my concerns with the \nprovision that creates a presumption that the Federal Government will \npay 100 percent of the costs of the mandates, even where those mandates \napply in the same manner to \n[[Page S1653]] the public and private sector. Even the opponents of the \namendment I introduced last week, which was defeated, acknowledge that \nthere were in fact many areas covered by the provisions of this bill, \nS. 1, where the public and private sectors do compete.\n  The sponsors of the legislation have stated in response to inquiries \nfrom colleagues they have sought to address that concern about the \ndisadvantage to the private sector by requiring that the authorizing \ncommittee state in its report the degree to which Federal payment of \npublic sector costs or the termination of the mandate would affect the \ncompetitive balance between State or local governments and the private \nsector, and any steps that the committee has taken.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 2 minutes to \ncomplete my statement pursuant to the generous offer of the Senator \nfrom Michigan, that coming from the time which he has been allocated on \nthe next amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, as I set forth during the discussion of \nmy amendment last Thursday, I do not believe it is appropriate to \ncreate a presumption of 100-percent Federal payment in any case where a \nlaw applies in the same manner to both the public and private sector. \nBut certainly where we have a committee finding that such a \ndisadvantage to the private sector will be created, the presumption of \n100-percent funding is totally inappropriate. Otherwise, what is the \npoint of the committee stating whether or not there will be a \ncompetitive disadvantage created? The Levin amendment would make \ncertain that the presumption does not apply in those circumstances.\n  Mr. President, I strongly support the Levin amendment, but I want to \nemphasize that it does not go far enough. As Senator Roth indicated in \nthe debate relating to my amendment: we know right now that the public \nand private sector compete in many areas covered by S.1.\n  Let me take a few minutes to read from two letters I received on \nthese issues after the debate on my amendment concluded. The first \nletter is from the International Association of Environmental Testing \nLaboratories dated Jan. 19, 1995, in support of the amendment I offered \nlast Thursday. It states:\n\n       S. 1 as currently written threatens public health and the \n     environment and disadvantages commercial environmental \n     testing laboratories that provide the same services as \n     government laboratories. * * * (B)y exempting government \n     laboratories from costs associated with important quality \n     standards compliance, this legislation disadvantages \n     commercial testing laboratories that provide the same \n     services as government laboratories. Such a double standard \n     not only hurts private sector laboratories, it also reduces \n     tax revenues resulting from commercial laboratory operations:\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this letter be included \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. The second letter is from the American Legislative \nExchange Council to Speaker Gingrich dated Jan. 12, 1995. This group \ndescribes itself in the first paragraph of the letter as the ``nation's \nlargest bipartisan individual membership organization of state \nlegislators dedicated to the principles of free enterprise and \nindividual liberty''. The letter states:\n\n       We are concerned that efforts underway to address mandates \n     on state and local governments will unfairly impede the \n     balance of competition, regulating private industry to meet \n     standards not required by the public sector. Everyday private \n     industry competes against the public sector to provide \n     Americans with goods and services in areas such as \n     transportation, the environment and many others. One example \n     of this is waste water treatment facilities. Under the \n     current mandate reform scenario, regulations on state and \n     local governments would be lifted on many services. \n     Unfortunately, private industry would not be exempted from \n     these same regulations. Instead, they would continue to be \n     forced to pass the costs of these regulations on to the \n     consumer. This problem would obviously create an unfair \n     advantage in favor of publicly operated services.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this letter be included \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2).\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, the Levin amendment would take an \nimportant step forward in eliminating unfair advantages to the private \nsector that may result from this legislation. I urge adoption of the \namendment.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                      International Association of\n\n\n                           Environmental Testing Laboratories,\n\n                                  Alexandia, VA, January 19, 1995.\n     Hon. Joseph I. Lieberman,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lieberman: The International Association of \n     Environmental Testing Laboratories (IAETL) is writing to \n     support the Kerry, Levin, Lieberman proposed amendment to \n     Senate Hill No. 1 concerning unfunded mandates. As a trade \n     association representing two-thirds of the environmental \n     testing industry, IAETL supports your proposed amendment \n     concerning the even-handed application of environmental laws \n     to apply to both the public and private sectors. S. 1 as \n     currently written threatens public health and the environment \n     and disadvantages commercial environmental testing \n     laboratories that provides the same services as government \n     laboratories.\n       Environmental laboratories provide critical analysis of \n     soil, air, and water for toxic contaminants. Such analysis is \n     the basis for important public health and environmental \n     decisions. IAETL believes that public health and the \n     environment are threatened by exempting government \n     laboratories from standards designed to ensure the quality \n     and reliability of laboratory data.\n       In addition, by exempting government laboratories from \n     costs associated with important quality standards compliance, \n     this legislation disadvantages commercial testing \n     laboratories that provide the same services as government \n     laboratories. Such a double standard not only hurts private \n     sector laboratories, it also reduces tax revenues resulting \n     from commercial laboratory operations.\n       Accordingly, IAETL supports your proposed amendment to S. 1 \n     and suggests that you add the following bullet to your ``Dear \n     Colleague'' letter concerning this issue:\n       Public laboratories, which provide analysis of soil, air, \n     and water to protect public health and the environment from \n     toxic contaminants, would be exempt from quality standards \n     that apply to commercial laboratories performing the same \n     critical services.\n       IAETL looks forward to working with you on the issue of \n     unfair competition between the public and private sector. \n     Please feel free to contact me should you have any questions \n     concerning this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Linda E. Christenson,\n     Executive Director and General Counsel.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                                              American Legislative\n\n\n                                              Exchange Council\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 12, 1995.\n     Hon. Newt Gingrich,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Gingrich: The American Legislative Exchange \n     Council (ALEC), the nation's largest bipartisan individual \n     membership organization of state legislators dedicated to the \n     principles of free enterprise and individual liberty, wishes \n     to express concern with the issue of federal mandates as it \n     relates to services provided by both the public and the \n     private sectors.\n       We are concerned that efforts underway to address mandates \n     on state and local governments will unfairly impede the \n     balance of competition, regulating private industry to meet \n     standards not required by the public sector. Everyday private \n     industry competes against the public sector to provide \n     Americans with goods and services in areas such as \n     transportation, the environment and many others. One example \n     of this is waste water treatment facilities.\n       Under the current mandate reform scenario, regulations on \n     state and local government would be lifted on many services. \n     Unfortunately, private industry would not be exempted from \n     these same regulations. Instead, they would continue to be \n     forced to pass the cost of these regulations on to the \n     consumer. This problem would obviously create an unfair \n     advantage in favor of publicly operated services.\n       As we have see in the early days of the 104th Congress, \n     just as laws are applicable to its citizens, they should also \n     apply to Members of Congress. The same premise holds true in \n     this case. Private industry should not be made to comply with \n     regulations that exempt public sector providers. The rules \n     must be consistent.\n       Thank you for your time. We appreciate your attention in \n     this matter.\n           Respectfully,\n     Senator Ray Powers (CO),\n                                                National Chairman.\n     Samuel A. Brunelli,\n                                               Executive Director.\n                           Amendment No. 174\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on amendment No. 174.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I yield back my time and move to \ntable.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n   [[Page S1654]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. This vote will occur after the previous two \nalready ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 219\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question occurs \non amendment No. 219 offered by the Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin]. \nDebate on the amendment is limited to 10 minutes equally divided.\n  The Senator from Michigan has already utilized his time and so the \nremaining time is under the control of the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and \nask unanimous consent it be charged to my time.\n   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nMichigan so that he can explain his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I have expressed the concern that there is \na feature in this bill that would require estimates for the life of a \nmandate which could go 20, 30, 40 years. It could be unlimited, and \nthat becomes an impossible task. We are kidding ourselves if we think \nwe can get anything reasonable beyond the first 5 years, frankly, or 10 \nyears, surely.\n  So this amendment puts a cap on the estimate requirement and says \nthat in no event shall the estimate have to be for any year beyond 10 \nyears. We have already acknowledged that the CBO has the right to tell \nus that they cannot estimate these costs, and that holds through for \nany number of years. The CBO usually estimates direct costs for 5 \nyears, and that is it.\n  So this says for a maximum of 10 years, and, if the CBO can only do \n5, obviously it will do 5. But this finally will set a cap on what \notherwise would be an impossible task.\n  I understand that the managers of the bill will accept this \namendment. I will be happy to have a voice vote on it. I do not need a \nrollcall if they accept the amendment.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I appreciate the efforts of the \nSenator from Michigan. I am prepared to accept this amendment.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I accept it on our side, also.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I yield back our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Michigan.\n  The amendment (No. 219) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 175\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to the motion to lay on the table amendment numbered 175 \noffered by the Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin]. On this question, the \nyeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, last year we had a bill which came out of \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee, S. 993. It was a good bill, a bill \nthat I believe had something like 60 cosponsors or more, 67 cosponsors, \nincluding the Senator from Ohio, the Senator from Idaho, and many \nothers. It was a bipartisan bill with strong bipartisan support.\n  The bill not only had the support of about two-thirds of the Senate \nas cosponsors, but S. 993, which came out of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee last year, had the strong support of the Governors, the \nmayors, local elected officials, the State legislators, the counties, \nthe cities.\n  We got letters about S. 993 last year, strongly urging the support of \nS. 993, going so far as to say that the Governors and the State \nlegislators and the counties and the cities' mayors would oppose any \namendments to S. 993. That is this document, October 6:\n\n       The nation's State and local elected officials strongly \n     urge the U.S. Senate to pass the state-local mandate relief \n     bill, S. 993, before adjournment.\n\n  Later on in the letter:\n\n       We view all amendments as an attempt to defeat our \n     legislation.\n\n  The Conference of Mayors, in a letter to Senator Kempthorne last year \nsaid:\n\n       On behalf of the United States Conference of Mayors, I am \n     writing to express my strong support for the Kempthorne-Glenn \n     bill, S. 993, and to urge immediate passage of the \n     legislation by the U.S. Senate.\n\n  They concluded by saying:\n\n       It is our belief that the bipartisan consensus we have \n     built on this critical legislation will carry S. 993 to \n     enactment and we pledge to oppose any and all amendments \n     which would weaken the consensus bill.\n\n  They say, ``any and all amendments.''\n  Then the President of the Conference of Mayors said:\n\n       I would also like to echo a statement that you [addressed \n     to Senator Kempthorne] often make when talking about unfunded \n     Federal mandates. The enactment of the Kempthorne-Glenn bill \n     will not be the end in our mutual battle against unfunded \n     Federal mandates, but the true beginning. S. 993 will provide \n     us with a powerful weapon against new individual mandates \n     bills, but it will remain our responsibility to carry on the \n     battle with all the strength we can muster.\n\n  If not a consensus, we had a near consensus of local officials for S. \n993.\n  S. 993 achieved a major goal. When you read the purposes of the bill \nin front of us, S. 1, S. 993 had the same purposes. If not verbatim it \nis pretty close to precisely the same purposes. Now I am reading from \nS. 1, but stating that S. 993 had the same purposes as S. 1, same \nstated purposes as S. 1:\n\n       To end the imposition, in the absence of full consideration \n     by Congress, of Federal mandates on State, local, and tribal \n     governments without adequate Federal funding, in a manner \n     that may displace other essential [State, local and tribal] \n     governmental priorities.\n\n  That was also a purpose of S. 993; to assure full consideration by \nCongress of Federal mandates.\n  Next:\n\n       To assist Congress in its consideration of proposed \n     legislation, establish and revise Federal programs containing \n     Federal mandates affecting States, local governments, tribal \n     governments and the private sector, by providing for \n     development of information, establishing a mechanism to bring \n     such information to the attention of the Senate and the \n     House, to promote, inform and deliberate decisions on the \n     appropriateness of Federal mandates in any particular \n     instance.\n\n  These are important purposes. They are also the purposes of S. 993. \nS. 993 accomplishes what S. 1 does in all but a few ways. And it is \nthose few ways I will get to in a moment.\n  S. 993 requires a CBO estimate for both the private and the sector \npublic costs. S. 993 contains a point of order if there is no cost \nestimate when a bill comes from a committee to the floor. S. 993 \ncontains a point of order if the committee fails to authorize \nappropriations to the level of the cost estimate. But that is where S. \n993 stops. It does not go further and create this Rube Goldberg \nmechanism which is in S. 1, which has become more and more complicated \nin some ways on the floor, and, happily, improved in some ways on the \nfloor.\n  But the mechanism, that Rube Goldberg mechanism that S. 1 has for \nthat additional point of order, remains and will bedevil this body to \nthe benefit of nobody, including local officials. Because the more we \ntry to tie ourselves up in a knot to protect the substantive \n[[Page S1656]] issue, the greater is the instinct to circumvent it with \nboilerplate, with loopholes, and there are many.\n  So if we do not come up with a mechanism which is workable, if we \nreally think we are going to create here, by a mechanism which is going \nto so tie this place up that we are going to reduce mandates purely \nfrom the weight of the process, what we are underestimating is the \ncapability of Members of Congress to write boilerplate into \nauthorization bills which avoids the cumbersome mechanism. So we are \nnot doing the State and local officials any good by adding this new \npoint of order with its cumbersome mechanisms.\n  I believe the Senator from California wanted me to yield at this \ntime, as she has done some wonderful work on a chart which actually \nfits in perfectly at this time. Ordinarily I would ask unanimous \nconsent I be allowed to yield to another Senator without it showing as \nan interruption in the Record, but in this case I think, with the chart \nbehind her, it is going to fit in very nicely with where I am in my \nremarks.\n  So I yield to the Senator from California 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Michigan, I \nthank him on behalf of many Senators for the role he has played in this \ndebate. Along with both managers, I think he has brought these issues \nto the fore, and he has been persistent. Some of them have not been \nglamorous, but he has tried to protect the rights of Senators to offer \namendments, he has tried to make everyone understand what this \nlegislation really does.\n  For many days I have had this chart on the floor. I am not much of a \nchart person, but I guess I am turning into one because I think a \npicture is worth many words and we have had many words to describe this \nbill.\n  S. 993, which Senator Levin has offered to us as a substitute bill, \nis, in my view, a far superior bill to the bill that is before us, S. \n1. It is intelligent. It reaches to the problem.\n  I come from local government, as does the Senator from Michigan. I \ndid not like the unreasonable mandates when they came, but I want to \nmake sure this U.S. Senate can respond to the people, to the children, \nto the elderly, to our families, to our people if in fact we need to \nmove swiftly. And look what has happened with S. 993.\n  It started off as a very good concept and a very good bill. If you \nlook here at the chart, I say to my friend, S. 993 stopped the process \nright here. All this green did not apply. We had the committee report a \nbill out and get an estimate from the CBO. That estimate of costs came \nhere to the Senate floor, and if it was not done there would be a point \nof order and that was it. We would have to know, if we were doing \nsomething, what it costs. That is smart. That is right. And we would \nhave to take action. Then we got to S. 1, and all this green was added. \nLet me explain to the people what this means.\n  Everything in the green here deals with parliamentary procedure. \nEverything in the green here, and that is half the procedure. So half \nof S. 1 deals with unelected people making decisions for this Senate. \nPeople in the CBO are unelected. They may be wonderful, but they are \nunelected. People in the Parliamentarian's office may be great, \nbrilliant--but they are not elected. They will be making life or death \ndecisions for the American people. Because if they come up with a \nnumber that is over $50 million, we can get caught in a debate over a \npoint of order.\n  I say to my friend, one of the comanagers of the bill, Senator \nGlenn--he tried to improve this bill. He wanted to make sure when a \nSenator had an amendment it did not have to go through this process all \nover again. But the Glenn amendment was defeated. Amendments that would \nhave streamlined this bureaucratic nightmare were systematically \ndefeated by the other side.\n  My own amendments were defeated. Although we did very well, we could \nnot get 51 votes to protect the children.\n  There is an ``exceptions'' section in this bill, S. 1. We wanted to \nsay that any bill that would protect against child pornography, child \nsexual abuse, child labor law violation, or any bill that would protect \nthe health of the frail elderly, pregnant women, or young children \nshould also be added to the list of exceptions.\n  But our Republican colleagues said ``No way.''\n  Why? It is my view that the ultimate goal of this bill is in fact to \ntie our hands, to make it much more difficult for us to act. That is \nnot why I came here. That is not why the people of my State sent me \nhere. They want me to act if we find out new information about what \nlead in the water does to children and pregnant women. They want me to \nact to help protect them.\n This bill will make it very difficult to do so.\n\n  So I say to my friend from Michigan, thank you for offering us this \namendment. I tried to make sure that the issue of illegal immigration \nwould be acted on. That is one of the biggest unfunded mandates for \nCalifornia. All we have in this bill--God bless Senator Graham for \ngetting it through--is an amendment preserving the status quo so that \nwe will not cut the Border Patrol. We have to increase the Border \nPatrol. The Graham amendment does not help us one bit in terms of \nadding more Border Patrol agents. It does protect us from cuts, but \nnothing in this bill will begin payments to my State of California for \neducating, incarcerating, or providing medical services to illegal \nimmigrants.\n  So this bill, S. 1, is a giant disappointment. It sets up a \nbureaucratic nightmare that no local government could really support if \nthey saw what it did. S. 993 is the unfunded mandates bill that I am \nvery proud to support. It would take this chart, take all of this off, \nand make it reasonable.\n  I am very proud to support my friend, Senator Levin, who is a great \nleader on this whole issue.\n  I yield my time to the Senator.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California.\n  One of the problems with S. 1 is that this new point of order that \nwas created originally delegated significant authority to the agency. \nThat language was corrected by the Byrd amendment yesterday. But the \nByrd amendment created in the process another complication, another \nwrinkle; worth doing in order to avoid the delegation for the agencies, \nbut nonetheless, it created another hoop, another hurdle, for this \nlegislation and for any appropriations bill.\n  The Byrd amendment said that we are not going to delegate the cuts to \nthe agencies if the appropriation down the road does not equal the \namount of the estimate. Instead, we will have the agency make a \nrecommendation back to the Appropriations Committee which can then go \nback to Congress which can then adopt it or not adopt it. It is another \nstep after the appropriations process is completed. Another step was \nadded--as far as I am concerned, worthwhile doing again, in order to \navoid the delegation, but it is another complication.\n  There are great and grave uncertainties in this process that we have \ncreated in S. 1. It is really processing wild. You have to leap this \nhurdle, you have to evade this trap, you have to swim this moat, you \nhave to jump this hoop. It goes too far in this additional point of \norder that it adds which was not present last year. It puts tremendous \nnew emphasis on an estimate, emphasis which is excessive. We want the \nestimate. We should insist on the estimate of costs. We should allow a \npoint of order if there is no estimate when a bill comes to the floor. \nBut S. 1 goes beyond that and requires certain additional language be \nadded which would require the reduction of the mandate in outyears if \nin fact appropriation levels do not reach the estimate, which could be \nas much as 10 years earlier, unless the Congress adopts a resolution \nsaying to the contrary.\n  The thing sounds simple to say the CBO or the Budget Committee will \nestimate. When is the mandate first effective? I gave an example the \nother day on the floor to show just how uncertain that issue is. I used \nthe example of a hypothetical Senate bill which says the reduction in \ndangerous levels of mercury from incinerator emissions will be required \nafter October 1, 2005, and that the EPA is designated to determine what \nconstitutes a mercury level dangerous to human health. It is \n[[Page S1657]] a simple process; it sounds simple. It is stated simply. \nBut it is not.\n  The question was asked: ``Well, when is that mandate effective? What \nis the first fiscal year that it is effective?'' Of course, when you \nread the bill, it sounds as if that would be October 1, 2005; that this \nhypothetical bill mandates reductions of these levels of mercury from \nincinerator emissions after October 1, 2005. So the commonsense answer \nis that is the fiscal year which the committee says it is first \neffective. The trouble with that is, if it is first effective in 2005, \nthen it is useless because all the costs are going to be expended \nbefore 2005 in order that the incinerator complied by the October 1 \ndeadline of 2005.\n  Then the statement is made: ``Well, let us take a look at that CBO \nestimate.'' So I came up with the CBO direct cost estimate for 87,000 \njurisdictions. Mind you, every amendment and bill is going to have to \nbe estimated for 87,000 jurisdictions. But this is what the estimate \ncomes back as. This is in this hypothetical. They say in the year 1, $6 \nmillion; year 2, $8 million; year 3, $10 million; year 4, $15 million, \nyear 6, $20 million; year 7, $30 million; year 8, $50 million; year 9, \n$100 million; year 10, the last year before they must be in compliance, \nit comes out at $200 million.\n  What is the first year of the direct costs that are levied or \nrequired by local governments? If we read the answers to the questions \nwhich I submitted to Senator Kempthorne, it comes out one of two ways. \nIt seems to me it is either the first year that the committee says is \nthe effective date--it sounded like 2006, the way I read it--or the \nfirst year that the Budget Committee determines that local governments \nare going to be spending money as a direct result of the mandate. Well, \nthe first year they do that is 1996 under this hypothetical estimate.\n  If you go 5 years from 1996, under the rule of this new process, if \nany of those first 5 years after the mandate is effective, it goes over \n$50 million. If in any of the 5 years you go over the $50 million, then \nyou cross the threshold, and certain very significant things happen if \nyou cross the threshold.\n  The trouble with that is you do not cross the threshold under this \nhypothetical if none of those first 5 years is above $50 million. But \nthen what year do you start? Based on what? The Parliamentarian, the \nChair, the CBO, or the Budget Committee just picking a year out of the \nair? They now have a CBO estimate. Those are the numbers. They have \nlooked. They have consulted with local officials. They have done all \nthe consultations which they should with local officials to estimate \nwhat those 87,000 jurisdictions are going to do with this incinerator \nto comply. That is what they come up with.\n  What it results in is, if you follow the language of the bill or if \nyou ignore the language of the bill, then you are in violation of what \nperiod of time in the bill seems to be required.\n  So a critical issue, when is the first fiscal year when there is \ndirect cost, is left vague. I have read the answers of my good friend \nSenator Kempthorne to my questions, and it is still vague. The truth of \nthe matter is we do not know. If the bill is going to determine the \nfiscal year, then it would seem to me it is going to be 2006. And at \nthat point the purpose of the statute, which is to help local \ngovernments and to help us understand impacts, would be thwarted. If it \nis the first year where there are direct expenses, on the other hand, \nthen it seems that the purpose of the bill might also be thwarted.\n  By the way, I just mentioned the fact that local governments are \nsupposed to be consulted, assuming you can get a cross-section of local \ngovernments, or figure out how you would do this in this kind of case. \nYou have an incentive here which is perverse. The higher the local \ngovernments say their costs are going to be, the more likely it is they \nare going to be off the hook or have the mandate paid for by the \nFederal Government.\n  The CBO is going to be required to consult with local government, and \nif it is in the interest of local governments to have a high estimate \ninstead of a low estimate because it means the funds from the Federal \nGovernment will be greater rather than less, or it means that there \nwill be something triggered which will let them off the hook altogether \nfrom the mandate, we have a perverse incentive.\n  These are estimates, I emphasize that there is no science to try to \nfigure out how many new incinerators and in what period of time they \nare going to have to be put in place by some of the 87,000 \njurisdictions. We know it is not an exact science; it is a wild guess. \nEven if any guesstimate can be made, it is still going to be a wild \none, in many cases. We had a chart from CBO going through previous \ninstances where they have made estimates of impacts on State and local \ngovernments, and they tell us that in many cases they cannot do it. We \nhave taken care of that, to an extent, with an earlier amendment which \nsays at least if the CBO cannot make an estimate, they are allowed to \ndo so in the intergovernmental mandate, the way the bill originally \nallowed them to be honest relative to a private concern.\n  We should be aware of the fact that the incentive being created by \nthis process will be for local governments not to be giving us their \nlowest estimates but their highest estimates. The more it is inflated, \nor the higher it is, if they come in at the top of the range instead of \nthe bottom of the range, the more likely it is that they are going to \nget funding from the Federal Government, or that a point of order will \nlie which will force us to waive a mandate. I do not think it makes \ngreat sense to put so much reliance on an estimate which contains one \nof these kinds of a perverse incentive.\n  Mr. President, I wonder how much time I have left under the time I \nhave yielded myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 20 minutes \nremaining. The Senator from Utah still has 15 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, earlier today, I asked the Senator from \nIdaho some questions about how this whole process would work on an \namendment. He gave me the best answers he could, which were that, well, \nif the CBO was unable to make an estimate and if the Budget Committee \nwas unable to make an estimate as to the cost to local and State \ngovernments of an amendment, that, first of all, a point of order would \nnot lie for the failure to make an estimate. That estimate requirement \ndoes not apply to amendments. But what does apply to amendments is the \nthreshold, the cost.\n  So if an amendment is offered and a point of order is raised that the \ncost of that to State and local governments is above $50 million in any \nof the 5 fiscal years after it is effective, somehow or other the Chair \nis going to have to make a ruling. How does the Chair make a ruling? \nTalk about uncertainties. It is going to ask the Budget Committee. The \nBudget Committee is going to ask the CBO. My question to the Senator \nfrom Idaho was, ``What happens if the CBO and Budget Committee cannot \ntake an estimate? They say there is no way we can make an estimate on \nthis amendment. What happens? Does the point of order lie if there is \nno way to make an estimate?'' The answer was, ``Maybe yes, maybe no. We \ncannot tell.''\n  I gather from the answer that most of the time the Chair would rule, \nin the absence of any information from the Budget Committee or from the \nCBO, that a threshold has been crossed, and that the Chair would rule \nthat a point of order does not lie. At least that would seem to be the \ncase some or most of the time. But the Senator from Idaho said, ``We \ncannot say how often that would be true,'' basically. I do not want to \nput words in his mouth, but I think the summary that I could best \ndescribe is that we are not precluding the Chair from ruling that a \nthreshold has been crossed, even though it has no basis for making that \nruling from the Congressional Budget Office or from the Budget \nCommittee; that the Chair could turn to other resources, perhaps.\n  What are those other resources if it is not the CBO or Budget \nCommittee? Is it newspapers? Is it the last Senator the Chair has \ntalked to? The bill tells us that these estimates are going to be based \non the CBO and on the Budget Committee. That is what the bill tells us. \nWhen it comes down to the critical issue, the absolutely critical issue \nas to whether a point of order lies because a threshold has been \ncrossed on an \n[[Page S1658]] amendment, we are left with the uncertainty and \nambiguity doubled. We always have an uncertainty and ambiguity when CBO \nand Budget Committee make estimates. But now we have added the Chair \nand the Parliamentarian to this process. It is no longer, as the bill \nsuggests, that we are going to be able to rely on the Budget Committee \nand the CBO. We are now told, no, even if they cannot give the Chair \ninformation upon which to rule on whether or not a threshold has been \ncrossed, nonetheless the Chair still is not precluded from ruling that \nthat threshold is crossed because the Chair could use other sources. A \ncouple were mentioned by the Senator from Idaho. One was the bill \nitself and, of course, that was available to the CBO and Budget \nCommittee. And another source that the Chair might look at, we were \ntold, was precedent which, of course, is also available to the CBO and \nthe Budget Committee.\n  So we have introduced another uncertainty, a great uncertainty, in \nthis process. Were there uncertainties in S. 993? Of course, \nthere were. S. 993, last year's bill on mandates, which I am offering \nas a substitute to S. 1, was not free of ambiguities, but there was not \nso much hinging on an ambiguity. It did not have this final point of \norder which got into the appropriations process down the road. That is \nwhat is new about S. 1.\n  Let us put ourselves into a real world situation. Let us say that my \nhypothetical bill has been offered, which would mandate reductions of \ndangerous levels of mercury in incinerator emissions after October 1, \n2005. The EPA is designated to determine what constitutes a level of \nmercury that is dangerous to human health. Well, when is the EPA going \nto determine that? The first fiscal year in which the mandate is \neffective could, to a significant extent, be dependent on when is the \nEPA going to issue its ruling, how long it will take, and at what level \nwill it be? What is the level? Someone has to make that estimate as to \nwhen that is. But that is complicated enough. An amendment comes along \nthat says, no new incinerator can be built within 300 yards of a school \nor hospital after October 1, 2005. That is an amendment offered on the \nfloor. No new incinerator after 2005.\n  Someone has to, presumably, figure out, ``Well, how many new \nincinerators might be built within 300 yards of a school and during \nwhat time period in 87,000 jurisdictions?'' Someone has to make that \nestimate.\n  Let us assume the offeror of the amendment has submitted the \namendment to the CBO and to the Budget Committee prior to offering his \namendment. Now we have a second-degree amendment that is offered on the \nfloor that says, ``No, we are going to reduce that to 100 yards of the \nincinerator instead of 300 yards from the incinerator.'' A second-\ndegree amendment, with no possibility of an estimate, is now offered on \nthe floor and the maker of the amendment, of course, the second-degree \namendment, did not know that the first amendment was going to be \nforthcoming. He did not have an opportunity to get his estimated. He \nsuddenly is confronted with that first-degree amendment and he is \ntrying to get a second-degree amendment in place. And now he is going \nto wildly scramble around to try to get an estimate from the CBO or the \nBudget Committee as to how much that second-degree amendment is going \nto cost.\n  And on this process, we are placing all of this weight. What is going \nto happen?\n  When we plunge ourselves into a procedural morass in order to prevent \nourselves from being able to act, if we want to, in an easier, \nreasonable way, we are likely to force ourselves into evasion, into \nboilerplate, and we are tempted to use this for other purposes.\n  Yesterday, we had an amendment which was adopted, the Graham \namendment, where a point of order now lies if you try to reduce Federal \nspending on immigration. Now a new process is being applied to a \nspending cut; the argument being that, if that cut were made, that \nwould lead to more local spending. Well, the same thing can be true for \ndozens of amendments. We can start putting points of order on the \nreduction of spending by the Federal Government for all kinds of \nreasons where their may be a resulting increase in local spending.\n  My cities have to spend an awful lot more trying to fight the drug \nwar if we do not stop drugs at their source. This is what we did \nyesterday, basically. Now we are going to use points of order to say \nany reduction in the level of expenditures to fight drugs at their \nsource, which is the responsibility of the Federal Government, surely \nnot the State or local governments. Drugs in Colombia, when the fields \nare being burned, are not the responsibility of my home State or my \nhome city. The Federal Government does that. And to the extent it does \nnot do that, we have more expenses for drug enforcement in my State. \nNow we will use the same process.\n  This is the temptation when you start using this kind of a process to \nachieve a substantive result to the degree that we have. This is all a \nmatter of degree. It is all a matter of whether or not S. 1 goes too \nfar and, in doing so, is going to create evasion and create the \ntemptation to use the same kind of a process for other kinds of related \npurposes. The evasion of S. 1 is not difficult to conceive and it will \ndo nobody any good if it is evaded. The evasion of S. 1 can simply be \nin the authorization bill, that ``Nothing in this bill is permitted to \ncost local and State governments more than $49 million in any fiscal \nyear, and here are the criteria upon which that can be achieved.''\n  So we will start using boilerplates. And then we will start using \nlanguage in appropriations: ``Notwithstanding any prior law, we are \ngoing to appropriate to this level,'' a level, let us say, that is less \nthan the estimate that was made 10 years before or 5 years before. So \nwe end up with notwithstanding language in appropriations bills in \norder to get around this. If we go too far now, if we put too much \nweight on this kind of a process now, we are inviting people to evade \nthem later.\n  If we do this right, if we have the right balance now, if we do what \nwe did last year in S. 993, which is to require the estimate and, yes, \nwe could even require the authorization, too--which it did last year--\nbut stop short of this new point of order relative to the \nappropriations process, we will be striking a balance where we will be \nforcing ourselves in a reasonable way to consider these costs, a way \nwhich was so reasonable that last year all of the local organizations, \nmayors, States, and legislators supported our effort. But we will be \navoiding the excess process, the Rube Goldberg mechanisms which are \ngoing to create such difficulty for us in the implementation.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 7 minutes \nremaining, the Senator from Utah still has 15 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, 3 weeks of debate on this bill seems now \nto be coming to an end and the vote in favor of a restriction on \nunfunded mandates imposed on State and local governments almost \ncertainly will be overwhelming.\n  During the course of this 3 weeks, however, we have been faced with \nvotes on literally dozens of amendments. Those amendments have covered \ntwo fundamentally different sets of subject matter. The first set, the \nnormal politics, a set of amendments that had nothing to do with \nunfunded mandates but cover much of what the agenda of this Senate is \nlikely to be during the course of the next 6 months with regard to \nvotes that will be overwhelmed by votes on the merits of those issues \nwhen they are brought up in due course. So that, in most respects, that \ndebate has been irrelevant to the agenda of the Senate and of the \nCongress of the United States.\n  But dozens of other amendments, I think, including this last one \nwhich is about to be voted on, do relate to unfunded mandates \nthemselves and almost without exception they have attempted to restrict \nthe ambit, the scope of this unfunded mandates bill.\n  Now the bill itself, it seems to me, is already relatively modest. It \ndoes not ban unfunded mandates as most States \n[[Page S1659]] and local governments would have us do. It simply states \nthat, if an unfunded mandate crosses modest threshold, it must \nconsciously be weighed if a point of order is raised against it. \nUnfunded mandates will still be possible on the part of the Congress of \nthe United States, as long as the Congress has voted on and is \nconscious of the fact that it is creating such mandates.\n  Even so, or perhaps particularly because this is the case, because it \nis not an absolute ban, what these amendments evidence, it seems to me, \nis a tremendous lack of trust in those who are elected in our States \nand in our local governments.\n  It appears to me that there is a high degree, literally, of \nlegislative arrogance involved in the proposition that somehow or \nanother only we know what is best for people in local communities; that \nonly here in Washington, DC, in this body and in the House of \nRepresentatives, is lodged a degree of wisdom and responsibility \nnecessary to see to it that there is proper protection for individuals \nin our society; that somehow or another without unfunded mandates our \nStates and local governments will ignore the young and their schools, \nwill ignore working people, will ignore the elderly, will ignore the \nvery quality of the environment in which these locally elected \nofficials themselves live.\n  I wonder how it is that responsible elected officials are only found \nhere in Washington, DC, and not in our communities. I submit, of \ncourse, that that is not the case. The reason for this bill, the reason \nfor an even stronger bill, would be that the responsibility for the \nlives and careers of people, in most cases, is best conducted by \ngovernments which are closest to them. That has been the genius of the \nAmerican experiment. That is the direction in which many other free \ncountries are moving and the direction in which we should move.\n  We need more personal humility. We need more belief that people \nelected in the States, in our counties, and our cities and towns, not \nonly have the best interest of their constituents in mind but are able \nand willing to act on those best interests.\n  This bill is a modest start to return to a system of federalism which \nhas made this country great. I, for one, am delighted that the great \nbulk of these amendments have been rejected and that we will pass a \nbill which will have at least some effect in restoring authority to the \nunits of government which can best use it and which were conceived by \nour Constitution as the units which should exercise those powers.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nIndiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, we are nearing the time when we are going \nto have a final vote on this very important piece of legislation. There \nhas been extensive debate, numerous amendments, attempts to specify, \nclarify, declassify, and I think bring more complication into this \nissue than need be.\n  The voters on November 8 said they wanted some very significant, \nmajor change in the way that Washington does its business, in the way \nit relates to the citizens which we were sent here to serve. There are \nsome basic fundamental underlying principles that we pledged to the \npeople in the fall of 1994 and which they endorsed on November 8: Live \nby the laws that you ask us to live by. Get your fiscal house in order. \nDo what we have to do. Do not spend more money than you take in.\n  Fundamental to and a big part of that mandate was the request from \nGovernors and mayors and local units of government to ``quit sending us \nmandates to comply with certain laws that you think are best for our \ncommunities, that you think are best for our people, and, by the way, \nthat you think we ought to pay for.''\n  I have here a chart of the State of Indiana with just nine cities \nhighlighted, with the amounts that these cities have to spend on \nmandates sent by this body, on priorities that they do not feel are the \ntop priorities in their communities. They are diverting money from \npolice on the streets. They are diverting money from essential services \nthat our local communities have determined are most important for the \ncitizens that they represent. Yet those are shoved down the list, down \nthe priority list, because the Federal mandate comes with a stamp that \nsays, ``Now, we have ordered it. You do it now. You figure out a way to \npay for it.''\n  Their Hobson's choice is either to raise taxes on citizens that do \nnot want taxes raised for the mandates that are coming down, or to cut \nessential services. Given the tax climate that exists, the deficit \nclimate that exists in our country today, what happens is that \nessential services are cut.\n  I have listed here city after city in Indiana, including Fort Wayne, \nIN, that has had to cut essential services that are necessary to the \nfunctioning of that community and reach the real needs of the people.\n  We have a very basic choice here. We can follow the mandate of the \nfall, the mandate of the people, and return authority back to the units \nof government that are closest to the people and back to the people; or \nwe can continue to take the attitude that Washington knows best, that \nwe can decide here what is best for every community in Indiana. It may \nbe what is best for a particular community somewhere in our Nation. But \none size does not fit all. One community's needs are not every other \ncommunity's needs.\n  So we have a very basic decision to make. That decision is: Do we \nwant to return authority and power to those units of government that \nare much closer to the people and give them the flexibility of \nproviding the priorities; or, if we are going to mandate something that \nwe believe is so important that ought to be mandated on a national \nbasis, are we going to provide the funds necessary to so that they can \naccomplish that mandate without subordinating other top, important \npriorities that affect that particular local community? I think it is \nthat basic.\n  Some would say that oversimplifies it; you do not understand how it \nworks. We have seen charts on how complicated this procedure is. There \nis a basic, fundamental question on which we will vote in just a couple \nof hours. That fundamental question is: Are we going to continue to \ndictate out of Washington decisions that our local citizens must live \nby, or are we beginning to turn that back to the people?\n  The very first act of the new Congress was to pass a bill which \nensures that Congress will live under the same laws it imposes on the \nrest of America. It was an important first step in fundamentally \naltering the culture of Congress. We will pass better laws if we must \nlive by them; if they cannot be complied with, they will not pass.\n  The bill before us today is equally important, because it ends \nbusiness as usual. For too long, Congress has legislated with impunity. \nNot only has Congress exempted itself from provisions of the law; often \nwe have indemnified ourselves from the costs. It has passed laws \nimposing burdens on States, communities, and businesses with little \nregard for the cost, and no accountability to the taxpayer. The $4.7 \ntrillion in accumulated debt only begins to tell the story of a \nCongress addicted to deficits; when we have lacked the resources we \nhave simply passed on the costs.\n  Under current practice, Congress does not have to consider the cost \nof the mandates it imposes on State and local government and the \nprivate sector. This is an irresponsible way to legislate.\n  The bill we are considering will ensure that we know the cost of \nFederal mandates on localities before a bill passes, and it will \nrequire that we provide a funding mechanism to pay for them.\n  Under S. 1, mandates with costs to State and local government of more \nthan $50 million must have a CBO cost estimate. Congress must then \ninclude the funds by finding an offset or by raising revenues.\n  Legislation which imposes financial burdens of more than $200 million \non the private sector must also have a CBO estimate or be ruled out of \norder.\n  The cost of mandates to communities is significant, perhaps a \nsampling of communities around my State will shed some light on why \nthis legislation is so important.\n\nCity:                                      Total cost, fiscal year 1993\n  Anderson...................................................$6,831,940\n  Columbus....................................................1,382,719\n  Elkhart.....................................................2,162,928\n  Fort Wayne..................................................5,837,492\n  Hammond.....................................................1,051,701\n  Lafayette.....................................................132,000\n  Mishawaka.....................................................162,447\n  South Bend..................................................2,751,150\n  [[Page S1660]] Terre Haute....................................151,585\n\n  These are big numbers for Indiana communities, yet they just begin to \ntell the story. When we require State and local government to respond \nto Washington's priorities--priorities Washington did not see fit to \npay for--we preempt the spending priorities of local communities, \nregardless of their urgency. When a Federal mandate comes down, it \nmoves to the top of the list.\n  This means that State and local leaders are forced to deal first, not \nwith local concerns, but with Washington's agenda. One Indiana mayor \ncharacterized this as the my-way, but-you-pay approach to Federal \npolicy.\n  As a result, our States and localities are faced with a Hobbsien \nchoice--raise taxes, or forgo dealing with the real problems of the \ncommunity.\n  Let me cite an example. There is no area of public concern more \nprofound than crime. Yet many cities divert funds away from local law \nenforcement to pay for Federal mandates.\n  In a survey of 146 cities, conducted by the National Conference of \nMayors and Price Waterhouse, it was estimated that over $800 million \nannually--an average of $5.5 million per city--would be available in \n1995 if Federal mandates were funded.\n  Many of those cities said they would spend the freed moneys on crime \nprevention. Most of it, 62 percent, would be spent putting new police \nofficers on the street. The rest would be spent upgrading patrol cars, \nmodernizing equipment, and providing overtime pay for officers.\n  Bloomington, IN, estimates it would spend an additional $90,000 on \nlaw enforcement. South Bend would spend over $1\\1/2\\ million on new \npolice protection for its citizens.\n  Federal mandates are hampering the ability of our cities to provide \nfor the basic safety and security of their citizens.\n  Unfunded mandates also dramatically increase the cost of doing \nbusiness. Complying with Federal regulations, as well as the liability \nexposure that results from Federal mandates and regulations, adds \nbillions of dollars every year to basic business costs.\n  These burdens thwart growth and job creation. They increase costs for \nconsumers. And they discourage people from going into business.\n  It is critical that Congress pass this legislation. We must return \npower and resources to States and communities so that they can deal \neffectively and creatively with the unique problems and priorities they \nface. We must relieve the burdens we have placed on the businesses of \nthis country, and allow them to unleash their creative power to build a \nstrong and growing economy.\n  The mayor of my home town, Fort Wayne, IN, expressed the sentiments \nof many when he said:\n\n       We need to change this irresponsible habit. If the same \n     people who wrote the laws and drafted the regulations had to \n     raise the funds to pay for them, they would be much more \n     careful about the costs.\n\n  In passing this legislation we take an important second step toward \nsignificant congressional reform and greater accountability to the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will necessarily make this quick. I am \nfascinated by these arguments, particularly the last two arguments I \nhave heard.\n  The fundamental question here is: Do we want to, in fact, deal with \nFederal mandates which should be local decisions or paid for by the \nFederal Government, or do we want to set in motion more gridlock? If we \nwant to do the former and not the latter, we should vote for this \namendment, No. 1.\n  No. 2, my friend from Washington is engaging in what I think is part \nof the litany that we have been hearing. Why do we in Washington think \nwe know so much, and why, in fact, do we not have more personal \nhumility?\n  If he means it, why are there exceptions in it? Why are there any \nexceptions? If he means what he says, why is there an exception here \nfor civil rights? I will tell you why. We got in the business of being \ninvolved federally because States acted irresponsibly on occasion.\n  So if my friend from Wyoming has such humility, let him come and \noffer an amendment to strike out all the exceptions. Why are we keeping \nin here ``constitutional rights of individuals''? They are not \nmandates. ``Discrimination on the basis of race, religion, gender, \nnational origin, handicap or disability status.'' Why is that not a \nmandate? It costs the States money to do those things. Why is that not \na mandate?\n  So this unusual argument about whether or not we have humility or do \nnot have humility, or Washington knows all or does not know all, that \nis a nice campaign rhetoric. What it is about is, why do we not stop \ntelling the States to do things which are not essential unless we pay \nfor them? Why do we not\n do it in a simplistic, straightforward way that does not allow a \nminority to tie up this body in gridlock for greater political purposes \nhaving nothing to do with looking out for the interest of the States? \nIf we want to do that, we have a bill that was introduced last year \nthat the manager of this bill was a cosponsor of last year, that does \nnot create that complex chart that allows any one or two or several \nU.S. Senator or Parliamentarians to get involved in gumming up the \nworks and creating gridlock.\n\n  Mr. President, like many of my colleagues, I was a local official \nbefore coming to the Senate. I know what it means to have to comply \nwith legal duties imposed from a higher government. As a former county \ncouncil member, I understand, and am sympathetic to, many of the \ncomplaints and concerns we have heard from State and local officials \nwho must respond to Federal mandates.\n  The bill before us today, S. 1, is not the legislation that we worked \non so long and hard last year to address the issue of Federal mandates. \nThat bill, S. 993, is being offered now as an amendment by Senator \nLevin; it will focus the Senate's attention on the costs involved in \nsetting new requirements to be met by States and local governments. It \nwill raise our awareness of the financial price that must be paid to \nmeet our goals, and permits us to determine how that price will be \npaid.\n  Senator Levin's amendment changes the way we handle mandate \nlegislation in this body, but it makes those changes subject to a \nsunset, in 1998, when the new process would end unless we choose to \nextent it. It will be an experiment--I believe a worthy experiment--to \nbe sure that our attention is directed to all the consequences of new \nlegislation.\n  Last year S. 993 had the enthusiastic support of a broad bipartisan \ncoalition. Senator Kempthorne, the acknowledged leader on this issue, \nwas the original author of that proposal.\n  But I am afraid, Mr. President, that S. 1 could prove to be a recipe \nfor confusion, frustration, and more political gridlock in the \nlegislative process. It was rushed through committee, with no debate \nand no amendments. Indeed, it came from committee without a report \nexplaining how it would work.\n  This should not be how we legislate.\n  The public debate about unfunded mandates over the past few years has \nbeen a healthy one, and has succeeded in bringing to the forefront the \ncontinual need to examine the costs associated with Federal \nrequirements and, indeed, the appropriate role of the Federal \nGovernment. There are limits to what the Federal Government should do \nand should require.\n  We need to approach our many real public policy problems with common \nsense, to give greater flexibility to those who implement our laws, to \nbe more goal-oriented and less process-oriented, and to reign in \nbureaucrats that get carried away with their charge.\n  As one example, I spent quite a bit of time last year, along with the \nGovernor of Delaware, trying to demonstrate to the EPA that our State \ncould meet new clean air standards without making all our citizens run \ntheir cars through an expensive treadmill test that yielded little \npollution reduction. EPA got the message; the treadmill test is out.\n  We will pass an unfunded mandates bill this afternoon. If I had my \nfirst choice, it would be the substitute before us now. It had the full \nsupport of State and local government leaders last year, and is free of \nthe hastily drafted, last-minute additions of this year's version.\n  [[Page S1661]] But whichever version we vote for here today, we will \nassure that decisions that materially affect State and local \ngovernments are made from now on with a clearer view of their costs as \nwell as their benefits.\n  Mr. President, if I have any time left--I may not--if I have any time \nleft, let me say that this is about making local decisions that deserve \nto be local decisions at a local level. And if we impose more on local \norganizations, then what they have a right to ask for we should pay \nfor.\n  But let me close by saying, I live in a city, in a State that has the \nhighest cancer rate in the Nation. We, coincidentally, are on the \nborder of southeastern Pennsylvania which has more oil refineries per \nsquare inch than any place in the Nation, including Houston, TX, and \nthe prevailing winds are south.\n  If we did not have the Federal Government setting out a Clean Air \nAct, the idea that the people of Pennsylvania would vote to expend the \nmoney to clean up the air, the ambient air quality in Marcus Hook, PA, \nto save the lives in Delaware is zero. That is why we have national \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 5 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I have enjoyed this debate. I have enjoyed many of the \nthings I have heard. The Senator from Michigan told us that S. 993 had \nnear consensus from mayors, Governors, et cetera, and spoke very \nproudly of it. I was an original cosponsor of S. 993, and I was proud \nof it. I will point out to the Senator from Michigan, and everyone \nelse, that S. 1 continues to enjoy exactly the same consensus, indeed, \nif anything, the consensus is stronger from the same people.\n  I will quote a letter addressed to the original cosponsors of S. 1, \nthe Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995, telling us:\n\n       Thank you for your leadership in listening to and acting on \n     the nationwide call of State and local governments to pass S. \n     1.\n\n  I will not read the entire letter. I ask unanimous consent that it, \nand other letters in support of S. 1, be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I will quote this relating to S. 1. They \nsay:\n\n       The bill is reasonable, workable and long overdue. It has \n     our unanimous bipartisan support, without weakening \n     amendments.\n\n  Signed by Howard Dean, Governor of Vermont, chairman of the National \nGovernor's Association; George Voinovich, Governor of Ohio; and \nBenjamin Nelson, Governor of Nebraska.

They are talking about S. 1, which \nthey want passed without weakening amendments.\n  I am relatively new to this body. I find it fascinating to go through \nthe learning experience that comes to a freshman Senator. I was here on \nthe floor for my first 2 years, and I learned about the filibuster. \nIndeed, I participated in the filibuster. I participated in and \nsupported the filibuster that killed the President's stimulus package, \nand I did it because I thought it was the right thing to do and also a \nmajority of the American people agreed.\n  It was, frankly, good politics. It helped us win the election because \nwe stood against something that the majority of the American people \nwere against. I participated in a filibuster on land use issues \nrelating to the ownership of land in my State. Once again, I believed \nin it, we won it, and most of the people in my State and the Western \nStates agreed. It redounded to our political benefit to participate in \nthat filibuster.\n  I participated in a filibuster on campaign reform because I thought \nthe bill, as written, supported one party to the detriment of the \nother. I believed in it. I understood that. The thing I have not \nunderstood about this debate, and I hope when it is over someone will \nexplain to me, is why the minority party has chosen to mount the same \nkind of filibuster that we mounted on the minority 2 years ago against \na bill that is supported by all of the Governors, all of the mayors, \nthe President of the United States and a large number of the Members of \ntheir party.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We are urging every Member of the 104th Congress \n     to join you in support of S. 1 and the future savings it will \n     bring to every taxpayer we serve.\n       S. 1 will bring an open, accountable, and informed decision \n     making process to future federal proposals and regulations \n     that impact state and local governments. S. 1 applies the \n     same pay-as-you-go rules that Congress now requires for the \n     federal budget to any mandates it would impose on state and \n     local governments.

Dirk Kempthorne,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kempthorne: On behalf of the 180,000 members \n     of the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB), I would \n     like to urge your strong support for S. 1, the Unfunded \n     Mandate Reform Act of 1995, scheduled for committee mark-up \n     on Monday, January 9 and floor consideration on Wednesday, \n     January 11. It is essential that we try to control the \n     ``unfunded mandates'' crisis facing America today.\n       What is known as ``unfunded mandates'' to Washington \n     insiders is really a cruel hidden tax on the housing \n     consumer. It is time to stop these unfunded mandates. It is \n     time to address the housing affordability crisis in this \n     country. Supporting S. 1 is an important first step. Without \n     this bill, unfunded mandates will continue to be passed on to \n     the housing consumer.\n       The problems created by unfunded mandates are not limited \n     to state and local government budget concerns, but affect all \n     Americans and uniquely affects the housing consumer and \n     homebuilding industry. Unfunded mandates often result in \n     ``impact fees'' on new housing and housing subdivisions. \n     These impact fees come in various forms such as sewer and \n     water hookups fees, fees for new streets and infrastructure, \n     fees for fire and police protection, assessments for schools, \n     libraries, museums, parks and solid waste facilities. In \n     addition, taxes are often levied or increased in the form of \n     bedroom taxes, contribution-in-aid of construction (CIAC) \n     taxes on utilities, increased property taxes, increased sales \n     taxes, real estate transfer taxes, gasoline taxes.\n       These impact fees and special assessments add substantially \n     to the cost of housing and represent one of the most dramatic \n     price increases to the housing consumer. In California, for \n     example, impact fees often exceed $20,000 per new house. More \n     common examples of impact fees include $5,000 assessments per \n     house in Florida and $3,000 per house assessments in \n     Maryland. The impact can really be seen when one considers \n     that 20,000 housing consumers are driven out of the housing \n     market for every $1,000 increase in the price of a house.\n       [[Page S1662]] Of equal concern is that the community as a \n     whole suffers from such actions. Unfunded mandates reduce the \n     ability of local governments to prioritize their own needs. \n     In a time when everyone is working on limited budgets, \n     compliance with federal mandates often requires funds to be \n     diverted from other areas of state/local budgets such as \n     education, emergency services or capital improvements.\n       S. 1 is a critical step in addressing this crisis by \n     requiring that any bill to be considered by Congress be \n     accompanied by a cost analysis as to the bill's potential \n     effect on state and local governments and the private sector. \n     Congress should be aware of the potential impact its laws \n     will have on local governments and the private sector before \n     they are voted on. Likewise, the American people should to be \n     informed of the impact of the laws being considered by \n     Congress.\n       Again, I would like to strongly urge your support for S. 1 \n     and opposition to any weakening amendments. We need to \n     address this crisis and alleviate the imposition of unfunded \n     federal mandates.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Thomas N. Thompson,\n     NAHB President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                 The United States\n\n\n                                         Conference of Mayors,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 30, 1994.\n     Hon. Dirk Kempthorne,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kempthorne: On behalf of the United States \n     Conference of Mayors, I want to thank you for your continued \n     leadership in our fight against unfunded federal mandates and \n     to express strong support for the new bill, S.1.\n       S. 1 is serious and tough mandate reform which will do more \n     than simply stop the flood of trickle-down taxes and \n     irresponsible, ill-defined federal mandates which have come \n     from Washington over the past two decades. S. 1 will begin to \n     restore the partnership which the founders of this nation \n     intended to exist between the federal government, and state \n     and local governments.\n       S. 1, which was developed in bipartisan cooperation with \n     the state and local organizations, including the Conference \n     of Mayors, is even stronger than what was before the Senate \n     last year in that it requires Congress to either fund a \n     mandate at the time of passage or provide that the mandate \n     cannot be enforced by the federal government if not fully \n     funded. However, the bill is still based upon the carefully \n     crafted package which was agreed to in S. 993 and which \n     garnered 67 Senate cosponsors in the 103rd Congress. The bill \n     would not in any way repeal, weaken or affect any existing \n     statute, be it an existing unfunded mandate or not. This \n     legislation only seeks to address new unfunded mandate \n     legislation. In addition, S. 1 would not infringe upon or \n     limit the ability of the Congress or the federal judicial \n     system to enforce any new or existing constitutional \n     protection or civil rights statute.\n       The mayors, are extremely pleased that our legislation, \n     which was blocked from final passage in the 103rd Congress, \n     has been designated as S. 1 by incoming Majority Leader Bob \n     Dole. We also understand and appreciate the significance of \n     the Governmental Affairs and Budget Committees holding a \n     joint hearing on our bill on the second day of the 104th \n     Congress at which our organization will be represented.\n       I remember the early days in our campaign when many \n     questioned our resolve. How could a freshman Republican \n     Senator from the State of Idaho move the Washington \n     establishment to reform its beloved practice of imposing \n     federal mandates without funding? We responded to these \n     doubters by focusing the national grass-roots resentment of \n     unfunded mandates into a well orchestrated political machine, \n     and by joining with our state and local partners in taking \n     our message to Washington.\n       The United States Conference of Mayors will continue in its \n     efforts to enact S. 1 until we are successful. We will not \n     let up on the political and public pressure. And we will \n     actively oppose efforts to weaken our bill.\n       The time to pass our bill is now. Those who would seek to \n     delay action will be held accountable, and those who stand \n     with state and local government will know that they have our \n     support and appreciation.\n       Thank you again for all of your hard work and commitment, \n     and rest assured that we will continue to stand with you.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                      Victor Ashe,\n     Mayor of Knoxville, President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                             National Association of Counties,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 29, 1994.\n     Hon. Dirk Kempthorne,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kempthorne: On behalf of the National \n     Association of Counties, I am writing to express our strong \n     support for S. 1, the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995. We \n     sincerely appreciate the leadership you have provided in \n     crafting this new, strong bipartisan bill to relieve state \n     and local governments from the growing burdens of unfunded \n     federal mandates. Our NACo staff has reviewed the latest \n     draft and they are convinced it is much stronger than S. 993, \n     the bill approved in committee last summer.\n       While this legislation retained many of the basic \n     principles from the previous bill, there were many \n     improvements. Most significant among them is the provision \n     that requires any new mandate to be funded by new entitlement \n     spending or new taxes or new appropriations. If not, the \n     mandate will not take effect unless the majority of members \n     in both houses vote to impose the cost on state and local \n     governments. Although the new bill will not prevent Congress \n     from imposing the cost of new mandates on state and local \n     taxpayers, by holding members accountable we believe it will \n     discourage and curtail the number of mandates imposed on \n     them.\n       Again, thank you for your leadership on this important \n     legislation. County officials across our great nation stand \n     ready to assist you in any way we can to ensure the swift \n     passage to S. 1. If you have any questions, please contact \n     Larry Naake or Larry Jones of the NACo staff.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               Randall Franke,\n\n                                Commissioner, Marion County, Ore.,\n     NACo President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                    National League of Cities,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 30, 1994.\n     Hon. Dirk Kempthorne,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kempthorne: I am writing on behalf of the \n     elected officials of the nation's cities and towns to commend \n     you for sponsoring the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995. \n     Of all the measures introduced to date, this legislation is \n     undoubtedly the strongest, best crafted, and most \n     comprehensive approach to provide relief for state and local \n     governments from the burden of unfunded federal mandates.\n       The National League of Cities commits its strongest support \n     for the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act. We will fight any \n     attempts to weaken the bill with the full force of the \n     150,000 local elected officials we represent. Local \n     governments and the taxpayers we serve have borne the federal \n     government's fiscal burden for too long. We will not have \n     such an important relief measure thwarted in the final hour \n     by special interests.\n       We commend you for continuing to foster the bipartisan \n     support which your original mandate relief bill so \n     successfully garnered in the last Congress. We will work hard \n     to gain bipartisan support for mandates relief in the 104th \n     Congress, because, as you are well aware, this bill will \n     benefit all states, all counties, all municipalities, and all \n     taxpayers, regardless of their political allegiance.\n       Again, please accept our sincere gratitude for your \n     efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Carolyn Long Banks,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                           National School Boards Association,\n\n                                Alexandria, VA, December 30, 1994.\n     Hon. Dirk Kempthorne,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Kempthorne: The National School Boards \n     Association (NSBA), on behalf of the more than 95,000 locally \n     elected school board members nationwide, would like to offer \n     its strong support for the ``Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of \n     1995'' (S. 1). This legislation would establish a general \n     rule that Congress shall not impose federal mandates without \n     adequate funding. This legislation would stop the flow of \n     requirements on school districts which must spend billions of \n     local tax dollars every year to comply with unfunded federal \n     mandates. We commend you for your unending leadership on this \n     critical issue.\n       Today, school children throughout the country are facing \n     the prospect of reduced classroom instruction because the \n     federal government requires, but does not fund, services or \n     programs that local school boards are directed to implement. \n     School boards are not opposed to the goals of many of these \n     mandates, but we believe that Congress should be responsible \n     for funding the programs it imposes on school districts. Our \n     nation's public school children must not be made to pay the \n     price for unfunded federal mandates.\n       S. 1 would prohibit a law from being implemented without \n     necessary federal government funding. S. 1 would allow school \n     districts to execute the future programs which are required \n     by the federal government without placing an unfair financial \n     burden on the schools.\n       Again, we applaud your leadership in negotiating and \n     sponsoring this bill which would allow schools to provide a \n     quality education to their students. We offer any assistance \n     you need as you quickly move this bill to the Senate floor.\n       If you have questions regarding this issue, please contact \n     Laurie A. Westley, Chief Legislative Counsel at (703) 838-\n     6703.\n           Yours, very truly,\n     Boyd W. Boehlje,\n                                                        President.\n     Thomas A. Shannon,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                            National Conference of\n\n\n                                           State Legislatures,\n\n                               Washington, DC., December 30, 1994.\n     Hon. Dirk Kempthorne,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kempthorne:  The National Conference of State \n     Legislatures enthusiastically supports S. 1, the Unfunded \n     Mandate Reform Act of 1995. We join you in urging your \n     colleagues to co-sponsor this bill and approve this \n     legislation in Committee and on the floor of the Senate. The \n     National Conference of State Legislatures commends \n     [[Page S1663]] your efforts, along with those of Senator Bill \n     Roth, incoming Chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs \n     Committee, and Senator John Glenn, the outgoing Chairman of \n     the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, in forging the \n     bipartisan mandate relief bill that is to be presented to the \n     Senate next week as S. 1. We deeply appreciate your \n     leadership in developing legislation that takes significant \n     steps toward correcting the problem of unfunded federal \n     mandates and for your openness to listen to our concerns \n     during the negotiation process.\n       Your bill is a fitting first step in restoring the balance \n     to our federal system by recognizing that the partnership \n     with state and local governments has been significantly \n     weakened by the growing federal practice of imposing unfunded \n     mandates. No government has the luxury of unlimited \n     resources, and the taxpayers of this country, our shared \n     constituents, recognize that having the federal government \n     pass its obligations down to the state and local governments \n     does nothing to reduce their overall tax burden.\n       This bill is about information and accountability. The cost \n     estimate, points of order, rules changes and other provisions \n     contained in this legislation are absolutely necessary to get \n     us back on track and have the federal government take \n     responsibility for its actions. To make responsible \n     decisions, members of Congress need to be fully aware of the \n     financial burdens that federal legislation often places on \n     state and local governments, and to understand the \n     implications of those burdens.\n       As has been said often over the past year, the level of \n     cooperation among state and local governments and members of \n     the United States Senate during the negotiation process is \n     unprecedented. Again, we appreciate your efforts, and those \n     of the other Senators who helped forge this compromise, and \n     wholeheartedly support passage of S. 1, the Unfunded Mandate \n     Reform Act of 1995.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Jane L. Campell,\n     President, NCSL.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                         City of San Clemente,\n\n                                San Clemente, CA, January 6, 1995.\n     Re: Support of House and Senate legislation on unfunded \n         federal mandates.\n     Hon. Dirk Kempthorne,\n     Senate Dirksen Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kempthorne: On behalf of the City Council of \n     the City of San Clemente, California, I am urging your \n     support and early passage of the proposed House and Senate \n     Legislation on unfunded Federal mandates.\n       Implementation of current unfunded Federal mandates have \n     significantly increased local government costs, and are \n     severely hampering our ability to fund and provide highly \n     critical basic services, such as public safety, to our \n     citizens. Proper compliance with current Federal mandates has \n     forced closer scrutiny over environmental issues, imposed \n     additional reporting requirements and forced cities to absorb \n     higher employee costs.\n       The City of San Clemente strongly urges your SUPPORT and \n     early passage of the proposed House and Senate legislation on \n     unfunded Federal Mandates, and further requests that you \n     oppose any weakening amendments. Local government revenue has \n     been steadily decreasing for many years. We cannot afford the \n     additional funding and staffing required to comply with \n     Federal mandates, unless the legislation includes funding for \n     such mandates.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Candace Haggard,\n     Mayor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                            National Federation of\n\n\n                                         Independent Business,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, January 3, 1994.\n     Hon. Dirk Kempthorne,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Dirk: On behalf of the over 600,000 members of the \n     National Federation of Independent Business, I urge you to \n     vote in favor of S. 1, the unfunded mandates legislation, \n     when it is considered by the Senate in January.\n       Unfunded federal mandates on the states and local \n     governments end up requiring these entities to raise taxes, \n     establish user fees, or cut back services to balance their \n     budgets. Small business owners are affected by all of these \n     actions.\n       Between 1981 and 1990, Congress enacted 27 major statutes \n     that imposed new regulations on states and localities or \n     significantly expanded existing programs. This compares to 22 \n     such statutes enacted in the 1970s, 12 in the 1960s, 0 in the \n     1950s and 1940s, and only two in the 1930s. The Congressional \n     Budget Office estimates that the cumulative cost of new \n     regulations imposed on state and local governments between \n     1983 and 1990 was between $8.9 billion and $12.7 billion. \n     These include environmental requirements, voters registration \n     requirements, Medicaid, and others.\n       It was not the states and cities who paid roughly $10 \n     billion in unfunded mandates during the 1980s; it was \n     taxpayers--small business owners as well as everyone else. In \n     June 1994, a poll of all NFIB members resulted in a \n     resounding 90% vote against unfunded mandates.\n       I urge you to strongly support S. 1.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           John J. Motley III,\n\n                                                   Vice President,\n     Federal Governmental Relations.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                                        Chamber of Commerce of the\n\n\n                                     United States of America,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, January 3, 1995.\n     Hon. Dirk Kempthorne,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Dirk: On behalf of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce \n     Federation of 215,000 businesses, 3,000 state and local \n     chambers of commerce, and 1,200 trade and professional \n     associations, I sincerely commend your hard work and tenacity \n     on the ``Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995,'' S. 1. The \n     Chamber membership identified unfunded mandates on the \n     private sector and state and local governments as their top \n     priority for the 104th Congress. Accordingly, the Chamber \n     supports this legislation and will commit all necessary time \n     and resources to ensuring its passage early in this session.\n       I particularly want to thank you for responding to our \n     concerns about the role of the private sector in this debate \n     and the potential impact it could have had on the business \n     community, especially small businesses. Your willingness to \n     include the private sector in Title II of S. 1, ``Regulatory \n     Accountability and Reform,'' and your recognition of the \n     potential unfair competition issue between business and state \n     and local government, make this a much stronger bill that can \n     have a significant impact on the current regulatory burden.\n       Again, Dirk, we appreciate your commitment to this issue. I \n     look forward to working with you to secure passage of S. 1 as \n     well as other issues that we can join forces on for the 104th \n     Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n     Richard L. Lesher.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                   National Retail Federation,\n\n                                                  January 4, 1995.\n     Hon. Dirk Kempthorne,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Dirksen Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kempthorne: On behalf of the nation's retail \n     community and its 20 million employees--1 in 5 U.S. workers--\n     we are writing to commend you for your sponsorship of S. 1, \n     The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995. This legislation is \n     the most effective way to confront the problem of unfunded \n     federal mandates while simultaneously resuscitating the \n     concept of federalism and giving the states back control of \n     their budget obligations.\n       The problem is well documented and the solution is clear--\n     unfunded federal mandates must end. Over the past decade, an \n     unprecedented increase in unfunded federal mandates in \n     environment, labor and education, to name just a few, has \n     forced state and local governments to undertake actions that \n     drain their resources and are often in conflict with the best \n     interests of their citizens as well as our industry.\n       As representatives of the retail industry in each of the \n     fifty state capitals, we have experienced firsthand the \n     profound adverse impact of unfunded federal mandates on our \n     industry and our state's economic well-being.\n       Unfunded federal mandates are simply another Washington \n     practice of circumventing a fundamental responsibility in \n     governing, the obligation to bring desires into line with \n     revenues. Such mandates are Washington's way to dictate to \n     the states, even though it has exhausted its resources. S. 1, \n     which would restore accountability and responsibility at the \n     federal level, is the strongest legislative initiative in \n     which to counter this growing problem.\n       Again, we sincerely appreciate your leadership on this \n     important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n         Tracy Mullin, President, National Retail Federation; \n           George Allen, Executive Vice President, Arizona \n           Retailers Association; Lynn Birleffi, Executive \n           Director, Wyoming Retail Merchants Association; J.

On \n     behalf of the over 750,000 members of the NATIONAL \n     ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS, I would like to urge your \n     support for S. 1 when it comes before the Senate.\n       Perhaps no other industry in America is more directly \n     affected by the passing along of federal mandates to states, \n     localities and the private sector than real estate. When the \n     federal government imposes environmental, educational and \n     other requirements, state and local governments have \n     basically two options. They can either eliminate or reduce \n     vital government services, such as police, fire, education, \n     or raise fees and taxes to pay for them. When the compliance \n     costs are passed along to the taxpayers in the form of \n     increased property taxes, real estate transfer fees and \n     impact fees this directly affects the affordability of \n     housing and the marketability of the affected communities. \n     And, most importantly, middle class, first-time home buyers \n     are often forced out of the market.\n       S. 1 will insure that these ``hidden'' federal taxes are \n     not imposed by requiring that proposed legislation include \n     the funding for the federal mandates. If funding is not \n     provided, then a point of order can be raised removing the \n     bill from further consideration by the Senate. The bill also \n     insures that any proposed regulations that impact the private \n     sector by more than $200 million include an analysis of the \n     effect it will have on the nation's economy and productivity.\n       We support S. 1 and we urge you to oppose any floor \n     amendments that would weaken its impact. There should be no \n     carve-outs for broad categories, such as labor or \n     environmental laws and regulations. Thank you for your \n     consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Stephen D. Driesler,\n                                Vice President and Chief Lobbyist.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 3 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to my friend from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan and \ncongratulate him on offering this amendment which is, in essence, S. \n993, which was reported out of the Governmental Affairs Committee last \nyear, an extremely balanced approach to the very real and justifiable \nconcerns of State and local governments that we, in Washington, are \npassing measures which force them to spend money, but we do not give \nthem money to pay those costs.\n  This measure had the widespread support of Governors and mayors. It \nforced Congress to confront the fiscal impact of our actions.\n  Unfortunately, S. 1, which is before us now, simply goes too far. It \ncreates an unintended, but I am convinced, very real and inequitable \nburden on private sector entities, businesses that are affected by \nthese mandates but will not have the extra protection of a second point \nof order in this measure.\n  I am concerned also that S. 1 will put at risk a whole array of \nFederal laws protecting the environment, people's health, people's \nsafety, people's rights that the public simply does not want us to \nendanger and, in that sense, the consequences of this bill are not only \nunintended, they are undesired.\n  Mr. President, this has not been a filibuster. This has been a \nreasonable, thoughtful discussion of a measure which, frankly, most \npeople on the Democratic side of the Senate want to support but feel, \nin its current form as S. 1 simply goes too far and loses the balance, \nthe critical balance that was so much a part of S. 993.\n  Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the amendment by my \ncolleague, Senator Levin.\n  The amendment that he offers includes the text of the bipartisan \nlegislation, S. 993, reported last year by the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee on which I am privileged to serve, which I thought adopted a \nbalanced approach to addressing the justifiable concerns of State and \nlocal governments about unfunded mandates. It had the widespread \nsupport of Governors and mayors. This amendment establishes the \nprinciple that Congress must be forced to confront the costs that may \nbe incurred by the State and local governments when we pass \nlegislation. Through the point of order provision, it provides an \nopportunity for the fullest discussion if there is not a CBO cost \nestimate and if there are not funds authorized in the legislation we \nadopt to cover the costs on State and local governments. I was \ncosponsor of S. 993 and I am pleased to support this amendment now.\n  Last week in connection with the debate on an amendment I offered \nalong with Senators Kerry, Levin, Bumpers, Dorgan, Glenn, and others, I \nset forth in detail my concerns about the changes made in S. 993 as \npart of S. 1. In particular, S. 1 creates a new and, I think, \nthreatening presumption.\n  Under S. 1, if the bill, joint resolution, amendment, motion, or \nconference report increases the Federal intergovernmental mandate by \nmore than $50 million in a given year, a point of order will lie unless \nthere is a funding mechanism provided. S. 1 as originally introduced \nalso provides that if the funding mechanism is an authorization for the \nfull amount of the mandate, then the bill must designate a responsible \nFederal agency, and establish procedures for that agency to direct that \nthe mandate will become ineffective or reduced in scope if the full \namount of the appropriations is not provided in any fiscal year.\n  In short, the presumption in S. 1 is that the Federal Government will \npay 100 percent of the cost of obligations imposed by the Federal \nGovernment on States and localities.\n  So S. 1 is a much more extensive reach than that adopted in this \namendment. It takes a problem and in its response reaches too far; and \nin doing so creates an unintended, and I am convinced, very real and \ninequitable burden on private-sector entities, businesses that are \naffected by these mandates. And I have been concerned that it also puts \nat risk a whole array of Federal law protecting the environment, \npeople's health, people's safety, people's rights that the public \nsimply does not want to endanger, that the public wants us to continue \nto protect.\n  Mr. President, let me now say that I believe the discussions of the \nlast several weeks have made numerous very important improvements in \nthe bill. I cannot overstate the outstanding work of Senators Levin and \nByrd who spent numerous hours working carefully through every provision \nof the bill and demonstrating persuasively to the sponsors that many of \nthe provisions were not well thought out and made little sense. They \nconvinced the sponsors to agree to important amendments that make S. 1 \na far better bill. In particular, I am pleased about: First, Senator \nByrd's amendment which will ensure that Congress has an important role \nin the final decision on whether and how mandates will fail or become \nreduced in scope; second, Senator Levin's amendment providing that if \nCBO cannot do a cost estimate on public sector mandates, the second \npoint of order will not lie.\n  Let me say there that S. 1 could have been improved at an earlier \nstage. S. 1 is extremely important piece of legislation. Its provisions \npotentially affect virtually all of our laws. Yet it was rushed through \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee without any opportunity for careful \nconsideration. The markup took place one full working day after the \nhearing on the bill. The Republicans opposed consideration of all \namendments and voted on a party-line basis to report the bill to the \nfloor without a report. I associate myself fully with the remarks of \nSenator Glenn earlier this morning. This is not how the Governmental \nAffairs Committee usually operates and I hope we'll be returning to our \nusual careful approach to considering legislation.\n  I know, however, that even with the amendments, the basic presumption \nin S. 1 that I am concerned about remains: That the Federal Government \nwill pay 100 percent of the cost of obligations imposed by the Federal \nGovernment on States and localities still exists. I will not go into \nall my concerns with this presumption. As I have previously stated, I \nbelieve that this presumption is inappropriate where laws apply in the \nsame manner to \n[[Page S1665]] State, local or tribal governments and the private \nsector.\n  The presumption is inappropriate because it creates an unintended, \nbut I am convinced very real and inequitable burden on private sector \nentities, businesses that are also affected by these mandates. Second, \nI am concerned that the process will create an unintended hurdle that \nmay well impede the protection of people's health, safety, and \nemployee's rights. Third, I am concerned that we may create \ndifferential standards for protection of our citizens. When we pass a \nlaw, we have determined that the national interest requires that the \nlaw achieve a goal, that there is a problem out there that requires a \nnational solution to protect public health or the environment. We are \nadopting legislation establishing a value, a goal, to protect people. A \nfamily where the grandparents are suffering from emphysema do not care \nif the incinerator that is belching dirty air is publicly or privately \nowned. They believe the Government has an obligation to ensure that \nthey get clean air regardless of who is providing that air. Fourth, I \nam concerned about the extra burden on businesses, particularly small \nbusinesses, if publicly owned facilities do not do their share of \ncleaning up the air or our estuaries. Fifth, those of us who represent \nStates which are victims of pollution from upwind are particularly \nvulnerable under this proposal. If municipal sewage plants in New York \nare exempt from future requirements, Connecticut industries will bear \nan even greater burden in cleaning up Long Island Sound. I think the \nLevin and Byrd amendments make some inroads into limiting the impact of \nthis presumption. But I remain convinced that the presumption itself is \ninappropriate and that this amendment, embodying last year's bipartisan \nbill endorsed by Governors and mayors is the right approach. I urge \nadoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield the Senator from Ohio 30 seconds.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I would like to make some short remarks. I \njust am beginning to resent the implication that I am filibustering \nsomething that I am a cosponsor of, as we keep hearing that from the \nother side of the aisle.\n  I addressed this at some length this morning for about 15 or 20 \nminutes on what happened in committee. We got railroaded in committee \nand could not bring up amendments. We wanted to bring them up there and \ncould not. We came to the floor with a guarantee that we would be able \nto bring up anything we wanted to bring up, and then cloture is filed \nagainst us here.\n  It has been one series of disasters after another in which the \nminority rights were trampled--no report from the committee, nothing at \nall. And yet I am a cosponsor of this legislation. The idea that we are \nsomehow filibustering on this side is just not borne out by the facts, \nand I think the Record shows that.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I believe I have 1 minute left. I yield \nmyself that minute.\n  First of all, let me say, Senator Glenn was the chief sponsor of last \nyear's bill. He is the cosponsor of this year's bill. He is not \nfilibustering, nor am I, nor anyone else who offered amendments to \nimprove this bill.\n  The committee process was significantly bypassed. S. 1 was introduced \non a Wednesday night, the hearing was on a Thursday, and they wanted to \ngo to markup on a Friday. The lesson to be learned here is it is useful \nto have a committee consider a bill. A lot of the amendments adopted \nhere should have been offered and adopted in committee if we had the \ntime.\n  There is no filibuster going on. It seems to me to suggest that \npeople who cosponsor this bill, S. 1, such as Senator Glenn, are \nfilibustering their own bill makes no sense at all.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a letter \nrelative to S. 993 signed by the same people who now support S. 1--\nwhich they do--but last October saying they strongly support S. 993 and \nwould oppose any amendments to S. 993, the same president of the \nNational League of Cities, the same Governor of Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All the time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n         NATIONAL GOVERNORS' ASSOCIATION, NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF \n           STATE LEGISLATURES, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES, \n           NATIONAL LEAGUE OF CITIES, U.S. CONFERENCE OF MAYORS,\n                                                  October 6, 1994.\n       To All Senators: The nation's state and local elected \n     officials strongly urge the U.S. Senate to pass the state-\n     local mandate relief bill, S. 993, before adjournment. \n     Passage of this bill is our top legislative priority.\n       Not only will we oppose any amendments not supported by the \n     bill managers, Senators John Glenn, William Roth, and Dirk \n     Kempthorne, but we view all amendments as an attempt to \n     defeat our legislation. We urge the defeat of all partisan \n     and extraneous amendments.\n       Please stand with your state and local officials in support \n     of this crucial legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     George V. Voinovich,\n       Governor of Ohio, Co-Lead Governor on Federalism, National \n     Governor's Association.\n     Randall Franke,\n       Commissioner of Marion County, Oregon, President, National \n     Association of Counties.\n     Victor Ashe,\n       Mayor of Knoxville, Tennessee, President, U.S. Conference \n     of Mayors.\n     Karen McCarthy,\n       Missouri House of Representatives, President, National \n     Conference of State Legislatures.\n     Sharpe James,\n       Mayor of Newark, New Jersey, President, National League of \n     Cities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 1 minute.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I wish to quickly acknowledge, I mean no \nimplication of dishonor among the Senators who have been working hard. \nI still see some indication that some Members of their party have done \nsome things that look and talk and walk to this Senator a bit like a \nfilibuster.\n  I yield the remainder of the time to the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, S. 993 is the core, it is the base of S. 1. I am proud \nof what we developed in S. 993 last session. But it was last session. \nIt is the building block upon which we then went forward and continued \nto develop S. 1.\n  For those Members who are thinking that they can vote for S. 993, \nlast session's bill, and not vote for S. 1 and think that they can then \nsay to their mayors and to their Governors, their county commissioners, \ntheir teachers, ``Oh, yes, I voted to stop unfunded Federal mandates, I \nvoted for S. 993,'' in today's environment, the fact that we have now \nmoved forward with S. 1, I am afraid you will not get the sort of \nreception that they may have anticipated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time on the amendment has expired.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Texas. [Mr. Gramm] and the \nSenator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham).

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \nmotion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nIdaho is recognized.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the Senator from Idaho controls 20 minutes.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n              Congratulations to the Managers of the Bill\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate the Senator from \nIdaho and the Senator from Ohio for having brought us to the completion \nof this rather lengthy process of passing the unfunded mandates bill.\n  They have done an extraordinary job of managing this bill. They are \nin what has been a long and fairly tedious few weeks here of extraneous \nissues to the underlying question, which is passage of the unfunded \nmandates law.\n  When I first was elected to this body 2 years ago, I made one of my \njob priorities passage of this piece of legislation. I was happy to \nwork with the Senator from Idaho to bring it to this point. And I \ncongratulate him for all of his efforts in truly driving this process.\n  Effective unfunded mandates language is absolutely critical to the \nStates, to the cities, and to the county governments of this country. \nIf we are going to have government which is responsive, we have to have \na Federal Government which, when it passes a law, does not end up \ntaking all of the glory and none of the hard decisions, but rather \ntakes the glory and also takes on the hard decisions. That means that \nthis bill will put us all on notice that when an unfunded mandate comes \nto the floor of the House or the Senate and there is a vote on that \nunfunded mandate, people be held accountable as to whether or not they \nare supporting passing of laws on to the States and on to the cities.\n  It is very appropriate that this bill should be one of the first \nmajor pieces of legislation passed by this Congress because it \nrepresents a new approach to the way we govern this country. It \nrepresents an approach which recognizes federalism should exist. In \nreal terms, federalism means that when the Federal Government takes \nactions, it creates costs for the local community and it also pays the \ncosts that it incurs and puts on those local communities.\n  So I strongly support this piece of legislation. I congratulate the \nmanagers of the bill for bringing it to this point.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nset aside for different Senators to make their comments occur after \nfinal passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that amendment \nNo. 222 be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the amendment (No. 222) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. GLENN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Yes, I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. GLENN. In setting aside time for comments until after the final \nvote, I also ask unanimous consent that the time reserved for Senator \nByrd be included in that time transferred until after the final vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 228 to Amendment No. 210\n\n       (Purpose: To make technical corrections, and for other \n     purposes.)\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President I send to the desk the managers' \namendment and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be reported.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Kempthorne] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 228 to amendment No. 210.\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n  (The text of amendment is located in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the agreement, the amendment is agreed \nto.\n  So the amendment (No. 228) to amendment No. 210 was agreed to.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to support S. 1, the Unfunded \nMandate Reform Act of 1995.\n  This bill will strengthen the partnership between the Federal and \nState government. That, in turn, will help us all do a better job \nprotecting public safety and public health.\n\n\n                               Background\n\n  When the Framers of the Constitution met in Philadelphia, federalism \nwas not an abstract theory. It was a practical necessity.\n  During the period of the Articles of Confederation, the Framers had \nexperienced, first hand, the chaos that occurs when there is no strong \nFederal Government to bind people together and address matters of \nfundamental national interest.\n  At the same time, the Framers understood that, in most cases, State \ngovernment, close to the people, governs best.\n  So the Framers enhanced the Federal Government's authority in certain \nareas. But, in the 10th amendment, they provided that ``the powers not \ndelegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by \nit to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the \npeople.''\n  This system established a partnership.\n  However, over the last few decades, the partnership has been \nweakened.\n  To begin with, Congress enacted a wide range of laws designed to \naddress important national problems. Laws to protect civil rights. To \npromote social welfare. To improve public health. To fight crime. To \nprotect the environment. And to accomplish other important goals.\n  In many cases, the Federal Government required States to take \nstronger action, or provided powerful incentives for them to do so.\n  As a result, our Nation made great progress.\n  But the cumulative cost of all of these laws began to mount. At the \n[[Page S1667]] same time, Federal funding did not rise. Instead, if \nfell.\n  Meanwhile, many State governments became more sophisticated. They \nwanted to address complex problems themselves, without instructions \nfrom Uncle Sam.\n  As a result of all this, State and local governments began to \ncriticize what they called unfunded mandates. Today, the criticism has \nswelled into a virtual rebellion.\n  Now, let's step back for a moment. As with most issues, the unfunded \nmandates debate has had its share of hyperbole. In some cases, the \nestimates of unfunded mandates have been wildly exaggerated. And \nvarious special interests have used the term ``unfunded mandates'' \nloosely, to attack any Federal law they don't like.\n  But, at the core of this debate, there is a real problem. Take the \ncase of Butte, MT. Because of various environmental laws, Butte is \nrequired to upgrade the drinking water system, at a cost of $20 \nmillion; construct a new sludge treatment system, at a cost of $7 \nmillion; and upgrade the landfill, at a cost of $5 million.\n  Independently, each of these requirements makes sense. But their \ncumulative impact can be devastating, especially for a small city like \nButte struggling to diversify its economy.\n  To address situations like this the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee has been focusing on the impact that our environmental laws \nhave on State and local governments.\n  During the last Congress, the committee reported a Safe Drinking \nWater Act and a Clean Water Act that each reduced burdens on local \ngovernments. And the committee considered a Superfund bill and an \nEndangered Species Act bill that would have given States more control \nover those programs.\n  In each case, we gave careful attention to the impact that our \nlegislation would have on State and local governments. In fact, that \nwas one of our primary concerns.\n\n\n                          Support for the Bill\n\n  The bill we are considering today will take another important step in \nthe right direction.\n  The key provision of the bill is pretty straightforward. It requires \nthat, when a bill comes to the floor of the Senate or House, Congress \nmust consider whether the bill imposes a large new mandate on State or \nlocal governments. If so, the bill creates a procedural point of order \nagainst the bill, which can only be waived by a majority vote.\n  In other words, before imposing a new mandate on State or local \ngovernments, Congress must stop and think. We must consider the impact \nof the mandate, consider the alternatives, and make an affirmative \ndecision that the mandate is appropriate.\n  By doing so, the bill reinforces the approach that the Environment \nand Public Works Committee has been taking over the last several years.\n  At the same time, the bill does not create any artificial barriers \nthat would prevent Congress from enacting needed legislation.\n  This is an important point. In some cases, a provision that \ntechnically is an unfunded mandate may be the best solution to a \nproblem.\n  Take the case of a pollution problem that has interstate effects. In \nother words, the pollution crosses State lines. One State may already \nhave taken steps to address the pollution problem. But that State may \nbe located downwind or downstream from another State that hasn't done a \ndarn thing. The bad actor is pouring pollution into its neighboring \nState.\n  In a case like that, we may need a minimum Federal standard. And we \nmay decide that it would be unfair to require the States that already \nhave addressed the problem, and paid for it themselves, to subsidize a \nhandful of bad actors who have lagged behind.\n  In other cases, a minimum Federal standard may be necessary to \nprevent the unfortunate race to the bottom that can occur if States \nweaken their environmental laws as a way of attracting jobs away from \nother States.\n  One State lowers its environmental standards. In response, other \nStates are forced to lower their standards.\n  The result is an overall decline in environmental protection. \nEverybody is worse off.\n  In a State like Montana, which has progressive environmental laws, we \ndon't want to be forced to lower our environmental standards in order \nto create new jobs, or to keep the ones we have.\n  So, Mr. President, there may be cases in which it is entirely \nappropriate to enact a provision that is, technically, an unfunded \nmandate. But, under the bill we are considering today, Congress can \nonly do so if we have carefully considered the impact of the mandate, \nconsidered the alternatives, and affirmatively decided that it's the \nbest solution to the problem.\n\n\n                                concerns\n\n  Of course, no legislation is perfect. During our consideration of \nthis bill, I believe that there have been some significant \nimprovements. And I want to thank the Senator from West Virginia [Mr. \nByrd], the Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], and others for their \ndiligent work.\n  However, I remain concerned over whether the Congressional Budget \nOffice will be able to carry out its new responsibilities. To date, no \none has been able to make reliable estimates of the cost of unfunded \nmandates. Furthermore, the Director of CBO has testified that his \noffice will be hard-pressed to make the necessary assessments.\n  That should be a warning flag. We need to be realistic about how well \nthis bill can be implemented. And we should be ready to fix any \nproblems that arise in the future.\n  Another concern is whether we may be creating an uneven playing field \nthat may favor the public sector over private industry. I hope that \nwill not be the result. But if it is, we may need to revisit that issue \nat a later date.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  In any event, Mr. President, this is not the end of the unfunded \nmandates debate. It's really the beginning.\n  In the upcoming months, we will have the opportunity to reform the \nSafe Drinking Water Act, the Superfund law, and other environmental \nlaws. In each case, we will have the opportunity to give States more \nflexibility and reduce unfunded mandates, while maintaining protection \nof public health.\n  If we do so, we will build on the progress we are making in this \nunfunded mandates bill, and do even more to strengthen the partnership \nbetween the Federal and State governments.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I wish to compliment the leadership of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, Senators Roth and Glenn, for their work \non this bill.\n  Senators Roth and Glenn have stood on this floor for 2 weeks. Their \nthoughtfulness, candor, and fairness are noted and appreciated.\n  Senator Levin is also to be strongly commended for his insightful and \ndetermined efforts to improve this bill.\n  I also wish to compliment the majority manager and prime sponsor of \nthe bill, Senator Kempthorne.\n  For the past 2 years, Senator Kempthorne and I have worked together \nas members of the Environment and Public Works Committee. We've dealt \nwith some thorny issues. Sometimes we've disagreed. But Senator \nKempthorne has always been thoughtful, diligent, and willing to \nconsider other points of view in order to make progress.\n  He's taken the same approach here, and the result is a solid bill \nthat will improve our consideration of environmental and other laws.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I support this bill. I believe that we \nshould consider the effects of legislation we consider in this body on \nStates and localities. I have some serious reservations, however, about \nthe sweep, and the director of this debate.\n\n\n                            the federal role\n\n  When the Articles of Confederation were conceived more than two \ncenturies ago, the States were to be sovereign and independent. Seven \nyears later, the Constitution was ratified as an antidote to the \ndecentralized and weak National Government established by the articles. \nThe Constitution strengthened the responsibility and authority of the \nNational Government, and recognized the Federal Government's unique \nrole in defining and protecting the basic rights and interests of \ncitizens in all States.\n  Over 200 years, the expansion of commerce, the advent of wars, the \ngrowth of a sense of national character, and \n[[Page S1668]] the surge of information and technology have \nconsiderably altered the responsibilities of government at each level. \nWe have grown and proposed as a Nation because our Constitution created \na Government capable of withstanding such dramatic developments and \nchanges.\n\n\n                       legitimate state concerns\n\n  I believe that a discussion of federalism is long overdue, but I am \nconcerned with the direction of our current debate. I understand well \nthe concerns of my State and local colleagues who are outraged over the \nproliferation of Federal mandates and regulations. And I understand \nwell their frustration over the Federal Government's shifting of a \nsubstantial share of the cost of providing basic services to more local \nunits of government.\n\n\n                         shared responsibility\n\n  I am concerned, however, that we are moving further away from the \nnotion of partnership and shared responsibility in this debate.\n  When the city of Houston seeks funding for a new sewer system, or the \ncity of Detroit seeks money for improvements to its transit system, who \ndo they come to for help? They come to us.\n  They come to the Federal Government because they believe that there \nis a national role in assisting them to serve their citizens. And they \ncome to us because they believe that we have deep--though shrinking--\npockets.\n  And, while we sometimes ask them to pay some of the costs, we do our \nbest to help. We, too, recognize that there is a national interest in \nproviding these services. We are willing to share some of the financial \nburden.\n\n\n                           the s. 1 approach\n\n  Now we come to our present debate. The underlying message of this \nbill is that the Federal Government should only ask something of our \nState and local counterparts if it is willing to pay 100 percent of the \ncosts. A point of order can be waived, but it can be raised on almost \nany bill with intergovernmental costs. The message is the National \nGovernment should not ask or expect States and localities to share a \nportion of these costs.\n  This is not an approach recommending shared responsibility, it is an \napproach that could cripple interdependence. The National, State, and \nlocal governments are not independent entities with their own unique \nset of constituents. They are interdependent units of government \nattempting to address similar problems with overlapping constituencies: \nthe American people. We must not lose sight of this fact.\n\n\n                    the importance of some mandates\n\n  Nor should we lose sight of the importance of some of the mandates we \nare discussing today. Let's put this in some perspective.\n  According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, here's a \nsampling of legislation it considers mandates: The Civil Rights Act, \nClean Air, Clean Water, and Safe Drinking Water, the Drug-Free Schools \nand Community Act, college work study, student loan reform, child \nsupport enforcement, and child nutrition legislation.\n  Surely we can all agree that the goals of these acts are important \nand national in scope. We can also agree that they have an important \nintergovernmental impact and benefit.\n  The National Conference of State Legislature's definition of a \nmandate is broader than this bill's. But I am concerned that they and \nothers will seek to expand the definition of an unfunded mandate to \ninclude every important social, environmental, and labor law that is \nnot fully funded by the Federal Government. This would grossly \nundermine the importance of these programs, and jeopardize the \nprotections afford to all Americans.\n  And it would disable our intergovernmental partnership.\n\n\n                 Cost Shifting--the shell and pea game\n\n  Clearly there are genuine issues of concern in the debate over \nFederal mandates. If pressed to its logical extremes, an inordinate \nnumber of mandates could severely limit the States' flexibility in \nresponding to unique regional needs, and abolish the number of fresh \nand innovative ideas that originate from local experimentation.\n  Paying for future programs is not, however, the only issue of concern \nto States and localities. Of equal concern is the financing of vital \nservices.\n  I believe that this bill fails to adequately address the issue of \nFederal cost shifting--one of the most damaging forms of \nintergovernmental abuse. The bill does not prevent the Federal \nGovernment from engaging in a shell and pea game with taxpayer \ndollars--shifting the Federal share of financing vital services to \nStates and localities.\n  S.1 does not consider a substantial cut in entitlement programs to be \na mandate as long as these cuts are accompanied by a corresponding \ndecrease in State and local governments' obligation to comply with the \nprograms provisions.\n  So, if the Congress chooses to slash funding for a major entitlement \nprogram--let's take Medicaid for example--it can do so--as long as it \ntells the States they no longer have to comply fully.\n  But, what is the practical effect on State and local governments of \nslashing Federal funding for Medicaid? The costs of providing virtual \nhealth care services to the poor will not have been reduced--but the \nFederal contribution to addressing that need will now have diminished.\n  Who's going to fill the financial void? Some nonprofits, public \nhospitals, and private charities may pitch in. But, inevitably State \nand local governments are going to have to pick up much of the \nadditional financial burden--whether or not they are required to by the \nletter of the law.\n  States and localities fear a balanced budget amendment so greatly for \nthis very reason. They are all too familiar with this game. They \nunderstand--and their recent experience has taught--that substantial \nreductions in Federal funding for vital services force more local units \nof governments to pick up much of the tab.\n  Cutting Federal funding for vital services is effectively an \nintergovernmental mandate.\n  It's a mandate on States and localities. And frankly, it's a mandate \non the middle-class.\n  All too frequency, it's middle-class Americans who end up bearing a \ndisproportionate share of the increased costs of providing important \nservices.\n  Nothing in this bill precludes the Congress from shifting the burden \nof financing entitlement programs to the States.\n  Mr. President, if we are really serious about addressing the problem \nof intergovernmental mandates, we should take steps to assure that the \nCongress does not shift the obligation of balancing the budget to the \nStates by asking them to control the costs of entitlements--something \nwe have been woefully unable to do.\n\n\n                           striking a balance\n\n  It is clear that the Federal Government should not and cannot impose \ncostly new requirements on States and localities without considering \nhow they will pay for those costs. It is also clear that we must \ndevelop a better balance between competing Federal responsibilities, \nand carefully review our budget priorities.\n  But in the long run, the solution to the unfunded mandates problem \ndepends on better communication between all levels of government. We \nneed to work together to set priorities and make sure that taxpayer \ndollars are being used efficiently.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  Mr. President, I commend the managers of this bill for their hard \nwork and genuine desire to assist our States and localities. This bill \nis a reflection of their commitment and a positive step forward.\n  Soon, my colleagues and I will have another opportunity to test our \nresolve toward improving intergovernmental relations as we debate a \nbalanced budget amendment and make the tough budgetary decisions that \nfollow.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to strengthen \ncooperation and partnership between all levels of government.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, when I came to the Senate 2 years \nago, I was very surprised to discover that in Washington there was \nalmost no discussion of an issue of great concern to State and local \nofficials. That issue was the impact of mandates imposed by the Federal \nGovernment on State and local governments.\n  I asked several Federal agencies for information regarding the cost \nof mandates on State and local governments, and I found, quite simply, \nthat no one \n[[Page S1669]] I could find in the entire Federal establishment knew \ntheir impact. That was one of the reasons my very first bill filed in \nthe 103d Congress was legislation to require disclosure with regard to \nunfunded Federal mandates. That is why S. 1 has such bipartisan \nsupport, and why I am a strong supporter of S. 1--because it promises \nto curb the practice of imposing Federal mandates on State and local \ngovernments without advance, complete disclosure of the impact of those \nmandates.\n  S. 1 will greatly change the relationship between the Federal \nGovernment and State and local governments. And that is a good thing. \nCreating a mechanism that will help ensure that the voice of State and \nlocal governments is heard in Washington before legislation is enacted \nis both sound policy, and something that has long been needed.\n  S. 1 will also make Federal officials more accountable--and that, \ntoo, is a good thing. Asking the Federal Government to make its \ndecisions with good information--with the best information we can get \non the State and local governments that will have to live by those \ndecisions--should not be controversial. Rather, it is the way decisions \nshould always have been made, and the way decisions should always be \nmade in the future.\n  S. 1 requires the congressional committees to report on the costs and \nbenefits anticipated from any Federal mandates contained in the bills \nthey report to the Senate for action, including the effects of the \nmandate on health and safety, and the protection of the environment. \nThe report will also include information as to whether any mandates in \nthe reported bill are to be partly or entirely offset.\n  The Congressional Budget Office [CBO] would be required to estimate \nthe cost impact of the mandate on State and local governments, if it is \nlikely to exceed $50 million, before the legislation could be brought \nup on the Senate floor. CBO would also be required to estimate the cost \nimpact of a proposed Federal mandate on the private sector if it \nexceeds $200 million.\n  A point of order could be raised if the legislation would increase \nthe cost of the mandate on State and local governments by $50 million, \nunless spending to cover the increase is also authorized. Under the \nterms of S. 1, most mandates would only be effective during a fiscal \nyear if Congress appropriated the funds to meet the costs of those \nmandates. If appropriations were cut, then the mandates would also be \nreduced.\n  S. 1, however, does not put Congress in a straitjacket. It does not \nprevent a congressional majority from enacting unfunded mandates. The \npoints of order established by the bill can be waived by majority vote. \nWhat S. 1 really requires, therefore, is, as I have already said, for \nCongress to make its decisions with the information on the mandates in \nfront of it, and, if Congress decides not to provide funding to offset \nthe costs of a particular mandate, to make that decision clear and \nexplicit.\n  This legislation also ensures that the cost of mandates imposed \nduring the regulatory process would be evaluated. Federal agencies \nwould be required to estimate the anticipated costs to State and local \ngovernments of the rules they write to implement Federal legislation. \nFederal agencies will have to consult with elected representatives of \nState and local governments so that their concerns and suggestions are \ntaken into account in the writing of rules.\n  The case for the changes made in S. 1 is compelling. The issue of \nmandates is the No. 1 issue for Governors, for mayors, and for other \nlocal elected officials across this country. Over and over, State and \nlocal\n officials from around this Nation, including my own State of Illinois, \nhave told me and every member of Congress that unfunded mandates are \ntaking over their budgets, and undermining their ability to manage \ntheir own local problems.\n\n  Governor Edgar of Illinois wrote me supporting S. 1, stating that \nunfunded mandates have consumed an increasing share of State and local \nbudgets, and that they impose severe limitations on what can be \nachieved with Illinois resources. I have heard from numerous county \nboards in Illinois on this issue. Winnebago County sent me a resolution \nthat was adopted by the county board on September 30, 1993, opposing \nState and Federal unfunded mandates. The mayor of Chicago sent me a \ncopy of a report that was prepared called ``Putting Federalism To Work \nFor America,'' from November 1992, that analyzes the impact of Federal \nmandates on Chicago. I want to discuss a few concrete examples from \nthat report.\n  In order to comply with carbon monoxide standards, the city of \nChicago, recognizing that traffic jams contribute greatly to these \nemissions, established a plan to increase the efficiency of the traffic \nflow in the city. This involved designating some streets as one-way, \nposting no-parking zones, and enforcing these zones by towing. Even \nthough the city achieved compliance with the carbon monoxide standards, \nas proven repeatedly by heavy monitoring by Federal employees, the U.S. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency demanded documentation that every car \nparked in a tow zone was actually towed.\n  The city had taken the necessary steps to ensure compliance with the \ncarbon monoxide emissions standard more than 20 years ago, but in 1989 \nthe Federal Government was still questioning the number of tow trucks \non the streets of Chicago. This occurred despite the fact that Federal \nmonitoring of carbon monoxide emissions proved that Clean Air Act \nstandards were consistently met. At the same time that Federal workers \nwere monitoring towing in Chicago, the main threat to the Great Lakes \nwas the disposition of airborne toxins from as far away as Mexico, a \nproblem that should fall under the aegis of a Federal agency.\n  The Calumet Skyway toll bridge provides another example of a high \ncost, unfunded mandate. The bridge must be painted regularly. The last \ntime the bridge was painted in the late 1970's, the price tag was $10 \nmillion. The current cost has escalated to $40 million. The $30 million \naddition is attributable to the Clean Air Act which requires that no \nsand blasting be used where lead-based paint is involved. The technique \nspecified to strip the old paint cannot allow lead chips to enter the \nair. The paint removed must be cocooned and other safeguards applied, \nincluding disposal requirements. Public health specialists disagree on \nthe level of risk that would be imposed by less severe safeguards. They \ndo appear to agree that the primary risk is assumed by workers who \ncould be protected at a dramatically lower cost. Similar problems have \nquadrupled the cost of repainting the Loop elevated train structure in \ndowntown Chicago. The report asks whether that extra $30 million would \nhave been better spent on crime control initiatives. And more \nimportantly, it asks which level of government is in the best position \nto decide.\n  Mayor Daley has long been a leader in the effort to educate the \nFederal Government on the adverse impacts unfunded mandates have on his \nability, and the ability of other mayors and local officials, to \nconduct the people's business and be accountable to the taxpayers. In a \nletter to me dated January 11, 1995, Mayor Richard Daley of Chicago \nreiterated that unfunded Federal mandates cost the city of Chicago over \n$160 million in 1992, a figure that has only increased since then. His \nletter goes on to say that: ``Fundamentally, this issue is all about \ngiving local governments the flexibility to make the best use of local \nand federal dollars.'' That is hardly revolutionary, but is critically \nimportant to every level of government.\n  Mandates impact big cities and small communities very differently, \nyet rarely are regulations written to be sensitive to those \ndifferences. The problems faced by Chicago are different than those \nfaced by small Illinois\n communities, and not all problems can be solved with the same \nsolutions. We have passed a Federal mandate to require testing for lead \nin water. In 1976, the law was changed to prohibit lead-based soldering \nof water pipes. Before 1976, lead was used to solder pipes together. \nWhen inspectors recently performed the lead testing requirements, the \ncommunity learned that there were no traces of lead in the municipal \ndistribution facility. The lead was only found when tests were \ncompleted in private homes. The local government could not require \nprivate homeowners to change their water pipes. In fact, most experts \nagree that the real threat \n[[Page S1670]] to children from lead is from lead-based paint, and not \nwater. But the city was required to spend thousands of dollars to test \nfor lead in water. This was a tremendous expense to the local taxpayer, \nwith very marginal benefits. And it makes it that much harder for that \ncommunity to meet higher priority needs.\n  Regulations often do not account for the very real regional \ndifferences in this country. For example, part of the Federal clean \nwater reference standard is a clear flowing trout stream. Illinois has \nno trout streams--and no trout in any of its rivers. Illinois has thick \ntopsoil, and the water is full of rich silt. It is that rich soil that \nmakes Illinois part of this country's breadbasket. In Colorado, water \nruns down mountains, so the clear flowing trout stream standard may be \nappropriate. That standard just does not fit the reality in Illinois.\n  These environmental regulations are important. They save lives. But \nwe must develop regulations that are more sensitive to local variations \nand flexible enough to address the problems of communities of all \nsizes. I recognize that the Senate does not debate the implementing \nrules that are written after we pass laws. But these are very serious \nproblems that go right to the heart of why citizens do not feel that \nthe government is responding to their concerns.\n  S. 1 is a statement that the Federal Government has heard what our \nState and local elected officials have been telling us, and that the \nFederal Government is prepared to change the way it has been doing \nbusiness. It is a recognition of the fact that the Federal Government \nhas a responsibility to State and local governments in the mandates \narea, and that the Federal Government is now prepared to meet that \nresponsibility.\n  While I strongly support S. 1, I also think it is important to keep \nin mind that an unfunded mandate is not per se a bad thing. Not every \nFederal mandate is bad; many have achieved a substantial amount of good \nfor the American public. My support for S. 1, as it was reported by the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, therefore, is not a repudiation of the \nwhole idea of mandates. The mandates the Federal Government used to \nmake real progress in civil rights and our treatment of the disabled, \nfor example, were essential to our progress as a nation, and as a \npeople. I applaud the fact that S. 1 recognizes how essential those \nmandates were and are, and that under the terms of the bill, future \ncivil rights legislation which builds on this tradition will be exempt \nfrom S. 1.\n  Federal action is sometimes necessary. There are mandates which \nimprove the health and safety of all Americans. We have Federal \nmandates that prevent a factory from disposing hazardous waste in the \nregular sewer system. This protects the sewers from contamination, and \navoids the burden that local communities would have to shoulder to \nclean up the problem. Mandates can help prevent environmental \ndegradation at the front end, so that we do not have to pay for clean \nup, which is always more costly, after the damage has been done. \nFederal mandates have helped to ensure that the water is safe to drink \nall across this country, and that disabled children receive a proper \npublic education.\n  The reason we are here is not because mandates are wrong in \nprinciple. The real reason we are here is because of the budgetary \nshell game that was played in the 1980's. The 1980's were a time when \nmany domestic programs were slashed, with mandates pushing the \nresponsibilities onto hard-pressed State and local governments. I was \nin the Illinois House when President Reagan introduced the New \nFederalism. It was supposed to redefine the relationship among Federal, \nState and local governments. What it really did\n was to make large cuts in Federal taxes, and push off the \nresponsibilities of providing necessary services to State and local \ngovernments--without sending the money. The net result of that exercise \nin fiscal subterfuge was an explosion of Federal debt from only about \n$1 trillion in 1980 to closing in on $5 trillion now.\n\n  S. 1 is designed to ensure that the kind of budget fraud we saw in \nthe 1980's won't be repeated in the 1990's, or in the next century. \nAddressing our budget problems requires tough decisions. In the 1980's, \nthere was a real attempt by the President to avoid making those tough \ndecisions, and to try to delude the American people into believing that \nwe could solve our budget problems on the cheap, without affecting the \nlives of the great majority of Americans. There was an attempt to avoid \nproviding any real leadership on our budget issues, and to avoid \ntelling the truth about our budget problems to the American people. \nThat was wrong then, it is wrong now, and we will be paying the price \nof those wrong decisions for decades to come. S. 1 cannot undo the \nmistakes made in the 1980's. What it can do, and what we must do, is \nensure that we don't repeat those mistakes, and that is another reason \nenactment of S. 1 is so important.\n  I believe that S. 1 will achieve a necessary balance. We need to \nbalance the benefit of mandates with their costs. We need to balance \nthe responsibilities of the Federal Government to ensure the safety of \nAmerican citizens with the rights of State and local governments to \nprioritize their budgets.\n  It is the responsibility of all levels of government--Federal, State, \nand local--to protect their citizens. Governors, mayors, and village \npresidents will feel the same pressure of public opinion to protect \nhealth and safety, as well as the environment, as we do at the Federal \nlevel. When this legislation becomes law, all levels of government will \nstill have to bear the costs to insure the safety and well being of the \nAmerican people. But we will stop the cost shifting from Federal to \nState and local governments that occurs because of a lack of \ninformation. Federal agencies will write better regulations with the \nbenefit of counsel from State and local officials. And Senators will \ncast informed votes.\n  We are all in this together, Mr. President. The Federal Government, \nState governments, and local governments, are all trying to meet their \nresponsibilities to the American people. What S. 1 does is very \nsimple--it ensures that the Federal Government does not attempt to meet \nits responsibilities with the tax dollars raised at the State and local \nlevels. S. 1 prohibits budgetary shell games, and by doing so, will \nhelp end confrontation between the various levels of government, and \npromote cooperating instead. And that, based on my experience at all \nthree levels of government, will not make it tougher for us to address \nthe problems the American people elected all of us to solve, it will \nmake it easier.\n  I want to conclude by congratulating my colleague from Idaho, Senator \nKempthorne, and my colleague from Ohio, Senator Glenn, for their \nleadership in crafting this legislation and bringing it to the floor so \npromptly in the new Congress. I share their view that this bill is \ncarefully balanced, and that it won't take much to upset that careful \nbalance that has so contributed to the broad, bipartisan support this \nbill enjoys.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues, therefore, to support S. 1, and to \nenact the kind of bill that will preserve the strong, bipartisan \ncoalition that has been the driving force behind the effort to address \nthe mandates problem. That, I believe, is what the American people \nexpect of us.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to insert the letters the \nGovernor Edgar and Mayor Daley, the resolution from the Winnebago \nCounty Board, as well as an editorial from the Chicago Tribune in \nsupport of this legislation, into the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                            State of Illinois,\n\n                                Springfield, IL, January 10, 1995.\n     Hon. Carol Moseley-Braun,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Moseley-Braun: I am writing to express my \n     sincere thanks to you for your support of S. 1, the \n     ``Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995.''\n       Unfunded mandates have consumed an increasing share of \n     state and local budgets, and impose severe limitations on \n     what can be achieve with our existing resources. It is \n     essential that Congress act now to reduce the burden of such \n     mandates, particularly in the context of current initiatives \n     to reduce the federal budget. The National Governors' \n     Association and other groups representing state and local \n     officials have made passage of a mandate relief bill their \n     major legislative priority over the past several years.\n       I am very pleased that you are an original cosponsor of the \n     mandate relief bill now under consideration. If I can be of \n     assistance \n     [[Page S1671]] to you as this important measure moves \n     forward, please let me know.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Jim Edgar,\n     Governor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                              City of Chicago,\n\n                                    Chicago, IL, January 11, 1995.\n     Hon. Carol Mosely-Braun,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Braun: I am writing to urge your support for \n     the Mandate Relief legislation about to be debated on the \n     floor of the House and Senate. I am pleased that the new \n     Congress has acted so quickly, with bipartisan support, to \n     move this legislation.\n       My support for effective mandates legislation goes back \n     several years. Along with countless other mayors, governors \n     and county officials, I have long tried to make clear to the \n     Congress and the Administration the adverse impacts unfunded \n     mandates have on our ability to conduct the people's business \n     and be accountable to our taxpayers. Chicago's 1992 study, \n     ``Putting Federalism to Work for America,'' one of the first \n     comprehensive studies of this issue, conservatively estimated \n     that mandates cost the city of Chicago over $160 million per \n     year--a figure that has only increased since then.\n       The legislation being considered in Congress will begin to \n     address problem by setting up a strong process to discourage \n     the enactment of new mandates, and to require that new \n     mandates be funded if they are to be enforced. I recognize \n     that it does not cover existing mandates, an issue which I \n     believe Congress also needs to address.\n       Fundamentally, this issue is all about giving local \n     governments the flexibility to make the best use of local and \n     federal dollars. The importance given the mandates issue \n     gives me hope that the new Congress--Democrats and \n     Republicans alike--will be paying close attention to the real \n     issues that face our communities and our citizens. Please \n     vote in favor of HR5/S1.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Richard M. Daley,\n     Mayor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n     Resolution of the County Board of the County of Winnebago, IL\n\n       Whereas, in November 1992, the citizens of the State of \n     Illinois approved an advisory referendum question opposing \n     unfunded state mandates; and\n       Whereas, units of local government can no longer afford to \n     implement state and federal mandates without adequate state \n     and federal funding mandates: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the County Board of Winnebago County to oppose \n     the enactment of all state and federal unfunded mandates.\n       Be It Further Resolved by the County Board of Winnebago \n     County that Winnebago County encourages the passage of Senate \n     Bill 993 and House Resolution 140 to free local governments \n     from obligations to carry out future federal mandates unless \n     federal funds are provided.\n       Be It Further Resolved that copies of the foregoing be sent \n     to the Senator Paul Simon, Senator Carol Moseley Braun, \n     Congressman Don Manzullo, Winnebago County Legislators, \n     County Board Chairman of DuPage, Kane, Cook, Lake, McHenry, \n     Will and St. Clair counties and the National Association of \n     Counties.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Chicago Tribune, Jan. 12, 1995]\n\n                       Unlocking the Mandate Trap\n       Not content to spend the federal government a few trillion \n     dollars into debt, Congress over the years has had a passion \n     for spending the money of state and municipal governments as \n     well. It does this by requiring the local folks to pay for \n     many programs and policies created in Washington.\n       These ``unfunded mandates'' have provoked a quiet \n     revolution in the past couple of years. About a dozen states, \n     including Illinois, have refused to comply with federal \n     ``motor-voter'' legislation, which requires them to expand \n     voter registration opportunities; California has sued to \n     block the federal government from enforcing it. Some state \n     leaders have threatened that, unless they get relief from \n     mandates, they will oppose a balanced-budget constitutional \n     amendment.\n       Their anger is understandable. The federal government gets \n     to be the good guy, imposing popular measures such as the \n     Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. The locals, in turn, \n     have to raise taxes to pay for enforcement and lose autonomy \n     in their spending decisions. The City of Chicago has \n     estimated that in one recent year it spent $70.8 million on \n     unfunded mandates, including $27 million in paperwork.\n       The Senate Thursday begins debate on a bill that would \n     require Congress to pay for any new mandate that imposes more \n     than $50 million in costs on local governments. If Congress \n     fails to do so, the mandate could be blocked by any member on \n     a point of order.\n       The bill provides quite a loophole: Congress could override \n     the point of order by a simple majority vote in each chamber. \n     It also includes exemptions for anti-discrimination statutes \n     and emergency assistance.\n       The bill faces assaults from the Right and the Left. Some \n     Republicans want a wholesale ban, or at least a requirement \n     of a three-fifths vote to override the point of order. Some \n     Democrats want to exempt labor, public health and public \n     safety laws.\n       The bill's impact will be limited. Requiring members to go \n     on record as supporting an unfunded mandate--in effect, \n     acknowledging they are passing on a tax hike to local \n     payers--is a worthwhile step. But it won't stop unfunded \n     mandates. Illinois lawmakers have often overridden their own \n     anti-mandates law, but rarely catch flak from voters.\n       This tack, however, recognizes that there are times when it \n     is appropriate for the federal government to set national \n     policy and expect localities to pay the cost. When that \n     happens, it will at least be clearer to voters who is \n     responsible.\n       The measure has the support of the National League of \n     Cities, the National Governors Association, and other \n     representatives of state and local governments. They see it \n     as a solid step toward easing their burden, and Congress \n     should see it that way, too.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for S. \n1, the unfunded mandates bill. I am a cosponsor of S. 1 because, \nalthough I recognize that mandates can serve important purposes, it is \ntime to ensure that we fully understand the consequences of unfunded \nmandates for States and localities.\n  Unfunded Federal mandates have caused a tremendous impact in the \ncommunities of North Dakota. For example, Safe Drinking Water Act \ntesting requirements cost some small North Dakota communities over $100 \nper year per household. Water rates in Grand Forks, ND, increased by \nover 30 percent from 1990 to 1993. Water rates in Langdon, ND, doubled \nin 1994. While the goal of the Safe Drinking Water Act is desirable, I \nbelieve that the legislation has to be flexible and that the Federal \nGovernment must be responsible while enacting unfunded duties upon \nsmall communities.\n  Mandates, including some unfunded mandates, have resulted in valuable \nand legitimate accomplishments. We benefit from a clean environment. We \napplaud school desegregation. We have made great progress toward \naddressing health and safety concerns. The Federal Government has also \nworked in partnership with local governments to achieve important \nobjectives. As the Washington Post reported on January 22, 1995, the \nFederal Government will provide $230 billion in grants to State and \nlocal governments this year. This partnership has worked in the past \nand it is my hope that it will continue to work in the future.\n  However, at times, this partnership has lost the notions of balance, \ncommon sense, and responsibility. As the Federal Government has tried \nto reduce spending and cut the deficit, responsibilities have been \npassed on to State and local governments, who are also struggling to \noperate their budgets in the black. For example, it is estimated that \nthe Safe Drinking Water Act will cost North Dakota communities almost \n$50 million per year in construction costs alone. Where will this money \ncome from? The Federal Government has not provided the answer--nor the \nfunds.\n  So, while we recognize that there are good mandates and difficult \nmandates, the question remains: Where do we find the balance? In short, \nhow do we restore common sense to the Federal legislative process: \nFirst, we must recognize that there are no ``one size fits all'' \nsolutions. The water policy or contaminant requirements that work for \nNew York City, population 10 million, do not make sense for Hazelton, \nND, population 240, or Underwood, ND, population 976.\n  In this regard, I am pleased that S. 1 provides for the analysis of \nrural communities' special needs in 3 separate areas; the CBO \nDirector's study of intergovernmental mandates; the CBO Director's \nstudy of private sector mandates; and an agency's\n analysis of a regulation. These provisions are found in section 103 \nand section 202 of S. 1.\n\n  Second, we must make sure that the Congress is making fully informed \nchoices when it considers mandates. That is what S. 1 does; it adds an \ninformative step in the consideration of legislation. This step simply \nprovides that the Congress will know the financial impact of the \nlegislation. The point of order mechanism in S. 1 will not prohibit the \nFederal Government from passing along a mandate, but it will ensure \nthat Congress has an idea of what the legislation may cost State and \nlocal governments before the laws are passed. We will exercise our \nlegislative duties with informed responsibility.\n  While I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill, I am also pleased \nthat my colleagues are taking the time to offer amendments to ensure \nthat it will \n[[Page S1672]] work in practice. S. 1 would affect every piece of \nlegislation considered after January 1, 1996. We should therefore work \ntogether in a bipartisan fashion to assure that the new process works \nsmoothly and has no unintended consequences. The new point of order \nprocess, as outlined in S. 1, should be open to suggestions for \nimprovement. That is what the legislative process is all about.\n  Partisan accusations that Democrats are stalling or obstructing \npassage of S. 1 are without merit. This important piece of legislation \nwent through introduction, hearings, and markup in 4 legislative days, \ncame to the floor without a report, and meaningful amendments are \nimmediately faced with a motion to table. While we must be responsive \nto States and localities, we must remember that we represent \nindividuals. We owe it to the people of this country to pass the best \npossible legislation, and, like it or not, quality takes careful \ndeliberation. For example, a sunset provision should be considered not \nas an effort to weaken the bill; but rather as a responsibility to \nimprove the bill as it proves necessary over time.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, this legislation represents a new sense \nof responsibility in Washington. November 8 was not about giving a \nmandate to partisan politics; rather it was the manifestation of a hope \nthat the Federal Government will truly represent the people of the \ncountry, without regard to partisan politics as usual. Therefore, we \nmust be responsible to other levels of government and work on \nmaintaining a good working relationship among Federal, State, and local \ngovernments.\n  As water rates doubled in some small rural communities, North Dakota \nlocal governments faced the new mandates and struggled to budget \nresponsibility. S. 1 will ensure that we at the Federal level legislate \nwhich contains an unfunded mandate. I urge my colleagues to support S. \n1 and accept this responsibility.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, for 2 long weeks, the Senate has been \ndebating legislation to correct the problem of unfunded mandates--those \ncostly Federal regulations handed down to the State and local levels, \nwithout the necessary dollars to carry them out.\n  Because of these unfunded mandates, State and local governments are \noften forced to raise taxes, change their priorities, or even reduce \nservices to comply with regulations that may or may not benefit their \nconstituents. Taxpayers, as usual get stuck with the bill. And mayors \nand State officials who don't obey risk being sued by the Federal \nGovernment.\n  In his State of the Union Address Tuesday night, President Clinton \nacknowledged this serious problem and called on Congress to legislate \nsome relief. ``It's time for Congress to stop passing on to the States \nthe cost of decisions we make here in Washington,'' he insisted.\n  Under the legislation we're considering, Senators will be more \ninformed as to the cost of these mandates. Under this legislation, we \nwon't be so quick to pass one-size-fits-all mandates. We'll know the \nfinancial burden we're placing on the country, and our State, local, \nand tribal officials.\n  This is a great start, and I applaud Mr. Kempthorne and Mr. Glenn for \ntheir leadership on this issue.\n  But as of this morning, the debate over the Unfunded Mandates Relief \nAct of 1995 has droned on for weeks.\n  Mr. President, what is the delay? President Clinton supports this \nbill. Nearly two-thirds of my colleagues in the Senate support this \nbill. The House passed its own version long ago. Our version will pass, \ntoo, and the vote won't even be close. So if there's little opposition \nto the bill and the principles behind it, what do I tell my \nconstituents when they ask why we're not moving forward. * * * why \nwe're not moving past unfunded mandates and on to the other crucial \nissues piling up ahead of us?\n  Mr. President, how can I explain this delay to Mayor Don Chmiel of \nChanhassen, MN, who tells me that his city desperately needs relief \nfrom costly stormwater mandates triggered last October?\n  Mr. President, what excuse for the holdup can I give Mike Opat, a \nmember of the board of commissioners in Hennepin County, MN? He tells \nme that if relief from unfunded mandates doesn't come soon, the most \npopulated county in my State will not be able to provide needed \nservices such as education, jails, health care, and social services for \nchildren and the elderly.\n  Mr. President, what do I tell Jim Kordiak, a commissioner in my home \ncounty of Anoka? He wrote to tell me, quote:\n\n       While each of us can think of hundreds of new programs that \n     we feel might be of benefit to the community, I believe it is \n     imperative that we restrain ourselves from the mandatory \n     implementation of such services and, instead, return as much \n     control as possible to local jurisdictions.\n\n  Mayor Norm Coleman of St. Paul sent me 10 pages of notes on the \nmandates his city is compelled to carry out--so many mandates, in fact, \nthat the city can't put a pricetag on the costs to its residents. How \ndo I explain our delay to Mayor Coleman?\n  Finally, Mr. President, what would you have me tell Martin Kirsch, \nthe mayor of Richfield, MN, who wrote asking for my help in turning the \nunfunded mandates bill into reality?\n  My colleagues and I are ready to do just that--we've pledged our \nunconditional support to this bill and the people back home who want \ndesperately to see it passed. But we've been hogtied by the opposition \nof a few Senators who are doing everything in their power to delay the \ninevitable and keep this bill from a swift vote.\n  The Washington Post says that some of my colleagues are manipulating \nthe rules to slow this legislation down. But let me suggest, Mr. \nPresident, that the American people are being manipulated along with \nthe rules. They sent us here to change Government. They sent us here to \npass good legislation like the Unfunded Mandates Relief Act. And \nthey'll be furious when they find out we've been passing little else \nbut time.\n  Senators do have the right to assert their positions on the floor. \nI'm not opposed to that. Having come from a body that restricted the \nrights of the minority and individual members for 40 years, I \nunderstand the need for free and open debate.\n  What I oppose is the cynical attitude of those who would use the \nrules of the Senate to derail good bills.\n  Congress is a great institution, but in the minds of the American \npeople, it is growing smaller in stature and larger in contempt every \nday. We have an opportunity and a responsibility to correct this image \nand provide a Government of which every American can be proud.\n  Mr. President, I'd like to be able to go back home to Minnesota this \nweekend and tell Don Chmiel, Mike Opat, Jim Kordiak, Norm Coleman, and \nMartin Kirsch that the Senate heard their pleas for relief and passed \nthe unfunded mandates bill. Let's stop these needless delays. Let's \nwork together. Let's put this debate behind us, and start moving \nforward.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate began debate on unfunded \nmandates with the premise that the Federal Government should not \nindiscriminately force State and local governments to implement Federal \nstatutes.\n  With this premise, S. 1 goes to the heart of the way Government works \nin the United States. It seeks to change the balance between the \nFederal and State governments. I happen to agree with the premise and \nwelcome a discussion about the balance of Government.\n  I agree that the distant reach of Federal Government should not tell \nStates how to take care of the special needs of their communities. I \nhave been working for months to get the Federal Government to condone a \ndairy compact that several New England States have chosen for \nthemselves.\n  I also agree that local problems are best solved by local solutions. \nAgain in Vermont, we worked to find flexibility in Federal statutes to \ndeal with a superfund site, inspection and maintenance standards for \nClean Air Act provisions, and other Federal laws.\n  I believe it is not fair for Congress to make the rules and force \nstate legislatures to levy the taxes to pay for them.\n  For these reasons, I supported the attempt to pass S. 993, the \nCommunity Regulatory Relief Act of 1994, by unanimous consent last \nOctober. I thought it was a fairly balanced bill that addressed these \nissues. S. 993 had a sunset provision and established a reasonable \nprocess for controlling unfunded mandates.\n   [[Page S1673]] Unfortunately, in addressing these issues and others, \nS. 1 leaves out a sunset provision and exposes Vermont to a host of new \nproblems. While the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act returns some control to \nthe State of Vermont, it also forces Vermont to abdicate some control \nto politicians in distant states that Vermonters do not elect.\n  It is difficult to speculate how this will affect prospective issues \nin the coming decades, but consider the implications if S. 1 had been \nlaw since the 1970s.\n  Vermont is downwind of one of the most industrially developed regions \nin our country. As I mentioned, I recognize that the cities of Chicago, \nDetroit, and Cleveland or the States of Illinois, Michigan, and Ohio \nshould have the discretion to address air pollution for their \nresidents. I do not believe that the mayors and governors of these \ngovernments have the discretion to send unlimited air pollution to \nVermont.\n  If the elected officials of the Great Lake States had decided that \ncontrolling air pollution is not a priority, and the Clean Air Act had \nbeen scaled back or voided as it could be under S. 1, would that mean \nthat Vermont is forced--automatically and without question--to bear the \neconomic burdens of smog, acid rain and toxic pollutants?\n  These are not insignificant economic burdens. Acid rain in the \nNortheast has forced States to airdrop lime in lakes to restore the pH \nlevel. Air pollution was the target of years of research to determine \nthe effects of acid deposition on forest health. Airborne pollutants \nhave been demonstrated to stunt fish growth and alter riparian \necosystems. Many of these are direct costs to agencies, and ultimately \nto taxpayers, in Vermont.\n  Vermont would be hurt most by indirect costs. Without an enforceable \nFederal air pollution standard, would 8 million people still visit \nVermont each year and contribute to our tourism economy? We cannot \nafford to subordinate our economic interests to the economic interests \nof another State.\n  Without an enforceable Federal air pollution standard, would the \nforests that cover three-quarters of my State support a healthy, \nsustainable forest products industry? The New York Times reported this \nsummer that air pollution had tripled forest mortality in the east.\n  Would the sport fisheries draw anglers from the 70 million people who \nlive within a day's drive of Vermont? Today, most of Vermont's fish can \nbe eaten by humans without posing a health risk. Without a Federal \nmandate, we may not have this luxury.\n  How would acid rain affect the crops of Vermont farmers? This is a \nquestion that scientists can offer only speculation.\n  It seems to me that if there had been legislation prohibiting \nunfunded mandates when Congress addressed the Clean Air Act, Vermont \nwould have had to assume responsibility for unfunded problems. It is a \ndisturbing irony.\n  Consider another example. Vermont shares more than 200 miles of Lake \nChamplain shoreline with the State of New York. I recognize that the \nGovernor and State legislature should have the flexibility to decide \nsewage effluence guidelines for their towns and municipalities in the \nState of New York. But New York does not have the right to pollute \nVermont and the lake that forms our common border.\n  While I am concerned about Vermont, I should think other States would \nhave concerns themselves. If Vermont filled in all the wetlands in the \nConnecticut River Basin, is Springfield, Hartford, and New Haven \nprepared to deal with floods? New York could pollute its backyard on \nLake Champlain while Vermont pollutes its front yard in Long Island \nSound--more than 70 percent of the fresh water in the sound comes from \nthe Connecticut River. Does New Jersey worry about having New York's \nmunicipal hospital waste on their beaches? Do Chesapeake Bay States \nworry about how Pennsylvania affects their fisheries and recreation \nresource? Is anyone in Louisiana and Mississippi concerned about \nputting their States at the end of our Nation's potentially biggest \nsewer line? These two States could be affected by the whims of 20 \nupstream States.\n  We can let States choose their destiny only to the extent that it is \ntheir own. A State does not have the right to harm another State. To me \nthis bill implies that States retain their right to pollute their \nneighbors.\n  States also have to assume responsibility for their own action. If a \nState chooses not to abide by toxic waste disposal, I will have a hard \ntime voting to spend millions for an EPA cleanup. If the State refuses \nto implement a certain standard of environmental health, I will have a \nhard time watching extra Medicaid and Medicare dollars go to an \nunhealthy population in some other State.\n  I raise these few examples only to illustrate my point: This bill has \nimplications that will hurt the State of Vermont, the people of \nVermont, and businesses in Vermont. While I support the premise for \nthis legislation, I do not support the proposed answer to the problem. \nA better bill exists that protects the rights of each of the 50 States.\n  I want to vote for a bill that restores a balance to the Federal and \nState governments, but ultimately I need to protect Vermont's interests \nfrom the competing interests of other States. This allows one State to \nharm another State. I cannot support that kind of measure.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, in the course of deliberations on this \nlegislation which are now in their third week, some question has arisen \nregarding the application of title IV to the provisions of title I. As \nthe chairman of the committee that reported S. 1, I wish to make clear \nto my colleagues how these two titles relate.\n  Title IV deals with the subject of judicial review. Many have \nsummarized its provisions simply as no judicial review. But I would \nlike to draw attention to the exact language of the provisions, \nparticularly to the reference in section 401 that does limit judicial \nreview over certain issues arising under ``this Act.'' That reference \nto ``this Act'' means only ``this Act'' and not the subsequent \nlegislation that may be processed under the procedures established in \ntitle I.\n  Yesterday, we adopted the Byrd amendment to title I, which makes \nreference to mandates becoming ineffective in certain circumstances. \nSome may be concerned that because of title IV there will never be a \nfinal or objective adjudication of the question of whether a mandate is \neffective or not.\n  That concern arises out of a misunderstanding of title I and title \nIV. Under title I we establish a process for Senate consideration of \nmandates legislation. So all that title I is is a process. Normally, \nSenate process does not give rise to judicial review. Title IV merely \ncodifies that history in this context. It refers only to S. 1--``this \nAct''--and not to legislation that will be processed under the \nprocedures in S. 1.\n  Under S. 1, subsequent mandates legislation will provide for funding \nlevels, how certain contingencies are to be addressed, which agency is \ndesignated as the responsible agency for determining whether funding of \nthe direct costs of the mandate is adequate, and so on. Agency action \nunder that subsequent legislation may be subject to judicial review \nsince only S. 1 is, under title IV, not subject to judicial review. If \nan agency wrongly determines that a mandate is effective or \nineffective, title IV of S. 1 does not preclude judicial review.\n  I hope that this clarifies the application of title IV to this \nlegislation and to subsequent mandates legislation.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the issue of \nunfunded mandates, and S. 1. In doing so, I would like to briefly \ndiscuss the origins of this issue, how I believe this issue should be \naddressed, and how the bill before us addresses this issue.\n\n\n                          origin of the issue\n\n  I first started to hear about this issue shortly after I arrived in \nthe Senate. Coincidentally, at about the same time the Reagan \nadministration was engaged in promoting the New Federalism, which was \nintended to empower States and localities to assume more control of \ndomestic issues. In reality, the effect of this move was, in too many \ncases, to simply shift the problems and responsibilities, without \nshifting resources that would have really allowed the States and \nlocalities to address the issues. This is illustrated by the fact that \nin 1980, total grants to State and local governments \n[[Page S1674]] from the Federal Government were $127.6 billion in \nconstant 1987 dollars, and by 1990 the figure had dropped to $119.6 \nbillion, again in 1987 dollars. We ensured we would not be able to \nprovide those resources with the changes in law recommended by the \nReagan administration that led to 12 years of spiraling budget \ndeficits. For over a decade, then, the Federal Government engaged in \nthe practice of passing legislation, often in pursuit of worthy goals, \nthat added to fiscal burden facing State, local and tribal governments.\n\n\n                   how this issue should be addressed\n\n  Clearly, States and localities have a legitimate concern about \nunfunded mandates. I have spoken to too many States and local officials \nto believe otherwise. In talking to these officials, I have come away \nwith the feeling that these officials are often not opposed to the \nunderlying aim of a Federal mandate, they are instead concerned about \nhow they will pay for it, or comply with regulations to achieve the \naim. For example, I have met very few officials who think that the \ndisabled should not have access to public buildings and transportation. \nI have, however, met many who have said that given all the cutbacks \nthey have faced over the last decade, they honestly wonder how they can \ncomply with requirements to grant that access. I have also spoken to \nmany officials opposed to overly complicated regulations implementing \nmandates. In short, they do not want us to stop addressing problems, \nthey instead want us to approach problems with a full understanding of \nhow our actions will affect other levels of government, and wherever \npossible, to provide a means to help pay for those effects. They also \nwant us to cut the redtape that too often subsumes the actual issue we \nare trying to address.\n  We should be aware of what we are asking of State and local \ngovernments. I am all for getting cost estimates of the effects of \nlegislation on other levels of government. We should also actively \nsolicit the participation of other levels of government in the \ndevelopment of legislation and regulations that may affect them. I \nfirmly believe that we should take all steps possible to ensure that we \nmeet our goals with a minimum of regulatory and bureaucratic redtape, \nespecially at the State, tribal, and local levels. We should seek, \nwherever possible, to identify funding sources for new mandates. We \nmust, however, also maintain the ability to confront pressing issues \nwith national implications.\n\n\n                     how s. 1 addresses this issue\n\n  I believe that the bill before us does address some of the aspects of \nthe problem of unfunded mandates correctly. It requires that we have \ninformation on the costs of unfunded mandates wherever possible on \nreported bills, for example. I am also encouraged by the provision \nestablishing pilot programs to reduce the burden of mandates on smaller \nlevels of government, and provisions to increase the participation of \nother levels of government in the development of policy that will \naffect them.\n  I am concerned, however, that the provisions prohibiting the \nconsideration of legislation without means of payment for mandates to \nState and local levels of government will have the effect of reducing \nour authority and ability to take action on issues of national public \nconcern.\n\n\n                               amendments\n\n  For that reason, I offered two amendments that I thought would \nimprove the bill with respect to this problem. One would have allowed a \nreporting committee to make a determination that the reported provision \nmet a compelling national interest furthering the public health, \nsafety, or welfare. In this case, while a report on costs would be \nprepared, lack of a funding mechanism would not have prevented the \nmeasure from being debated by the full Senate. I offered a similar \namendment that would have required cost reports, but would have ensured \nthat legislation relating to radioactive waste could also always be \nheard. Likewise, I supported similar amendments from my colleagues that \nsought to ensure that procedural hurdles would not prevent the Senate \nfrom fulfilling its responsibilities to meet pressing national needs.\n  I offered a third amendment which sought to ensure that the Senate \nmaintained its authority over independent regulatory agencies by \nstating that no funding point of order would work against a provision \nthat could probably be considered as a rule by the agencies exempt from \nthe regulatory title of S. 1.\n  Unfortunately, my amendments, and many other amendments which would \nhave improved this bill, were defeated in largely partisan votes. In \nreviewing these amendments, many of which would have\n corrected substantial procedural difficulties, such as the costing out \nof amendments offered on the floor, it has become apparent to me that \nsome of my colleagues seem to be as interested in passing a potentially \nflawed measure quickly as they are in carefully drafting a proposal \nthat will address the unfunded mandates issue in a way that best \npromotes the national welfare, and the welfare of the working people \nwho ultimately are affected by the policies passed and implemented by \nall levels of government.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  In short, Mr. President, the bill before us in many ways sidesteps \nthe issue of forcing Congress to act responsibly in balancing pressing \nnational needs and costs to other governments. It does so by saying we \nshall, in too many cases, simply not consider pressing needs, unless we \ncan pay the full costs incurred of all levels of government.\n  Nevertheless, I feel compelled to support this legislation because, \nas flawed as it is, it does provide a means for the Senate to better \nconsider the costs imposed on others in legislation, and a means to \nimprove the process through which regulations are made. I know that \nultimately, it is these issues with which the State, local, and tribal \ngovernments in New Mexico are concerned. On careful review, I believe \nthat the need to address those issues outweighs my concerns about the \nprocedural chaos created by this legislation. I also take some comfort \nin the knowledge that we can revisit the issue and amend the bill where \nit proves to be unworkable.\n  I must say, however, that, when we are presented with a conference \nreport on this legislation, I will also carefully review that report, \nand any and all changes made from the legislation we are passing today. \nIf I determine that the conference report is even more flawed than the \nversion passed today, I may vote against that conference report.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, local elected officials in my home State \nof Washington have discussed the cost of Federal laws with me since I \ncame to the U.S. Senate. I understand their concerns; I served in my \nState legislature, and know it can be costly to comply with some \nFederal laws.\n  For that reason, I cast my vote for this legislation.\n  But, Mr. President, as you and all our colleagues know, I have some \nserious concerns about this bill. I think, it some senses, it might go \ntoo far. Some Senators might wrongly assume that passage of this bill \nmeans that they have free rein to gut environmental and labor laws, or \nhealth and safety regulations. That is not what the people of my State \nwant. They just want us to be honest in budgeting. They want us to \nconsider the cost of regulations and mandates we consider. They want us \nto use common sense in legislating. That means clean water, safe \nstreets and neighborhoods--the benefits of Federal mandates.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I will work within the new constraints of \nthis legislation to ensure that America's environment, health, safety, \nand labor laws enjoy the highest standards in the world. The passage of \nthis bill just makes me more determined than ever to fight for the \nwell-being of future generations.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on the second \npart of the so-called Contract With America, a bill to require Congress \nto consider the financial impact on States and localities of new \nFederal legislation.\n  Let me be briefly clear: I believe that it is both necessary and \nappropriate for Congress to enact some type of unfunded mandates \nconstraints. I have served in local government and I understand the \nproblem.\n  I supported last year's unfunded mandates bill, S. 993, as did almost \nevery other Senator, all of the Nation's Governors, mayors, and other \nState \n[[Page S1675]] and local officials, as well as the President of the \nUnited States. That is why I voted for S. 993 today. That bill is a \nfine bill--a bill that would work.\n  If the Senate had not been tangled up in partisan squabbling at the \nend of the 103d Congress, unfunded mandates restraints would have now \nbeen the law of the land. I deeply regret that S. 993 was not enacted. \nAnd today it was actually voted down.\n  S. 1 has many problems which I and others have tried to resolve. This \nbill creates a potential for endless delay, gives enormous power to \nunelected bureaucrats, contains troubling ambiguities that will mar its \nimplementation, and utterly fails to address the biggest unfunded \nmandate of them all, illegal immigration.\n  But because I believe in the need to pass unfunded mandates \nconstraints, I offered several amendments to S. 1 to make it a better \nbill.\n  First, I offered an amendment to ensure that the procedures the bill \ncontains would not impede the ability of Congress to respond to the \nhealth and safety needs of society's most vulnerable citizens--most \nparticularly, our young children, our pregnant women, and our frail \nelderly. My amendment was defeated on an almost straight party line \nvote by 44-55.\n  Second, I offered an amendment to exempt any legislation intended to \nprohibit, deter, study, or otherwise mitigate child pornography, child \nabuse, or child labor laws. The vote, again on an almost straight party \nline, was 46-53.\n  If just a few more Republican Senators had supported these limited \nexceptions, I believe we would have had a bill that met the need to \nconstrain unreasonable Federal mandates without endangering the health \nand safety of our Nation's youngest and oldest citizens.\n  In addition, the Senate rejected my amendment to reimburse the states \nfor the costs they incur because of illegal immigration. Thankfully, \nSenator Bob Graham's amendment to hold the line on existing programs to \nstop illegal immigration was approved. But frankly, we need to ensure \nthat we'll do much more than just hold the line, and S. 1 fails to do \none thing to ease this tremendous burden on my State.\n  My State of California simply cannot continue to expend huge sums \nwithout getting reimbursed by the Federal Government, due to the \nFederal Government's failure to enforce the border. Ignoring \nreimbursement to the States is a major failure of S. 1.\n  The problem of unfunded mandates is too serious to ignore. We should \ncreate a process to ensure that we take a careful look at the burdens \nwe place on other levels of government and the private sector, and to \nmake our decisionmaking more deliberate and accountable. S. 993 was \nthat bill.\n  But S. 1 invites failure. It creates a process that can be used to \ntie this Senate in knots, to block legislation needed to protect the \nhealth of our most vulnerable people, to undermine our ability to \nrespond when our children are being abused and exploited. I cannot \nsupport such a bill.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, last year I cosponsored the \nKempthorne-Glenn legislation, S. 993, to deal with the unfunded \nmandates problem. Today, I will vote against the pending legislation, \nS. 1, but I want to reiterate my support for the sensible, workable \nproposal offered by Senator Levin. Had it been adopted, the Levin \nsubstitute would have forced the Congress to review any imposition of \nnew, unfunded costs on the States and localities, but would not have \ntied us up in a procedural nightmare when we needed to address \nimportant national interests.\n  Last year's bill was built on a bipartisan consensus. It was rooted \nin the realization that the Federal Government had mistreated States in \ntwo fundamental ways. First, the Federal Government had, too causally \nand too often, imposed mandates without thorough consideration of the \nfinancial burdens State and local governments already face. And, \nsecond, the Federal Government had too frequently told the States what \nto do without giving them the resources and the flexibility to do it.\n  No one denies that problems resulted. No one denies that solutions \nneed to be found.\n  But if I were to characterize last year's bill, I would say it was \ndesigned to sensitize us to the problem. To require us to think \ncarefully and critically about what kind of burdens we were imposing \nbefore we imposed them. Under the terms of last year's bill, we would \nknow how much of burden we were creating. We would have to acknowledge \nthe magnitude of the burden before we passed legislation. We would no \nlonger be able to hide behind ignorance. We would have to acknowledge \nthe consequences of our decisions on our own States and our own \nconstituents.\n  If, on the other hand, I were to characterize this year's bill, I \nwould say it was designed to paralyze us, to prevent us from requiring \nStates to do anything unless we fully paid them to do it.\n  That, I suspect, is not how the proponents of the legislation would \ncharacterize it. They would point out that the bill allows us to impose \nunfunded mandates if, by a majority vote, we choose to do so. But, Mr. \nPresident, I believe that even the proponents would agree that the bill \nenshrines the principle and the presumption that the Federal Government \nshould not impose requirements on the States unless it pays them to \ncarry out the mandate.\n  I believe, Mr. President, that the legislative history of this bill \ndemonstrates that point. Several amendments were offered to exempt some \nclass or group of activities from the strictures of this legislation. \nTime after time those amendments were defeated. And the justification \nfor that was, in essence, that we ought to protect the principle that \nthere would be no unfunded mandates. While the Senate might, on a case-\nby-case basis, waive that principle, the presumption is that it ought \nto be protected.\n  Mr. President, on a philosophic level, I do not agree. And on a \npractical level, I do not believe the bill we are passing is workable. \nLet me explain.\n  While I believe we need to be sensitive to the burdens the Federal \nGovernment imposes on States, I also believe the Federal Government \ncan--and in some cases should--impose those burdens. The odds ought not \nbe stacked against a Federal mandate by the legislative roadblocks \ncontained in this bill.\n  Philosophically, the Federal Government has a fundamental \nresponsibility to set the tone and framework for our national life, to \nset minimum standards to protect the health and safety of our people, \nto protect our national security and welfare, and to deal with issues \nthat are interstate in nature and can't be effectively tackled by the \nStates.\n  Periodically, as a people, we have sought to limit national power. \nBefore the Civil War, John C. Calhoun advanced the notion of \nnullification, allowing States to ignore Federal laws they didn't agree \nwith. And just a few decades ago, southerners called for increased \nStates rights in the face of Federal civil rights legislation.\n  We rejected those ideas because ours is a Federal system of \ngovernment. And in that system, the Federal Government has certain \nobligations.\n  When States suffer from a disaster, they turn to the Federal \nGovernment for help. When California was plagued by floods and \nearthquakes and fires, they turned to Washington to help them clean up. \nAnd when our shore was ravaged by nor'easters, New Jersey also sought \nsimilar assistance.\n  But the Federal Government's role is not just limited to acts of God. \nWe must also respond to acts of indifference.\n  The Federal Government should act when local and State governments \ndon't want to spend the money to prevent pollution or to immunize \nchildren. We should be there to stop gun-running across State lines or \nthe spread of HIV-contaminated blood. We have a role in fighting the \nflood of illegal immigrants across our borders or the flow of people \nacross State lines as a result of ``benefit shopping.''\n  I am proud to say that New Jersey, my home State, is relatively \naffluent. It is also compassionate and progressive. We have some of the \ntoughest environmental laws in the country. We care for our disabled. \nWe have tough gun control laws and occupational safety regulations. But \nthose strengths could disadvantage us if Federal standards are weakened \nor eliminated.\n  Let's take a few examples.\n  In the late 1980's, we had to close our beaches when raw sewage and \nmedical \n[[Page S1676]] waste washed up on our shores. It cost us millions of \ndollars and was a major setback to our State's economy, image, and \nquality of life. But it was a problem we could not solve alone. The \nFederal Government had to step in and require New York to treat its \nwastes, to regulate disposal\n of medical wastes, and to cover its garbage barges. Mayor Koch still \ncomplains to me about this unfunded mandate. But that mandate helped us \nmanage a crisis. And the standards imposed on New York were necessary.\n\n  Federal standards do more than help us correct problems. They help \nprevent them. Let me give you an example: Many people in New Jersey say \nthat biggest fear is gun violence. But without the Brady bill--an \nunfunded mandate that requires background checks by local police when \npurchasing a gun--we really could not stop the gun violence from coming \ninto New Jersey. That happened right before the Brady bill went into \neffect, when a former New Jersey resident bought a gun in Arizona, \nbypassing a background check that would have been required in our \nState, and shot four people at close range, in cold blood, at a motel \nin Saddle Brook. We need the Brady bill.\n  Our first try at a constitution, the Articles of Confederation, had \nto be scrapped after a few years because they put too much power in the \nStates and they encouraged disunity and divisiveness.\n  States, by their very nature, are insular. Their goal is to take care \nof their own. But we are one nation, and in the words of Alexander \nHamilton, ``a nation without a national government is an awful \nspectacle.''\n  We need to approach national problems with national solutions. We \nneed to establish Federal policies to tackle issues with interstate \neffects. And we need to promote a national government motivated by a \nconcern for decency, equity, and compassion.\n  That is why the Federal Government has set standards to prevent \nStates from cutting off food stamps to children or eliminating aid to \nlegal immigrants. As a nation, we agree that we need to reform welfare; \nas a U.S. Senator, I am not prepared to allow States to abolish it.\n  Philosophically, then, I am troubled by this bill.\n  Practically, I am appalled by it.\n  Despite significant improvements made in the mechanics of the bill by \nSenator Levin and others, it still presents us with a legislative maze.\n  It imposes an unacceptable burden on the Congressional Budget Office, \nwhich is tasked with the responsibility of providing us with cost \nestimates on literally hundreds of bills and amendments--a task which, \nin some cases, will be impossible.\n  It creates at least two points of order which can be raised against \nany bill or amendment and will, in some cases, prevent the Senate from \ndealing efficiently with what should be routine matters. Despite the \nfact that the American people have told us that they have had quite \nenough of delay and procedural ploys and gridlock, this bill will give \nany individual Senator an opportunity to impede progress on any \nlegislation. The Senate will, I am convinced, rue the day that it \ncreated the procedure contained in this bill.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the bipartisan work we did last year \nshould have been ratified this year. Instead, blown by changing \npolitical winds, some Members decided we should go further than they \nhad last year. The net result is a bill which superficially claims to \nbe similar to last year's effort but is, in reality, a mandate for \ngridlock and an expression of unfounded fear of a federal system of \ngovernment. It is also, unfortunately, a bill that I cannot support.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I believe that for too long we in this body \nhave taken a paternalistic attitude toward our colleagues in State and \nlocal governments, by telling them that we know best how they ought to \nconduct their business. We have been too willing to require State and \nlocal governments to address a problem, without giving them the \nfinancial assistance necessary to carry out that mandate. We forget \nthat, if we pass the buck to State and local governments to fix these \nproblems, we should also be willing to pass the bucks to pay for it, or \nbe explicit that we are not doing so.\n  It is for that reason that I support this bill and intend to vote for \nfinal passage.\n  I appreciate the frustration of State and local officials as they \nhave watched Federal funding to counties decline dramatically in the \nlast decade, just as they have experienced a sharp rise in the demands \nthe Federal Government has placed on them to fund Federal regulations \nand programs.\n  Let's face it, the Reagan-Bush policies which shifted more \nresponsibility to State and local governments often did not include the \nnecessary funds to pay for these programs. I have seen one estimate \nthat funding to local governments under the Reagan administration \ndeclined by 50 percent. When you combine this shift with the erosion of \nthe local tax revenue base caused by the recession of the early 1990's \nit is no surprise that State and local leaders are throwing up their \nhands in despair.\n  However, having said that, I agree with many of the comments made by \nmy colleagues in the past week and a half regarding the complex nature \nof this bill, and the potential unintended consequences that might \narise under this legislation.\n  That is why I offered an amendment, which was adopted, to ensure that \nwe have not created a disincentive for States and local governments to \ntake action. We must not stifle innovation at the State and local level \nby suggesting that those who wait for Congress to act will be rewarded \nwith Federal funds. We\n must work to ensure that this legislation does not penalize those \nStates and local governments that are working to solve their own \nproblems. This legislation was not intended to create gridlock at the \nState and local level.\n\n  That is also why I supported a sunset amendment. We will need to step \nback at some point down the road and determine if this process to make \nCongress explicit about the cost of mandates, and make us pay for them, \nhas tied our own hands too much.\n  Mandates are not necessarily a dirty word and we should all remember \nthat there are some good things that are in all our interests. The \nexclusions in the bill reflect some of these priorities: The \nconstitutional rights of individuals, laws and regulations that \nprohibit discrimination on the basis of race, religion, gender, \nnational origin, or handicapped, or disability status, emergency \nassistance at the request of States and local governments, and \nlegislation necessary for our national security. There are other \npriorities which I wish had been included in the exemptions in this \nbill, such as legislation relating to class A human carcinogens, \nlegislation which would impact the well-being of pregnant women, young \nchildren and the frail elderly, and legislation relating to child \npornography, child labor laws, and child abuse.\n  Mr. President, I regret that these amendments were not adopted and \nthat many other important clarifying amendments were tabled, often \nalong party lines.\n  I support this legislation because I believe we have an obligation to \nbe explicit about the mandates we are passing along to our States and \nlocal governments. Whether we decide to pay, for the mandate or not, we \nshould be honest about what these mandates will cost.\n  Because, Mr. President, we all know who really pays in the end, and \nthat's the taxpayer.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, we are about to finish work on S. 1, the \nunfunded mandates legislation. This has been a difficult process, and I \nregret to say that I cannot support the final product. In the final \nanalysis, I feel it will create a real obstacle to the kind of laws \nthat we need to protect my State and my constituents.\n  Earier, I offered an amendment to the bill that highlights the way \nall governments--Federal, State, and local--often pass on the costs of \nsupplying needed services and that we need to work together to reduce \nthe total bill paid by the taxpayer. I was pleased that this amendment \nwas adopted nearly unanimously.\n  In a nutshell, my point was: What difference does it make to a \ntaxpayer if we cut Federal taxes, or refuse to raise them to pay for \nneeded programs, and the taxpayers' State taxes increase? What \ndifference does it make to the taxpayer if State taxes decrease or stay \nthe same, when local taxes or property taxes increase in lock step? to \n[[Page S1677]] get control of the problem, we have to work together.\n  This bill's stated purpose is to slow a process that is becoming all \ntoo common. We face a deficit that we all decry. We are loath to raise \ntaxes or truly cut spending. Yet, we all see in our States problems, \nissues that require a Federal response. The result is: We pass a law, \nand we pass on the bill.\n  This cannot go on. It has to change. We have to take into account the \nfull cost--along with the benefits--of the laws we propose. And the \nlegislation before us attempts a response.\n  On the other hand, I represent my State of New Jersey. We know too \nwell why national programs are often needed. For years, another State \ndumped sewage off our shore that polluted our shoreline. Without a \nFederal law, and Federal water quality standards, how could we protect \nour own? Air currents likewise have no respect for State boundaries. \nWe're downwind of too many States that, frankly, aren't very concerned \nabout our problems with air quality and our status as the second worst \nregion in the country. It doesn't surprise me that the Governor of Ohio \nis strongly against Federal air quality regulations. But we in New \nJersey can not clean up for them, too. This legislation makes it far \ntoo easy to block the creation and implementation of Federal laws \nintended to protect a State like New Jersey.\n  We need a better accounting of the costs that are sometimes too slyly \npassed along. We need to give the Governors and mayors more funding and \nmore regulatory flexibility to reduce costs. But,\n we need national programs, from time to time, and we don't need new \nways for naysaying legislators or bureaucrats to keep us from \nprotecting our own.\n\n  Mr. President, eliminating or minimizing unfunded mandates is a \nlaudable goal. But it cannot provide a straitjacket for the Congress or \nbe the excuse for legislators to stop needed laws for the protection of \nthe public. This bill should drive a rational decision on public \nmandates. It does much more.\n  Last Congress, the Senate Government Affairs Committee reported an \nunfunded mandates bill that almost all of us would have supported. It \nwasn't as aggressive a bill as some would argue for. But that bill did \nrequire authorizing committees to recognize and acknowledge explicitly \nthe cost to State and local officials of regulatory mandates. It \nrepresented real progress, and was strongly endorsed by Governors and \nmayors around the country.\n  The Senate, however, has now complicated the issue immensely. Two \nweeks ago, we began the consideration of legislation that was \nsubstantially altered from the bill reported last Congress. Hearings on \nthe bill were simply perfunctory and many of my colleagues have come to \nthe floor with basic questions of how this bill will work in the \nfuture.\n  Let me illustrate some of my own concerns about this legislation by \ntalking about a specific piece of legislation, not a hypothetical, that \nI've introduced. It's a bill that I'm very proud of, that has strong \nbipartisan support, and is even implicitly part of the Contract With \nAmerica. The bill is, frankly, a collection of mandates on States. It \nis the Interstate Child Support Enforcement Act, which I introduced \nlast Congress as S. 689 and will reintroduce this year.\n  A single parent has lost her ability to support her children when an \nabsent parent moves out of State to evade court-ordered child support. \nThis bill would repair all the holes in the interstate system of child \nsupport, to make those absent parents take responsibility for their \nchildren. This is a new bill, and these are new mandates, so there is \nno question that this legislation would apply to it.\n  Child support enforcement exemplifies a certain type of Federal \nmandate on States: The mandate that smooths and improves relationships \namong States, to make an effective Federal system possible.\n  Some advocates for improving child support enforcement argue that \nStates don't do a good enough job of collecting, because $6 billion or \nso of court-ordered child support goes uncollected. They advocate \nreplacing the State-based system with a fully Federal system, a whole \nnew bureaucracy.\n  I would rather make the State-based system work. If States are \nrequired to give full faith and credit to child support orders from \nanother State, if they are required to use comparable support order \nforms, if they are required to withhold lottery winnings, for example, \nfrom deadbeat parents no matter where the children live, then the \nState-based system can work efficiently and cheaply. The mandate to \nCalifornia improves the program in New Jersey, and vice versa. The only \nalternative to this kind of mandate, which will be undercut by passage \nof this bill, is a new Federal bureaucracy.\n  I do not imagine that a new bureaucracy would ever be the option \npreferred by the manager of this bill.\n  Second, my colleagues have raised questions about whether it is \npractical to ask the Congressional Budget Office to estimate costs to \nStates and localities. In the case of child support enforcement, we \nhave already asked CBO to estimate the costs to States, and they have \nworked hard at the project. They have surveyed States, asking what they \nare already doing and asking them to estimate the cost of the new tasks \nthat the legislation would require. Not only do we not yet know the \nexact cost, but I doubt that we know for sure, after more than a year \nof research, whether the total cost of the mandates, offset by savings, \nwould even exceed $50 million, and thus fall under the purview of this \nbill.\n  CBO doesn't get these figures out of thin air, after all. We are \nunfortunately overly dependent on States' own estimates, sometimes \ntheir overestimates, of the costs, and we are also forced to depend on \noutside advocacy organizations or State bureaucrats, both of which may \nhave their own ideas about policy. The point has been made several \ntimes: Let's not treat this CBO analysis with a reverence that even the \nCBO would have to admit is undeserved.\n  Third, S.1 will track and complicate all legislation for years beyond \nwhen the authorizing committee acts. I'm sure many of the bill's \nsupporters look at this as a positive feature of the bill. But I join \nthe many Senators who have raised questions about the possibility of \nshifting legislative authority to regulators and bureaucrats, if \nauthorized funding--needed to offset the mandate costs--is not fully \nforthcoming from the appropriators.\n  The response to these concerns has generally followed one line. Under \nthe terms of S.1, the authorizing committee will lay out ``procedures \nunder which such agency shall implement less costly programmatic and \nfinancial responsibilities * * * to the extent the an Appropriation Act \ndoes not provide for the estimated direct costs of such mandate.'' In \nother words, we expect the authorizing committee to lay out which \nmandates become inoperative if the appropriators fail to provide 100 \npercent of the amount.\n  Mr. President, I'm sorry, but this just doesn't pass the straight \nface test. Do we really expect the authorizing committees to provide a \ncomplete or even partially complete roadmap to account for all of the \ninfinite possibilities open to future appropriators? The appropriators \nmight provide 10 percent of the money, then go to 30 percent, then back \nto 20 percent--do we really expect that guidance provided by the \nauthorizing committee will answer the issues raised? If this bill \nwasn't so important, we'd be laughing about this provision and its \nludicrous implications.\n  If we take this idea seriously, every authorizing committee will have \nto come up with a complex decision tree for every law. If the \nappropriations are 30 percent, it would say, then implement regulation \nX, but only partially implement regulation Y. If appropriations are 40 \npercent, enforce X and Y but not Z. If we cannot map this out, we're \nleaving it up to bureaucrats to decide which laws to enforce. And this \nis a simple case. One appropriation directly funds three mandates. What \nhappens in a more complex case, such as a block grant that States can \nuse as they choose to fund mandates or their own priorities?\n  I hope my colleagues will consider the implications of this question \nbefore they begin their parallel drive to convert categorical Federal \nprograms into block grants. Again, I will use child support as an \nexample. Federal funds help States collect child support from the \nabsent parents of children on \n[[Page S1678]] AFDC. For some activities, the Federal Government pays \n75 percent of the cost of the mandate; in other cases there is an \nenhanced match to provide an incentive by rewarding success. The \nformula is complex, but in no case does the Federal Government pay 100 \npercent which is appropriate because it is the responsibility of the \nState to enforce child support and minimize welfare costs.\n  I have seen reports that the latest Republican proposal on welfare \nreform will involve consolidating hundreds of individual programs into \none, open-ended block grant. Presumably this would include the $2.2 \nbillion IV-D program for States to collect child support. What happens \nif that program is folded in with many other welfare programs into a \nblock grant of $20 or $30 billion, with no more matching rate or \nincentive payments? States could spend all the money to collect child \nsupport, or none of it? Is the mandate now to be considered totally \nunfunded, since there is no money specifically directed to it? Or is it \nnow fully funded, since States could pay for it by shifting welfare \nfunds away from other needs?\n  Mr. President, yesterday, we passed an amendment offered by Senator \nByrd which tried to address these two issues by creating yet another \nlegislative procedure. While I appreciate the intent of the amendment \nand endorse it, let no one think that this amendment solves these \nproblems. Even if the authorizing committees act responsibly, even if \nthe appropriators do everything they can, this new process still does \nnot mitigate against real possibilities that have nightmarish \nimplications.\n  What if there is an across-the-board sequester of funding? Does every \nagency stop implementing regulations?\n  The Byrd amendment was agreed to and improved the bill. But amendment \nafter amendment was voted down, often on a party line. We tried to \nprevent regulations from targeting the private sector. This was \nrejected. We tried to prevent new roadblocks to legislation protecting \nchildren and the elderly. Rejected. We tried to make workable the point \nof order. Rejected.\n  Mr. President, I say today that I would have supported a bill to \nprotect the States and local governments against unfunded mandates. I \nwould have supported the legislation from last Congress, which was \nloudly endorsed on a bipartisan basis and by all the State and local \ngovernment groups. But I cannot endorse S.1.\n  In the past, we have passed legislation to clean the air and water. \nWe've passed legislation to protect the public health and safety. We've \npassed legislation to ensure the preservation of our oceans, our \nbeaches, our public lands. We do not do this because we desire to pass \ncosts on to the States. We do this because this is what the public \ndemands.\n  Certainly, we have to consider the costs to the States and local \ngovernments when we pass important legislation. This bill goes much \nfarther. I believe that this bill will, if passed, be used to undercut \nfundamental laws that exist or will be created to improve our world and \nsafeguard the public. I cannot support such a step.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, our Nation's Governors, mayors, and \ncounty executives have long sought relief from the imposition of \nunfunded mandates by the Federal Government. For to long, we have \nthought too little about the consequences of Federal decisions on the \nbudgets of States, cities, counties, and towns. With the passage of \nS.1, the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act, the Senate has undertaken an \nimportant and historic restructuring of the intergovernmental \nrelationship between Washington and State and local governments.\n  Much of the debate on this bill has been about achieving an \nappropriate balance between the need to reduce the fiscal burdens on \nState and local governments and concern over impairment of the ability \nof Congress to legislate in areas where Federal responsibility is \nclear. Several amendments were debated on the floor in an attempt to \nachieve this balance. Among the amendments which I supported, but which \nwas defeated, was one which would have excluded from S.1's procedures \nmandates intended to apply equally to governmental entities and the \nprivate sector. Passage of this amendment would have expressly \nprecluded situations from arising where either health and safety \nstandards would apply differently to State and local governments than \nto the private sector, or where the private sector could have been \nplaced at a competitive disadvantage. Although a separate amendment was \napproved requiring authorizing committees to include a description of \nany action taken by the committee to avoid any adverse impact on the \ncompetitive balance between the public and private sectors, this \nsituation will nonetheless bear close watching.\n  Despite the failure of this amendment and others I supported to be \nadopted, I have concluded that, on balance, S.1 is worthy of support. \nIt recognizes--for the first time--that the Federal Government must \nconsider the budgetary impact on States and localities of the laws we \nenact and the regulations we promulgate. This was an important \nacknowledgement and, I believe, a positive step.\n  I commend the managers of this legislation, and look forward House \npassage ad swift approval by the President.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask that we now go to third reading \nof the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass? The yeas and nays have been ordered \nand the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

IMPACT ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Congress should be concerned about shifting costs \n     from Federal to State and local authorities and should be \n     equally concerned about the growing tendency of States to \n     shift costs to local governments;\n       (2) cost shifting from States to local governments has, in \n     many instances, forced local governments to raise property \n     taxes or curtail sometimes essential services; and\n       (3) increases in local property taxes and cuts in essential \n     services threaten the ability of many citizens to attain and \n     maintain the American dream of owning a home in a safe, \n     secure community.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Federal Government should not shift certain costs \n     to the State, and States should end the practice of shifting \n     costs to local governments, which forces many local \n     governments to increase property taxes;\n       (2) States should end the imposition, in the absence of \n     full consideration by their legislatures, of State issued \n     mandates on local governments without adequate State funding, \n     in a manner that may displace other essential government \n     priorities; and\n       (3) one primary objective of this Act and other efforts to \n     change the relationship among Federal, State, and local \n     governments should be to reduce taxes and spending at all \n     levels and to end the practice of shifting costs from one \n     level of government to another with little or no benefit to \n     taxpayers.\n\n     SEC. 109. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This title shall take effect on January 1, 1996 or on the \n     date 90 days after appropriations are made available as \n     authorized under section 104, whichever is earlier and shall \n     apply to legislation considered on and after such date.\n             TITLE II--REGULATORY ACCOUNTABILITY AND REFORM\n\n     SEC. 201.

Such a process shall be \n     consistent with all applicable laws.\n       (c) Agency Plan.--\n       (1) Effects on state, local, and tribal governments.--\n     Before establishing any regulatory requirements that might \n     significantly or uniquely affect small governments, agencies \n     shall have developed a plan under which the agency shall--\n       (A) provide notice of the contemplated requirements to \n     potentially affected small governments, if any;\n     [[Page S1683]]   (B) enable officials of affected small \n     governments to provide input under subsection (b); and\n       (C) inform, educate, and advise small governments on \n     compliance with the requirements.\n       (2) Authorization of appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to each agency to carry out the provisions \n     of this section, and for no other purpose, such sums as are \n     necessary.\n\n     SEC. 202. STATEMENTS TO ACCOMPANY SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY \n                   ACTIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Before promulgating any final rule that \n     includes any Federal intergovernmental mandate that may \n     result in the expenditure by State, local, or tribal \n     governments, and the private sector, in the aggregate, of \n     $100,000,000 or more (adjusted annually for inflation by the \n     Consumer Price Index) in any 1 year, and before promulgating \n     any general notice of proposed rulemaking that is likely to \n     result in promulgation of any such rule, the agency shall \n     prepare a written statement containing--\n       (1) estimates by the agency, including the underlying \n     analysis, of the anticipated costs to State, local, and \n     tribal governments and the private sector of complying with \n     the Federal intergovernmental mandate, and of the extent to \n     which such costs may be paid with funds provided by the \n     Federal Government or otherwise paid through Federal \n     financial assistance;\n       (2) estimates by the agency, if and to the extent that the \n     agency determines that accurate estimates are reasonably \n     feasible, of--\n       (A) the future costs of the Federal intergovernmental \n     mandate; and\n       (B) any disproportionate budgetary effects of the Federal \n     intergovernmental mandate upon any particular regions of the \n     Nation or particular State, local, or tribal governments, \n     urban or rural or other types of communities;\n       (3) a qualitative, and if possible, a quantitative \n     assessment of costs and benefits anticipated from the Federal \n     intergovernmental mandate (such as the enhancement of health \n     and safety and the protection of the natural environment);\n       (4) the effect of the Federal private sector mandate on the \n     national economy, including the effect on productivity, \n     economic growth, full employment, creation of productive \n     jobs, and international competitiveness of United States \n     goods and services; and\n       (5)(A) a description of the extent of the agency's prior \n     consultation with elected representatives (or their \n     designated representatives) of the affected State, local, and \n     tribal governments;\n       (B) a summary of the comments and concerns that were \n     presented by State, local, or tribal governments either \n     orally or in writing to the agency;\n       (C) a summary of the agency's evaluation of those comments \n     and concerns; and\n       (D) the agency's position supporting the need to issue the \n     regulation containing the Federal intergovernmental mandates \n     (considering, among other things, the extent to which costs \n     may or may not be paid with funds provided by the Federal \n     Government).\n       (b) Agency Statement; Private Sector Mandates.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, an agency \n     statement prepared pursuant to subsection (a) shall also be \n     prepared for a Federal private sector mandate that may result \n     in the expenditure by State, local, tribal governments, or \n     the private sector, in the aggregate, of $100,000,000 or more \n     (adjusted annually for inflation by the Consumer Price Index) \n     in any 1 year.\n       (c) Promulgation.--In promulgating a general notice of \n     proposed rulemaking or a final rule for which a statement \n     under subsection (a) is required, the agency shall include in \n     the promulgation a summary of the information contained in \n     the statement.\n       (d) Preparation in Conjunction With Other Statement.--Any \n     agency may prepare any statement required under subsection \n     (a) in conjunction with or as a part of any other statement \n     or analysis, provided that the statement or analysis \n     satisfies the provisions of subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 203.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe bill was passed.\n  Mr. GLENN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                             Change of Vote\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I either misstated my vote or my vote was \nmismarked before on the Levin amendment No. 218. I was recorded as \nhaving voted ``no'' on that. I intended to vote ``aye.'' Since it does \nnot change the vote, I ask unanimous consent that my vote be changed to \n``aye'' on that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.)\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, may we have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, first I want to commend the managers of this \nbill, particularly my colleague Senator Kempthorne. This is his third \nyear, and I think he has done an outstanding job working with the \ndistinguished Senator from Ohio, Senator Glenn. He is someone who made \nthis commitment and stuck with it.\n  Just for historical purposes, we have been on this bill a long, long \ntime. The vote was 86 to 10. I think we could have finished it probably \na week ago. We had 44 rollcall votes taken, 8 were unanimous. Of those \n44 votes, 9 were taken on committee amendments that had been adopted \nunanimously in committee.\n  We started on this bill on Thursday, January 12, at 10:35 a.m. We had \n10 full days debate on S. 1. We used about 58 hours 34 minutes: The \nDemocrats, 36 hours 55 minutes; Republicans, 21 hours 39 minutes.\n  There were 211 amendments submitted to the desk. Of those 211, 68 \nwere actually proposed--50 proposed by my Democratic friends, 18 \nproposed by Republicans; 30 were agreed to; 20 were tabled; 16 were \nwithdrawn; 2 second-degree amendments fell; 3 have yet to be disposed \nof.\n  These are just sort of background facts on how long it has taken and \nhow many amendments and how many hours.\n  I assume the next bill may take as much time. I hope not. If this was \na warmup, we have a lot of work ahead of us.\n  I will also suggest that this is the first step in forging a new \npartnership. The 10th amendment to the United States Constitution \nreads:\n\n       The powers not delegated to the United States by the \n     Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are \n     reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\n\n  That is what this legislation is all about. The idea that power \nshould be kept close to people, that is federalism. It is the idea on \nwhich our Nation was founded.\n  But I think we have made it very clear that we, in effect, have \ndusted off the 10th amendment in this effort. It has been a very \nsuccessful effort. I know that we came close last year but did not \nquite get it. We wanted to do it in, I think, the last 2 days of the \nsession. Maybe we could have done it in 2 days then, but it took 10 \ndays now.\n  The distinguished Senator from Idaho, Senator Kempthorne, Senator \nGlenn, Chairman Roth, Chairman Domenici, and others, deserve immense \ncredit for working together on a bipartisan basis with representatives \nfrom State, local, and tribal governments, Democrats, Republicans, and \nindependents, private sector groups and key Members from the other \nbody. In fact, a few moments ago, I saw the distinguished Governor of \nOhio, Governor Voinovich, who has been one of the leaders in working \nwith Governors, mayors, and everybody else across the country, calling \nSenators of both parties.\n  On the other side, my particular thanks to Congressman Clinger and \nCongressman Portman, because they crafted the bill that is before us \ntoday. It seems to me that all this hard work is going to be a \ndeparture from business as usual and also, we are making a big, big \nstep in the right direction.\n              the first step in forging a new partnership\n\n  The 10th amendment to the U.S. Constitution reads:\n\n       The powers not delegated to the United States by the \n     Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are \n     reserved to the States, respectively, or to the people.\n\n  Federalism. The idea that power should be kept close to the people. \nIt's the idea on which our Nation was founded. But there are some in \nWashington--perhaps fewer this year than last--who believe neither our \nStates nor our people can be trusted with power. Federalism has given \nway to paternalism--with disastrous results.\n  In the 104th Congress, we plan to dust off the 10th amendment and \nrestore it to its rightful place in the Constitution. Adoption of this \nlegislation is the first step in that process, the first step in \nforging a new partnership between Congress and our partners at the \nState and local level. This partnership is bipartisan, as the vote \ndemonstrated and as the support among officials at all levels of State \nand local government already demonstrates.\n\n\n                     change from business-as-usual\n\n  The distinguished Senator from Idaho, Senator Kempthorne, Senator \nGlenn,\n Chairman Roth, Chairman Domenici, and others deserve immense credit \nfor working together on a bipartisan basis with representatives from \nState, local, and tribal governments--Democrats, Republicans, and \nindependents--private-sector groups and key Members in the other body--\nparticularly Congressmen Clinger and Portman--to craft the bill that is \nbefore us today. All that hard work has produced a bill that will lead \nto a dramatic departure from business-as-usual in Washington.\n\n  Mr. President, for far too long, Congress has operated under the \nfalse assumption that legislation that did not affect the Federal \nbudget had no cost. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  According to private estimates, in 1994, the private sector and State \nand local governments spent between $600 and $800 billion complying \nwith Federal regulations. In last year's budget, President Clinton \nprojected that in 1994 the Federal Government would collect a total of \n$549.9 billion from Federal income taxes on individuals.\n  In other words, State and local governments, private businesses, and \nultimately taxpayers and consumers paid more to comply with Federal \nregulations than the Federal Government\n collected from Federal income taxes on individuals.\n\n  This bill will change the way we do business in Washington. It will \nlead to a more informed debate on the Senate floor, a debate that will \nrequire us to consider the potential cost of a new \n[[Page S1685]] mandate to State and local government and to the private \nsector, before the mandate is adopted.\n  For far too long, Congress has given State and local governments new \nresponsibilities without supplying the money needed to fulfill these \nnew obligations. Those unfunded mandates have forced State and local \nofficials to cut services or increase taxes in order to keep their \nbudgets in balance.\n  The costs are immense. California Governor, Pete Wilson, estimates \nthat unfunded mandates cost his State $7.7 billion last year.\n\n\n                        more informed decisions\n\n  This new process is a reality check for advocates of new mandates. It \nforces those who want to expand the reach of the Federal Government to \nconsider the potential cost of their actions to State and local \ngovernments and to the private sector--before they take action. It is a \nreality check for advocates of new mandates.\n  Those who want to create new mandates or expand existing ones have a \nchoice: Either get an\n estimate of the potential cost of a new mandate and pay the full cost \nof imposing that mandate on State and local governments up front or try \nto get a majority of the Senate to agree that the Federal Government \nshould not finance the new mandate.\n\n  This legislation is really about good government and accountability. \nHere's the bottom line: The potential costs of new legislation should \nbe considered before the legislation is adopted.\n\n\n                 who benefits most from mandate relief?\n\n  There has been a lot of discussion about who this legislation helps. \nIt certainly is a top priority for State and local government \nofficials--Democrats and Republicans--who are sick and tired of dealing \nwith a Congress that passes the buck. I have met personally with \nrepresentatives from the so-called Big 7--Governors, mayors, State \nlegislators, county officials, school boards, and so forth. They know \nthat mandate relief will make it easier for State and local officials \nto balance their budgets each year.\n  But, the real beneficiaries of this legislation are the people who \nultimately pay all the bills for unfunded mandates: individual \nAmericans.\n  People--not government--pay all the taxes, both\n   hidden and direct, generated by unfunded mandates. Federal mandates \non businesses lead to higher prices for goods and services people on \nthose businesses.\n\n  When faced with an unfunded Federal mandate, State and local \ngovernment officials make a choice--they cut services or raise taxes in \norder to comply with the new Federal requirements and balance their \nbudgets.\n  Stemming the flow of unfunded Federal mandates from Washington will \nhelp keep State and local taxes down and help prevent cuts in \neducation, crimefighting and other State and local services.\n  Mr. President, this is a good Government initiative that is long \noverdue. I am confident that it will be approved with broad bipartisan \nsupport. I hope that those in the other body will be able to act on \nthis legislation without major changes and that we can get this \nimportant legislation to the President as quickly as possible.\n  So I want to again congratulate my colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/27/senate-section/article/S1640-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1685-S1688]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNFUNDED MANDATE REFORM ACT\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for yielding.\n  I did not have the opportunity to listen to his entire statement, but \nhis comments at the end reflect sentiments that I had intended to \nexpress.\n  This is the end of business as usual, at least as it affects our \nrelationship with the States, local governments, and tribal \ngovernments. I commend the managers of the bill on both sides of the \naisle for their hard work. They have done an outstanding job in the \ncourse of the last 2 weeks to bring us to this point.\n  Senator Kempthorne and Senator Glenn have shown the demeanor and the \ncomity between themselves, and certainly the patience in working with \nall of us, to make passage of this bill possible.\n  Let me also say that because we took the time, because we deliberated \nthoroughly for the last 2 weeks, because we have had the opportunity to \noffer amendments and considered them carefully, this is a much better \nbill than the version that was presented to this body just 2 weeks ago. \nIt has been improved by the process. Those improvements resulted in \nbroad bipartisan support for the legislation in the end.\n  To all of my colleagues, I say it is important that everyone \nunderstand the difference between the House and the Senate. Certainly, \nit is possible to pass legislation through the House more quickly, but \nI do not believe that all the legislation that goes through the House \nis exactly as we would like it in the Senate. The responsibility of the \nSenate is to deliberate more carefully and to deal more deliberately \nwith the legislative issues at hand.\n  There are many very complicated and difficult questions we have had \nto face with this issue, as there will be with other bills that will \ncome before us. The amendment process is our only means to effectively \ndeal with with those questions in a meaningful way.\n  So it is with great admiration that I come to the floor this \nafternoon to congratulate the two managers of this legislation. But I \nmust remind my colleagues that the minority feels very strongly that as \nthese amendments and bills come before us, we will take our time, we \nwill do what we must to ensure that all matters related to the \nlegislation get thorough consideration. We will be as supportive as \npossible when we agree with our Republican colleagues on the merits. \nBut certainly we must object when the process does not allow us or \naccord us the opportunities the minority deserves as these complicated \nbills come before us.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I was pleased to cosponsor S. 1, the \nUnfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, a bill to curb the practice of \nimposing unfunded Federal mandates on States and local governments.\n  This is an important piece of legislation, and I am delighted it has \npassed.\n  I wish to commend our majority leader, Senator Dole, and all the \nothers who joined on this bill as cosponsors. I especially wish to \ncommend Senator Dirk Kempthorne, the Republican manager of the bill, \nand Senator John Glenn, the Democrat manager.\n  Senator Kempthorne is a new Senator, yet he managed this bill as if \nhe were a veteran of 20 years. He artfully handled it with great skill \nand much grace. We are very proud of his efforts. I predict this bill \nis going to bring great results to this Government, and I look forward \nto those results in the years ahead.\n  Mr. President, over 1 year ago, in October 1993, thousands of mayors, \ncounty commissioners, and Governors met in front of their town halls, \ncourt houses, and State houses and gathered here in Washington to speak \nout against, what is popularly described as, the unfunded mandates \nissue.\n  Unfunded Federal mandates arise when the Federal Government, through \nlegislative or executive action, directs State and local governments to \nestablish a particular policy or program, without providing the \nfinancial resources to implement that policy or program.\n  Mr. President, this situation emanates from our unique system of \ngovernment. By design of our Founding Fathers, governmental power in \nour Nation is divided between the National Government and State and \nlocal governments. The National Government, with delegated and implied \npowers, coupled with the supremacy clause of article 6 of the U.S. \nConstitution, has taken upon itself to direct the States in many areas \nof law and public policy. On the other hand, the 10th amendment to the \nConstitution specifically reserves to the States or to the people, \npowers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution. Thus, a \nnatural tension arises between levels of government, particularly when \nit involves unfunded mandates.\n  Federal laws and regulations place a heavy burden on State and local \ngovernments, as well as businesses and consumers. Cities and counties \nare hit particularly hard by Federal environmental rules which require \nexpensive capital expenditures and operational \n[[Page S1686]] costs to comply with Federal standards.\n  Numerous surveys and studies have been conducted to determine the \nextent of the burden of unfunded mandates. These surveys consistently \nreport findings that unfunded mandates consume significant portions of \nState and local budgets, totaling billions of dollars.\n  Mr. President, the message of State and local government officials is \nbeing heard in Washington, and their concerns are being addressed. Last \nyear, in addition to an Executive order issued by President Clinton, \nunfunded mandates legislation was considered by Congress, although \nfinal action on the measure could not be completed in the closing days \nof the last Congress.\n  I am pleased that the Senate has acted on this reform legislation \naddressing unfunded Federal mandates. No one could have handled this \nbill with more talent and skill than Senator Kempthorne has done, and I \ncongratulate him on the leadership he has shown on this issue. Also, I \ncommend the majority leader and relevant committees for quickly \nbringing this bill to the floor. This measure is widely supported, as \nindicated by the bipartisan majority of Senators who cosponsored the \nbill, and who ultimately voted for final passage.\n  Mr. President, S. 1 establishes a legislative framework based on \nthree fundamental concepts--information, consultation, and \naccountability. First, this bill provides that Congress must consider \ninformation on the cost of mandates to State, local, and tribal \ngovernments, as well as to the private sector. This information will \nidentify whether or not proposed legislation includes a mandate and, if \nso, the cost of the mandate.\n  Second, the bill requires consultation with State, local, and tribal \nofficials when Federal agencies develop regulations that contain \nsignificant Federal mandates. This provision is consistent with \nPresident Clinton's Executive order which seeks to establish a closer \npartnership between the Federal Government and the States.\n  Third, the bill establishes a method of enforcement and \naccountability. It provides for a point of order against committee-\nreported bills and resolutions which contain a mandate but fail to \nprovide information on the cost of the mandate. Another point of order \nlies against legislation which contain unfunded mandates exceeding the \n$50 million threshold. These provisions put an end to the practice of \npassing hidden costs to the States. Congress must now openly address \nthese costs and make a deliberate decision to impose a mandate and pass \non the costs of that mandate.\n  Mr. President, the issue of the proper role of the Federal Government \nis one which the Nation has faced from its beginning. Since our \ncolonial days, Americans have been suspicious of centralized executive \npower. Recognizing a legitimate role for government, the Founding \nFathers nevertheless sought to limit the power of the National \nGovernment. This bill is another step toward restoring the Federal-\nState partnership as it was designed and intended by the Founders of \nthe Constitution. The word ``Federal'' evolves from the Latin word \nfoederatus, meaning covenant or compact. The Constitution establishes \nthat compact or contract between the governed and the government, and \nbetween the National and State governments. It gives specified powers \nto the central Government, and reserves all other powers and rights to \nthe people and to the States. Today, however, the Federal Government \ncontinues to expand its influence in commercial regulation, \nenvironmental protection, welfare reform, and health care. Any one of \nthese areas contains the potential for continued pressure on both the \nFederal treasury as well as State and local budgets.\n  Mr. President, while the issue of Federal mandates will not likely \ndisappear in the foreseeable future, the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of \n1995 will help to diminish the threat to State, local, and tribal \ngovernments and will bring timely information, accountability, and \nconsultation to the process. I was proud to support this legislation \nwhich prohibits the Federal Government from mandating State or local \ngovernment action, unless Federal funds are provided.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would like to thank the Senator from \nSouth Carolina for his comments.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  I would like to add my words of congratulations to the Senator from \nIdaho. As was mentioned by the Dean of the Senate, Senator Kempthorne \nis a freshman. He has only been here for 2 years, and it is a very rare \nthing that someone who has been here only 2 years would be able to take \na bill to the floor and to handle that bill really alone as the sponsor \nof the bill, with able help and participation from Senator Glenn, as \nwell.\n  Senator Kempthorne really deserves the credit, and I wish to \ncongratulate the people of Idaho for electing a person who is a former \nmayor of Boise, who came here with a mission, to try to help a \nsituation that he had experienced firsthand as mayor. I relate to that \nexperience because I was State treasurer of my State of Texas. The \nothers that were the first people on this bill were also State or local \nofficials, such as Senator Gregg, who was the Governor of New \nHampshire.\n  People like us, who came from local and State governments, really \nunderstand what was happening to the 10th amendment. The 10th amendment \nis one of the most important amendments to our Constitution. A lot of \npeople forget it was the States that created the Federal Government; it \nwas not the Federal Government that created the States. And the 10th \namendment says exactly that, that all the powers not specifically \nreserved to the Federal Government shall go to the States and the \npeople.\n  We must return to the 10th amendment, and we took a historic step \ntoday on this side of our Congress to do just that, to restore the \nrights of the States and the local governments to make the decisions \nclosest to the people. That is what our Founding Fathers intended, and \nthat is what I hope every step we take throughout this session will \ncontinue to approach.\n  I want the government closest to the people to make the decisions \nthat relate to the people to whom they are closest. This was a major \nfirst step, and I am so proud to see that the House is now debating \nthis very same bill. I look forward to the President having the relief \nto the States and cities on his desk by the end of next week. That will \nbe a major step.\n  In fact, this really has been a historic week in Congress. On the \nother side of the Capitol, the House yesterday passed a balanced budget \namendment, a great step forward for our children and grandchildren to \nknow that we are going to act responsibly to start trying to get toward \nthat balanced budget so that we will not pass our debts on to the next \ngenerations. And on this side of the Capitol, we passed the first step \nto giving the States and local governments closest to the people the \nrights they should have.\n  So I just want to commend Senator Kempthorne. I commend all who \nworked so hard on this bill. For the last 10 days, it has really rested \non him, and I think it is a great step forward. We are beginning to do \nfor the people what we hoped we could do, what they asked us to do on \nNovember 8, and that is to start making the Federal Government less \nintrusive on our lives.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWINE). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I want to respond to the very kind remarks \nmade by several people about myself and Senator Kempthorne with \nrelation to this bill. I do believe this is very, very important \nlegislation. I referred to it several times during debate as landmark \nlegislation, and I think it is that important. A lot of times some of \nthese things about processes and procedures and what you have to \nconsider before you do something else, the organization of Government, \nthe intergovernmental relationships between the Federal, State and \nlocal governments and how that fits in with the Constitution and so on, \nare arcane. They are looked at as something boring and not too \ninteresting. But we have referred to them, on the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, occasionally, as doing sort \n[[Page S1687]] of the grunt work of Government, if you will.\n  They are not as spectacular, not as interesting, maybe, as looking at \nB-2 bombers, M1A2 tanks, radars, and all the other things that go on. \nBut improvements in these areas have, for the future--5, 10, 15, 20 \nyears down the road--the potential of making our Government work \nbetter, work more efficiently, and that is what this is all about. That \nis why I do believe this is landmark legislation.\n  What it has done basically is reversed a trend that was started some \n60 years ago. I mentioned on the floor several times during this debate \nover the last 2 weeks, that I go back in my own lifetime to the days of \nthe Great Depression. I remember that very well. Why is that important \nin considering unfunded mandates? Because prior to that time there were \nnot some of the demands made on States that came to be common in the \ndays during and after the Great Depression. Prior to that time in this \ncountry families took care of families, communities took care of \ncommunities. It was rare people could not take care of each other \nwithin the local community. Once in a while maybe some young person had \nto be sent to the county orphanage or some old person had to be sent to \nthe county home. That was looked at as a failure of the community at \nthat time.\n  That was sufficient. That Norman Rockwell view of America was \nsufficient in the early days of this country. It worked and I wish \nAmerica still worked that way. But what happened in the days of the \nGreat Depression was there was hunger, there were soup kitchens in the \nUnited States of America. If the movies portray it properly, the Okies \nwere heading west with a mattress on top of the car. The United States \nat that time had enough doubt about itself that it was questionable \nwhat would become of this country--it was that serious.\n  There was hunger in America, if you can imagine that, on a big scale. \nUnemployment was over 20 percent for 4 straight years; 1 year, \nunemployment was right at 25 percent. America had lost its ability to \ncope and to take care of each other in that Norman Rockwell world that \nhad been so great for this country and a hallmark of this country--\npeople taking care of each other.\n  But that broke down. I remember my dad running an extra 2 acres of \nland, planting a big garden, and giving food away to the people in the \ntown. We helped. I will not go into all the details of that. But then \ncame along, out of that kind of disaster, the election of Franklin \nDelano Roosevelt and the New Deal. Whether people today think that was \na good idea or not, I can tell you about those days when the mortgage \non the home I was living in was saved by the FHA, and where people were \nput back to work, where I remember my dad, who had a little plumbing \nshop, going to work on a WPA project in New Concord replacing the water \nsystem that was made out of wooden pipes--wooden pipes--with a new and \nmore modern water system--things like that went on all over the \ncountry.\n  A program was started for rural electrification and the lines went \nout across the country. The farmers, then, had new energy sources to \nhelp them do their work. I will not go into all the things that were \npart and parcel of that whole New Deal. I think too many people these \ndays speak of the New Deal in scathing tones. But the New Deal \naddressed the problems of America at a time when America had lost its \nown capability to take care of itself, person to person, community to \ncommunity and so on. It was that serious.\n  Did some of those programs over the last 60 years go too far? Why, of \ncourse they did, and I would be the first to admit that. We say now \nthat all of the concern for people and for training and job training \nthat has resulted in, I believe it is 128 different Government job \ntraining programs, many that overlap--is wasteful. Is this wasteful? Of \ncourse it is. Should we correct that? Of course we should. But some of \nthe things that have happened over the last 60 years began in tragedy \nfor this Nation, and the programs that were put in back at that time \nwere lifesaving programs for this Nation.\n  We have come to the point over the last dozen years or so where \nFederal demands on the States, pursuant to programs quite laudatory as \nfar as their purposes go--but too many of the programs have been just \nmandates given to the States. ``Let the States pay for them.'' Maybe we \npay 10 percent from the Federal level, but then put big demands on the \nStates.\n  Where that could be done, perhaps satisfactorily back maybe 15 or 20 \nyears ago, it will no longer work because those Federal demands have \nbecome so great, with environmental concerns such as the Clean Air Act \nand Clean Water Act, building codes, police and law and order, and all \nthe other things that we know about, where demands have been placed \nfrom the Federal level on the local communities or on the State \ngovernment but the adequate money has not flowed along with that to \nhelp them implement those programs. Along with that, in the mid-1980's \nthere was what was called the new federalism that cut out a lot of the \nnormal Federal support. Community Development Block Grants and some of \nthe other programs were cut out that the States had been depending on \nto help them cope with some of these Federal demands.\n  So we have seen an enormous, exponential increase in the last 10 \nyears or so in demands on the States and local government that has \nbecome intolerable. Starting back about 3 or 4 years ago we saw \ncomplaints coming from the States, complaints coming from counties, \nfrom local governments and increasing in volume and increasing in \nconcerns expressed about where this country was going if we continued \nthis. Were we violating the Constitution? Were we violating propriety? \nJust ``what is right'' might be even a better question than one about \nthe Constitution, because we cannot just heap requirements on the \nStates and expect them to be able to cope with that.\n  That is the reason I think this legislation is so important. To those \nwho just decry everything about New Deal and everything about the \nDemocratic support for some of those programs and so on, I point out \nthose programs were born of necessity in a time of crisis for this \ncountry. Now, after a period of some 60 years, though, we are saying \nthat what finally happened with these programs, where the funding was \nput back on the States too much, that this has to be reversed. So that \nis the reason I see this as landmark legislation.\n  I think we have reached a height. We are leveling this off. We are \nsaying there absolutely has to be considered up front the costs of \nprograms and there has to be a vote on those programs, if it is \ndemanded, right here. So we have to assume our responsibility, where \ntoo often in the past we have just taken these programs and said: I am \nsure the States can take care of that. Let us vote that in. There has \nnot been too much squealing recently, they must be able to do it. So we \njust go and vote that out.\n  That will no longer be the case. When this legislation is finally \nthrough the House or whatever compromise version comes out of the \nHouse, we will have moved to a different level, a different \nrelationship between the States and the Federal Government and the \nlocal governments.\n  I have been getting an increasing amount of mail about this subject. \nI would say to the Governors out there across this country, I have been \ngetting an increasing amount of mail from local officials, from city \nand county officials, saying, ``They do to us what you do to them.'' In \nother words, the State does to my county, the State does to my town, \nwhat they are complaining the Federal Government does to the States. So \nI think the Governors have to take it upon themselves to make certain \nthat this ``no money, no mandate'' that is sweeping the country \nincludes the relationship among the States and local governments.\n  There have been some editorials in our home State of Ohio to that \neffect, where they pointed out some things where the State has given \nthe local government problems in just such an issue as we are trying to \naddress in the relationship between the Federal and State Governments.\n  So I think there is another area where the Governors and the States \nhave to make certain that they are also taking adequate action. There \nare still needs of the people out there across this country. There are \nstill needs of the poor. There are still needs to have to be met with \nregard to Medicaid, medical care, and health care, \n[[Page S1688]] some of which are provided for by Federal funds that are \nallowed to become less available to the States. But the needs of the \npeople have not changed. Can the States adapt to this new situation, \nparticularly if we pass a balanced budget amendment? Can the States \nadapt to this and assume those services now that they could not or \nwould not do back in the days of the Great Depression, and assume it \nnow some 60 years later as we reverse this relationship between the \nFederal, State, and local governments?\n  I think that has yet to be seen, and I think as a result of the \nlegislation that we are here passing and will be passed over in the \nHouse one of these days, I hope, I think we have to very carefully \nwatch this to make sure that some States are not less careful to take \ncare of the needs of the people so that we do not see them once again \ngoing through a trough, as a Federal necessity to move in, and come \nabout because of the States unwillingness to act.\n  So with those caveats on this I am very, very glad to see this \nlegislation passed today. We worked on it a long time.\n\n\n                   Commendation of Senator Kempthorne\n\n  Mr. President, I want to mention briefly some of the people involved. \nCertainly Senator Kempthorne, who has been a real driving force behind \nthis starting about 2 years ago, introduced the legislation along with \nabout half-dozen other proposals that were put forth that were referred \nto the Governmental Affairs Committee, must be commended. I had been \nworking on some legislation along this line myself. And so we combined \nforces on this. He has been an absolutely superb person to put this \nlegislation forward. He has been a real spark plug on it, has kept \nafter it when we were trying to have hearings in the Governmental \nAffairs Committee, and wanted to have hearings. If the hearings were \nnot scheduled for a week or so, I would get a couple of phone calls \nfrom Senator Kempthorne very nicely, politely asking, ``John, couldn't \nwe work this in? Don't you think maybe we could somehow work this in \nover there?'' And work it in we finally did, and we got the legislation \nout last August.\n  I will not go through the litany which I have gone through a couple \nof times already today about what happened once we got it out of \ncommittee in August, and what happened during the fall when we could \nnot get adequate time on the floor to have it considered. Then the \nelection came about. There was a new attitude over in the House, and we \nthought perhaps S. 993, which was the first bill that was an adequate \nbill by all estimates, might not be the legislation that the House had \nwanted to agree to now with the changed political situation. So this \nnew legislation, S. 1, was put forward and was given the preeminence \nthat it deserved by being named S. 1, the No. 1 bill to be considered.\n  Senator Kempthorne, through all of this, has been a superb person to \nwork with, friendly, congenial. We have not had any harsh words. We \nhave worked things out between us.\n  I want to congratulate him for his persistence in this regard. It has \nbeen great to see him work, and as we mentioned here not too long ago \non the floor--an hour or so ago--to have someone come here with a very \ncomplex piece of legislation and handle it the way he did is a real \ntestimony to his capability.\n\n\n                         Commendation of Staff\n\n  Mr. President, on Senator Kempthorne's staff, of course, Buster \nFawcett, who is here and has worked on this, as the prime person \nworking on it; Brian Waldmann, also, Senator Kempthorne's \nadministrative assistant, and Gary Smith, all have worked on this, have \ndone a superb job, and have done a lot of work. They have had a lot of \nsleepless nights.\n  On my own staff, Leonard Weiss is our staff director on the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, who is here, along with Sebastian \nO'Kelly and Larry Novey, who is back in the back here. All of them \nworked and worked and worked on this, and did a superb job in all the \nnegotiating back and forth. I want to give them full credit for that.\n\n\n              Commendation of Senator Levin and His Staff\n\n  Mr. President, let me say a word also about Senator Levin from \nMichigan. I have never known a Senator since I have been here who is \nmore persistent, who, once he gets his teeth into something that he \nbelieves in, becomes a real pit bull for that purpose, and who by his \nbackground and training, having been president of the Detroit Council \nat one time, has a feel for local issues as well as the Federal issues \nthat we deal with here, but he brings that kind of a background to this \nconsideration of such legislation as this. Where other people may say \nthat phrase is OK, he wants to dig into every phrase to see what its \nimpact is going to be, to see what can be misconstrued under this and \nwhether it can be corrected by a change of wording.\n  In other words, his emphasis through all of this is one of principle, \nof how we make legislation work better. How is it going to apply to the \nStates? How will it apply to the city of Detroit? How will it apply to \nthe counties? On and on, he tries to set up scenarios to illustrate the \nweaknesses in legislation. That is what motivated him through all of \nthis in committee.\n  He was so unhappy when we were not able to get any amendments \nconsidered in committee. They were automatically voted down, and we had \nto bring them to the floor. But he persisted, and he brought those \nconcerns to the floor and dealt with many of them right here on the \nfloor.\n  I want to pay credit to him, and particularly to his staff, Linda \nGustitus, who is the staff on the Oversight and Government Management \nSubcommittee of Governmental Affairs. She has done a superb job on \nthis. I want to give credit to them.\n\n\n                Commendation of Senator Daschle's Staff\n\n  Mr. President, on the minority leader's staff, Senator Daschle's \nstaff, Mike Cole and Eric Washburn, all worked very hard on this. I \nknow that we stand up and take credit and we get all the laudatory \ncomments about doing some good with a bill like this. But it is the \nstaff who worked the long nights sometimes with us, sometimes in our \nabsence, while the Senators were home in bed quite frankly, and did \nsuch great work on this.\n  I do think they can take great pride in seeing their work on landmark \nlegislation. I think that will be the case as the years go on, and as \nthey continue to work with us to make sure that this is fine tuned, and \nthat this legislation is working as intended.\n  So I want to give credit to all of those people and the other \nSenators involved here, and we are proud to have worked on this \nourselves. We are glad we got the bill through.\n  We have the job now of hoping to get it through over in the House, or \na compromise version thereof. We look forward to being able to attend \nthe signing ceremony, I hope in the not-too-distant future at the White \nHouse when this finally becomes law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I want to associate myself with the words of my colleague from Ohio \non this legislation, that we understand that this is landmark \nlegislation. We may have seen the turning of the corner of a new \nattitude, maybe a new cooperation between the States and the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Senator Glenn was commenting on times gone by back in the Great \nDepression, of course, in that great era of drought and what drove the \n``Okies'' to California. I would have to say I do not know what it is \ndoing now but the Californians are coming to Montana now. I do not know \nwhat is driving them. But also as a fellow marine, we did not even know \nit at the time, but that goes back further than either one of us want \nto visit about, I congratulate him on his tenacity, and Senator \nKempthorne from Idaho, because unfunded mandates just did not start 1 \nyear ago or 2 years ago. It has been going on here quite awhile as the \ndebate got going, and finally we see today it has come to fruition in \nthe passage of this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/27/senate-section/article/S1685-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1688-S1690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    WESTERN FOREST HEALTH INITIATIVE\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I want to bring up a situation that caught \nmy eye.\n  Day before yesterday I received a copy of an Associated Press article \nthat exposed a previously unreleased \n[[Page S1689]] Forest Service document, now being referred to as \n``Phase I of The Western Forest Health Initiative.''\n  This report was internally submitted September 30, 1994, about the \ntime the agency said it would release its final report to the public. \nThe final report, however, was not released until December, and it was \nwatered down considerably. It is called phase 2.\n  The difference between the two documents is remarkable and it appears \nto demonstrate the difference between how Forest Service scientists--in \nother words, the professional land managers, especially in the Forest \nService--view forest health and how this administration sees it.\n  The phase I report in every way was more aggressive and emphasizes a \nmuch greater sense of urgency than the report that was finally released \nto the public. Phase I contains about 70 different recommendations on \novercoming impediments and barriers to achieving good forest health \ngoals and lists scores of specific actions needed to address those \nconcerns. It identified work to be done on almost 5 million acres of \nU.S. Forest Service lands. The new document, phase II, is more of a \ndiscussion document than a policy document. It recommended projects \ncovering only half a million acres of land--projects that were already \nplanned for and would have been done regardless of this initiative. So \nphase II proposes to remove barriers without clearly stating what they \nare and it disregards some very significant problems that the forests \nhave completely.\n  So, Mr. President, I think this action is flagrant. It undermines the \nhonest and serious attempts of the land managers to deal with forest \nhealth problems by the Forest Service. It is of extreme concern to the \npeople of my State and others in the West, who fought the 67,000 \nwildfires last summer--that burned 4 million acres, and it cost 26 \nlives. If we trail those back as to what caused the fires and how we \ncould have controlled them, it goes back almost entirely to dealing \nwith forest health issues.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the original Western Forest \nHealth Initiative, dated September 30, 1994, along with an Associated \nPress article, dated January 25, 1995, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n       Healthy resilient forests are important for sustaining \n     ecosystems, including the needs and values of humans.\n       Currently, many of our national forested ecosystems are \n     under stress and are unhealthy, meaning they cannot sustain \n     their inherent complexity while providing for human needs. \n     The problem with forest health is not confined to any single \n     region of the country. Some eastern and southern forested \n     ecosystems are challenged with considerable and complex \n     forest health problems. However, the nation's attention is \n     focused on western forested ecosystems, where the scale and \n     magnitude of the problems are greatest, and where the loss of \n     life, property, and resources from catastrophic wildfires \n     have heightened the public's awareness.\n       To address the western forest health problem, the Chief of \n     the Forest Service chartered an interdisciplinary team of 14 \n     members from all organizational levels to identify Forest \n     Service priority activities that can move towards restoring \n     western forested ecosystem health across National Forest \n     System and contiguous other land ownerships. The Team was \n     asked to identify and recommend solutions to barriers and \n     impediments that block or impede the accomplishment of \n     restoration activities. The focus was on assessing the \n     problems in our western forests, and then charting an \n     ecosystem approach, emphasizing projects that restore, \n     protect, or enhance ecosystem health. The Team's task did not \n     include addressing burned area recovery and restoration. \n     Rather it looked at actions that would work towards restoring \n     forested systems, to reduce the risks of future catastrophic \n     losses.\n       As part of this process, the Team did extensive outreach \n     and shareholder sensing, personally contacting over 40 \n     members of Congress, 30 non-governmental organizations, other \n     federal agencies, tribes, the Western Council of State \n     Foresters, Washington, Regional, and Northeast Area staffs, \n     Forest Service Research Stations, and 92 western Forest \n     Supervisors.\n       The data gathered in this intensive effort was compiled \n     into two automated electronic data bases: one for projects \n     and program level data from the National Forests and State \n     Foresters; the other containing over 1,100 comments on \n     barriers, impediments and proposed changes in management \n     direction, policy, or law. Content analysis and synthesis was \n     conducted by the Team. It resulted in an identification of \n     the magnitude of planned and needed work. Over 70 \n     recommendations were developed for changes that are needed to \n     overcome impediments.\n       Key findings estimate that over the next two years, there \n     are approximately 5 million acres of treatment opportunities \n     that restore forested ecosystem health. In addition, there is \n     a significant amount of ecosystem analysis needed in support \n     of future forest health projects.\n       Not all forests are unhealthy, nor can we treat or restore \n     all forests that are unhealthy. To facilitate management \n     decisions and move towards implementation, the team developed \n     a framework for prioritizing projects and budget needs that \n     contains biological, physical and human components. In using \n     it, managers will both be able to identify high priorities \n     for management, as well as get a sense for the level of \n     public acceptance and likelihood for successful \n     implementation.\n       Recommendations for changes that are needed centered into \n     the following key areas: changes to improve the effectiveness \n     and efficiency of the National Environmental Protection Act; \n     appeals, and consultation processes; increased budget and \n     funding flexibility, with a focus on increasing carryover and \n     multi-funding approaches to support multiple resource \n     projects; comprehensive review of legislation, regulations, \n     and policies to remove inconsistencies and conflicting \n     direction, new ways to get the job done on the ground, such \n     as land management services contracts and competitive inter-\n     agency grants; a greater commitment to truly working in \n     partnerships with other federal agencies, States, tribes, and \n     neighboring landowners in addressing forest health problems \n     that cross our boundaries; and better frameworks, protocols \n     and education and training for tying integrated inventories, \n     assessments and planning into more holistic and integrated \n     systems.\n       Forest health problems are national in scope. Lasting \n     solutions that can only be achieved by shared conservation \n     leadership toward common goals and land conditions. This will \n     require cooperative efforts and shared vision by the \n     Executive, Legislative and Judicial branches of the federal \n     government, as well as by our varied and many cooperators \n     from the private and public sectors. There are no easy or \n     short-term cures for forest health problems that have \n     developed over a span of the past century.\n                                                                    ____\n\n               [From the Associated Press, Jan. 25, 1995]\n\n   Document Shows Clinton Forest-Health Plan addresses Only Part of \n                                Problem\n\n                           (By Scott Sonner)\n\n       Washington.--Agriculture Undersecretary Jim Lyons says the \n     administration's Western forest health plan tackles only a \n     portion of the acres needing treatment and will be fortified \n     with additional projects in coming years.\n       ``This was not a one-shot deal,'' Lyons said in a telephone \n     interview Tuesday night.\n       ``There is a lot of work to be done on the forests, a lot \n     of opportunities to improve on their health,'' he said.\n       Lyons responded to criticism from the timber industry after \n     a Forest Service document disclosed Tuesday indicated the \n     Clinton administration's plan to reduce wildfire threats \n     addresses only about one-fifth of the 5 million acres a \n     Forest Service team identified as needing treatment.\n       The Forest Service's Western Forest Health Initiative Team \n     advocated a broader, speedier effort to remove dead timber \n     and otherwise reduce the amount of fuel in national forests, \n     according to a copy of the team's report obtained by The \n     Associated Press.\n       ``Based on field responses, work was identified for \n     completion over the two years covering approximately 5 \n     million acres on national forests in the West,'' the team \n     wrote in its Sept. 30 report to Forest Service Chief Jack \n     Ward Thomas.\n       ``In addition there is a significant amount of ecosystem \n     analysis needed in support of future forest health projects . \n     . . . Time is critical,'' the team said.\n       Critics in the timber industry said the team's report \n     indicates the administration watered down the scientists' \n     recommendations before launching the new strategy last month.\n       ``The difference between them is what the Forest Service \n     wanted and what the administration wanted,'' said Doug \n     Crandall, vice president for public forestry at the American \n     Forest & Paper Association.\n       The team's report ``in every sense was more aggressive, \n     substantial, specific and urgent than the final report,'' he \n     said.\n       The Agriculture Department's plan calls for 330 health-\n     restoration projects on approximately 1 million acres of \n     national forests over the next two years.\n       The projects include plans to obliterate some old logging \n     roads and restore fish habitat as well as remove dead, burned \n     wood and thin bug-infested forests where fuel loads pose a \n     threat.\n       The salvage logging and thinning is controversial because \n     environmentalists and some forest scientists say the cutting \n     does more harm than good to a forest ecosystem.\n       Conservationists also point to past cases where the Forest \n     Service used salvage logging as a guise to cut large, live \n     trees without jumping through the hoops of as many \n     environmental regulations.\n       ``The team gave us a wide range of projects,'' Lyons said \n     Tuesday.\n       [[Page S1690]] ``They instructed us in the first phase to \n     do those the team thought would have a high likelihood of \n     being implemented and that were less controversial and would \n     demonstrate we can get some of these projects done on the \n     ground,'' he said.\n       ``There's nothing to hide. There was no scrubbing. It was \n     important to gain the confidence of both the industry and the\n      environmental community that our forest health initiative \n     was intended to improve the health of forest ecosystems \n     and not simply to generate timber,'' Lyons said.\n       Some lawmakers have proposed exempting some salvage logging \n     operations from the normal environmental requirements in an \n     effort to expedite the cutting before the dead wood loses its \n     market value.\n       Senator Larry Craig, R-Idaho, chairman of the Senate \n     Agriculture subcommittee on forestry, is preparing a forest \n     health bill that may adopt some of the team's \n     recommendations, his spokesman David Fish said Tuesday.\n       The 5 million acres identified by the Forest Service team \n     includes 1.3 million acres in need of fuel reduction and 1 \n     million acres in need of ``vegetation treatments,'' including \n     ``commercial harvest, salvage . . . commercial thinning, \n     commercial thinning . . . firewood.''\n       The team also identified 1 million acres for soil and \n     watershed work, 400,000 acres of ``combination treatments,'' \n     which could include some prescribed burning, and another 1.1 \n     million acres of other projects ranging from educational \n     projects to seeding and fertilization.\n       In addition, the team addressed two other controversial \n     areas that did not show up in the final initiative--reform of \n     U.S. environmental laws and below-cost timber sales.\n       In addition to coming up with ways to reform the National \n     Environmental Policy Act, the team recommended the Forest \n     Service return the agency's administrative appeals process to \n     exempt some salvage logging from the appeals that \n     environmentalists have used to block such harvests.\n       The team warned that efforts to do away with so-called \n     ``below-cost timber sales''--logging operations that cost \n     more to offer than the revenue they return--could harm forest \n     health programs.\n       Ann Bartuska, the Forest Service's director of forest pest \n     management who led the forest health team, said the USDA plan \n     ``was not intended to be a comprehensive look at forest \n     health; it was a snapshot.\n       ``It was a subset of the total package,'' she said. ``We \n     thought it was important to get started on some of these.''\n       Bartuska said the 5 million-acre estimate was based on \n     1,900 project sites that regional and forest supervisors \n     ``rapidly identified on the first go-round.'' The 330 \n     projects in the USDA plan represent the supervisors' top \n     priorities and will cover an estimated 1 million acres, she \n     said.\n\n  Mr. BURNS.

Mr. President, I rise to talk at length about the \nBipartisan Commission on Entitlements and Tax Reform, a subject that I \nbelieve eventually this body will be compelled to address. When it \ndoes, it will be, of necessity, a bipartisan effort. We will not get it \ndone if Democrats take advantage of Republicans, or vice versa. With \nthat in mind, I note with considerable pleasure, before talking at \nlength, that at a critical point during the debate on the unfunded \nmandate bill, an effort was made to place an amendment on the \nconstitutional amendment to balance budget that would have required us \nto, in the Constitution, separate Social Security from the rest of the \nbudget. That may make good policy sense at one level, but I was happy \nto join many Republicans in opposing that effort, as I was happy to \njoin in an effort to oppose but not defeat the sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution that followed.\n  It will take that kind of bipartisan effort if we are going to be \nable to address this issue. I note, for the record, that when the \nRepublican leader earlier commented that perhaps this 10 days was a \nwaste of time in debating this bill, I note for Americans that we are \ndebating the health and safety and security of their lives. This is not \na small issue. There is no economic imperative driving this \nlegislation. The Government is not about to go broke if we do not pass \nthis bill. I was proud to vote for this bill. I think it is a good \npiece of legislation. But the imperative to get it done right away is a \npolitical imperative, not economic.\n  I note as well, with great interest and concern, that out of 44 \namendments with rollcall votes on this particular piece of legislation, \nthere was only one time when a single Republican crossed the line and \nvoted for a Democratic amendment. That was on Senator Boxer's amendment \nto exempt child pornography. Even in that case, only the Senator from \nPennsylvania, Senator Specter, could cross the line and vote for a \nDemocratic amendment.\n  I must say, Mr. President, if we continue in that kind of forum with \nthe Republicans, joined by some people's measurement of admirable \nunity, while Democrats on almost every single amendment had to be \npersuaded to vote for the Democratic sponsor of an amendment, we are \nnot likely to continue making successful efforts in this body. The \nreason the unfunded mandate bill passed was that there was bipartisan \nsupport for the underlying effort. It was a good effort.\n  I hope that the actions, at least as I witnessed them, of \nunprecedented unity, as I might point out, unprecedented willingness to \nbasically say whatever you say, I will vote for it, do not continue as \nwe take up other matters.\n  Mr. President, the American people have heard a lot of speeches this \nweek about the future. I am here to add my voice to this clatter. I \nwant to talk about the year 2013. It is a long way off. It is in a \ncompletely different decade, a separate century, and new millennium. I \nsuspect most of us would rather think about matters that are more \ncurrent. But unless we take action to the contrary, Mr. President, \nsomething very important will happen that year.\n  Somewhere in America, a senior citizen will find in his or her \nmailbox the first check the Treasury of the United States ever financed \nout of the Social Security trust fund, a pot of money that we will, \nuntil that day, have saved for a rainy day. By the year 2029, 16 years \nlater, the drizzle of that first rainy day will have deteriorated into \na downpour--that is, if adjustments are not continued to be made in \nthat due date. It was just 7 years ago that that year 2029 was \nforecasted to be another 35 years later. In 17 years after the first \ncheck was cut with funds from the Social Security trust fund, another \nretiree will find in his or her mailbox the last check financed from \nthe Social Security trust fund.\n  Then the Social Security system and its much flaunted trust fund will \nbe bankrupt. Today a document will be delivered to the President of the \nUnited States and the leadership of Congress that describes that \nfuture--a future in which the Federal budget consumes nearly 40 percent \nof the economy, and every dollar we collect in taxes will go directly \nto fund entitlements and interest on the national debt. And our \nGovernment will be paralyzed and unable to do little but operate as an \noversized ATM machine whose only function is to collect money and hand \nit back out.\n  One of the arguments that was made, Mr. President, during the debate \nabout attaching a requirement that Social Security be funded as a \nseparate budget was that if a private sector trust fund was operated in \nthis fashion, the individual operating in the private sector would go \nto jail. Well, Mr. President, any private sector insurance company that \noperates the way we are operating two of the largest social insurance \nprograms in the world--Social Security and Medicare--any private sector \ncompany that operated insurance companies in the fashion that we \noperate, essentially ignore what the trustees are saying, which is what \nwe are doing.\n  In February of 1994, the trustees of the Social Security and Medicare \nfund delivered to the Congress and the President a report that said we \nshould take action sooner and not later, because we have promises on \nthe table that we simply cannot expect to be able to reasonably fund. \nThat is the way insurance companies operate, Mr. President. That is the \nway they operate.\n  Well, if a private sector company operated in that fashion, we would \nalso likely close them, shut them down.\n  That is the bad news. The good news is that in the same document, the \nfinal \n[[Page S1691]] report, the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax \nReform describes a brighter and bolder future for our country, a future \nin which our economy is stronger, our senior citizens more secure, and \nour treasury more solvent. The difference, Mr. President, is up to us. \nI am here today because I find the challenge of building a stronger \nfuture an invigorating one, and because I see the road ahead as one \npaved not with problems but with opportunities--opportunities to \nmodernize our retirement programs to meet the needs of a changed and \nchanging population, and to address some fundamental defects in our \neconomy.\n  Before getting to these changes, let me describe what necessitates \nthem. The American population is aging in a way that requires us to \nrethink the structure of our entitlement programs,\n the two largest of which, retirement and health care, were designed as \nsystems in which each generation of workers would pay taxes to support \nthe generations of retirees that preceded it. In return, each \ngeneration expects its successor in the work force to support their \nbenefits.\n\n  The system succeeds, provided that each generation has enough \nchildren to grow up and pay the taxes that support its benefits. Mine, \nMr. President, did not. Today, there are nearly five workers paying \ntaxes to support each retiree; when my generation retires, there will \nbe fewer than three. And, as life expectancies continue to expand, \nAmericans will collect more in lifetime benefits.\n  This is an unprecedented event, Mr. President. Those who caution that \nI am overstating the case, who say, ``Well, we have always waited until \nwe reached a crisis and then we fixed the problem,'' are urging us to \nignore the unprecedented nature of the baby boom population moving into \nretirement and the unprecedented nature, as well, of the changes that \nare going on in the underlying economy of the United States of America.\n  Quite plainly, Mr. President, the arithmetic, which not only our \nCommission has examined but the trustees of the Social Security and \nMedicare trust funds have said themselves, the arithmetic does not \ncompute. We will be able to support the aging population without \nimmediate consequences for three decades because we have built a \nmassive surplus in the Social Security trust fund.\n  Because in 1983, for the first time, we ended a pay-as-you-go system, \nimposing larger taxes than were necessary to pay-as-you-go on people \nthat are in the work force.\n  Now, one of the prevailing myths that always goes on--and we heard it \nagain in the debate about whether or not to keep Social Security \nseparate--is that Social Security is generating a surplus. I hear it \nall the time from people saying, ``Just keep your hands off of my \nSocial Security.''\n  Mr. President, that money comes from people who are in the work \nforce. And we, in 1983, imposed and, as a consequence of using that \nmoney, agreed to ask Americans in the work force, particularly those \nwho are paid by the hour, to shoulder a disproportionate share of \ndeficit reduction.\n  Our retirement entitlements, Mr. President, are in much better shape \nthan our health care system.\n  I have already described a crucial historical moment in the year 2013 \nand another in the year 2029. Again, it is not only likely but almost \nassured that those times will be closer than 2013 and 2029. Let me \ndescribe a few that will occur before that.\n  The first is in the year 2001. Mr. President, you can reach out and \ntouch that. That is not a long ways away, 2001. That is when the \nMedicare hospital insurance trust fund, the part A trust fund, soaked \nup by an aging population and escalating health care costs, goes \nbankrupt.\n  The second is in the year 2008, when the baby boomer generation \nbegins to retire. In a single decade, beginning at that moment, in my \nState, the overall population will go up by less than 2 percent, while \nthe retired population goes up by over 28 percent. That states the \nproblem right there. That refutes the common argument that is made, \n``Well, we faced this thing in the past. We will face it in the future. \nWe will just do as we have done previously.''\n  We cannot do as we have done previously, Mr. President, because we \nare facing something the likes of which we have not seen before.\n  In 2012, spending on entitlements and interest on the national debt \nwill consume every dollar we collect in taxes, leaving literally \nnothing for defense, infrastructure, law enforcement, or any other \nfunction of Government.\n  If those dates seem too distant to merit attention, consider a figure \nthat is right here and now. In Nebraska, as is true with most of the \nNation, the population for those who are retired over the age of 65 and \nthe population for those who are in our primary and secondary schools, \nthe K through 12 environment, is almost identical. There are 275,000 \nretirees in Nebraska, Mr. President, and another 275,000 children in \nkindergarten through the 12th grade. We spend $1.3 billion of revenue, \nof tax revenue--property and State sales and income taxes--about 8 \npercent of that comes from the Federal Government --on those kids. We \nspend $4.5 billion on retirees.\n  Mr. President, much more ominous than that, we are going to spend $50 \nmillion more incrementally on the kids and we are going to spend $400 \nmillion more on retirees.\n  I pause to say, I do not intend, nor do I urge on others, to engage \nin any intergenerational warfare. It is not necessary for us to \nexaggerate this problem, but it is unquestionably a problem. It is a \nproblem that gets worse as you examine the demographics. We do not need \nto look for a demon, for an enemy, for something that is causing this. \nIt is demographic. It is, in many ways, our own success.\n  The technology of health care gets more and more expensive, but the \ndisparity in investment is stark. In my opinion, Mr. President, we will \nhave dire implications for our future.\n  Fixing these problems and building a better future is a challenge \nbecause it requires those of us whose occupation teaches us to think in \n2-, 4- and 6-year cycles to think, instead, in decades and generations. \nMany of the benefits of entitlement reform will take hold in our \neconomy years after most of us leave this institution--if not this \nplanet--as will the consequences if we fail to act.\n  If our political cycle teaches us to think in terms of 6 years at the \nmost, the myopia of our budget cycle is worse. As families across \nAmerica evaluate their finances over decades, planning for education, \nfor retirement, for health care, their Government looks only 5 years \ninto the future and then turns its eyes away after that. The most \nimportant recommendation of the Commission on Entitlement and Tax \nReform may be the need to expand our budget cycle to include the \nconsequences of our action 25 and 30 years out.\n  We just passed a piece of legislation that requires us to think about \nthe costs that we impose upon States, Mr. President. It would be \nincumbent upon us, as well, to think about the costs that we impose \nupon future generations, not only with our current action but with our \ncurrent neglect.\n  We hear time and again that entitlement reform must be done, but we \nalways struggle to get the job done. And one of the reasons that that \noccurs, in my short and happy experience with dealing with this issue, \nis entitlements are typically not only misunderstood, but are highly \ncharged politically. People are vested in this program and they get \nvery upset and concerned and in an angry mood or hardly in the mood to \nlisten to reason. In addition, politicians very often turn a cloudy \nsituation downright muddy by intentionally describing entitlement \nprograms inaccurately.\n  We hear on Social Security time and time again this quote: ``Social \nSecurity isn't a problem. It's self-funded.'' Well, yes, it is self-\nfunded, but it is not self-funded by Saudi Arabia, it is not self-\nfunded by current beneficiaries. It is self-funded with a 12 percent \ntax on every American worker. Tomorrow is a different story, Mr. \nPresident. Tomorrow 12 percent will not get the job done.\n  Now what the Entitlement Commission is saying is that by the year \n2013, the entitlements and interest will consume every single dollar of \navailable tax revenue and will nearly double, by the year 2029, payroll \ntaxes if action is not taken soon to change these trends.\n   [[Page S1692]] Further, Mr. President, we distort our health care \nentitlements. I do not exaggerate, nor do I consider it particularly \nfunny, that I could have scored points in my recent reelection effort \nif I had asked my campaign consultant who did my television ads:\n\n       I would like you to produce a 30-second ad in which I will \n     go face on the camera and say, ``If reelected, I promise to \n     keep the Government out of your Medicare. I promise there \n     will be no big Government takeover of your Medicare \n     program.''\n\n  Time and time again, I have heard Members come to this floor and say, \n``I'm against national health insurance. I oppose the Clinton plan, \nbecause the Clinton plan represents national health insurance.''\n  Then come back to the floor within an hour sometimes opposing any \nchange in the Medicare Program, causing people to believe it is \nsomething other than what it is. Medicare is national health insurance \nbut only those who are 65 years of age and older are eligible. That is \nwhat it is. It is not a program like Social Security; it is not \nanywhere nearly as self-funded.\n  As I indicated earlier, not only is the program going to be \ninsolvent, part A, but over time we have required a larger and larger \namount of general fund subsidies to pay for physician services, and \nincreasingly, to pay for hospitalization as well.\n  Yet we continue to go out and pander to the audience. We do not want \nto antagonize the audience. They vote in large numbers, this audience, \nso we misrepresent the program. And it should not come as a surprise, \ntherefore, that Americans are confused about their health-care \nentitlements.\n  While I do not accept the rhetoric of those who describe entitlement \nreform as a process of pain rather than an opening of opportunities, \nthe fact remains it is also difficult because it requires the Senate on \noccasion to utter one of the most uncomfortable words to utter in this \ncity--that is the word ``no.'' Particularly to those who are apt to \nvote against us because we use that dreaded word.\n  We have, Mr. President, all the excuses we need to postpone action. \nLet me give a few reasons for acting today. The first and most \nimportant is that it is relatively easy to fix the problem today. \nTomorrow the fixes will be draconian. The Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, as the Secretary is required, every 4 years, has put together \nlast year a 13-person Commission that is examining Social Security, \nexamining Medicare, examining the disability insurance trust fund, \nexamining on behalf of the Secretary, as required by the Social \nSecurity law, and will make recommendations as to what action is \nrequired.\n  The people who staff and work for that Commission say that unless we \nput action in place in 1997, unless we change the law at the latest by \n1997, to take effect in 1998, we will begin--as our Commission says as \nwell--we are going to begin to see the size of this thing grow so \nquickly that we will look back and people will wonder, Americans will \nwonder, ``Well, for gosh sakes, why did you not take action when it was \nrelatively easy to fix?'' The answer will be, again, well, we budget \nfor 5 years, Mr. and Mrs. Citizen, and we get reelected for 2, 4, and 6 \nyears.\n  The second, taking action today means that we can fix the problems \nwith little or no impact on current retirees.\n  The third reason for acting today, Mr. President, is that planning \nfor our national future also means we can give American citizens, \nparticularly workers who are not currently retired, time to plan for \nthe changes.\n  Understanding the problem, what do we need to do to fix it? There are \nseveral options outlined in the report of our Commission. I would be \nremiss if I did not salute those who had the courage to submit their \nown ideas along with the distinguished Senator from Wyoming, Senator \nSimpson, who submitted a plan. I hope to be able to work to develop a \npiece of legislation that will give Americans an opportunity to say we \nsupport this specific piece of legislation. Most of the people who are \non this Commission had much to lose, particularly those who were \nelected and holding office had very little to gain, given the political \nclimate, by doing so.\n  I want to describe today some of the ideas that were laid out in this \ndocument by former Senator Jack Danforth and myself. Now I want to \nalert people, this is a proposal in motion. We hope to be able to make \nsome changes in it. I will go through this thing so that citizens \nunderstand that when we talk about entitlement reform, at some point it \ngets tough. And it gets tough in a hurry. It stops getting tough after \nwe deal with congressional retirement, which is one of the first things \non my list. After that it goes downhill in a hurry. There are no easy \nchoices. There are no choices that we can make where somebody is not \nfinding themselves, saying ``Oh, my gosh, this will require a change in \nmy life.''\n  Mr. President, we try to say we should lead by example. We tried to \nsay we need to have it fair and balanced and everyone participating. I \nbelieve, in fact, that generalized efforts to reduce discretionary \nspending will be good news, as well. It should lay the groundwork to \nmake entitlement reform easier, but it will not make entitlement reform \nin the end an easy piece of business.\n  We began with the premise that Congress must lead before asking the \nAmerican people to accept entitlement reform. For that reason, the \nKerry-Danforth proposal would cut in half the rate at which Members of \nCongress accrue pension benefits beginning in the year 1996. Also in \nthis spirit, we would bring retirement programs for Federal workers \nmore in line with private pensions. Other proposals offered in the \nspirit of putting the Government's house in order include raising the \nFederal retirement age to 62.\n  This proposal would gradually phase out eligibility for unreduced \nbenefits for Federal workers before age 60. Beginning in 2000, for \nworkers with at least 5 or fewer than 20 years of service, the \nretirement age for unreduced benefits for CSRS and FERS is increased by \n4 months each year until age 62 in the year 2020. We have additional \ndetails with this proposal, Mr. President.\n  The second thing we do is adjust the CSRS to high-5 pay.\n  Third, reduce the rate which military retirement benefits accrue.\n  The next thing we do, Mr. President, is to adjust the Consumer Price \nIndex calculation to better reflect inflation. I will spend a bit of \ntime with this, Mr. President, because it is a very key provision that \nhas gotten a great deal of attention in the news lately.\n  A number of Federal programs are adjusted annually, based on annual \nincreases in inflation as measured by the CPI. The CPI is based on a \nmarketbasket of goods and services purchased by a representative urban \nworker. Adjusted every 10 years, the current marketbasket was last \nrevised in 1987 using data for the period 1982 to 1984. As a result, \nthe CPI does not capture dynamic annual changes in the pattern of \nconsumer preferences.\n  In addition, the CPI may not adequately measure the consumer benefit \nderived from improvement and quality of existing goods or the \nintroduction of new goods. A number of economists have supported this \nchange. Most individuals who have looked at it say it is a reasonable, \nfair change. It is also one of the easier changes that we have to deal \nwith.\n  The next large category is an effort not just to preserve and \nstrengthen Social Security, Mr. President, but to begin to consider the \nother sources of retirement income that very often are neglected. There \nare three major sources of income that Americans look to for their \nretirement years. The first is Social Security. Twelve percent of \npayroll tax, 12 percent of payroll is collected. We all know how it \nworks. Comes into the Social Security trust. The trust is required to \ninvest only in Treasury bonds. The average rate of return is somewhere \nbetween 1 and 2 percent in real terms inflation adjusted. That is \nsource No. 1. Unfortunately, for many years, it is their only source of \nretirement, creating a real serious problem for individuals who are on \nfixed income, and that is their only source of retirement.\n  But the second large source of retirement, Mr. President, is private \npensions. Unfortunately, it appears that in the 1980's we took action \nin tax and in regulation that may have had a counterproductive effect, \nbecause we see a decline in private pensions being offered to \nemployees, particularly in small businesses, Mr. President. And \n[[Page S1693]] though the Kerry-Danforth proposal did not make a \nrecommendation in that regard, I, myself, am particularly interested in \nthe context of reforming our retirement programs to better suit the \nchanged and changing needs of our work force, to consider changing our \ntax and regulatory laws as they relate to private pensions.\n  The third source of retirement is individual savings. It has been \nnoted, and I will note it later, there has been a decline of savings in \nthe United States of America. There is a disproportionate amount of \nsavings in certain sectors of the economy. Obviously, it is true that \nif you make some $130,000 a year, as 535 Members of Congress do, that \nyou are apt to be able to save a lot more money than if you make \n$12,000 to $15,000 a year, as an awful lot of Americans do, or $8,000 a \nyear as an American living on the generous $4.25 minimum wage we \nprovide as a minimum standard for wages.\n  Those are the three sources of income that people have to consider.\n  I mention this lower income American, Mr. President, for a very \nspecific reason. We tried to make our proposals as progressive as \npossible. I am open to suggestions as to how we can make them more \nprogressive. They need to be. One of the blessings of living in the \ngreat State of Nebraska is that I have had the opportunity to acquire a \nfriendship with a man by the name of Warren Buffett, a local \nbusinessman that has done pretty well in life. And Warren Buffett once \nsaid to me one of the problems you have in dealing with these kind of \nissues and others like it where you are concerned about what is going \non in the work force is that at any point in time if you have 120 \nmillion people in the work force, which is approximately what we have \ntoday, 60 million will be above average, and 60 million will be below.\n  When you have a market, as we do today, that is international, and \nwhen you have technology ripping through the workplace increasing \nproductivity but reducing the number of people who need to work, what \nhappens is the market is bidding down large numbers of people and the \nservices that they deliver into that market.\n  It is a reality. There are very few workplace environments, Mr. \nPresident--Congress may be the exception--where workers are protected \nfrom the forces of the market. What happens, therefore, is that we have \na lot of people in this country who are in the work force who cannot \nafford health care, who are in the work force and even if we change our \ntax and regulatory policies simply are not going to have the resources \nto be able to save. It does not mean that tax change and regulatory \nchange is not needed. It just means that those of us who get $135,000 a \nyear in an environment where we are protected from the economic \nmarketplace need to be sensitive to the dilemma faced by lower-income \nindividuals.\n  The chief goal of the Kerrey-Danforth proposal is fulfilling our \npromises to today's retirees while ensuring the long-term health of \nSocial Security. I have already described the challenges that face the \nsystem. Our proposal for redressing these problems is among the most \nexciting in our entire plan.\n  We propose to make changes in the Social Security Program that enable \nus to reduce the employee payroll tax by 1.5 percent in exchange for a \nrevised long-term contract. It shifts more responsibility and control \nto the individual, provides opportunity for higher returns on \ninvestment, and allows us to return Social Security to its intended \npurpose, as a supplement to personal retirement savings.\n  Let me be clear, Mr. President--although there will be allegations to \nthe contrary--no reductions in Social Security benefits affect anyone \nover the age of 50, and no Social Security reductions are used to \nreduce the deficit. The savings we propose to Social Security would go \nback into the trust funds and strengthen the program. We would require \nthese younger workers to invest in the savings payroll tax cut in a \nmandatory IRA-type personal savings account.\n  Mr. President, I believe this simple and single change would alter \nthe culture of savings in America. Every young worker, when their first \njob is taken, whether they are 16, 17, 18, would have to come home to \nMom or to Dad and say, ``I have a 1\\1/2\\ percent decision to make.''\n  We were attacked by many when we put this proposal out. One of the \nthings you will hear later is we proposed to move the normal retirement \nage to 70 while keeping the reduced benefit age at 62. We were attacked \nby the Washington, DC, Chapter of the NAACP as almost being racist \nbecause black Americans have a shorter lifespan than white Americans \ndo.\n  We were attacked by many people in organized labor who said this is \ngoing to be bad for American workers. But I urge Senators and Members \nof Congress and Americans, in particular, before you buy that rhetoric, \nto examine what 1\\1/2\\ percent over the course of a working life in a \nsafe individual retirement account would do. It not only provides a \nhigher rate, but it provides the kind of flexibility that I think \nAmericans want in their retirement program.\n  Mr. President, this proposal has a number of important economic \nbenefits. Companies can save and invest more, grow faster, and have \nmore rapid improvements in the standards of living of their citizens.\n  Private savings in the United States of America have fallen from more \nthan 8 percent of the economy in the sixties to 5 percent today, and \nthe trend line is down; it is not at a plateau, it continues to \ndecline, perhaps because of tax and regulatory changes. But for \nwhatever the reason, the savings rate continues to decline. The Kerrey-\nDanforth proposal takes an important first step towards reversing this \ntrend.\n  More exciting, though, is the fact that this proposal gives workers \nmore control over planning for their own retirements by transferring \nauthority for these investments from the Government to the individual. \nThe return on these savings provides workers the potential for far more \nlifetime benefits than they can expect from the Social Security system \nif it continues on its current course. Thus, those who attacked our \nproposals need to compare the current system as most reasonable people \nwould expect is going to happen to it--and that is significant \nadjustments made out in the future--they need to compare the current \nsystem with the one that Senator Danforth and I are proposing.\n  Mr. President, this is a middle-class tax cut with both a purpose and \na payoff. We also propose over a period of 30 years to raise the \neligibility for full benefits from age 67 to 70, while still allowing \npartial benefits at age 62. This option accelerates the phasein to age \n67 that is already in current law. The age for full eligibility will \nreach 70 for those under age 28 today.\n  So for one who is thinking of going out this evening and interviewing \nsomebody and finding out, what do you think about this adjustment that \nSenators Kerrey and Danforth are proposing, please do not go out and \ninterview somebody over the age of 50; it does not affect them. Go \ninterview somebody under the age of 28. That is who this thing affects, \nand they are going to be affected mostly if no action is taken at all.\n  Mr. President, let me address a great misunderstanding about the \nprevious two proposals. The term we use to describe the age at which \nAmericans are eligible for full benefits, the term ``retirement age'' \nis very misleading. Americans do not want to retire at age 70. If \nanything, they want to retire early. They cannot do so, Mr. President. \nThey cannot mathematically do so without a substantial pool of private \nsavings.\n  The previous two proposals, therefore, are designed to increase an \nindividual's control over when they retire. Make no mistake, the age at \nwhich Americans retire is set by genetics, economics, and personal \npreference, not by statute. A low statutory retirement age means \nnothing for those who lack the savings to enjoy, and that is true for \nthe individual and it is also true for this Nation.\n  Our other proposal to restore solvency to the Social Security System \nis including State and local workers in the Social Security Program; \nindexing the Social security bend points for CPI instead of average \nwage growth; reducing growth of benefits to mid- and upper-wage workers \nusing a third bend point; and adjusting the CPI formula to better \nreflect inflation.\n  Mr. President, I have run through four or five things here to change \nour \n[[Page S1694]] Social Security system. None of these are easy. All of \nthem require us to think, first of all, in the context of an entire \nretirement program: of Social Security, of private pension, and of \nindividual savings.\n  We need to make adjustments in all three, and it requires us, most \nimportantly, to be able to look out 25 or 30 years to connect our \naction with our words. Rarely is there one of us who does not get up \nand give a speech and talk about our kids and grandchildren. If we do \nnot take the trustees' advice and take action to restore the strength \nof this program, in particular, then those who hear our words will \nwonder why it is not accurate to describe us as hypocrites.\n  In the area of health care and other entitlements, there are many \ncritics who oppose reform of Medicare and they point out correctly the \nfact that much of the increases in this program are due to escalating \nhealth care costs.\n  This concern is true enough, but it also ignores, at great peril, in \nmy judgment, the fact that in addition to higher health care costs, our \nhealth care entitlements are growing because more Americans are \nretiring and taking advantage of them.\n  Again, there is no enemy. I am not pointing at seniors and saying: \nYou are the problem. We have a big demographic change that is \noccurring, and the simple way of saying it is our generation did not \nhave as many children as our parents thought we were going to have.\n  (Mr. FRIST assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, the fact is that Medicare spending will \ncontinue to skyrocket due to an aging population, even in the \nmiraculous event that Federal health care costs were held to the rate \nof inflation--highly unlikely. Any time anybody gets close to looking \nat that, I note with some disappointment, some considerable \ndisappointment the President saying no Medicare reductions can be used \nfor deficit reduction. But any time you get close to making changes \nthat would keep Medicare, the Federal costs going at the rate of \ninflation, we get providers coming in--the distinguished occupant of \nthe chair, I am sure, has heard his cohorts talk about what happens \nwhen we reduce reimbursements under Medicare. We get hospitals coming \nin here. We get all sorts of people coming in here telling us about the \nterrible things that happen. Even if it miraculously occurred that the \ngrowth of the Federal program stayed at the rate of inflation, it would \nstill be a substantial increase in the program merely because, as I \nsaid, of the tremendous demographic change.\n  The Kerrey-Danforth proposal tries to fairly and evenly control the \ngrowth of entitlement programs. We allow Medicare beneficiaries to buy \ninto risk-adjusted pools. We try to apportion the increase, the wedge \nthat we see coming, between adjustments in what is paid to providers, \nadjustments in what the beneficiaries themselves pay in, and we say the \ngeneral fund can pick up approximately a third of it, as well. We try \nto apportion the changes that are required between all three of those \nsources.\n  In the area of other entitlements, Mr. President, we use, as I \nindicated earlier, an adjustment in the CPI, a different CPI to better \nreflect inflation. This proposal would apply to all other entitlements \nincluding veteran's compensation. We take a rather difficult but I \nthink correct action of means testing Medicare, veterans compensation, \nand unemployment insurance. It is phased in. It is difficult, I know, \nbut I believe if Americans examine the details of this proposal, they \nwill see that we are not taking away a benefit that is offered. A \nperson like myself that was service-connected disabled, that was \nwounded and injured in the war in Vietnam, you do not take away my \nbenefit. You merely say that if my income comes up, the size of the \nbenefit, I think most appropriately, would be reduced.\n  In the third area, Mr. President, the area of tax expenditures, we \nmake some recommended changes, as well. I note with some amusement and \nconcern, every time we talk about entitlements, tax expenditures are a \nreal favorite target. But when the rubber meets the road and it comes \ntime to put them on the list, it is awfully difficult to find much \nenthusiasm for doing it because they do unquestionably have a historic \nimpact upon people.\n  The Kerrey-Danforth plan suggested that we limit itemized deductions \nto 27 percent. The adjusted CPI that I described earlier would apply to \nincome taxes, standard deductions and personal exemptions. We cap the \nemployer-paid health insurance deduction, a proposal that is consistent \nwith our belief that we ought to move in a direction where individuals \nare taking more responsibility for making price and quality decisions \nin the health care market as opposed to having the Government make \nthose decisions for them.\n  Mr. President, these are the long and the short--a bit long--of the \nproposals that the Kerrey-Danforth solution has. They were extremely \ncontroversial at the time. They were greeted with almost unanimous \nopposition from most of the interest groups that were affected. We were \ndescribed in not altogether complimentary terms by most of these \norganizations, many of which I think are doing an awfully good job and \nare trying to protect their programs. I say to them with great \nsincerity that I want to protect these programs as well. Inaction does \nnot protect them. Our proposal is not a proposal that destroys Social \nSecurity. It strengthens Social Security. We are responding to the \nchallenge of the trustees.\n  Now, there may be Members who want to come down here and raise taxes. \nMaybe that is the solution you want to propose. Well, propose the \nsolution. You can come at this problem and solve it whether you are a \nliberal or a moderate or a conservative. Any ideology can solve this \nproblem. You cannot solve the problem, though, if you are afraid of the \nconsequences of proposing a solution.\n  So I say let the debate begin. But let us not stop the debate merely \nbecause there was strong and vocal opposition at the first proposal out \nof the box to solve it, Mr. President. I say again with great sincerity \nthat if we delay on this and wait, we are going to be alarmed by the \nconsequences.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to show--I will use one of the rare \ncharts that I put up in the Chamber--the future as described by current \nlaw, which is what this chart over here is. And I do this for the \npurpose of saying to Americans who wonder what is in this for me, what \nis going to happen, we are proposing to make changes in retirement and \nhealth care, what happens in the future.\n  Mr. President, this is the future of current law. This the future of \nKerrey-Danforth were it enacted just as it is. I do not hold any \nillusions it is going to be enacted just as it is. I have already had \nsome suggestions made to me that I think are altogether good and \nreasonable, and I have indicated you can solve this with a liberal, \nmoderate, or conservative ideology. And I suspect that those ideologies \nwill be expressed when and if--and I hope it is soon--this floor and \nthe House as well begin to engage in what ought to be done.\n  What it shows is that this future of current law becomes this future. \nThis is very important, Mr. President. These bar charts are not just \nbar charts. They are our economy. This green line here represents the \nhistorical rate of taxation in America.\n  One of the few things that has remained constant in Washington, DC, \nis the approximate rate of taxation. Measured as a percent of our \nentire economy, it has stayed at about 19 percent. It has gone up to \nover 20 percent during World War II, spikes up a little bit during the \nwar in Vietnam, but all the rest of the time it has stayed at about 19 \npercent.\n  Now, again, maybe someone comes down here and says, gee, I think the \nrate of taxation ought to be 25 percent. Let them argue that. That is \nfine. Let them argue. But let the majority decide what we think is the \nrate of taxation. And it appears that the majority, going from liberal \nto conservative Congresses--and we have been all over the place on \nthis--it appears that the majority of Americans have kind of settled \nin, perhaps without intent, but they have settled in at about a 19 \npercent rate of taxation.\n  Here is where we are today, Mr. President, 1995, with a deficit of \nabout 3 percent. The red line is entitlements; the blue line is net \ninterest. And what \n[[Page S1695]] you can see is the red and the blue line together begin \nto move up.\n  This is where I was saying earlier that in the year 2013, \nentitlements and net interest consume everything that is available.\n  Again, maybe in 2013 we are going to have a Congress saying we were \nelected on a promise to raise taxes. Maybe it will happen. I doubt it, \nbut maybe it will happen. Maybe in 15 years Americans will say: They \nkept our taxes down 18 years; now we are really ready to raise them up \nagain. Let's jack them up 5 percent of GDP and suck up these new \nentitlements out here and add a bunch of discretionary programs on top.\n  I think it is unlikely, Mr. President. What that means is you could \neliminate all the discretionary spending, which we may end up doing. \nThe discretionary spending went down last year. It is going to go down \nagain, while entitlements are going to go up $50 billion and health \ncare and retirement is almost the entire piece of that. We are going to \nwhack the discretionary spending one more time, and that is going to \ncontinue until and unless we face it.\n  Under our proposal, this levels out, as I point out to Members and to \ncitizens, if we do not even balance the budget. You still have to do \nmore if that is what you want, to balance the budget. But we get within \nstriking distance. You can do it with discretionary spending after \nthat. It is not a discretionary spending commission. We did not address \nthe problem of discretionary spending. The purpose of this commission \nwas not to make recommendations to balance the budget but to get the \ntwo large insurance programs, the retirement and the health care \nprograms, in balance so that we could say to the trustees that we in \nthe Congress have taken action to bring these accounts into long-term \nbalance.\n  This rather confusing chart shows what happens just with the Social \nSecurity trust funds. Again, this is the most controversial one of all. \nThis is one the Speaker says we are going to leave off the table; the \nPresident says we will leave it off the table; everyone says we will \nleave it off the table. We will deal with it sometime out there in the \nfuture. Maybe in 2000, when the third millennium arrives, that is when \nwe are going to deal with it.\n  There was a lot of wailing and gnashing of teeth earlier when we had \nthat amendment on the balanced budget, but fortunately it was defeated. \nHere is the fact. This is what is going on out there in the future. So \nwhen you are out there talking about your kids, my kids are 20 and 18. \nMy kids are 20 years old and 18 years old. And this is the kind of \nfuture they face. This is what they are looking at. It is fine for me. \nI am in good shape. It is fine for me until the year 2029. And mark my \nwords, the trustees, in my judgment, are going to come back and say \nsometime later this year it is now not 2029; it is 2024. They have been \nmoving this due date closer and closer since we recently fixed it.\n  That is the future under the Kerrey-Danforth proposal. You may have a \nmore liberal proposal that says no, no, no, Senator; we want to raise \ntaxes.\n  Bring it down here. Let us vote on it. Let us vote to consider some \nalternative to this. I do not mind that at all. But ignore this problem \nat not just your peril but our peril, and I predict that in 1997 or \n1998, we are going to begin to hear some very, very serious statements \nmade about what is going to happen by more and more people if we do not \ntake action.\n  I hope that this entitlement commission report that we are delivering \nto the President and to the leadership will be given consideration \nbecause this kind of a future will change America as we know it today.\n  We will be able to say to our kids and our grandkids: Yes, Social \nSecurity will be there for you. Yes, Medicare will be there for you.\n  But just as important, ask an economist, ask Alan Greenspan, if you \nare on the Banking Committee or on the Joint Economic Committee, the \nnext time he comes before you. Ask him directly what happens if this \nkind of future is enacted. What happens if the Kerrey-Danforth plan or \nsome modification that achieves the same effect, what happens if that \ntakes place? I will predict to you he is going to say that long-term \ninterest rates go down at least 200 basis points, or 2 percent, and \nmaybe as much as 4 percent.\n  It is this inflationary expectation that is causing the bond market \nstill to bid up the long-term price of money. If we could get that kind \nof action taken quickly, we would continue the economic recovery. It \nwould enable us to keep interest rates low, employ more people, allow \nus to build up our skills and our wages, and get the standard of living \nrising, as most Americans want, and probably, although we have not put \na pencil to this and calculated it, probably produce the opposite of \nwhat we have right now, which is compounding interest working against \nus. We could probably get compounding interest working in our favor and \nfind ourselves with good news, possibly able to adjust taxes down or \nmake some other extension out there so that Americans would say: Gee, \nthis is a payoff, a good payoff, for having made the tough decisions.\n  I will close by saying I am very grateful for the leadership that \nSenator Danforth put in on this and all the other members of this \nBipartisan Commission on Entitlements and Tax Reform. I am very much \nappreciative and sensitive to the political problems surrounding this \nissue.\n  One of the things I have learned in this is it does not do any good, \nI believe, when you are discussing this, to hyperventilate and \nexaggerate the impact. We have attempted to present the facts. I have \nnot said in any of this discussion: America is going to go bankrupt. We \nwill not go bankrupt. We may devalue our currency, but we are not going \nto go bankrupt. We are just not going to be able to fulfill a \ngenerational promise we made.\n  We are not sitting here saying Social Security is broke. It is not a \nshort-term crisis. We are saying we are operating a very large \ninsurance fund and we ought, on behalf of future beneficiaries, to make \nadjustments today so they get the promises that are currently on the \ntable and that we ought to make long-term planning a part of our \nthinking. As difficult as it might be, we ought to make that long-term \nplanning a part of our thinking.\n  We have also suggested that we make incremental reform, incremental \nsteps towards changing both our retirement and our health care \nprograms. I have been more explicit on the retirement programs than I \nhave on the health care programs. But as I see it, there are four large \nentitlement programs in America. By ``large''--I define large to be \n$200 billion plus. Three of them are Federal: That is Federal \nretirement, Federal health care, and Federal tax entitlements. There is \na debate about whether or not taxes are entitlements. The fourth is K \nthrough 12 education. You are entitled to that as well, but that is a \nState and mostly local issue.\n  I am saying we should use this opportunity. As we solve this long-\nterm structural problem--as we solve the long-term actuarial problem, \nas the insurance folks call it--we ought to consider making changes in \nour regulation in our taxes, particularly as it relates to retirement, \nso we will provide Americans with the opportunity to acquire more \nprivate pensions and a larger pool of private savings as well.\n  I intend to repetitively come and try to make the point. I hope \nAmericans understand that there will be concerted effort in the U.S. \nSenate and in the House of Representatives to try to give Americans a \nlegislative vehicle they can rally behind, a specific set of \nrecommendations that are open to amendment, open to changes, open to \nany suggestions that might improve it, and change the future as we are \ncurrently heading upon it.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/27/senate-section/article/S1690-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1695-S1696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   COMMENDATION OF SENATORS AND STAFF\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, after 11 days of debate we finally had \npassage of S. 1, a Senate bill which will curb unfunded Federal \nmandates. I think, as you can well appreciate, after 11 days and \noftentimes 12 hours a day, we really have said quite a bit about S. 1, \nso in my closing comments, I would like to say what has not been said \nwhich are just some thank-you's for a lot of folks who worked very, \nvery hard for this fundamental change in how this institution of \nCongress will operate under S. 1.\n   [[Page S1696]] I want to thank Senator Dole, the majority leader, \nwho designated it S. 1, demonstrating with his leadership and with his \nconviction that this is the sort of new partnership that he wants to \nsee ordered in a federalist system where local, State, and National \nGovernment works in partnership, not one dictating to the other from \nthe Federal level down.\n  I thank Senator Roth and Senator Domenici--Senator Roth, of course, \nis the chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee; Senator Domenici \nis the chairman of the Budget Committee--for all their efforts during \nthe winter recess and their help in crafting this legislation.\n  During that period of time, also, Senator Exon, who is the ranking \nmember on the Budget Committee, and his staff were very helpful. I \nthink, with Senator Exon being a former Governor, he knows how \nimportant this is.\n  Senator Levin, during the course of 11 days, certainly provided a \ngreat deal of input, a number of amendments that really we found quite \nacceptable that I think will enhance the bill. So I appreciate Senator \nLevin's efforts on that.\n  Senator Byrd was certainly conscientious as we proceeded through this \nentire process. He offered an amendment which I think is a key \namendment, which really strengthens this bill.\n  Then the Senator who I will now reference, the Senator from Ohio, \nSenator Glenn, who has been a great partner in this whole effort. I \nthink what is significant is that in the last session, the 103d session \nof Congress, when the Democrats were in the majority and when he was \nthe chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee and before unfunded \nmandates was a household term, Senator Glenn realized that we needed to \ndo something about that and so we crafted legislation. But it was his \npartnership, as we worked through this, that I think really helped us \nin a major way get to today, the fact we are going to provide to the \nAmerican public, to the taxpayers, relief from these unfunded Federal \nmandates on the State and local governments. The mayors can now be the \nmayors they were elected to be. Governors can now be the Governors they \nwere elected to be.\n  I think often of that quote from Ben Nelson, the Governor of \nNebraska, who said he was elected Governor of Nebraska, not the \nadministrator of Federal programs in Nebraska.\n  But I just have always been a great admirer of John Glenn's. Working \nclosely with him, when you work that many hours together, you really, I \nthink, determine the essence of an individual.\n  It has been a honor, literally, standing at your side and I \nappreciate all of your help on S. 1.\n  I also would like to acknowledge some folks that I think too often we \ndo not say enough about, and that is the staff that helped us. On my \nstaff, Buster Fawcett, who is my legislative director and really was \nthe architect of the language of this, and Gary Smith, who worked with \nthe State and local officials throughout the country in coordinating \ntheir desires and wishes in the legislation and their support for this.\n  Both Buzz and Gary served with me when I was the mayor of Boise, ID. \nBuzz was the city attorney and Gary was the administrative assistant. \nWe brought the team with us to Washington, DC.\n  We have added to that team Brian Waidmann, who is now my \nadministrative assistant. But his understanding of the process and his \nmethodical approach was instrumental in getting us here and Wendy \nGuisto, also of my staff, who helped us with the research.\n  On Senator Dole's staff, we cannot say enough about Elizabeth Greene, \nwho was just tremendous in helping us as we needed to understand the \ndifferent aspects of this process; and David Taylor, a young man who \njust has a grasp of where the end line is and what it takes to get \nthere in a fashion that others respect, and, yet, you get there in a \nfashion that no one feels that they have been upset, upset in getting \nthe job done.\n  Senator Domenici's staff, Bill Hoagland, Austin Smythe, Jennifer \nSmith, and Anne Miller just played a key role with the intelligence \nthat they have about this whole process; and Senator Roth's staff, \nFrank Polk and John Mercer, with their working relationship and \nunderstanding of how Government should work; Senator Glenn's staff, \nSebastian O'Kelly, Larry Novey, and Leonard Weiss.\n  We have come to know these people and to respect them, and I think it \nis demonstrated that there is a bipartisan spirit here that can and \nshould work.\n  Senator Byrd's office, Jim English, and Senator Exon's office, Bill \nDauster.\n  Senator Hatch's staff: Ed Whelan provided superb advice on the \nconstitutional aspects of this legislation.\n  Senator Brown's staff: Bennett Railey also provided expert legal \nadvice and often on very short notice.\n  Senate Labor Committee staff: Steve Solon and Ted Verheggen provided \nexcellent help on labor law issues.\n  Republican Cloakroom staff: Brad Holsclaw, Sarah Whittaker, Hillary \nNewlin, Mike Smythers, John Doney, Dave Schiappa, Ky Fullerton, and \nDick Gibbons.\n  Democratic staff: Marty Paone, Lula Davis, Arthur Cameron, and Kelly \nRiordan.\n  Legislative clerks: Scott Bates, Dave Tinsley, and Kathie Alvarez.\n  Journal clerks: Bill Lackey, Mark Lacovara, and Patrick Keating.\n  Parliamentarians: Bob Dove, Alan Frumin, Kevin Kayes, and Beth Ann \nSmerko.\n  Elizabeth MacDonough of the Official Reporter's Office.\n  Pages: Bethany S.

I am grateful, and I was \nwell served.\n  Finally, I want to thank the citizens of Idaho for the opportunity \nthey have given me in serving in the Senate. I hope they will take a \nsmall measure of pride that the effort to reform unfunded mandates was \nborn in Idaho.\n  Mr. President, again, I thank all who participated with us.\n  I also want to acknowledge and thank my wife, Patricia, and my kids, \nHeather and Jeff, because for many nights the closest they got to dad \nwas watching C-SPAN. Anyway, I will be home tonight.\n  I thank the people from Idaho, because I appreciate the honor of \nserving them. They are people who are straightforward. That are honest \nand sincere. They just said, ``Why don't you go back there and do a job \nfor us, and not on us.'' And I think that is what we accomplished here \nwith Senate bill 1.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I am particularly appreciative of the \nremarks of my distinguished colleague from Idaho. He was not on the \nfloor when I made my remarks about him a little while ago.

Mr. President, Wednesday, January 25 was a sad and somber \nday in southern Ohio. On that day, America lost a patriot, Ross County \nlost a legend, and I lost a friend. Bob Badgley was one of my earliest \nand strongest political supporters--and he came to be a good and dear \npersonal friend as well. Over the years, I called on ``Badge'' often \nfor advice and counsel. He was 76 years young when he passed away on \nWednesday, and I know his hundreds of friends--indeed thousands--around \nthe State are going to miss him as much as I already do.\n  Although Badge never aspired to hold high public or elective office \nhimself, he devoted countless hours to myriad volunteer activities that \nbenefited his State, his community, and the Democratic Party that he \nloved so much for so long. On Tuesday, President Clinton delivered his \nState of the Union address. I don't know whether Bob was \n[[Page S1697]] watching that speech on what proved to be the last night \nof Bob's life, but I hope he was. Because when the President recognized \nand lauded citizen involvement, he was saluting Bob Badgley and the \nkind of life he lived--and I know that would have made Badge smile.\n  These days, I know it has become fashionable to be cynical about \npolitics and all things political; to be suspicious about the motives \nof anyone who would willingly involve themselves in the political \nprocess of our Nation. But Bob believed that if we want good \ngovernment, we have to be willing to help bring it about. And he \nbelieved that we all have a responsibility to try. So Bob served as \nChairman of the Ross County Democratic Party; he served on that county \nparty's executive committee continuously since 1957, and at the time of \nhis death, he had served 29 years on the Ross County Board of \nElections.\n  Somehow, he also found time to run his own electronics and vending \nbusinesses, and to be active in the Ross County Senior Citizens Center \nand related community services. In fact, Badge devoted so much time to \ncommunity service that he received the Humanitarian Award from the \nChillocothe Businessmen's Association in 1973, and the Community \nService Award from the Ohio Department of Aging in 1992--the only Ross \ncountian ever to receive the latter award.\n  Mr. President, there is a little story I want to tell about Bob that \nhappened recently. I had my family out at Vail, CO, for a skiing \nvacation over the holidays. We came back to Washington a couple of days \nbefore we were to go back in session in early January. I think we came \nback on New Year's day. On our telephone answering machine at home \nthere was a recorded message left. It was from Bob Badgley to Annie and \nto me. He said that he and Jeanne, his wife, had just been sitting \naround talking about particular friends and what they meant, and he \nthought it was a good time to call and just tell us what it meant. And \nhe did so on that recording, and it meant much to me and I made a \nlittle note and had a note on my desk to call him back. Because of \nduties here in the Senate, being so busy in the next few weeks or so, I \nhad not called. The note is still over there on my desk for me to call \nBob Badgley. So it was particularly poignant for me when I heard of his \ndemise the other evening.\n  For all these reasons and more, Annie and I will miss Bob deeply. But \nwe are grateful to have known him, and that the good Lord allowed Badge \nto touch our lives. And we hope that for his wife Jeanne--and for the \nentire Badgley family--it will be at least some consolation to know \nthat Bob will live forever in our hearts and in our memories. In that \nmost important sense, we will truly never lose, our Badge.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, of the many novel ideas which we \nassociate with the advent to office of Representative Newt Gingrich as \nSpeaker of the House, none is more singular than his suggestion that we \nwould all do well to read, or perhaps reread, ``The Federalist.'' As a \nNew Yorker, I much applaud the proposal, and would presume on the \nSenate's time to invoke that venerable tradition in the context of the \ncurrent debate over the proposed United States guarantee of Mexican \ndebt.\n  The most striking, at least to my mind, of those 85 essays by James \nMadison, Alexander Hamilton, and John Jay is the assertion that the \nproposed new Constitution was based on a ``new science of politics.'' \nIf I may cite a commentary of my own, written some years ago, the \nestablishment of the American Government in the latter part of the 18th \ncentury took its foremost distinction from the belief of those involved \nthat they were acting upon scientific principles. Hamilton noted, in \nthe ninth ``Federalist,'' that previous republics had had such stormy \nhistories that republicanism had admittedly fallen somewhat into \ndisrepute. This tendency could be overcome thanks to progress in \npolitical science:\n\n       The science of politics * * * like most other sciences, has \n     received great improvement. The efficacy of various \n     principles is now well understood, which were either not \n     known at all, or imperfectly known to the ancient.\n\n  He went on to cite, as examples of new discoveries, the various \nconstitutional provisions with which we are now familiar, separation of \npowers, the system of checks and balances, popular representation in \nthe legislature, the independent judiciary, and so on.\n  How exactly had the ``efficacy of various principles'' come to be so \n``well understood''? By scientific method, of course. Which is to say, \nthe deductive analysis of available data. Which, in turn, is to say the \nstudy of different systems of government which had prevailed at \ndifferent times and places in the past.\n  No. 18:\n\n       Among the confederacies of antiquity, the most considerable \n     was that of the Grecian Republics associated under the \n     Amphyctionic Council.\n\n  No. 17 (by Hamilton, naturally):\n\n       When the sovereign happened to be a man of vigorous and \n     warlike temper and of superior abilities, he would acquire a \n     personal weight and influence. * * * Among other \n     illustrations of [this] * * * truth which might be cited \n     Scotland will furnish a cogent example. The spirit of \n     clanship which was at an early day introduced into that \n     kingdom, uniting the nobles and their dependents by ties \n     equivalent to those of kindred, rendered the aristocracy a \n     constant overmatch for the power of the monarch; till the \n     incorporation with England subdued its fierce and \n     ungovernable spirit, and reduced it within those rules of \n     subordination, which a more rational and a more energetic \n     system of civil polity had previously established in the \n     latter kingdom.\n\n  No. 19:\n\n       The examples of ancient confederacies * * * have not \n     exhausted the source of experimental instruction on this \n     subject. There are existing institutions, founded on a \n     similar principle, which merit particular consideration. The \n     first which presents itself is the Germanic Body.\n\n  This is but a sampler. ``The Federalist'' abounds in analysis of the \nprinciples on which different states are founded, and the successes or \nfailures, the strengths and weaknesses associated with each.\n  It is an unequaled analytic tradition. The more troublesome, then, is \nits disappearance in our time. Notably in the matter of our relations \nwith the State of Mexico.\n  From the time it was first proposed that we enter a free-trade \nagreement with Mexico, I have objected for a single reason.\n  Mexico is a Leninist State.\n  The Leninist State is the most noteworthy, if calamitous, political \ninvention of the 20th century. Having just come through a 70-year \nstruggle with the original such State, formed as the Union of Soviet \nSocialist\n Republics, you would suppose we would be able to recognize one on our \nsouthern border. But then you might suppose many things about the \nanalytic reach of the Department of State and of Treasury, only to be \ndisappointed. Note that the American Labor movement had no such \ndifficulty.\n\n  Let me hasten to state that Leninist principles were never fully \ndeployed in Mexico. There was no Great Terror. Even so, ``Americas \nWatch'' records in a 1992 assessment that ``torture is endemic'' in \nMexico. Which is to say, State torture. Political opponents are \nmurdered. Elections are propaganda exercises, and so forth.\n  The central principle of the Leninist State is that a single \npolitical party holds sway over the whole of society, and in \nparticular, governs the government. We know from the Soviet experience, \nand for that matter from the Mexican experience, that this is never \nwholly successful. Yet it is the principle. Hence, the Partido \nRevolucionario Institucional. Literally translated, the Party of the \nInstitutional Revolution.\n  The simple fact is that the Russian Revolution made a great \nimpression in Mexico--as it did in the United States and most countries \nin the world. But unlike most, Mexico set out to reproduce the Soviet \nmodel. So much that when Trotsky fled the Soviet Union, now controlled \nby Stalin, he did not settle in Paris, as failed revolutionaries were \nexpected to do; he went instead to Mexico City. Upon his arrival in \n1937, Trotsky saw that Mexico was a \n[[Page S1698]] place where he could continue his work. Here was an \nimportant battleground in the struggle to win international support for \nMarxism. He wrote:\n\n       Of all the Spanish-speaking countries, Mexico is virtually \n     the only one where the necessary freedom exists for the \n     dissemination of the Marxist word. This international \n     situation assigns a leading role to Mexican Marxists not just \n     with respect to Latin America, but with respect to Spain \n     itself, as well the growing Spanish emigration to all \n     countries of the Old and New World. * * * History has \n     assigned serious responsibilities to Mexican Marxists.\n\n  Stalin, of course, pursued him. But Trotsky's myth persists in \nMexico. This from the August 27, 1990, issue of Newsweek:\n\n       Leon Trotsky? The man who applauded the arrest of dissident \n     factions of the dawn of the Russian Revolution? The military \n     commissar who argued for the coercion of workers into \n     industry and preached that the Soviet Union should be a \n     springboard for world revolution? This week, on the 50th \n     anniversary of his assassination at the order of Joseph \n     Stalin, Leon Trotsky is being hailed in Mexico as a prophet \n     of perestroika, an avatar of socialism with a human face. The \n     Mexico City government has spent more than $100,000 to \n     restore the house where Trotsky died; the elaborate ceremony \n     to make its reopening this week was to be presided over by \n     the mayor. ``This anniversary * * * is our chance to show \n     that socialism still has validity,'' Aguilar insists, ``that \n     it can still be identified with human rights.'' Exclaims \n     political scientist Paulina Fernandez: ``Trotsky represents a \n     badge of honor for communism today.''\n\n  This may seem sentimental and harmless; and to a degree it was. But \nin foreign affairs, for example, the Government of Mexico made itself a \nfirm ally of Marxist causes throughout the cold war. At the United \nNations it would occasionally vote with the United States, mostly by \naccident. But in General Assembly votes 1975-90, it voted with the \nWarsaw Pact 90.3 percent of the time. I was present as U.S. \nRepresentative in 1975 when Mexico joined the Soviet Union and 70 of \nthe most obnoxious dictatorships in the world in the infamous \nResolution 3370, declaring Zionism to be a form of racism. Mexico had \nno part in the quarrels of the Middle East, but that was the party line \nand the Partido Revolucionario Institucional toed it.\n  Mind, by 1990 the Leninist regime in Mexico was coming apart, much as \nit was in Russia. The regime had long since become corrupt; rather, the \ncorruption had long since become evident. A kind of division of the \nspoils took place. Intellectuals were given foreign policy. Viva Fidel \nand all that. Entrepreneurs were given industry--such that in 1993, \nPresident Salinas could hold a fundraising dinner at $25 million a \nplate. Party bosses were given various fiefdoms--to use a feudal term--\nprobably including portions of the drug traffic. And so it went. \nWorkers got little; peasants got nothing.\n  Then reform appeared.\n  The central organizing principle of the P.R.I., one which had indeed \nbrought stability to the Mexican State after decades of bloody chaos, \nwas the single term, 6-year Presidency. In 1988, the P.R.I. chose \nCarlos Salinas de Gortari, who had earned a Ph.D. in government at \nHarvard. Others like him appeared in Mexican Government circles. It is \nnot clear to me how much they rejected the Leninist model of the \nMexican State. Surely they accommodated it; almost certainly, however, \nthey recognized that it didn't work well. In the Leninist tradition, if \nyou will, this brought about vicious intraparty conflict. To succeed \nSalinas, the P.R.I. chose Luis Donaldo Colosio, who attended the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania, to be the next President of Mexico--this \nchoice was probably dictated by Salinas, one of the inducements to \ngiving up office in the Mexican manner is the power to choose one's \nsuccessor--Colosio was assassinated in Tijuana in March, 1994. Among \nthose subsequently arrested were local P.R.I. opponents of Colosio. \nProbably in the same pattern, in September, 1994, Jose Francisco Ruiz \nMassieu, the reform minded Secretary-General of the P.R.I., was \nassassinated in Mexico City. The main suspect has evidently implicated \nother P.R.I. officials in the killing. In the meantime, in Chiapas, \nfollowers, or descendants, or what you will, of Emiliano Zapata brought \nabout an internal rebellion. Zapata, who had written in 1918:\n\n       Much would we gain, much would human justice gain, if all \n     the people of our America and all the nations of old Europe \n     should understand that the cause of revolutionary Mexico and \n     the cause of Russia, the unredeemed, are and represent the \n     cause of humanity, the supreme interest of all oppressed \n     people. * * * It is not strange, for this reason that the \n     proletariat of the world applauds and admires the Russian \n     Revolution in the same manner as it will lend its complete \n     adhesion, sympathy and support to the Mexican Revolution once \n     it fully comprehends its objectives.\n\n  That was then. It is now 1994. Mexico has entered into a free-trade \nagreement with the United States and Canada. There will be a \nPresidential election in August. The regime is in peril. A fixed \nexchange rate is maintained to ensure a large inflow of U.S. consumer \ngoods to produce a sufficiently satisfied electorate. A huge foreign \ndebt ensues. Followed in turn by devaluation and the present crisis of \n1995.\n  Surely, this could have been anticipated as a possible if not \nprobable sequence. It was not. Two successive administrations went \nforward with NAFTA with the same confidence that had attended our \nearlier free-trade agreement with Canada.\n  I have no explanation for this. None has been proffered--note that \nA.M. Rosenthal argues in this morning's Times that there is a need for \ntestimony under oath. A plausible explanation would be that our policy \nmakers looked upon Mexico as a typical Third World economy which had \nadopted a policy of import substitution as a means towards industrial \ndevelopment. This was common enough economic strategy in the \npostcolonial period. Charles P. Kindleberger notes that it was indeed \nthe much respected prescription of eminent economists such as Raul \nPrebisch of Argentina and Gunnar Myrdal of Sweden. India would be a \ngood example of a democratic developing nation that opted for this \nstrategy. By the beginning of the 1990's, however, the Indian \nGovernment was changing its view--even as at the beginning of the \n1980's it had faced a foreign exchange crisis.\n  Surely, Mexican Government officials, under the influence in part at \nleast of American economists, had also begun to change. The collapse of \nthe Soviet Union hastened this appreciation in the value of American \ndegrees. Just this Monday a poor fellow was ousted from President \nZedillo's cabinet for having falsely claimed to have a doctorate from \nHarvard. But old habits die hard in a still theoretically one-party \nState. A free-trade agreement necessitates a flexible exchange rate to \ncorrect imbalances in the flow of imports and exports. Even so, the \nSalinas government maintained a fixed exchange rate until after the \nelection. Then came the crash.\n  At this point I would like to make a seemingly contradictory \nargument. I opposed NAFTA. First, I voted against President Bush's \nrequest for ``fast track'' authority. Then, in 1993, I voted against \nthe resulting agreement. I was then chairman of the Finance Committee. \nI did nothing whatever to hold up the agreement, and I might have done. \nTo the contrary, I saw to it that it was reported out of the committee \npromptly. When it came to the floor, I asked my colleague Max Baucus, \nthen chairman of the Subcommittee on International Trade, to manage \ntime in support of the bill. Which thereupon passed.\n  My objections, which I believe I stated clearly enough, were \npolitical more than economic. I did not believe that the United States \nappreciated the troubles that would almost surely come of entering into \nso close a relationship with a polity so very different from our own; \ndifferent in ways that could bring about a crisis such as that of the \npresent.\n  Nonetheless, I fully support Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, \nSecretary of State Warren Christopher, and Secretary of the Treasury \nRobert Rubin in their advocacy of a $40 billion loan guarantee fund for \nMexico. My reasons are twofold. First, I have the uttermost respect for \nDr. Greenspan and his associates in this matter. He asserts that he \ncame to his present position ``with great reluctance.'' This week he \ntold the Finance Committee that he all but detested the ``too big to \nfail'' argument, be it applied to banks or nations. And, yet, there was \nsomething to it. Just yesterday, he told the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, ``If this were strictly confined to Mexico, there would be \nno purpose whatsoever in a \n[[Page S1699]] government loan guarantee.'' But the issue is not \nconfined to Mexico. It is Dr. Greenspan's judgment that the economies \nof the whole of the developing world are potentially at risk. The \nSenator from New York is not about to hear such testimony from Alan \nGreenspan and pay no heed.\n  Similarly, I was struck by the comment yesterday by my distinguished \ncolleague, Paul Coverdell, not just incidentally former head of the \nPeace Corps, warning against demands for strict conditions on the loan \nguarantee which may ``inflame'' relations with Mexico. May, indeed. \nThey most assuredly will. Then we shall have chaos on our hands; or \nrather, on our border.\n  In my view, it comes to this. We probably ought never to have entered \na free-trade agreement with a polity so very different from our own. \nBut we did. And we now face the consequences. They are nothing we \ncannot manage. As the headline from an editorial in the Buffalo News of \nJanuary 26, 1995 explains:\n\n       It's risky, but U.S. has to try to rescue Mexico's economy\n\n\n            location and trade links leave us little choice\n\n  The true disaster would be to insist on conditions that would arouse \nall the hostility and hysteria of a nation of 93 million souls on our \nsouthern border who for almost the whole of the 20th century have \ndefined themselves by what they loathed in us.

Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  The Senate has just passed S. 1, the unfunded mandates legislation. \nEach of us has come to his own conclusion after weighing the pros and \ncons of the bill and deciding whether or not this bill is in the best \ninterests of the Nation.\n  My point in speaking on this bill now, after the vote on final \npassage, is, No. 1 to explain my vote against the bill; and second, to \noffer a word of caution.\n  This bill has not produced a panacea, as I will address shortly. One \nof the reasons why I voted against the bill is that the Senate rarely \nimposes restraints upon itself by statute.\n  When the Senate addresses its procedures in statute it is usually to \nprovide expedited procedures for the consideration of specified \nmeasures such as War Powers, Budget Act, Trade Act, or various \nprovisions authorizing Congressional approval or disapproval of \nExecutive proposals. In other words, Defense Base Closure Commission \nrecommendations).\n  The Senate addressed its rules in the Legislative Reorganization Acts \nof 1946 and 1970, and imposed certain requirements and safeguards which \nmay not have explicitly authorized points of order, but whose \nprovisions could arguably be enforced by points of order on the Senate \nfloor.\n  The Senate has imposed numerous restrictions on itself and provided \nfor their enforcement by points of order in the Congressional Budget \nAct of 1974, which I had a great deal to do with writing, and the \nrelated laws such as the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \nReduction Act of 1985 and 1987 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings) and the Budget \nEnforcement Act of 1990.\n  But the Senate usually establishes internal discipline by amending \nits rules or entering into unanimous consent agreements, agreements \nwhich can be objected to by any Senator. One objection and the proposed \namendment does not go into effect.\n  Amendments to the rules almost invariably occur by the adoption in \nthe Senate of a simple Senate resolution.\n  Establishing points of order in statutes is unnecessary, and should \nbe avoided as much as possible.\n  To establish points of order in statutes is unnecessary, and allows \nthe Senate to change its procedures (if not its rules per se) without \none day's notice in writing, and also avoids the more stringent cloture \nrequirement of two-thirds vote on proposals to amend the Standing Rules \nof the Senate.\n  This is one way of getting around the cloture requirement of two-\nthirds vote on proposals to amend the Standing Rules of the Senate.\n  Establishing points of order in statutes unnecessarily lengthens the \nprocess by involving consideration in the House of rules governing the \nSenate, involving consideration in committee, on the floor, in \nconference on the House and Senate floors during the consideration of a \nconference report, and also involves the President of the United \nStates.\n  If the President should obtain a line-item veto at some point, God \nforbid, it is conceivable that a President could become involved in \ninternal Senate discipline by vetoing some but not all of the \nprovisions that deal exclusively with Senate procedure.\n  A point of order against unfunded mandates is a departure from \nprevious changes to Senate procedure in that it can have the effect of \nprecluding the consideration of a particular subject matter by the \nSenate. What other types of subject matters will be added to this list?\n  If one specific subject matter may be thus avoided in the future, \nthen what other subject matters may be avoided, because they are made \nsubject to statutorily imposed points of order?\n  So I view this with concern, Mr. President. We are going down a \nslippery slope from which there is no return when we impose points of \norder as a means of internal discipline in the course of Senate \ndeliberation on a bill. We impose those points of order by a law, by \nstatute, as I say, bringing not only the Senate, as should be the case, \nbut also the House and the President into the act.\n  S. 1 is not a cure-all for the problem of federally imposed mandates. \nAnd most importantly, it is not the safety net for the States that it \nhas been characterized to be.\n  This legislation will not provide any State, local or tribal \ngovernment a foolproof sanctuary against future mandates. Nor will it \nprotect those governmental units against increased costs should the \nrequirements of any current mandate be increased. All that S. 1 does in \nthis regard is to establish a majority point of order against any bill \nor joint resolution reported by a committee without a CBO cost \nestimate. And obviously, as with any majority point of order, that is \nan additional hurdle to be overcome by those who may wish to enact a \npiece of legislation. But I would stress, in the strongest possible \nterms, that the point of order is merely a majority point of order. And \nas such, it takes the votes of no more than 51 Senators to waive, if \nall Senators are present and voting.\n  And if all Senators are not present and voting, it takes a majority \nof those who are present and voting. If only 60 Senators are present \nand voting, then only 31 Senators would be needed to waive.\n  Fifty-one Senators, or a majority of those who are present and \nvoting, can say that the mandate contained in the bill or joint \nresolution is important enough to the health, safety, and welfare of \nthe American public that they are willing to enact the mandate without \nan estimate. If only 51 Senators are present and voting, then only 26 \nare needed to constitute a majority.\n  Apparently forgotten by those who would make S. 1 out to be a \nprotective shield against the whims of the Congress is that the number \nof Senators needed to waive the point of order is precisely the number \nof Senators needed to pass any bill containing a mandate.\n  The point must be emphasized, particularly to the Governors of this \nNation--and to the mayors of cities who are meeting in this Capital \nCity--that S. 1 will not with certainty protect them from the costs and \nresponsibilities of future mandates.\n  Further, there is nothing in S. 1 which will provide any relief \nwhatsoever to State and local governments for the costs of existing \nFederal mandates. No relief whatsoever, Governors. None. No relief \nwhatsoever.\n  According to the report of the Budget Committee on S. 1, one study \nprepared for the GSA Regulatory Information Service Center in 1992 \nfound the cost of Federal mandates to State and local governments and \nthe private sector \n[[Page S1700]] was estimated to amount to $581 billion, or roughly 10 \npercent of the gross domestic product.\n  Witnesses before the Budget and Governmental Affairs Committee at a \njoint hearing on January 5, 1995, from State and local governments \ntestified about the damaging impact of existing Federal mandates on \nState and local governments.\n  The National League of Cities testified over the past 2 decades that \nthe Congress has enacted 185 new laws imposing mandates on State and \nlocal governments.\n  The U.S. Conference of Mayors testified that 314 cities will spend an \nestimated $54 billion over the next 5 years to comply with only 10 of \nthose Federal mandates.\n  Mr. President, Governors and mayors should keep in mind that nothing \nin S. 1 will relieve them of compliance with a single one of these \nexisting Federal mandates or provide them with one thin dime of \nreimbursement of their costs.\n  In addition, this bill will do nothing to protect the States against \nthe harsh pain that they will be forced to endure if the biggest \nunfunded mandate of all--a constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget--is ever riveted into the Constitution.\n  So those Governors and mayors who have been supporting a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget under the belief that \nthe passage of the unfunded mandates bill today, if enacted into law, \nwill relieve them of the burdens that are imposed upon them, they are \ngoing to be sadly and badly mistaken.\n  This bill will not safeguard one single State from that pain. Where \nare the States going to find the money to replace the hundreds of \nbillions of dollars that currently flow from Washington to those State \ncapitols when we start slashing the Federal budget promiscuously? Where \nare those Governors going to find the quarter trillion dollars that \nwill cease to flow to their States in fiscal year 2002? A quarter \ntrillion dollars, Mr. President, is the amount of money that will be \nlost to the States according to projections from the Treasury \nDepartment. Those are dollars that go for highways, additional police \non our streets, housing, education, environmental cleanup, cleanup of \ntoxic wastes, and myriad other programs.\n  Moreover, that amendment does not even count additional moneys that \nwould need to be cut if the tax cuts called for in the Republican \n``Contract With America'' are enacted. Under that scenario, the loss of \nFederal dollars to the States is even worse.\n  So to those Governors and those mayors who are in town--hopefully \nthey are watching C-SPAN--who think that S. 1 will protect them, I say \nto you, Mr. Governor, Mr. Mayor, think again. This bill, with or \nwithout its points of order, will not screen them from the overwhelming \nhurt that they are going to feel under that constitutionally sanctioned \n``unfunded mandate,'' the largest mandate of all, a colossal mandate--a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget.\n  Much has been said about the fact that this bill, S. 1, is different \nfrom the bill which the Senate considered last year--and I voted today \nfor the amendment by Mr. Levin to substitute the bill that was \nconsidered last year, which I believe was a better bill--the big \ndifference being the creation of a point of order.\n  With respect to these points of order, left unsaid is the perverse \npolitical reality that Senators who do in fact vote to waive a point of \norder will undoubtedly find their procedural vote used against them in \nthe next election. A point of order then, in a sense, that is nothing \nmore than a brilliant political ploy directed at portraying any Senator \nwho has the audacity to stand up for the health and well-being of the \nAmerican people as some sort of ``budget buster.''\n  I can see the television ads already. I can see the demagoguery and \ndepraved mischaracterization of a Senator's vote. Any of us who may be \nwilling to waive the point of order, willing to do what is right and \nbest for our constituents, will find the big guns of the 30-second ad \nmen aimed at our heads. Those political hucksters will have a field \nday, and we all had better know it, if we do not know it already. It \nwill happen, Mr. President, because that is what elections have become, \nI am sorry to say. As a result of our incessant desire to avoid \nthoughtful reflection and meaningful debate aimed at educating the \npublic, we have sunk to the level of 30-second public policy--30-second \npublic policy. If the answer to a problem does not fit on a bumper \nsticker, well, then the answer must not be correct.\n  Sadly, that truth will undoubtedly dissuade some from otherwise \ncasting a vote they feel is all right on future legislation. I hope it \nwill not dissuade many.\n  Mr. President, let me just try to emphasize to Governors of the \nStates and the mayors of our cities again that, if they think that, \nwith passage of this bill, with its eventual enactment into law, the \nway will then be paved for a constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget because, and by virtue of this unfunded mandates bill, the \nStates will be protected, they are mistaken. It is my understanding \nthat many of the Governors and mayors wanted, before the Congress \ndebates the constitutional amendment to balance the budget, wanted the \nCongress first to pass an unfunded mandates bill. They wanted that \nfirst. But if they are counting on these points of order to protect \nthem, they are in for a rude awakening.\n  We already have majority points of order, Mr. President, in the \nSenate Rules concerning appropriations bills. Let us turn in the Senate \nRules to rule XVI.\n Rule XVI, paragraph 4--I will read this paragraph, as follows:\n\n       4. On a point of order made by any Senator, no amendment \n     offered by any other Senator which proposes general \n     legislation shall be received to any general appropriation \n     bill, nor shall any amendment not germane or relevant to the \n     subject matter contained in the bill be received; nor shall \n     any amendment to any item or clause of such bill be received \n     which does not directly relate thereto; nor shall any \n     restriction on the expenditure of the funds appropriated \n     which proposes a limitation not authorized by law be received \n     if such restriction is to take effect or cease to be \n     effective upon the happening of a contingency; and all \n     questions of relevancy of amendments under this rule, when \n     raised, shall be submitted to the Senate and be decided \n     without debate; and any such amendment or restriction to a \n     general appropriation bill may be laid on the table without \n     prejudice to the bill.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, that point of order is honored mostly in the \nbreach. We all know that when an appropriation bill comes to the floor, \nif a Senator makes a point of order against an amendment as \nconstituting legislation on an appropriation bill, another Senator will \nimmediately raise the point of germaneness, and without debate, the \nChair will submit that question of germaneness to the Senate for its \ndecision. And we all know what happens. We all know what happens. \nSenators pay no attention to that point of order. They look at the \nsubstance of the amendment and disregard the rule and the point of \norder and vote that the amendment is germane to the bill.\n  That point of order is a majority point of order and it is little \nheeded and it poses no obstacle. Senators simply wave it aside by \nvoting on the question of germaneness.\n  The same thing will happen here. In the case of unfunded mandates, \nSenators will get to the point where they pay no more attention to a \npoint of order than a hog does to Sunday.\n  Section 101 of S. 1, the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995, amends \ntitle 4 of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of \n1974, and adds a new section 408 to that title to create a point of \norder that precludes consideration of legislation in the Senate \nregarding unfunded mandates. Section 904(b) of the Congressional Budget \nAct currently authorizes a motion to waive points of order under titles \n3 and 4 of the Congressional Budget Act by a majority vote, and would \nthus provide a waiver for this new point of order.\n  I have already mentioned Rule XVI of the Standing Rules of the \nSenate, which prohibits proposing amendments that are legislative in \ncharacter to general appropriations bills.\n  I say it once again to you mayors and Governors who may be listening. \nUnder Senate precedents, the Chair seldom gets to rule on this point of \norder because the proponent of the amendment may raise the defense of \ngermaneness which is then submitted to the Senate for decision and \ndecided by a majority vote. This procedural vote by the Senate should \nbe based on whether the proposed Senate amendment is germane to some \nlegislative language in the House \n[[Page S1701]] passed bill. However, it has now simply become a \nsubstantive vote on the Senate amendment. In many instances, those \nSenators who support the amendment vote that it is germane and those \nwho oppose the amendment vote that it is not germane, despite the fact \nthat they are being asked to resolve a procedural issue. In this way \nvalid procedural constraints are frequently sacrificed for transient \nsubstantive ends.\n  Mr. President, since the beginning of the Republic, the Federal \nGovernment has imposed important and necessary requirements on the \nStates. The Constitution requires the States to have elections, even \nthough the Federal Government does not pay one penny for them. It \nrequires States to allow defendants a fair trail. Those Federal \nrequirements on the States transcend mere financial considerations. \nThey fall into a higher category. They represent bedrock beliefs and \nsacred values held by all Americans to be of paramount importance. Fair \nelections, fair trails--each of these, Mr. President, lies at the very \nheart of what makes up the American tradition, and no point of order \nshould deter us from continuing to uphold those values because we fear \na 30-second spot or a misrepresentation of a procedural vote.\n  But the point of order in the bill will simply add to an already \ncumbersome process. It will be nearly impossible, as the Director of \nthe Congressional Budget Office has said, to issue cost estimates in a \ntime fashion. How can we expect CBO to canvas the 87,000 State, local, \nand tribal governments throughout the Nation with anything resembling \nefficiency? The answer, Mr. President, is that we cannot.\n  We will simply see a trampling over, a mad rush to put aside, to \nwaive the points of order. That is one thing I think we can expect to \nsee. We could very well see a situation whereby the agenda of this \ninstitution is set, not by the majority and minority leaders, but by a \nsmall group of budget analysts in the basement of the CBO. But here \nagain I think that will be avoided by simply waiving points of order.\n  Senators need only think back to the closing days of the last \nCongress, when various health-care bills were waiting for CBO scoring \ndata, to see how that situation could develop. Is that what Senators \nwant? Do we really want the agenda of Congress set on the basis of how \nfast a budget analyst can do his job? Do we really want to be told \nthat, despite our wishes, we cannot go to a particular bill because the \ncost estimate is not ready? That, Mr. President, is absurd.\n  Because of these problems, I was pleased to join my colleague, \nSenator Levin, in support of his substitute amendment. The Levin \namendment was, in effect, a complete substitute based on the version of \nthe bill that we considered last Congress. That version, as I have \nnoted, did not contain the point of order. It was a good substitute, \nand one that should have been adopted.\n  Mr. President, as I have previously stated, and as my vote in favor \nof the Levin substitute showed, I am a supporter of an unfunded \nmandates bill. I believe that, under certain circumstances, if we in \nCongress require the States to carry out our laws, then we should pay.\n  We should not offload that financial burden on the States.\n  Notwithstanding the fact that I did not vote for this bill, I would \nlike to compliment the efforts of those Senators on both sides of the \naisle who worked hard to improve S. 1. Senator Glenn, of course, \ndeserves more than a fair share of credit for the time and the energy \nhe put into the bill in committee and here on the floor. Senator Levin, \ntoo, deserves an enormous amount of credit for the number of hours he \nhas been here, lending us his expertise, and asking of the managers \nprobing questions designed to get at the heart of the matter.\n  Finally, I offer my congratulations to the distinguished Senator from \nIdaho [Mr. Kempthorne], who, while we are not in agreement on most of \nthe amendments offered, demonstrated throughout a high sense of purpose \nand immaculate fairness to all of us. He is a man of extraordinary good \nsense, a man of civility, a gentleman, and I have no doubt that he will \ngo far in this institution.\n  Then I extend my congratulations to Senator Boxer, Senator Murray, \nSenator Bingaman, and others for the job they performed in coming \nforward with good, meaningful amendments.\n  I compliment the minority. This is a big minority. This is not a \nfledgling or small minority. There are 47 Senators on this side of the \naisle. There were only 44 Senators in the minority on the other side of \nthe aisle in the last Congress; 44. But in this Congress, the minority \nhas 47 Members.\n  I think the minority played an important and meaningful role in \nslowing down this legislation--saying, ``Let us hold on a bit; not so \nfast.''--in amending it, in improving it, debating it, and exposing its \nweaknesses. The minority has refused to be run over by the majority \nsteamroller, and that is as it should be. As a result, this legislation \nwhich has just passed has been improved, and it is better understood.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/27/senate-section/article/S1699-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1701-S1702]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           LORNA KOOI SIMPSON\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, somebody once asked Ralph Waldo Emerson the \nsecret to success. And after a brief pause, Emerson replied, ``Make \nyourself necessary to somebody.''\n  I know that I speak for all of our colleagues in expressing to our \nfriend and colleague, Senator Alan Simpson, from Wyoming, our most \nsincere sympathies on the death, on January 24, of his mother, Lorna \nKooi Simpson. As we all know, Mr. President, God only gives us one \nmother.\n  Plutarch tells us that Alexander the Great made his mother many \nmagnificent presents, and Antipater once wrote a letter to Alexander, a \nlong letter full of heavy complaints against her. And when he had read \nit, Alexander said, ``Antipater knows not that one tear of a mother can \nblot out 1,000 such complaints.''\n  A little less than two years ago, Senator Simpson lost his father, \nformer United States Senator Milward L. Simpson. The loss of loved ones \nis always a blow to us, but to lose one's parents over such a brief \nspan of time is doubly hard, and I want Senator Simpson and his family \nto know that we understand something of their grief in these days.\n  But a degree of the sense of loss at the death of Mrs. Simpson is \nassuaged upon contemplating the life and accomplishments of this great \nlady.\n  Throughout her life, Lorna Simpson was dedicated to ``making herself \nnecessary'' to others, in the words of Ralph Waldo Emerson--to hundreds \nand hundreds of other people--in practically everything that she did.\n  An accomplished musician at both the piano and the Hammond organ, and \na masterful vocalist, through her music, Lorna Simpson enriched the \nlives of those around her. She played the organ and directed the choir \nat her church in Cody, Wyoming. Indeed, early in her marriage, her \nsister prevailed on Mrs. Simpson to enter a contest to compose an \noriginal ``pep song'' for the University of Wyoming. Reluctantly, Mrs. \nSimpson went to work, and succeeded in winning the contest with her \noriginal ``Come on, Wyoming!''\n  Additionally, however, Mrs. Simpson was also a talented amateur \nsculptor and artist, and played an active role in promoting the arts \nthroughout her entire life.\n  But that was not the limit of her contributions.\n  In 1940, Mrs. Simpson was appointed by the Mayor of Cody, Wyoming, to \nthe Cody Planning and Zoning Commission. With other citizens, Mrs. \nSimpson engaged in a long and successful campaign, complete with a bond \nissue that passed in 1950, that rendered Cody ``one of the most \nbeautiful cities in Wyoming.''\n  Moreover, Mrs. Simpson and her husband were co-owners of the local \nradio station KODI in Cody, at which Mrs. Simpson often did both \nprogramming and on-the-air work. During World War II, Mrs. Simpson was \nthe acting editor of the Cody Enterprise newspaper.\n  And in her ``spare time,'' as a co-owner with her husband of the Cody \nInn, Mrs. Simpson oversaw the restoration of this hostelry to its \noriginal grandeur.\n  In fact, time here does not permit a full recounting of the full \nrecord of Mrs. Simpson contributions to the career of her husband and \nto her family, as well as to the people of Wyoming and the United \nStates. Suffice it to add that she served as the First Lady of Wyoming \nduring her husband's tenure \n[[Page S1702]] as Governor\n from 1954 through 1958, and accompanied him to Washington during his \nservice as a United States Senator from 1962 through 1966 after he won \nan election to complete the unexpired term of the late Senator Keith \nThomson, during which the elder Senator Simpson was diagnosed with \nParkinson's disease, forcing his retirement from the Senate.\n\n  On once being nominated ``Wyoming Woman of the Year,'' Mrs. Simpson \nsaid, ``The Bible does say, `Let your light so shine before men that \nmay see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in Heaven.'''\n  Certainly, Lorna Kooi Simpson carried with her throughout her life a \nbrilliant, far-reaching light. She was a genuine ``Renaissance Lady.'' \nTo reflect on her life is to marvel at the capacity of some men and \nwomen to live selflessly and abundantly beyond the imaginations of most \nof us, and we are all diminished by the death of this great Wyoming \nlady, as we are diminished by the death of any great person.\n  I trust that Senator Simpson, whom we admire, and for whom we have \ngreat affection, will find a rich and undiminishing solace in the \nmemories of Mrs. Simpson, and in the assurance of the love of God that \nso infused and defined her life. To be sure, Lorna Kooi Simpson was, \nand is, a genuine reflection of the workmanship of a Loving Heavenly \nFather, and she is now at rest in an Eternal Home, not made with hands, \nin our Father's house, near at hand to the Lord whom she so dearly \nserved throughout her life with every talent with which He had \nentrusted her.\n  My wife, Erma, and I extend our sympathy and our condolences to Alan \nSimpson and all of his family in this hour of trial.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/27/senate-section/article/S1701-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1702-S1703]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 MORATORIUM ON NEW WETLAND DELINEATIONS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I introduced this week, with 10 \ncosponsors, a bill to safeguard the property rights of our Nation's \nfarmers. The bill will establish a moratorium on new wetland \ndelineations, until Congress has time to enact a new farm bill and to \nconsider the wetlands issue on agricultural land in conjunction with \nthat bill. This corresponds with the policy set here by this body in \n1985 when we passed the antisodbusting and antiswampbusting provisions \nthat are on the books and are generally good pieces of legislation--now \nbeing abused, though, by faceless bureaucrats, who are trying to \nredetermine additional wetlands. Even though the prior determinations \nhave fit into the farming patterns of individual farmers around the \nUnited States.\n  As you know, Mr. President, no less than four Federal agencies claim \njurisdiction over the regulation of wetlands. Just think of how \nimpossible it is for the family farmer of America to try to understand \nwhat four different Federal agencies want him to do in regard to \nwetlands on his personal property and how that confounds him in making \nbusiness decisions on the operation of his farm.\n  Those four agencies last year entered into a memorandum of agreement \nconcerning wetlands delineation on agricultural land. Although the \nmemorandum of agreement was intended to streamline the regulatory \nprocess, and it was meant to clarify the role of each agency, it has, \nhowever, increased the level of confusion and the level of frustration \namong the farmers affected by it. It has not made their life any \neasier. It may have well been the intention of the faceless bureaucrat, \nthrough that agreement, to make life easier, but it has not.\n  The delineation of wetlands on agricultural land has been, for a long \nperiod of time, a confusing proposition. On the other hand, the \nconsequences of the delineations are very clear. The farmer, for \ninstance, might alter a wetland without authorization from the Federal \nGovernment, and could potentially face civil penalties, criminal \naction, and loss of farm program benefits. Because the stakes are so \nvery high, I think we have a responsibility in this Congress, as \nrepresentatives of the people, representing a major industry in \nAmerica, because the food and fiber chain, from producer to consumer, \nis 20 percent of our gross national product, and considering the \nimportance of this industry and the millions of family farmers, \nindependent entrepreneurs that make their living this way, because of \nall these reasons, we must ensure that the delineation process is \naccurate and that it is reasonable.\n  As I speak, Mr. President, new wetlands delineation are being \nconducted in the State of Iowa pursuant to the memorandum of agreement. \nIt is just starting in the State of Iowa, but is going to cover every \nother State affected by agricultural wetlands. So even though it is of \nimmediate impact in my State, in just a few months, this process will \nbe going on throughout the country.\n  This is a process whereby these people, unknown to the individual \nfarmers, take the individual soil survey maps and aerial photos of \nvegetation topography. From these they attempt to find, in areas where \nthey have not already said there are wetlands, some other little bit of \nevidence of wetlands, in order to get more farmers under the regulatory \numbrella and get more land within each farm under that umbrella of \nwetlands? Because the more wetlands determinations and the more of an \nopportunity for the bureaucrats to have some jurisdiction over private \nproperty they would not otherwise have jurisdiction over.\n  This is being done not with on-site farm inspections, not with the \nindividual farmer right alongside the soil conservation personnel--\nremember, historically, for 60 or 70 years, there has been a very close \nrelationship and friendly relationship between the soil conservation \npeople who are educating farmers to be better caretakers of our natural \nresources and the farmer wanting to do that and learning from that \nprocess.\n  That sort of consultation has promoted more benefit to the \nenvironment than any other one process I know from the U.S. Department \nof Agriculture. In this current process, it has not been the usual \nclose relationship, but it is in the back rooms, or in the laboratories \naround the individual States, where bureaucrats are going over these \nsoil maps with this aerial photography to find other wetlands.\n And then send out a new map to the individual farmers with additional \ndelineation of wetlands on it. At that point, you have wetlands whether \nyou think they are wetlands or not and it is your job, as an individual \nfarmer, then, at the appeals process to show that these really are not \nwetlands. And the burden of proof is on the back of the farmer.\n\n  This is kind of a way of saying, ``You are guilty of having something \nthat you did not even know you had,'' particularly if you have been \nfarming this very land for a long period of time.\n  Well, we ought to inform the farmer of this process. The bureaucracy \nhas not informed the farmer of the process. In fact, in my State, in \nStory County, IA, there was a meeting to discuss this whole process, \nbut it was by invitation only.\n  Although it may be legitimate to have some further determination, it \nought to involve the farmer and it ought to require that the bureaucrat \nmaking that determination at least visit the area and see with their \nown eyes what the situation might be. This would reinforce the close \nrelationship we have had for six or seven decades between the soil \nconservation consultant, engineer, and the individual family farmer. I \nam talking about the family farm, not the big corporate farmer with the \nabsentee landownership and some foreign manager taking care of the \nland.\n  This process is currently going on, so that farmers will soon be \ndeprived of the right to farm their land or improve their property \nbecause a Federal bureaucrat decides that such activity interferes with \na protected wetland.\n  Remember, we went through this process after we passed the \nantiswampbusting and antisodbusting legislation in the 1985 farm bill. \nI do not, for the most part--not completely, but for the most part--I \ndo not hear any individual farmers complain about that determination or \nthe regulations that have followed that determination. That is because \nthere was an open effort on the part of the bureaucracy to work with \nthe farmers, to understand what the process is, to have input. But not \nnow. The meetings in my State are by invitation only.\n   [[Page S1703]] Now, I suppose it sounds like we are opposed to \nprotecting valuable wetlands. Well, I think the litmus test of that is \nour vote for the antiswampbusting, antisodbusting provisions in the \n1985 farm bill. There were no efforts to repeal those provisions. In \nfact, even in the 1990 farm bill, there was some expansion in this \narea.\n  But I think we ought to be cognizant of the fact that it is not good \nfor agriculture, it is not good for our general economy, and it surely \nis not conducive to the family farmer. He should not be expected to \nconfront a faceless bureaucrat every so often, with changes in the \nrules every few years, so that farmers can never be certain if their \nconduct is allowed under the current regulatory scheme.\n  I am also opposed to the promulgation of a memorandum of agreement by \nfour Federal agencies that will significantly affect the ability of \nprivate property owners to improve their land without the benefit of \ninput from the people affected by the agreement.\n  My bill basically accomplishes two things. First, it will allow those \nproperty owners affected by the memorandum of agreement to have some \ninput through congressional hearings on the wetlands policy. At the \nvery least, Congress should ensure that the concerns of the private \nowners are heard before they are deprived of the use of their land.\n  The second purpose of the bill is to stop the bureaucracy from acting \nbased upon the flawed memorandum of agreement. It is my sincere hope \nthat this Congress will reform Federal wetlands policy. This policy \nshould be based upon sound science, recognize the constitutionally \nprotected right of private property, and, above all, institute a large \ndose of common sense into the program.\n  And where a real opportunity to instill common sense into this \nprogram was missed by the bureaucracy, is when the agreement was not \npromulgated under the Administrative Procedures Act. That process \nallows the publishing of whatever the bureaucrat wants to regulate, but \nit institutes upon them a discipline and a hearing process to make sure \nthat there is input from all segments of the regulated community.\n  Now, in my State, we do not try to sneak things over on the people. \nThis process of ignoring public input is foreign to the thinking of the \ncommonsense approach of mid-Americans who are law-abiding citizens, who \nwant to work with their Government, who want to keep the economy or the \nenvironment sound.\n  And so I beg for 6 months to slow the process down, to alert the \nfamily farmers of America to what is going on. That it is affecting \ntheir right to farm, and to do it in a businesslike fashion, and to \nallow the Agriculture Committee, under the extremely capable leadership \nof Senator Lugar, to review this whole process and to work it into the \nfarm bill.

Mr. President, I am pleased today to bring to the \nattention of my colleagues a thoughtful opinion piece by our colleague, \nthe Senator from Maryland, which appeared in the Washington Post on \nSunday, January 22. She presents a road map that I believe can help all \nSenators, on both sides of the aisle, as we develop our priorities in \nthis new Congress. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Mikulski's \ncolumn be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the column was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Jan. 22, 1995\n\n                          Democrats, Get Real\n\n                        (By Barbara A. Mikulski)\n\n       Democrats need a new attitude and action plan to focus on \n     solving real problems. This attitude and plan must promote a \n     shared national vision to create good jobs and give help to \n     those who work hard, play by the rules and practice self-\n     help. We need to create a new state of mind that--as \n     Americans--we can solve our nation's problems together.\n       Democrats must stop being angst-addicted. We have too often \n     substituted agonizing for action, and it has paralyzed us. To \n     connect with middle-class Americans, we must think clearly \n     and act decisively. Democrats must focus on the day-to-day \n     needs of everyday Americans--their jobs, families and \n     opportunities. We also need to look at our country's long-\n     term needs. We need to generate jobs with pay worth the \n     effort and education. We need to create a national readiness \n     that is based on competence and character.\n       Democrats must focus on being politically effective, not \n     necessarily politically correct. We cannot use words from a \n     dated vocabulary. Political labels such as ``right,'' \n     ``left,'' ``liberal'' and ``conservative'' have become \n     cliches. Labels and stereotypes that go with them have little \n     meaning.\n       Being politically effective means helping those who are \n     middle class stay there or do better. Being politically \n     effective means helping those who are not middle class get \n     there through hard work and practicing self-help. Worn-out \n     sound bites about the economy and crime weaken our \n     credibility and play into the hands of those who demonize our \n     ideas by blaming the victim, the government or both.\n       Democrats must figure out what works. We must be advocates \n     for people and not automatically defend every government \n     program. Let's look at the mission of these programs. When \n     they serve their mission and help people, great. When they \n     don't, let's get rid of them. We cannot be a rescue squad for \n     every line item. Often, the good intentions of good people \n     have gone astray. Tinker Toy reforms ultimately created other \n     problems.\n       One example is federal housing policy. We thought that if \n     we gave people housing, we would give them opportunity. Begun \n     during the New Deal, most federal housing programs were meant \n     to provide short-term shelter for people temporarily out of \n     work. But a series of complicated rules and boutique programs \n     has rewarded the wrong kind of behavior and made housing \n     projects Zip codes of pathology. Few residents can find work. \n     Crime and substance abuse are high.\n       Some blame the victim. Some identify with the victim. But \n     Democrat's addition to other people's misery does not solve \n     their problems or substitute for national policy. While we \n     must acknowledge the pain of the impoverished, we must also \n     require them to take charge of their own lives. We must find \n     ways to reward those who work or get into a program for self-\n     sufficiency.\n       We must ensure that welfare rules do not destroy the \n     family. Democrats should stand up for the family--and that \n     includes men. We need to end the ``get the man out of the \n     house'' rule, which has pushed men out of the house so a \n     family can qualify for public benefits. Shortsighted \n     intentions have created rules that dismantle families, \n     emasculate men and deny their children a full-time father. \n     Being a dad is more than writing a child-support check.\n       We've heard a lot about angry voters. Actually, I think \n     voters' anger stems from bewilderment and disillusionment. \n     This bewilderment and disillusionment is based on the fact \n     that their personal experience does not reflect what \n     statistics tell them. People are told that they are fortunate \n     to live in an economy of low unemployment, low inflation and \n     rapid growth. Yet, people are one downsizing away from \n     unemployment, their friends have been laid off, and their \n     standard of living continues to decline. At the same time, \n     people feel less secure in their homes, neighborhoods and \n     workplaces Children are killing children with guns carried \n     around in school backpacks.\n       America's future deserves more thought and effort than \n     partisan bidding wars over tax cuts. It deserves more than \n     the pursuit of ``faddish'' ideas floated by think tanks. \n     Americans deserve real solutions to the complex problems of \n     an increasingly complex world.\n       Democrats must join together to create this new attitude, \n     both within the Democratic Party and within the country--to \n     reward hard work, family stability and playing by the rules. \n     Together, we can begin to address the very valid concerns \n     Americans have about their futures, the futures of their \n     families and the future of their country.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/27/senate-section/article/S1703-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1703-S1704]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   AUSCHWITZ IS SYNONYMOUS WITH EVIL\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, perhaps more than any other word, \nAuschwitz is synonymous with evil.\n  Fifty years ago today, Russian soldiers liberated Auschwitz.\n  The horrors of Auschwitz are incomprehensible and undescribable.\n  Over 1 million people lost their lives at Auschwitz--the largest of \nthe Nazi death camps. Ninety percent were Jews. Hundreds of thousands \nwere children.\n  Auschwitz represented the German's campaign to exterminate a people--\nthe Jews. They almost succeeded--killing two out of three Jews in \nEurope.\n  As a Polish-American, I carry the images of Auschwitz in my heart.\n  [[Page S1704]] The Germans considered all Poles to be an inferior \nrace. After Poland was conquered, German authorities expelled much of \nthe native Polish population from regions of the newly annexed \nterritories. Polish cities were given German names and German settlers \nwere colonized on Polish land. In occupied Poland, the Nazi governor, \nHans Frank, proclaimed: ``Poles will become slaves in the German \nReich.''\n  The Nazis set out to destroy Polish culture. Thousands of Polish \nteachers, politicians, university professors, and artists were executed \nor sent to Nazi concentration camps. Catholic priests were among the \nmain targets of Nazi mass murder in Poland.\n  In fact, Auschwitz was created as an internment camp for Polish \ndissidents. And thousands of Poles were murdered alongside the Jews in \nAuschwitz.\n  Many Poles risked their lives to save Jews:\n  Irena Sendler was a young social worker in Warsaw. She used her \nposition to smuggle 200 Jewish children out of the ghetto to safe \nhouses. In 1943, Sendler was arrested by the gestapo, brutally tortured \nand condemned to death. On the day of her execution, she was freed with \nthe help of the Jewish underground.\n  Irena Adamowicz, a Polish Catholic, aided in establishing contacts \nbetween the Jewish Underground and the main Polish resistance \norganization.\n  Jan Karksi, who, while working for the Polish Government in exile, \nwas one of the few outsiders to visit the Warsaw Ghetto. He appealed to \nthe allies to do something.\n  These are just a few examples. But as a Polish-American, it pains me \nto know that these brave patriots were a minority. The majority of \nPoles, like the majority of Europeans, were neither killers nor \nvictims. Most merely stood by, neither collaborating, nor coming to the \naid of the victims. This passivity amounted to acquiescence.\n  Elie Weisel, a survivor of Auschwitz, visited Auschwitz 25 years \nafter the liberation. He wrote:\n\n       I hadn't realized how near the village was. I had thought \n     of it as worlds distant from the camp. But the villagers \n     could see what was happening behind the barbed wire, could \n     hear the music as the labor details trudged to work and back \n     again. How did they manage to sleep at night? How could they \n     go to mass on Sunday, attend weddings, laugh with their \n     children, while a few paces away human beings despaired of \n     the human race.\n\n  Many years later, Eli Weisel was awarded the Nobel Prize. This week \nhe led the American delegation to Auschwitz.\n  As a Polish-American, I traveled to Poland in the late 1970's. I was \na Congresswoman. And I wanted to see my heritage. I went to the small \nvillage where my family came from. It was a very moving and historic \nexperience.\n  But I also wanted to see the dark side of my history, and I went to \nAuschwitz.\n  In touring Auschwitz, it was an incredibly moving experience to go \nthrough the gate, to see the sign, to go to see the chambers. I went to \na cell that had been occupied by Father Kolbe, a Catholic priest, who \ngave his life for a Jewish man there.\n  And then, for those of you who don't know, I'm a social worker, I've \nbeen a child abuse worker and I don't flinch.\n  But then I got half way through that tour and I came to a point in \nthat tour where I saw the bins with glasses and the children's shoes, \nand this 40-something year old Congresswoman could not go on.\n  I became unglued. I had to remove myself from the small tour, go off \ninto a private place in Auschwitz, cry in a way that shook my very \nsoul. And when I left there, I thought, now I really know why we need \nan Israel.\n  And that is why I will fight so hard to ensure the survival\n   of Israel. I know its importance. I know why it exists.\n\n  I also know why it is so important for us educate our young people--\nabout the effects of hatred, about the importance of history.\n  Several years ago. I helped my friend Mark Talisman to create a \nliving memorial to the Jews of Poland--called Project Judaica. Through \nits cultural center, its international education programs, and its \nrescue of Jewish artifacts, Project Judaica seeks to educate people \nabout the rich history of the Polish Jews. Project Judaica's Center for \nJewish History and Culture is in Krakow, near the village my family is \nfrom.\n  In closing, I would like to read the words of Eli Weisel:\n\n       Never shall I forget that night, the first night in camp, \n     which has turned my life into one long night, seven times \n     cursed and seven times sealed. Never shall I forget that \n     smoke. Never shall I forget the faces of the children, whose \n     bodies I saw turned into wreathes of smoke beneath a silent \n     blue sky. Never shall I forget those flames which consumed my \n     faith forever.\n       Never shall I forget that nocturnal silence which deprived \n     me, for all eternity, of the desire to live. Never shall I \n     forget those moments which murdered my God and my soul and \n     turned my dreams to dust. Never shall I forget these things, \n     even if I am condemned to live as long as God himself.\n\n  Mr. President, 50 years after the liberation of Auschwitz, let us \npledge never to forget. And let us honor those who died in the \nholocaust by fighting against bigotry, hate crimes, and intolerance.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/27/senate-section/article/S1703-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1704]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n       U.S. ARMY STAFF SGT.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the attached \nLas Vegas Sun article by Nevada's former Governor Mike O'Callaghan on \nPresident Clinton's proposal to raise the minimum wage be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                       Stop Whining; Pay Workers\n\n       Whine, whine, whine.\n       The sky is going to fall in if the minimum wage is raised. \n     If you listen to the Republican-led whine choir, it assures \n     us that small businesses will collapse and thousands of \n     teenage hamburger flippers will be fired if the minimum wage \n     rises from $4.25 to $5 an hour.\n       Let's be honest, any business today that doesn't have the \n     ability to pay its workers $5 an hour probably should \n     collapse if it hasn't already. You can't convince a thinking \n     American that the newly suggested minimum wage will do \n     anything but help the working poor and, in the long run, \n     improve the economy. A quick glance at past minimum wage \n     increases will show that they have been a plus, not a \n     negative, for the working poor and the economy.\n       I was proud of President Bill Clinton when he said in his \n     State of the Union address:\n       ``Members of Congress have been here less than a month; 28 \n     days into the new year, every member of Congress will have \n     earned as much in congressional salary as a minimum-wage \n     worker makes all year long.''\n       Earlier, he had pointed out that there are ``2\\1/2\\ million \n     Americans, often women with children,'' who now work for \n     $4.25 an hour.\n       [[Page S1705]] Figure it out: These people, when employed \n     full time, make $170 a week and less than $9,000 a year.\n       Try raising a family on these wages, when the poverty level \n     for a family of four is $13,000 a year. In case the family \n     breadwinner gets sick working for minimum wages, he or she \n     most likely hasn't any medical coverage. The situation \n     becomes a double tragedy.\n       Furthermore, the idea that only teenage fast-food workers \n     are paid the minimum wage is wrong. Actually only about 30 \n     percent of these workers are under 20. A much larger \n     percentage is 25 years old and up. Yes, and 60 percent of the \n     people struggling to get by on minimum wage are women. Many \n     of them are\n      single parents.\n       As a governor, I heard all of the silly arguments against \n     raising the minimum wage during the 1970s. Sometimes, it was \n     like pulling teeth for Assemblywoman Eileen Brookman and \n     state executives Stan Jones and Blackie Evans to convince \n     legislators to move ahead with minimum-wage legislation.\n       Who are these hard-working Americans who labor for $4.25 an \n     hour? According to writer Michael Gartner, the households \n     with less than $10,000-a-year income give a greater \n     percentage of their money to charity than do those who make \n     $75,000-$100,000 annually. They aren't a bunch of bums or \n     freeloaders. They are men and women we should be proud of as \n     fellow Americans who toil at jobs day after day to feed \n     themselves and their families.\n       I remember my father working for a dollar a day during the \n     Great Depression. Cutting and skinning trees for pulp from \n     dawn to dark wasn't an easy task. Following that bit of \n     exercise in the snowy and cold climate of Wisconsin, he came \n     home to milk the cows and then go to bed, knowing that hours \n     before the sun rose the next day, he had to milk them again \n     before leaving for the woods.\n       Let the editors of USA Today give us a brief history of the \n     minimum wage and bring us up to date:\n       ``The first minimum wage law set a 25-cents-an-hour wage in \n     1938 in order to provide `a minimum standard of living \n     necessary for health, efficiency and general well-being for \n     workers.'\n       ``And for most of the next four decades, the minimum wage \n     provided that floor to earnings, as Congress raised it a \n     dozen times--once every three or four years--to keep up with \n     inflation.\n       ``But then came the Reagan revolution. From 1979 to 1989, \n     the wage was stuck at $3.35 an hour, losing nearly half of \n     its purchasing power.\n       ``The result: A wider gulf between rich and poor and an \n     increasing reliance of working families on food stamps, tax \n     credits and other welfare to make ends meet.\n       ``The 90-cent increase implemented from 1989 to 1991 helped \n     lift nearly 200,000 families from that situation, the Labor \n     Department found. But it still left 18 percent of full-time \n     workers earning less than poverty wages for a family of \n     four--a whopping 50 percent increase from 1979.''\n       So stop the predictions of economic catastrophes and the \n     whining that accompanies the voices against the minimum wage \n     going to $5. It's long overdue, and anything less will only \n     allow the continuation of one of our country's greatest \n     injustices against the working poor.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/27/senate-section/article/S1704-3", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1705]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          THE WAR IN CHECHNYA\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, last week, Russian President Boris Yeltsin \ndeclared victory in Chechnya, stating that the military stage of the \nconflict had concluded. It is clear, however, that neither the conflict \nnor its political and international ramifications are behind us. The \nfighting, although less intense, continues with horrifying reports of \nattacks against civilians. Russia's foray into Chechnya, moreover, \ncontinues to take a toll on Russia's domestic reform agenda as well as \nits relationships with the West.\n  Secretary Christopher put it well last week after his meetings in \nGeneva with Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev. He said: ``I told the \nForeign Minister that the United States fully supports the principle of \nRussia's territorial integrity, but that we are extremely concerned \nabout the price that the war is exacting in terms of human life, in \nterms of support of reform, and in terms of Russia's standing in the \nworld.'' To my mind, Secretary Christopher delivered the right message. \nLet us hope that Russia responds appropriately.\n  Mr. President, I believe that few of us would deny that territorial \nintegrity is an important principle that must be preserved. There are \n32 ethnic federal units in Russia--consisting of 21 sovereign republics \nand 11 autonomous regions. These areas make up about one-third of \nRussia's land mass. Much\n of that territory is resource-rich and politically important. If \nRussia had taken a laissez-faire attitude toward Chechnya, it is \nconceivable that other republics and regions would have followed suit \nby attempting violent breakaways--breeding instability and bloodshed \nthroughout the region. An unstable Russia is clearly not in the United \nStates interest.\n\n  I do believe that Russia has a right to preserve its borders \nconsistent with the principles laid out by the Organization on Security \nand Cooperation in Europe. The OSCE--formerly the CSCE--makes clear \nthat Europe's borders are not to be changed by force. That being said, \nRussia can't have it both ways. if we are going to look to OSCE to \nargue that Russia's territorial integrity should be preserved, we also \nhave to take seriously OSCE commitments and principles regarding human \nrights. As a member of OSCE, Russia has committed to observing certain \nstandards of behavior. Most recently, at the OSCE summit in Budapest, \nOSCE members adopted a code of conduct that spells out principles \nguiding the role of armed forces in democratic societies. The Russian \nmilitary's behavior in Chechnya raises serious questions about Russia's \ncommitment to OSCE principles.\n  It is not too late for Russia to seek a peaceful end to the Chechnya \nconflict. In fact, an OSCE team is scheduled to visit Chechnya to focus \non human rights, treatment of prisoners, humanitarian aid, and election \npreparation. Moscow should welcome this as an opening to show good \nfaith and follow through on President Yeltsin's pledge of \n``rehabilitating the life-support system and of protecting human rights \nto the full extent.''\n  While I want to see the United States continue to engage Russia and \nto support the reform effort, there are many voices here in the \nCongress calling for a reevaluation of our relationship, including our \nassistance program. In my view, United States bilateral assistance--the \nvast majority of which is in the form of technical assistance to \nfarmers, teachers, business representatives, and other ordinary \nRussians--is crucial to bolstering the reformers.\n  By far the most important type of assistance, however, is the aid we \nprovide under the Nunn-Lugar program to help Russia and the other \nnuclear powers of the former Soviet Union with dismantlement and \nconversion. It is a wise investment in our own security, and to create \nlinkages between Chechnya and the Nunn-Lugar program would be the \nheight of irresponsibility. As I said, however, not everyone shares \nthis view, and I am afraid that if Russia does not opt for a peaceful \nsolution to the Chechnya conflict, the march to end assistance will be \nunstoppable.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/27/senate-section/article/S1705-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1705]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  ANNIVERSARY OF AUSCHWITZ LIBERATION\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, 50 years ago tomorrow troops of the soviet \nred army marched into almost unimaginable horror in Auschwitz, Poland. \nIn the 50 years since its liberation, Auschwitz has become a synonym \nfor man's inhumanity to man. Roughly 1 million Jews were murdered at \nAuschwitz, part of Hitler's twisted final solution. Some 75,000 Poles \nand some 23,000 gypsies were killed. It is hard to envision the scope \nof this holocaust--the barbaric efficiency of the Nazi killing machine \nis typified by the Auschwitz camp.\n  The importance of remembering Auschwitz should be clear to this and \nfuture generations--even today there are those who deny reality and \ndistort history by claiming to doubt the reality of the Nazi Holocaust. \nTheir lies only highlight the need to reflect on the meaning of the \nHolocaust on this important anniversary.\n  In the last few days leading up to tomorrow's anniversary, newspapers \nand television have had powerful and moving accounts of life and death \nat Auschwitz.

Mr. President, 50 years ago tomorrow troops of the soviet \nred army marched into almost unimaginable horror in Auschwitz, Poland. \nIn the 50 years since its liberation, Auschwitz has become a synonym \nfor man's inhumanity to man. Roughly 1 million Jews were murdered at \nAuschwitz, part of Hitler's twisted final solution. Some 75,000 Poles \nand some 23,000 gypsies were killed. It is hard to envision the scope \nof this holocaust--the barbaric efficiency of the Nazi killing machine \nis typified by the Auschwitz camp.\n  The importance of remembering Auschwitz should be clear to this and \nfuture generations--even today there are those who deny reality and \ndistort history by claiming to doubt the reality of the Nazi Holocaust. \nTheir lies only highlight the need to reflect on the meaning of the \nHolocaust on this important anniversary.\n  In the last few days leading up to tomorrow's anniversary, newspapers \nand television have had powerful and moving accounts of life and death \nat Auschwitz. One has only to see the pictures and hear the anguished \nvoices of the survivors to understand the phrase: ``never again.'' The \nhorror of the death camps should lead each and every one of us to say \n``never again.'' Never again will the world tolerate mass murder as a \ntool of state policy.

Mr. President, I want to take a moment to salute the \nSenate \n[[Page S1706]] pages for their hard work and dedication over the past \nfew months. Since last September, they have put in long hours helping \nin the day-to-day operations of the Senate floor--from opening its \ndoors in the morning to turning out its lights at night. And all that \ncomes after early morning classes at the U.S. Senate Page School.\n  No doubt about it, by watching democracy in action, these fine \nstudents from across America have learned more than the textbook view \nof Congress.\n  I know I speak for all my Senate colleagues when I say we are \ngrateful for their commitment to making the Senate work, and I wish \neach of these young men and women all the best in the future.\n  I ask unanimous consent that their names be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the names were order to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Ben Shoun, Tennessee; Bethany Atkins, North Carolina; Megan \n     Smith, Minnesota; Karen Hodys, Rhode Island; and Hilary \n     Johnson, Oregon.\n       David Miller, Pennsylvania; Kelvin Chen, Mississippi; April \n     Cunningham, California; Leslie Pridgen, South Carolina; and \n     Brad Parrish, Utah.\n       Dan Case, Yarmouth, ME; Mike Chapman, Flint, MI; Jeffrey \n     Colvin, Canajohaire, NY; Danny Heffernan, Atlanta, GA; \n     Cristin Hodgens, Westborough, MA; and Fulmer Jones, \n     Booneville, AR.\n       Michael Kaplan, Alexandria, LA; Katherine Lord, Shorewood, \n     WI; Mathew McMillan, Los Angeles, CA; Mark Mezvinsky, \n     Philadelphia, PA; Tai Mirach, Hallowell, ME; and Melody \n     Montgomery, Grass Range, MT.\n       Tony Oliver, Yarmouth, ME; Noah Oppenheim, Tucson, AZ; Rupa \n     Patel, Plymouth, MI; Liz Rosenberg, Middlebury, VT; Abe \n     Tucker, Brunswick, ME; and Meredith Villines, Little Rock, \n     AR.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/27/senate-section/article/S1705-3", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1706]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 CONTACT WITH AMERICA--SUPER BOWL XXIX\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the House may be debating the Contract \nWith America, but I ask the Senate today to consider the Contact with \nAmerica. On Sunday, the people of America will be in contact with one \nanother, eagerly debating, disputing, and disagreeing.\n  However, I regret to inform this body that they will not be in touch \nwith us. They are of the mind that the issue is far too big for the \nSenate to tackle or the President to block. Government involvement \nwould be called unsportsman-like conduct. The Supreme Court would be \nruled off-sides, and even radio talk show hosts would be flagged for \ninterference.\n  Of course I mean Super Bowl XXIX--29. This ultimate contact sport \npresents a real problem for me and my colleague, Senator Boxer, because \nthis year's Super Bowl pits two California teams against one another--\nthe four-time Super Bowl champs, the San Francisco 49'ers and the \ntalented and challenging San Diego Chargers. Normally, if a California \nteam would play a team from some other State, I would willingly wager \nwith the rival Senators. But it would be unseemly for two Senators from \nthe same State to wager against one another. Does my colleague, Senator \nBoxer, agree?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I do. The only thing I will bet is that a California team \nwill win. I share my friend's excitement for the game. This is only the \nsecond time in the history of the modern era of the NFL that two teams \nfrom the same State have captured their division titles to earn a spot \nin the Super Bowl.\n  To quote Henry David Thoreau, ``Mankind's progress moves from East to \nWest,'' a phrase that continues to ring true for the NFL in 1995. \nCalifornia teams, fueled by the high-powered, high-scoring west coast \noffenses and supported by quick, powerful defenses, have taken the game \nto a new level. The Chargers and 49'ers proudly sit atop the ranks of \nthe NFL and will bring the coveted Vince Lombardi Trophy back home to \nthe Golden State for the eighth time in 29 years--twice as many times \nas any other State. I am sure that my friend from California would \nagree that this is a remarkable accomplishment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Of course. Bruising contests are not unfamiliar in \nCalifornia as I well know from last year. If you add up all of the \nchampionships in World Series, Super Bowls, NBA, and NCAA \nChampionships, California has won more than any other State. I ask my \ncolleague to give her views on this Super Bowl.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, this Sunday's Super Bowl will add a \nfinal chapter to what has turned out to be a magnificent story--the \ntale of two teams taking a strikingly different course to arrive at the \nsame destination. The young, upstart San Diego Chargers are the \nquintessential underdogs. After battling to finish with an eight and \neight record last year, most NFL pundits rated them way down in the \npolls. some of us can relate to that. However, the Chargers stormed out \nof the gates and finished first in their division. San Diego marched \nthrough the playoffs by beating Miami and going back to the snow and \nice of Pittsburgh to defeat the Steelers and earn their first Super \nBowl berth. Then, as my colleague knows, there are the 49'ers.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I certainly know the 49'ers. From day one of this \nseason, the 49'ers were picked by many as the team to beat. Assembled \nfrom a corps of seasoned veterans and prime talent developed within, \nthe 49'ers had but one goal: beat Dallas and win the Super Bowl. After \novercoming a number of early season injuries, the team finished with \nthe best record in the league. they moved past the Chicago Bears in the \nfirst round of the playoffs, and realized part one of their goal with a \nhard-earned victory over the Dallas Cowboys. Now, they go into Miami as \na heavy favorite, hoping to win an unprecedented fifth Super Bowl. I \nwould like to know if my colleague also feels that this is a wonderful \nmatchup?\n  Mrs. BOXER. It could not be better. In fact, the drama will not be \nconfined to the final score. Will Cal graduate Gail Gilbert, who was \nwith the Buffalo Bills in the last four Super Bowls and now plays for \nthe Chargers, finally be able to celebrate a victory? And how many more \nSuper Bowl records will Jerry Rice break? There are a number of \nintriguing subplots to this story that I look forward to watching \nunravel. I would like to know who the senior Senator favors in this \ngame?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. While I realize that I represent the entire State of \nCalifornia, I must admit that I will be cheering for the 49'ers. I \nwould like to point out to my colleagues that there is no public outcry \nfor term limits in football. Otherwise, the 49'ers, with the shy smile \nand accurate arm of Joe Montana, would not have won super bowls in the \n1981 season, in 1984, or in 1989 and finally in the following year, a \ncrushing 55 to 10 win. Now, as a native San Franciscan, I do take pride \nin such an exemplary record. And, frankly, while wishing San Diego \nwell, I expect Steve Young to demonstrate his mastery of the game with \nan unprecedented fifth Super Bowl victory for the 49'ers.\n  Both teams, however, are to be congratulated for their success in \nreaching the Super Bowl, and for many other accomplishments, is that \nnot right?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely. Let me discuss one area of professional \nsports that deserves more attention: the work that many athletes do to \nhelp others in their communities. I'd like to cite two examples of \nplayers who give their all.\n  Junior Seau, the all-pro linebacker of the Chargers works hard for \nhis charity, the Junior Seau Foundation, which helps youth in the San \nDiego area by funding child abuse prevention, drug and alcohol \nawareness, and anti-juvenile delinquency programs. He is also his \nteam's spokesman for the United Way.\n  Forty Niner quarterback Steve Young heads the Forever Young \nFoundation which funds a number of San Francisco Bay area charities. \nThese are but two examples of players who feel an obligation to give \nback to the communities that so enthusiastically support them.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Well, no matter which team wins, Senator Boxer and I \ncan take pride. There are obvious similarities between Government and \nfootball. In both, blows to the face are disallowed. And there is much \nthat Government can learn from football--hopefully, beyond trick plays \nand sneaks. For one thing, we can learn that sportsmanship and mutual \nrespect that go with handshakes between players after the battle is \nover, the score is settled and life moves on to other challenges. Here \nis to a great game.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/27/senate-section/article/S1706-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1707-S1709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S1707]]\n IN OPPOSITION TO THE PROPOSED $40 BILLION IN LOAN GUARANTEES TO MEXICO\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, President Clinton outlined the many \nchallenges facing this Nation in his State of the Union Address. \nParamount amongst those challenges was the need to bring fiscal \nresponsibility back to the Congress and the Federal Government.\n  I appreciate the President's acknowledgement of the need to balance \nour budget. In this same speech, coupled with the challenges that we \nface as a nation, the President outlined his proposed action to assist \nour neighbors in Mexico.\n  The Congress will soon be faced with a vote on whether to support \nthis proposal, which will provide Mexico with $40 billion in loan \nguarantees. The purpose of the loan guarantees is to reschedule \noverextended short-term maturities, assisting Mexico through what is \nnow a difficult financial situation.\n  With our current budgetary problems, I cannot support the exposure of \nmy fellow American taxpayers to the tune of $40 billion in loan \nguarantees as initially proposed by President Clinton.\n  Mr. President, as the administration and Congress struggle with this \nfiscal crisis, I am concerned that we are overlooking many important \nfactors. Mexico's financial situation seems to be the result of past \npolicy decisions, not external factors outside of Mexican control.\n  The Mexican Central Bank, in an attempt to hold interest rates down, \nprinted a huge excess of pesos. By creating excess pesos, Mexico \nundermined the exchange rate and drove many investors away. The \ndevaluation was forced by bad monetary policy.\n  The mistakes made by Mexico do not give me confidence that this loan \npackage is a good idea. If we are asking taxpayers to risk their hard-\nearned money, we must guarantee that this loan is not throwing good \nmoney after bad. I suggest that we ask for four specific conditions:\n  (1) Sound money policy. This could be guaranteed by the institution \nof a currency board.\n  (2) Guarantees that tax policy will be pro-growth and wage and price \ncontrols will be eliminated.\n  (3) Reasonable and adequate collateral.\n  (4) Full disclosure of how the moneys raised under the guarantee are \ndisbursed.\n  Mr. President, the problems in Mexico are not new, and they are \ncertainly not simple. Therefore, in an effort to further review this \nproblem, members of the Senate Steering Committee invited several \nspeakers to provide more-in-depth information. Those speakers included \nWalker Todd, Lawrence Kudlow, Steve Hanke, and Riordan Roett.\n  My purpose in pointing this out is to emphasize that my position on \nthis issue has not been formed hastily. My support of pursuing a \ncurrency board for Mexico is not an effort to ignore the needs or \nproblem that Mexico now faces.\n  Quite the opposite. A currency board, from the information I have \nreviewed, seems the most viable option to provide a solution to this \nproblem rather than a Band-Aid response that will provide only \ntemporary relief.\n  Mr. President, Steve Hanke, who is a professor of applied economics \nat Johns Hopkins University and has researched and written extensively \non monetary policy and the use of currency boards, made a number of \ncogent points which I would like to share my with my colleagues. The \nsimplicity of a currency board is one of its greatest assets:\n\n       A currency board is a monetary institution that only issues \n     notes and coins. It maintains full convertibility of that \n     money at a permanently fixed exchange rate with a foreign \n     anchor currency, such as the dollar. As reserves, it holds \n     assets in the anchor currency equal to 100 percent of all \n     notes and coins in circulation.\n       This requirement provides credibility for the fixed rate \n     because a board cannot expand the monetary base faster than \n     it obtains foreign reserves. Consequently, a board cannot \n     cause a balance of payments crisis because of a lack of \n     foreign reserves. Indeed, no currency board system has ever \n     succumbed to a balance of payments crisis.\n\n  In addition to their simplicity, currency boards have a proven \nrecord. Professor Hanke discussed the success of currency boards in \nHong Kong, Estonia, Lithuania, and Argentina. I was especially \ninterested in the success of the currency board in Argentina.\n  That country was experiencing annual inflation rates of 2,315 percent \nin 1990. In April of 1991,\n President Menem of Argentina Installed a currency board.\n\n  Since the adoption of a currency board, the rate of inflation in that \ncountry has dropped to around 3.9 percent--the lowest in Latin \nAmerica--and, the budget is virtually balanced with economic growth up \nto about 7 percent. The successes in Argentina need to be very \ncarefully reviewed and considered as a model for resolving the problems \nexperienced in Mexico.\n  Rather than writing a blank check, I hope that this administration \nwill consider opening discussions with the Mexicans to review this \noption.\n  Professor Hanke also pointed out that a currency board could be \nestablished easily and inexpensively. In fact, language on currency \nboards, included in the 1993 Foreign Operations Appropriations bill \nprovides that:\n\n       There is appropriated for an increase in the United States \n     quota in the international monetary fund, the dollar \n     equivalent of 8,608.5 million special drawing rights, to \n     remain available until expended and, among other uses,\n       Such funds may be used to support monetary stability in \n     member countries through the instrumentality of currency \n     boards. (Public Law 102-391, 106 U.S. Statutes at Large \n     1636).\n\n  In short, Mr. President, I cannot support the extension of $40 \nbillion in loan guarantees to Mexico.\n  With respect to the issues of adequate collateral and full disclosure \nof receipts, in my estimation these issues should be addressed fully in \nthis debate. The need for adequate collateral for a loan guarantee is \nfairly straightforward.\n  I have grave concerns about accepting Mexican oil receipts as \ncollateral when they are previously obligated and limited--Pemex, the \nNational Petroleum Co.'s gross export receipts per year are about $8.5 \nbillion.\n  There is an excellent discussion of this issue and the need for full \ndisclosure in a recently published article from The Nation magazine by \nWalker Todd.\n  Let me add, I do not often agree with the positions raised in this \npublication, but hope that my colleagues will take a moment to review \nit.\n  Mr. President I ask unanimous consent to enter a copy of the article \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From the Nation, Feb. 13, 1995]\n\n            Mexican Handout--Bailing Out the Creditor Class\n\n                          (By Walker F. Todd]\n\n       One of the most preposterous financial crimes of the \n     century, the official management of the 1980s developing-\n     countries debt crisis, is being repeated before our very \n     eyes, and by many of the original perpetrators to boot. As \n     this is written, the Clinton Administration is pushing, and \n     Congress seems poised to approve, a loan guarantee package \n     for Mexico of up to $40 billion. This is on top of hastily \n     arranged international credit lines worth $18 billion, most \n     of them guaranteed directly or indirectly by the United \n     States and cobbled together since Christmas.\n       Mexico owes the world about $120 billion (more than $160 \n     million by some estimates), and about $58 billion of that \n     amount falls due this year. Hence the need for a total aid \n     package of about $58 billion, although it is not yet certain \n     that most or all of that aid will be drawn upon. One must be \n     exacting and clear about who the principal beneficiaries of a \n     U.S. guarantee of Mexico's foreign debts would be: Mexico \n     owes foreign--primarily U.S.--investors in stock shares and \n     bonds about $60 billion. Also, about $18.3 billion of the \n     $120 billion total is owned to U.S. banks, led by Citibank \n     with about $2.9 billion. With the peso down in value by one-\n     third and Mexico's dollar reserves dwindling, it is clear \n     that only a mammoth infusion of funds or forgiveness of its \n     debts can prevent the country from defaulting.\n       The original crime, now being repeated, was the profligate \n     lending of billions of dollars from the U.S. banking system \n     between 1974 and 1982 to as gaudy a band of tinpot military \n     dictators, kleptocratic presidents and bon vivant finance \n     ministers as ever graced a Connecticut Avenue diplomatic \n     reception, followed in August 1982 by the discovery that the \n     borrowers either could not or would not repay the money. But \n     it was not practical politics to recognize the stupidity of \n     the situation and call the lenders into account. No, \n     orthodoxy and good form required the ongoing pretense that \n     the loans were still good, with a host of jerry-built \n     solutions from the Treasury, Federal Reserve, \n     [[Page S1708]] International Monetary Fund and World Bank. \n     So, as an African economist once told me, `One class of \n     people borrowed the money, and a different class of people \n     had to pay it back.''\n       The I.M.F.-policed austerity regimes that were used to keep \n     the loan money flowing (usually only enough to pay the \n     interest; the principal was rarely reduced) became legendary \n     in developing countries during the 1980s. What did the \n     governing cities or international financial diplomats care if \n     the vanishing middle class and teeming poor of the Third \n     World paid the price of ``adjustment'' while the lifestyles \n     of the rich changed not at all?\n       In 1982 Mexico owned U.S. banks about $25 billion. The \n     dirty secret of Debt Crisis I was that foreign banks had \n     deposits of flight capital from rich residents of the debtor \n     nations that would have covered much (and in some cases all) \n     of the banks' claims on the debtor countries. But despite the \n     price paid for ``adjustment'' by the middle classes and the \n     poor of the developing countries, not to mention the price \n     paid in lost export sales to those countries by U.S. \n     manufacturers and farmers in the heartland, the names of the \n     thieves and the amounts they stole were never disclosed.\n       Now, by devaluing the peso, Mexico has again committed \n     moral (if not technical) default on its dollar-denominated \n     obligations. This is the principal legacy of the \n     administration of former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari \n     and his supporters in the U.S. establishment. It is doubtful \n     that Mexico can meet its external obligations during 1995 \n     without either debt relief (always the right answer in \n     international lending problems involving developing \n     countries) or new loans from First World governments and \n     banks (the establishment's preferred solution). After the \n     lost decade of the 1980s, relieved only briefly in the early \n     1990s by the North American Free Trade Agreement financial \n     bubble, the Mexican people find themselves once more \n     confronting official demands for renewed austerity, quiet \n     acceptance of further reduced wages (now approximately 60 \n     percent below 1980 levels in inflation-adjusted peso terms), \n     reduced possibilities for immigration to the United States to \n     escape poverty, and diminished prospects for renewed growth \n     of the Mexican economy for the foreseeable future.\n       But here is where the truly intolerable part begins again: \n     The governing elites in both countries who caused, \n     exacerbated or covered up this mess expect to be held \n     harmless, just as happened in 1982.\n       Secret credit lines for Mexico from the United States, \n     Japan and European governments amounting to as much as $12 \n     billion were negotiated twice in the past fifteen months or \n     so, ostensibly to defend the peso, but it is now clear that \n     the only possible use of those lines would have been to \n     finance the flight from the peso of Mexico's governing elites \n     and their compatriots in the international financial system. \n     Amusingly, through a tripartite credit line involving Canada \n     as well as Mexico, which was announced publicly in April \n     1994, the United States essentially has agreed to lend Canada \n     dollars that Canada can then lend to Mexico, which further \n     weakens the U.S. dollar: Our own creditor now understand that \n     we have underwritten the foreign debts of our two neighbors. \n     Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was an active \n     promoter of those credit lines, as well as the current \n     bailout effort.\n       The principal purpose to be served by the new Mexican \n     bailout package is to prevent a loss of confidence of foreign \n     investors in a host of other developing nations, like \n     Argentina. But this is a silly exercise, a true confidence \n     game, because now no rational investor could have faith in \n     Mexico's governing Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), \n     which has enjoyed so much official U.S. support in recent \n     decades. The Banco de Mexico, the country's central bank, was \n     still intervening in the Mexico City stock exchange and \n     rigging tesobono (treasury bill) auctions in the same week \n     that the bailout package was presented to Congress, a clear \n     indication that stability has not returned to the country's \n     shaky financial markets. Also, if other countries have \n     mismanaged their financial affairs and are courting disaster \n     for their currencies, there is not much that a bailout of \n     Mexico can do to restore investor confidence. Besides, the \n     prospects for repayment from future Mexican oil receipts, for \n     example, are somewhat limited: At current oil production and \n     price levels, the gross export receipts for Pemex, the \n     national petroleum company, are only about $8.5 billion per \n     year, and most of that has already been pledged to other \n     purposes. The time is long since past in Washington for a \n     repetition of the Paul Volcker-directed ``lend new money to \n     meet the interest payments and pretend that it is all still \n     good debt'' strategy of the 1980s.\n       Dissent has broken out in both the Republican and \n     Democratic parties over various aspects of the bailout. A \n     variety of extraneous conditions are being proposed to \n     sweeten the\n      deal: demands that Mexico loosen its ties to Cuba and crack \n     down on illegal immigrants to the United States (red meat \n     for the right), and calls for stronger enforcement of \n     labor and environmental protection (for the liberal left). \n     But what a bottom is needed is a prompt and full \n     disclosure of what the $40 billion bill will be used for. \n     The names and amounts paid for each disbursement under the \n     credit line should be published. If there are Charles \n     Keatings, Ferdinand Marcoses and M. Danny Walls lurking in \n     this Mexican credit mess, then the public is entitled to \n     know who they are and what they intend to do with the \n     money they receive at our expense. And if the names \n     disclosed prove to be those of prominent Mexicans and U.S. \n     banks, securities firms, mutual funds and pension fund \n     managers, then we should know that, too. Who knows, with \n     enough disclosure, maybe no one would step forward to \n     claim the money. But don't count on it.\n       Unfortunately the loan guarantees as currently proposed \n     cannot foster real stability in Mexico. And support for the \n     side agreements to NAFTA misses the point entirely. \n     Dissenters in Congress should insist on complete \n     institutional and financial reform of the Mexican government, \n     which might then do more to address labor and environmental \n     concerns. The PRI has forfeited all moral authority to \n     govern. President Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon should invite \n     the two main opposition parties to join his Cabinet on a full \n     power-sharing basis, with all the important Cabinet \n     ministries going to the opposition. The PRI itself should be \n     dissolved.\n       To combat the PRI's almost unnatural hold on the affections \n     of many of Mexico's uneducated poor, truth commissions \n     independent of the PRI, like those used in Chile after \n     Pinochet, should be established to investigate matters like \n     the use of the foreign credit lines by the Banco de Mexico, \n     the assassinations of the student demonstrators in Mexico \n     City in 1968, the manipulation of the 1988 election results, \n     the responsibility for the assassinations of Luis Donaldo \n     Colosio (first presidential candidate of the PRI) and Jose \n     Francisco, Ruiz Massies (second-ranking official of the PRI) \n     in 1994, and the assassinations of journalists and opposition \n     activists during the Salinas regime. Also, a separate inquiry \n     should be mounted into the influence of drug runners and \n     money launderers in Mexican public life, as well as their \n     connections to foreign intelligence services.\n       As for Washington's pending actions: It once was a federal \n     felony under the Johnson Act for any person subject to U.S. \n     jurisdiction to lend money to a foreign government in default \n     on its loans from the United States. After 1945, however, the \n     act was amended to accommodate the formation of the Bretton \n     Woods institutions. Only international financial ``outlaws'' \n     like the former Soviet Union China were excluded. There in \n     1992, during the euphoria over market openings in Russia, the \n     Johnson Act was quietly amended further to exempt from its \n     prohibitions the former Soviet-bloc countries that were not \n     yet of the I.M.F. and World Bank, establishing the principle \n     that even ``outlaws'' may now borrow money in international \n     financial markets. This is too bad, for as the crimes of 1982 \n     are repeated, this time we lack a good felony statute with \n     which to punish the miscreants.\n\n  Mr. GRAIG. Before closing, I would like to discuss the effect of the \nproposed $40 billion loan-guarantee package in my own home State of \nIdaho. Mr. President, in a report released by the Department of the \nTreasury titled, ``America's Stake in the Mexican Loan Guarantee \nProgram: A State-by-State Analysis of American Jobs Dependent on \nExports to Mexico,'' Idaho was listed with approximately 700 jobs \nrelating to products intended for export to Mexico.\n  While this number may seem negligible to some, it is not \ninsignificant in relation to the overall workforce of Idaho.\n  Therefore, one of the points that I want to emphasize is that I have \ntaken into consideration the impact the Mexican financial crisis and \nproposed resolution of loan guarantees may have on the workers in my \nState. However, jobs are not the only thing that this situation could \naffect.\n  Mr. President, we are discussing a substantial amount of money, $40 \nbillion from the pockets of American Taxpayers--from the pockets of \nIdahoans.\n  The phones in my State offices and in my D.C. office have been busy \nwith frustrated constituents calling to tell me that they are opposed \nto the blank -check approach to alleviating this problem.\n  Mr. President, those 700 jobs in Idaho will not be secured if \nMexico's fiscal and monetary policies do not change.\n  And, I am concerned that we could find ourselves 6 to 12 months down \nthe road with those 700 jobs in Idaho still at risk, and taxpayers \nbeing asked to dig even deeper into their pockets. That is not a \nsituation that I will help to create.\n  In closing, let me add that our elections in November carried a clear \nmessage from American voters that they want to see less Government.\n  If the United States provides Mexico with the $40 billion in loan \nguarantees and allows the current policies there to continue, we will \nbe financing bigger \n[[Page S1709]] Government and Government-controlled responses to the \nmonetary problems there.\n  Raising taxes and implementing wage and price controls were not part \nof our electorate's message last year, and I am not supportive of \nfinancing those problems in other countries.\n  There are options to resolving the monetary crisis in Mexico and they \nneed to be fully considered. I hope that we will have a full review of \nthis issue, and take a path that will lead toward a solution, not a \nBand-Aid for Mexico.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/27/senate-section/article/S1707-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        DYNAMIC REVENUE ANALYSIS\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, a few weeks ago I sat through a hearing \nof the House and Senate Budget Committees on the issue of dynamic and \nstatic revenue estimating. At this hearing, the staff of the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation presented a statement that seemed particularly \nconcerned about an article that Bruce Bartlett of the Alexis de \nTocqueville Institution had published in the Wall Street Journal a few \nweeks ago. Since I know Mr. Bartlett personally, I was especially \ninterested in what he had to say.\n  Apparently what the Joint Committee staff is most concerned about was \nMr. Bartlett's discussion of an exchange Senator Packwood, the chairman \nof the Finance Committee, had had with the Joint Tax Committee \nregarding the revenue effect of raising the top tax rate to 100 percent \non those earning more than $200,000. According to Senator Packwood, the \nJoint Committee had predicted some $200 billion per year in additional \nrevenues from this tax change. Senator Packwood rightly characterized \nthis estimate as questionable.\n  Now, according to the Joint Committee staff, there was nothing wrong \nwith this estimate because it included a caveat that it did not take \ninto account any behavioral response. They then included in an appendix \nto the statement a complete set of correspondence between Senator \nPackwood and the Joint Tax Committee on this matter. Apparently, the \nSenator from Oregon has had a long time interest in this issue and has \nperiodically asked the Joint Committee to update its estimates.\n  I do not believe that simply appending a caveat is at all adequate. \nThe fact is that a 100-percent tax rate would raise zero revenue and \neveryone knows it.\n  If this were merely an academic discussion, it would not concern me. \nBut under the budget laws and established practice, we are required to \ntreat these estimates from the Joint Committee as if they are \nscientific truth. And we all know that these estimates carry enormous \nweight when it comes to legislating changes in the Tax Code. If the \nJoint Committee says a tax cut will lose $101 million and there is only \nroom in the budget for a $100 million tax cut, then you are out of \nluck. A point of order will prevail and your tax proposal is out the \nwindow.\n  Now, I had always assumed that the whole point of having revenue \nestimates on tax bills was so that we could project the actual effect \nof tax changes on the Government's aggregate revenues as accurately as \npossible. Yet here we have clear evidence that the Joint Committee has \nproduced estimates for the chairman of the Finance Committee that do \nnot fully account for behavioral changes.\n  I am very concerned about this because the Joint Committee on \nTaxation probably produces hundreds of estimates during the course of a \nyear that effectively have the force of law. Even the Treasury \nDepartment's estimates do not have the same weight as those produced by \nthe Joint Committee, because the Congress will always defer to its own \nstaff in a dispute with the administration. It makes me wonder what \nother caveats are buried in these estimates that have not gotten any \nattention in the past.\n  In any case, the sensible thing would seem to be for the Joint \nCommittee to produce estimates that it actually believes are as correct \nas possible, in terms of the actual effect on the Government's revenues \nof any changes in tax policy.\n  Apparently, this matter of improving the quality of revenue estimates \nhas become a political issue, with those opposed to certain tax \nproposals standing firm against any dynamic scoring. This is apparent \nfrom the article I read in the Wall Street Journal, in which the \nchairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, Laura \nD'Andrea Tyson, also attacks my\n friend Bruce Bartlett for noting several instances in which the Joint \nCommittee's estimates for tax increases were far too high.\n\n  Ms. Tyson states that Mr. Bartlett ignored the many times their \nestimates were too low, as though this constitutes a defense of the \nJoint Committee's methodology. However, it seems to me that being too \nlow is just as bad as being too high.\n  Ms. Tyson further notes that the Joint Committee's estimates were \nsomethings wrong because of unforeseen events. She implies that the \ncollapse of oil prices in the early 1980's was such an unforeseen event \nthat made the Joint Committee's estimate of the windfall profits tax be \nfar too high. In fact, as I recall, there were a number of economists \nat that time who were arguing that decontrol of the price of oil was \nvery likely to reduce the price of oil by encouraging additional \ndrilling and exploration. In fact, I believe that this is exactly what \ndid happen.\n  Lastly, Ms. Tyson indicates that the reason why corporate tax \nrevenues fell after the Tax Reform Act of 1986, rather than rise in \naccordance with Joint Committee estimates, is because corporations \nceased doing business as corporations and began operating as \npartnerships or subchapter S corporations. Thus the revenue that was \nlost on the corporate side was made back on the individual side.\n  The point here is that the 1986 act lowered the top individual income \ntax rate below the top corporate rate. I think most tax lawyers could \nhave easily predicted that this would lead people to take advantage of \nthis differential by reorganizing their businesses so as to be taxed at \nthe individual rate rather than the corporate rate.\n  While it may be true, as Ms. Tyson says, that the Treasury did not \nactually suffer that much of a net revenue loss, it still does not \nexplain the Joint Committee's apparent estimating errors.\n  Personally, as a legislator, I want the best possible information \nbefore I make a decision. I think the Joint Committee and the \nCongressional Budget Office should at least explore the possibility of \npreparing dynamic revenue estimates. Their revenue estimating models \nshould be improved and updated to account more fully for changes in \nbehavior and economic growth. Perhaps a commission comprised of public \nand private sector experts could be established to recommend reforms in \nthe revenue estimating process.\n  I would suggest we keep the current static revenue scoring, but \nrequire the Joint Committee to provide a range of possible dynamic \nrevenue estimates for major tax bills for illustrative purposes only. \nAfter a period of time, we could compare the static and dynamic \nestimates to see which ones came closer to reality.\n  As a member of the Senate Budget Committee this is a matter I intend \nto follow closely as time goes by. My only interest, as I said, is to \nget the best, most accurate, information possible. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/27/senate-section/article/S1709-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1709-S1710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       KENNEWICK SCHOOL DISTRICT\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nKennewick schools and their community for being recognized by the \nCenter for Workplace Preparation as 1 of 21 most effective national \nprograms working to involve parents in education. We all recognize the \nvital role parents have in the social, physical, and psychological \ngrowth of our children. Unfortunately, whether by choice, due to other \ncommitments or a lack of communication between parents, children, and \nthe school, parents are all too often excluded from school activities. \nOur schools recognize that if we are going to effectively deal with the \nproblems in our classrooms, we need a higher level of parental \ninvolvement. Fortunately, many of our parents realize they have to \nbecome more involved in the education of their children and have \ncollaborated with their schools to develop programs which meet the \nneeds of the families, the schools and the community.\n  [[Page S1710]] Today, one of the greatest problems facing our schools \nis drug abuse. We all recognize the toll the drug abuse takes on our \nfamilies, our communities, and ultimately our economy. Studies reveal \nthat 70 percent of public school students aged 12 through 19 reported \nin 1989 that drugs are available at their school. Nearly 13 percent of \n8th graders, 23 percent of 10th graders, and 30 percent of 12th graders \nhad five or more drinks in a row in a 2-week period during the 1990-91 \nschool year. And, 44 percent of all our teachers reported in 1992 that \nstudent misbehavior interfered substantially with their teaching.\n  There is no question that safety and order are necessary in our \nclassrooms if we want learning to take place. Yet, the use of alcohol \nand other drugs is unacceptably high among our school-age children and \nthe results of this use are increased violence, misbehavior, and little \ndesire to engage in learning. Recognizing the toll drug abuse takes on \nour schools and communities, the Kennewick School District and \ncommunity parents came together to develop the Parent Network which \naims to curb student substance abuse and increase parent knowledge of \ntheir children's activities. To join the Network, parents must sign an \nagreement that their children will remain substance free for the school \nyear and will set curfews for their children. Family and student \nactivities are arranged by the Network which are guaranteed to be \nsubstance free. I also want to stress that while the purpose of the \nprogram is to include parents in this process, the Network ensures that \nstudents have a voice in all activities. Their involvement is critical \nto the success of such programs and I am pleased the school and \ncommunity have sought their inclusion.\n  One of our national goals is to encourage parental involvement in \neducation and I want to commend the Kennewick School District and their \ncommunity not only for recognizing the importance of parental \ninvolvement but for implementing a program that works for our schools \nand our families. The American College Testing recently released a \npublication entitled: ``On Target: Effective Parent Involvement \nPrograms'' which discusses the need for parental involvement and \ndescribes how the 21 selected programs are supporting this aim. I am \nvery encouraged by the efforts being made by communities throughout our \nNation and I hope other will follow the example set by these \noutstanding programs.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/27/senate-section/article/S1709-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           THE ``ENOLA GAY''\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I have followed with increasing distress \nthe events surrounding the Smithsonian Institution's exhibit on the \nEnola Gay and the end of World War II. With each passing day we are \nmade privy to revelations of an offensive and unrecognizable telling of \nthe great struggle to protect the United States and free the world from \nthe tyranny of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan.\n  Many of our citizens who have proudly worn the uniform of our \nmilitary and offered their lives in the service of our Nation, have \nexpressed justified outrage that the Nation's repository of collective \nmemory should be so callously dismissive of the salient issues \ninvolved.\n  Adolf Hitler and his Nazi regime were responsible for the unspeakable \nhorror upon tens of millions of people in Europe. Indeed, today marks \nthe 15th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, a striking event \nwhich reminds us of the tyranny of fascism. Imperial Japan launched a \ncalculated attack on our Nation in the predawn light of December 7, \n1941, and precipitated a war which saw excruciating suffering visited \nupon the people of Korea, Manchuria, and the military forces of the \nUnited States. And now, the institution which for over a century has \nserved as the premier repository of our cultural, intellectual, and \ntechnological history has decided to portray the noble, titanic \nstruggle against evil as nothing more that a power struggle against \nmoral equivalents.\n  I am appalled that our national history is being rewritten. I spoke \nagainst the original Enola Gay display at the Smithsonian which wrongly \ndepicted our Nation's history during World War II. The second display \nresulted in more revisionism and more public concern and required \ncongressional consternation to get it changed.\n  The Smithsonian Institution has a magnificent track record of telling \nthe history of our country with accuracy, compassion, and style.\n  I call upon the Smithsonian Institution to work with veteran \norganizations to create an accurate, fair, and compelling display of \nwhich we all can be proud.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/27/senate-section/article/S1710-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:07 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 273.

Mr. President, I rise to emphasize the critical need \nfor a smarter, more cost-effective approach to Government regulation. \nToday, I introduce legislation intended to generate constructive debate \non this important issue.\n  As chairman of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, I want to build \nconsensus on how to regulate smarter among all engaged in the growing \ndebate on regulatory reform--including the general public, businesses \nof all sizes, environmental and public interest groups, academia, State \nand local governments, the White House, and my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle. Throughout my career, I have been committed to protecting \nthe environment, health, and safety. I reaffirm that commitment today. \nWe should not forget that many regulations provide important \nprotections and benefits to the public. Let there be no mistake--we \nneed a clean environment, safe workplaces, and safe medications.\n  Mr. President, it is clear that the regulatory process is broken. Too \nmany regulations impose undue costs, and the regulatory process itself \nhas become too cumbersome, unresponsive, and inefficient. The \ncumulative cost of regulation is enormous and is rising at an alarming \nrate. The annual cost of Federal regulation was conservatively \nestimated at about $560 billion for 1992; it could exceed $660 billion \nby the year 2000. About three-fourths of the cost increase is expected \nfrom upcoming risk regulations, such as environmental, health, and \nsafety standards.\n  The rising cost of regulation affects us all--businesses large and \nsmall, governments at all levels, and the American worker and consumer. \nRegulations drive up prices and stifle wages, innovation, and economic \ngrowth. Although the direct costs of regulation generally are imposed \non businesses and governments, these costs ultimately are passed on to \nthe American consumer through higher prices, diminished wages, \nincreased taxes, or reduced government services. The cost of regulation \nhas been estimated at about $6,000 per year for the average American \nhousehold.\n  The recent elections brought to this Congress historic change, an \nwith it, and unprecedented opportunity to reform the regulatory \nprocess. However, it is important that we take a balanced approach to \nreform. In our zeal to implement substantial changes, we should act \ncarefully so that we truly perfect needed Government programs--not \ncripple or stymie them. Building a smarter regulatory process will \nrequire the expertise and consensus of those on all sides of the \nregulatory reform debate. Together, we should strive to achieve \ndesirable social goals in the most cost-effective manner practical.\n  My goal is to forge a consensus on effective legislation to make the \nregulatory process more efficient and effective. The bill I am \nintroducing today is a first step in this direction, but it requires \nfurther debate and deliberation. It may be necessary to add further \nprovisions, delete some, or revise others. I will chair a series of \nhearings, beginning on February 8, to provide a forum to discuss the \nbroad principles of regulatory reform--those reflected in this bill as \nwell as others we have not yet addressed.\n  My bill will require Federal agencies to seriously consider whether \nthe benefits of regulating justify its costs. When regulating risks, \nregulators will be required to make realistic estimates of risk based \non the available data, and disclose to the public any assumptions \nnecessary to measure those risks. The bill also will encourage agencies \nto base their priorities on the relative risks posed by various \nsubstances, activities, and products to achieve the greatest overall \nreduction in risk at the least cost. More generally, my bill will \nrequire agencies to review existing regulations, to be sensitive to the \ncumulative regulatory burden, and to select the most cost-effective, \nmarket-driven method practical. These are but some of the principles to \nbe discussed at the hearings on regulatory reform.\n  We can reinvent the regulatory process to ensure that when agencies \nchoose to regulate, they will do so in a more effective and less costly \nmanner. We can reduce the burden on governments, businesses, and the \npublic, and still ensure that important benefits and protections are \nprovided. We cannot afford to ignore the need to regulate smarter.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the legislation I introduce today be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 291\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide Federal recognition of the Mowa Band of \nChoctaw Indians of Alabama; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n            THE MOWA BAND OF CHOCTAW INDIANS RECOGNITION ACT\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Mowa \nBand of Choctaw Indians Recognition Act. This particular piece of \nlegislation has passed the Senate three times in the past two \nCongresses. While I would prefer not to have to pursue congressionally \ngranted recognition for the Mowa Choctaws, this course of action has \nbeen dictated by the institutional resistance of the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs to Federal recognition of the Mowa.\n  The Mowa Choctaws originally applied for Federal recognition in 1983. \nA State-recognized tribe with 3,500 members, the Mowa live within the \nboundaries of the original Choctaw Nation in Mobile and Washington \nCounties of Alabama. Mowa ancestors were signatories of the treaty of \nDancing Rabbit Creek which provided for the nonremoval of Indian \nfamilies. Under the treaty, the signatories and their descendants were \nentitled to retain their rights to Choctaw citizenship.\n  The Mowa Choctaws have maintained an intense Indian identity over the \npast 160 years and have petitioned Congress for Federal recognition or \nto redress treaty grievances several times, beginning as early as 1836. \nBecause of the failure of the BIA to act upon their petition in a \ntimely manner, the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs reported the bill \nin both the 102d and 103d Congress with the recommendation that the \nMowa be granted full Federal recognition.\n  Only recently has the BIA acted upon the petition. In December, the \nBIA, after 12 years of delay, issued a preliminary finding denying the \nMowa petition. However, the BIA only acted upon the petition when it \nbecame likely that the bill would pass the Congress and be sent to the \nPresident for his signature. I find this conduct at best suspicious, \nand most likely reflective of the BIA's longstanding bureaucratic \ndisposition against the proposal.\n  Mr. President, I have no intention of dropping this issue, regardless \nof the position of the BIA. Indeed, Congress granted Federal \nrecognition to one-half dozen Indian tribes last year without the \napproval of the BIA. Congress writes the laws of this land. Career and \nappointed bureaucrats do not. The Mowa case is stronger than scores of \npast petitions for recognition that were approved, and I will continue \nto work to see that Congress rectifies this bureaucratic injustice and \ngrants the Mowa Choctaws the Federal recognition that they \ndeserve.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/27/senate-section/article/S1711-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1719]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 230\n\n  At the request of Mr. Dole, the names of the Senator from New Jersey \n[Mr. Bradley], the Senator from Idaho [Mr. Craig], and the Senator from \nIllinois [Ms. Moseley-Braun] were added as cosponsors of S. 230, a bill \nto prohibit United States assistance to countries that prohibit or \nrestrict the transport or delivery of United States humanitarian \nassistance.\n\n\n                                 S. 250\n\n  At the request of Mr. McConnell, the name of the Senator from \nPennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] was added as a cosponsor of S. 250, a bill \nto amend chapter 41 of title 28, United States Code, to provide for an \nanalysis of certain bills and resolutions pending before the Congress \nby the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States \nCourts, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 262\n\n  At the request of Mr. Grassley, the names of the Senator from Indiana \n[Mr. Lugar] and the Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Thomas] were added as \ncosponsors of S. 262, a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \nto increase and make permanent the deduction for health insurance costs \nof self-employed individuals.\n\n\n                                 S. 270\n\n  At the request of Mr. Smith, the name of the Senator from \nPennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] was added as a cosponsor of S. 270, a bill \nto provide special procedures for the removal of alien terrorists.\n\n\n                          Senate Resolution 37\n\n  At the request of Mr. Packwood, the names of the Senator from \nCalifornia [Mrs. Feinstein] and the Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. \nPell] were added as cosponsors of Senate Resolution 37, a resolution \ndesignating February 2, 1995, and February 1, 1996, as ``National Women \nand Girls in Sports Day.''\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/27/senate-section/article/S1719-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1720-S1725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S1720]]\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                KEMPTHORNE (AND GLENN) AMENDMENT NO. 228\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE (for himself and Mr. Glenn) proposed an amendment to \namendment No. 210 the bill (S. 1).

IMPACT ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Congress should be concerned about shifting costs \n     from Federal to State and local authorities and should be \n     equally concerned about the growing tendency of States to \n     shift costs to local governments;\n       (2) cost shifting from States to local governments has, in \n     many instances, forced local governments to raise property \n     taxes or curtail sometimes essential services; and\n       (3) increases in local property taxes and cuts in essential \n     services threaten the ability of many citizens to attain and \n     maintain the American dream of owning a home in a safe, \n     secure community.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Federal Government should not shift certain costs \n     to the State, and States should end the practice of shifting \n     costs to local governments, which forces many local \n     governments to increase property taxes;\n       (2) States should end the imposition, in the absence of \n     full consideration by their legislatures, of State issued \n     mandates on local governments without adequate State funding, \n     in a manner that may displace other essential government \n     priorities; and\n       (3) one primary objective of this Act and other efforts to \n     change the relationship among Federal, State, and local \n     governments should be to reduce taxes and spending at all \n     levels and to end the practice of shifting costs from one \n     level of government to another with little or no benefit to \n     taxpayers.\n\n     SEC. 109. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This title shall take effect on January 1, 199? or on the \n     date 90 days after appropriations are made available as \n     authorized under section 104, whichever is earlier, and \n     shall \n     [[Page S1724]] apply to legislation considered on and after \n     such date.\n             TITLE II--REGULATORY ACCOUNTABILITY AND REFORM\n\n     SEC. 201. REGULATORY PROCESS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Each agency shall, to the extent permitted \n     in law--\n       (1) assess the effects of Federal regulations on State, \n     local, and tribal governments (other than to the extent that \n     such regulations incorporate requirements specifically set \n     forth in legislation), and the private sector including \n     specifically the availability of resources to carry out any \n     Federal intergovernmental mandates in those regulations; and\n       (2) seek to minimize those burdens that uniquely or \n     significantly affect such governmental entities, consistent \n     with achieving statutory and regulatory objectives.\n       (b) State, Local, and Tribal Government Input.--Each agency \n     shall, to the extent permitted in law, develop an effective \n     process to permit elected officials (or their designated \n     representatives) of State, local, and tribal governments to \n     provide meaningful and timely input in the development of \n     regulatory proposals containing significant Federal \n     intergovernmental mandates. Such a process shall be \n     consistent with all applicable laws.\n       (c) Agency Plan.--\n       (1) Effects on state, local, and tribal governments.--\n     Before establishing any regulatory requirements that might \n     significantly or uniquely affect small governments, agencies \n     shall have developed a plan under which the agency shall--\n       (A) provide notice of the contemplated requirements to \n     potentially affected small governments, if any;\n       (B) enable officials of affected small governments to \n     provide input under subsection (b); and\n       (C) inform, educate, and advise small governments on \n     compliance with the requirements.\n       (2) Authorization of appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to each agency to carry out the provisions \n     of this section, and for no other purpose, such sums as are \n     necessary.\n\n     SEC. 202.

Mr. President, I rise today to call attention to the 1996 \nAtlanta Paralympic games which are to be held following the 1996 \nOlympic games in Atlanta. Most people who follow sports realize that \nthe Olympic games will begin in Atlanta on July 19 and conclude on \nAugust 4, next year, 1996.\n\n[[Page S1726]]\n\n  During those 16 days, over 10,000 athletes will compete in 26 sports \nand 37 disciplines. Many people are unaware, however, that just 12 days \nafter the conclusion of the 1996 Summer Olympics, a sporting event of \nsimilar magnitude will begin. The Paralympic opening ceremony will be \nheld August 16 and over the next 12 days of competition more than 4,000 \nathletes from 102 nations will compete in 19 different sports.\n  The origin of the Paralympic movement dates back to 1946 when Sir \nLudwig Guttman organized the International Wheelchair Games to coincide \nwith the 1948 London Olympics. Since that time, the official Paralympic \norganization was established and Paralympic games have been held nine \ntimes in nine countries across the globe. The 1996 Atlanta Paralympics \nwill mark the 10th and largest gathering with an expected 1.5 million \nspectators. Very large number of people coming to Atlanta from all over \nthe world. Over the years those competing in the Paralympics have \nexpanded from wheelchair athletes to include amputees, the blind, those \nwith cerebral palsy, dwarfs, and those with a variety of other physical \nlimitations. While the disabilities of the athletes range across a wide \nspectrum, they are united in their dedication to perfection and their \nquest for excellence.\n  Many of us, myself included, were not aware of the levels at which \nthese athletes compete. It is truly marvelous. Their times and scores \nin sports ranging from cycling to powerlifting, judo to swimming, are \nworld class by any standards. The Paralympic world records for various \nevents are, in some cases, just shy of the Olympic world records which \nis truly amazing. Tony Volpentest, born without hands and feet, ran the \n100 meter event in 11.63 seconds--within 2 seconds of the Olympic \nrecord held by Carl Lewis. Kim Brownfield, a paraplegic, bench pressed \n602 pounds--at that rate he will soon be moving mountains. Without a \ndoubt, the men and women who will be competing in the Atlantic \nParalympics are elite athletes, training and performing at the highest \nlevels of their sports.\n  While their scores and records are awe inspiring, perhaps the \ngreatest accomplishment of the athletes who qualify for the Paralympics \nis their seemingly impossible achievement of conquering their physical \nimpairments. The Paralympic motto is ``The triumph of the human \nspirit.'' Indeed it is this spirit, above all else, that invites us to \nshare in their victories and revel in their accomplishments. Gathered \namongst us in Atlanta in 1996 will be men and women more physically \nchallenged than most of us, yet they will attain levels of excellence \nfar higher than most of us will ever dream of. Through incredible \ndedication and perseverance and despite every pressure to the contrary, \nthese men and women have accomplished extraordinary feats.\n  As you can well imagine, each of these athletes has a\n   tremendous success story behind their achievements, a success story \nbehind their achievements. One that particularly struck me is that of \nAl Mead, an above-the-knee amputee, who captured the silver medal in \nthe long jump in the 1992 Paralympic Games in Barcelona with a jump of \n4.62 meters.\n\n  Like many of these athletes, Al was not born with his disability. He \nwas an active 9-year-old, when one day at school he took a hard fall. \nAfterwards, his left leg was numb and circulation eventually stopped. \nHe faced three operations as doctors tried to correct the problem. \nFirst, his foot was amputated; then, his leg just below the knee; and \nfinally, just above the knee. He still remembers when he was having \nthat ordeal wondering why everyone was so upset. The way Al figured it, \nhis leg would grow back as soon as he got out of the hospital.\n  Al, relying heavily on his family's religious faith, remained \noptimistic during this hospitalization and recovery. Once he returned \nhome from the hospital, he decided to continue doing all the things he \nhad done prior to the operation--despite his doctor's advise to ``take \nit easy.'' Anyone who knows 9-year-old boys ought to know better than \nto expect them to sit sill for any length of time. Indeed, while \nwaiting for his prothesis to arrive, Al taught himself how to ride his \nbike with only one leg. Then, once his leg arrived, Al became more \nactive, playing baseball, hockey, and basketball with community and \nschool teams. Al recalls playing alley football one day when he caught \na pass and was running towards the goal line only to have his leg fall \noff in midstride. While his opponents and teammates were rubbing their \neyes in disbelief, Al was laughing at the happenings.\n  Al attended Morehouse College in Atlanta where he now lives with his \nwife and two children. He is the vice-president of an executive search \nfirm and the music director at his local church. Al has competed in \nnumerous National Handicapped Sports' competitions where he has broken \nnational and world records in the 100- 200- and 400-meter events and \nthe high jump and long jump. He is currently training for the \nParalympic Games, and I particularly look forward to watching Al \nperform in 1996 in his home State and his home town. I also look \nforward to watching thousands of his fellow athletes who may not have \n100-percent bodies but who have 100-percent hearts and give 100 percent \nof their efforts to their stunning athletic achievements.\n  Mr. President, I will be speaking on this subject several times in \nthe next several months, all the way to the Olympic Games in 1996 \nbecause I think it is very important for those of us in this body, \nthose of us who watch this body on television and those people who \nfollow this body throughout the country to understand what a remarkable \nevent is going to take place after the regular Olympic Games in the \nParalympic Games in 1996.\n  I believe that all of us will be very interested and fascinated to \nwatch remarkable athletes such as Al Mead who will be competing in \n1996. I believe that my colleagues and the American people will be both \nawed and inspired by what we discover.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair, in his capacity as a Senator from \nthe State of Missouri, directs the order for the quorum call be \nrescinded.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/27/senate-section/article/S1725-7", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, JANUARY 30, 1995, AT 1 P.M.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
