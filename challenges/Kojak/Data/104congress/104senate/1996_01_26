Mr. President, I apologize to the distinguished Senator \nwaiting to speak but, with reference to the schedule, I would like to \nmake a couple of comments, if I could.\n  Also, of course, there will be conversation today about the START II \nbill.\n  I want to commend the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, who \nis here on the floor, for his effort to get a quick turnaround on this \nconference report agreement. It is bipartisan. Several of the problems \nthat existed in the previous conference report have been removed and a \ncompromise has been worked out. I am sure it is one that neither side \nis 100 percent happy with, but it is one that I think we should \nsupport, and we should move quickly today. I know we have indications \nthat the President will sign this bill. I believe the ranking member of \nthe Armed Services Committee will support it.\n  So, I hope we can get a quick agreement to move forward on this \nDepartment of Defense conference report. We hope to be able to announce \nsomething on that in the next few minutes.\n  Also, there has been an understanding with regard to time that will \nbe used on START II. Hopefully, we can take that time and move forward \non that bill, also.\n  On the continuing resolution, I would like to point out to our \ncolleagues here in the Senate that there has been a lot of work done on \nthis continuing resolution. Again, there has been a lot of give and \ntake. The proof of that is the fact that it passed the House of \nRepresentatives last night by an overwhelming margin of 371 to 42. Only \n42 voted against this continuing resolution. So truly it was a \nbipartisan effort. I have had some contact with the negotiators on that \npackage. They certainly worked very hard, and they came up with what is \ngood for now. It will take us to March 15 and give us additional time \nto get agreement on the appropriations bills that have not passed this \nbody. Hopefully, the Labor-HHS and Education appropriations bills can \nbe moved through the Senate. I remind my colleagues once again that \nthis is where that issue languishes--right here in the Senate.\n  The White House has indicated its support for this continuing \nresolution until March 15. So, it is bipartisan in \n\n[[Page S392]]\nthe House, it is supported by the administration, and we need to act on \nit because we do have the deadline of today, January 26, of the present \ncontinuing resolution. If we do not act this afternoon and get an \nagreement to move this continuing resolution to the President, then we \nhave looming before us the possibility of another Government shutdown. \nThe headlines last night on the television news reports and this \nmorning were very positive. An agreement is reached to open the \nGovernment.\n  Now the Senate should act quickly to follow the example set by the \nHouse. We should not delay this continuing resolution. We should move \nit through following the example set this time by the House of \nRepresentatives. Yet, we are being told that, oh, well, there may have \nto be several votes. There may need to be some amendments. Certainly \nany Senator has a right to offer amendments, but I urge them to think \nvery carefully about what could happen here this afternoon. If we start \namending, or trying to amend, this continuing resolution, if amendments \nare not laid on the table, then we could have a real problem. If we \namend that continuing resolution, it could mean that the shutdown of \nthe Government would begin over the weekend. We would have a real \nproblem.\n\n  The House of Representatives acted responsibly. They have done their \nwork. And they have recessed until next week. So I urge my colleagues \nhere in the Senate to think about this. If you do start offering \namendments and some of them, in fact, do pass, then you are flirting \nwith real danger. And the blame will be on the Senate. It will be on \nthose who offer these amendments which should not be considered in this \nforum and should not be considered on this bill.\n  So, I hope that we will get an agreement on all three of these \nissues, take them up in speedy order, and complete our work this \nafternoon.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am very pleased that we were able to \nget another Defense authorization bill, and I want to commend Senator \nLott, Senator Warner, and Senator Cohen, who have joined with me on the \nconference committee to get this done quickly. We have a good bill.\n  I suggest that we act on it and that it be the first thing we do. I \ndo not think we need more than 45 minutes to decide; in other words, an \nhour and a half to complete this bill and sign it away. I hope it can \nbe taken up at this time.

Mr. President, I was glad the leader spoke about optimism \nand the opportunity to do things. I want to talk just a little bit, if \nI may, in morning business about this past year and the successes of \nthis past year.\n  It seems to me that we have worked very hard. We have worked very \nlong. We had to do a number of things to respond to the voters in 1994 \nwho said the Federal Government is too big and it costs too much. \nAnyone who thinks that making that change from where we have been is \neasy is a bit naive.\n\n  So I think the Republican majority in this Congress has had great \nsuccess. We restructured the debate in this country and have a whole \nnew approach changing the direction of Congress and, frankly, changing \nthe direction of the President. After 30 years of basically dealing \nwith the Great Society and what this group has done time after time, \nwhich is talk about how much more we can spend, there has been no \nbalanced budget for that whole time, but simply a rush to spend more \nand increase taxation. We have turned that around this year. We changed \nthe debate from where it has been for a very long time.\n  As to the continuing resolution, the President is probably going to \nsign it. They say this President is responsible. The Congress is \nresponsible for spending, and it is our responsibility. We are the \ntrustees that have that to do.\n  I am, frankly, very proud of what we have done this year. For the \nfirst time, we presented a balanced budget to the President. \nUnfortunately, he vetoed it. I do not think the President wanted a \nbalanced budget at that time. But now we are talking about how you \nreduce spending, how you reduce the size of Government rather than how \nmuch it could grow. For the first time, we will make today a \ndownpayment on a balanced budget. We will have a budget at the end of \nthis year that will be in keeping with our 7-year effort to do that. \nThat is progress. That is, I think, a significant victory that should \nbe claimed. It is the first step on the road to success.\n  What about the change in the President's behavior? I think that is \nsignificant as well. Three years ago the President talked about more \nspending, and about investment. He talked about stimulating the economy \nthrough spending. And we had the largest tax increase in the history of \nthe world. Two years ago we were talking about placing one-seventh of \nthe entire economy under the jurisdiction of the Federal Government in \nhealth care. This year the President is talking about the era of big \ngovernment being over. Now, if that is not a change. I am delighted for \nthat. A year ago the President presented a budget none of which \nbalanced. The President is under pressure, I think, from the Congress \nto present a balanced budget, and that is a movement forward.\n  So I think this is a great victory for the American people and for \nfuture generations. Have we completed our victory? Of course not. Is it \ngood enough? No. Is it a good start? Yes. We probably succeeded in \nthree-quarters of what we set out to do. Did the President make the \nneeded changes in entitlements? No. But he did make some accommodation. \nHe talked about some choices in Medicare. He talked about some caps on \nMedicaid. He talked about a commitment to welfare. Those are changes. \nAnd until we make those, of course, there is no real budgeting. But \nthat is where we have come.\n\n  We are talking now about the end of big government. The debate is not \nabout growth, but how we reduce the size of government. These are the \nthings the President talked about before the election. But now we are \nback to that. I think that is great. I am excited by the opportunity to \ndo that.\n  Thomas Jefferson said that we do divide naturally in this country, \nregardless of what the party is called, between those who think there \nought to be an elite governing and we take the money from the folks and \nprovide the programs and those who believe people ought to take care of \nthemselves and the Government's role is to create an environment in \nwhich the private sector can work. We are still divided that way. That \ndebate, of course, will go on.\n  So, Mr. President, I think today we ought to say we have had a very \nsuccessful 1995. We have changed the debate. We are structured \ndifferently. We are talking about the possibilities of reduction \ninstead of the certainty of increases. We are talking about a balanced \nbudget, and we have begun and made a downpayment on that. There is a \ngreat deal to do, of course, but I believe we ought to recognize that \nwe have made a victory, that we have made some real progress, and that \nwe ought to move forward.\n  There are other things we need to do. We need to deal with welfare. \nWe need to deal with regulatory reform. We have some health reform that \nwe ought to do. We have to empower the States to be able to do more of \nthose things so there is flexibility and fit. We have to accept, \nprobably most of all, the responsibility for paying for the benefits \nthat we are now providing instead of putting it on the credit cards for \nour kids and our grandkids.\n  So, Mr. President, I hear a lot of grumbling and wondering and \nconfusion. It seems to me that we have had a good year. We have done a \nvery difficult thing, and that is make a fundamental change in the \ndirection that this Government is taking, one that I think is good for \nAmerica, it is good for all of us as citizens and taxpayers and, maybe \nmost of all, it is good for our kids and our grandchildren. \n\n[[Page S393]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to report to the Members of \nthe Senate the progress of the telecommunications bill and urge that \nall Members continue to show great interest. I also urge all citizens \ninterested in this legislation to show vigilance and continue to \nsupport the bill and urge that it be passed.\n  As Members of the Senate know, consideration of this bill has gone on \nfor a long time and it is a bipartisan bill. It has attracted the \nsupport of many groups across the country. We now have the regional \nBell companies supporting the bill and we have the long-distance \ncompanies supporting the bill. That is an unusual, rare moment in \nAmerican history when the regional Bells and long-distance companies \nare temporarily at peace, so to speak.\n  Indeed, the labor union, the Communications Workers of America [CWA], \nyesterday sent a letter to Senator Dole urging that the bill be passed. \nSo this bill has gotten an unusual amount of support. The big cable \ncompanies and the small cable companies support it. The broadcasters \nsupport it, to the extent of what is in the bill now.\n  I know there is a dispute over the spectrum area. What I am saying is \nthat we have an historic opportunity to pass a bill. But if we hesitate \nvery long, this whole thing will come unraveled. I am very worried \nabout it coming unraveled. So I rise to ask for the continued vigilance \nand support of everybody across the country and of my fellow Senators.\n  Let me say a word or two about the spectrum issue that has arisen. \nOur leader has, quite correctly, raised the issue of the spectrum. I \nwould say this bill does not give the spectrum away as it is written. \nWe believe strongly that there is some misunderstanding about what the \nbill says about the spectrum. Indeed, this Senator tried very hard to \nput the spectrum auction issue into the reconciliation bill, and later \nhave it dealt with as a budgetary matter.\n  The point before us is that we are going to have to have a broad \nspectrum bill. I like to call it a ``grand spectrum debate.'' I think \nthe sale to MCI yesterday, its new bid of approximately $680 million \nfor something that was scored by CBO at less than $100 million, shows \nthe value that there is in the spectrum and the potential savings to \ntaxpayers. We have to think about the taxpayers.\n  It is not just the broadcasters who use the spectrum. The spectrum is \nalso used by people with handheld radios, and by people doing radar \nphotography. The military has a good deal of spectrum allocated to it, \nas does the CIA. We need to educate ourselves and the people of the \ncountry about the value of all this spectrum use and what the \ntaxpayers' interest in it is.\n  There has been very little, for example, on television shows \ndiscussing the spectrum, strangely enough. We have not had a feature on \nthe spectrum and its value to the taxpayers on ``60 Minutes'' that I \nknow of. Nor have we seen Ted Koppel doing a feature on the spectrum \nand how valuable it might be to the taxpayers.\n  For some mysterious reason, there have not been very many television \nshows on the networks that educate the public about the spectrum. I \nurge those shows to do so.\n  In any event, it is not just the broadcast spectrum we are dealing \nwith here. It is all the spectrum out there that is being used. New \ntechnologies may make four or five uses out of the spectrum where once \nonly one use was possible. Something designed for one use can now be \nused for transmitting data and other things. As new technology and new \ninventions come into play, it may be worth four, five times as much. \nWhere once you might have one TV channel, you now may be able to have \nfour. You may be able to transmit data on one station and do something \nelse with another.\n  So the taxpayers have a real interest in this, as do budget \nbalancers. We did not really try to solve this problem in the \ntelecommunications bill. Some misunderstandings are floating around. We \nmore or less delayed a decision on the spectrum in the \ntelecommunications bill. So I have suggested that we have a grand \nspectrum debate and that we have a spectrum bill. We have already had \nhearings. I suggest that we go through all the spectrum, from the \nbroadcasters' use to other, different uses of it, including that held \nin public and private use. That we look at what the military has and \nwhat the CIA has. We will have to have a classified briefing.\n  We should not hold up the telecommunications bill for that purpose. \nIt is my hope that in a few days we can work out some language, or \nleave the present language in the bill.\n  So we are making a good-faith effort. I am saying that I do not think \nwe can solve all of the spectrum issues at this time. I have tried to \ndo it. The votes are not there. We are in a deadlock situation.\n  Let us not lose the whole telecommunications bill over this matter. \nIt is too good a bill. We have worked long and hard. It is a bipartisan \nbill. It is the best bill in this Congress, in this Senator's opinion. \nIt will create jobs in our country. It will provide a road map for \ninvestment.\n  I urge that we act on it soon. I am continuing to lobby our leaders \nand everybody else. In fact, yesterday the spectrum and the \ntelecommunications bill were the subject of Senator Dole's remarks when \nhe traveled in South Dakota. I commend him again and thank him for his \nkind remarks about my work on this bill.\n  I hope we can work out these problems soon. I urge all groups not to \nslip into lethargy. We have a lot of work left to do on this bill. It \nwill not pass automatically. We must keep working at it. That is what I \nam doing. That is what I urge my colleagues to do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/26/senate-section/article/S393-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S393-S394]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO BARBARA JORDAN\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \nextraordinary and brilliant woman--former Congresswoman Barbara Jordan. \nI was deeply saddened by Ms. Jordan's death. She was very special to \nme, and to this country. She enriched and moved this Nation unlike any \nother American.\n  Barbara Jordan was in a class all by herself. I was fortunate enough \nto serve with her in U.S. House of Representatives. She taught me a lot \nabout what it means to be a tough advocate for the American people.\n  Nothing stopped Congresswoman Jordan from forging ahead--not race, \nnot gender, and not her illness. She lived her life as a teacher never \ngiving in to the victim mentality. Not Congresswoman Jordan. That was \nnot her style.\n  She had an immense impact on this Nation, and yet, Barbara Jordan \nserved as a Congresswoman for only 6 years. But during that time, she \nused her rich, booming and elegant voice, to leave a powerful impact on \nthis Nation. She believed, as I do, in letting your voice be heard.\n  She spoke forcefully about important national issues, and she had \ncommitment and conviction like none other. She had a special kind of \ncommitment--the kind that's hard to find.\n  She never wasted a breath on nonsense, but always spoke the truth so \neloquently. She was a true pioneer for \n\n[[Page S394]]\nwhat's right and for tackling what's wrong in America. She was the \nNation's conscience during Watergate and helped restore America's faith \nin the Constitution.\n  That is why students lined up for hours at the LBJ School of Public \nAffairs just to register for her class. Now, that was a line worth \nstanding in.\n  These students understood that it was a treat to be taught by this \nwoman of many firsts. The first African-American, and first woman, \nelected to the Texas Senate. The first southern black elected to \nCongress since the Reconstruction, and the only woman in her law school \nclass in Boston University.\n  Barbara Jordan inspired us because she was a visionary who firmly \nbelieved in this Nation's potential. Our country is different today \nbecause of her and the strength, integrity and sensibility that she \nsymbolized.\n  Barbara Jordan was a great American. She was proud to be black, proud \nto be a woman, proud to be a Texan, and proud to be an American. I know \nshe will live in our hearts and minds forever.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/26/senate-section/article/S393-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S394]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO ARTHUR GEORGE GASTON\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, thousands of people in Alabama and all \nover the country were deeply saddened by the death of Dr. Arthur George \nGaston on January 19, 1996. He was one of the most successful \nbusinessmen of our time, as well as a generous philanthropist and civic \nleader who never forgot his humble beginnings.\n  When I think of A.G. Gaston, many different facets of his life come \nto mind. Of course, his longevity, his business success, his compassion \nfor the less fortunate, his lifelong battle for civil  rights,  and  \nhis  many  tangible contributions to his community, State, and Nation \nare things that stand out.\n  But I am also reminded that Dr. Gaston was born on the Fourth of July \nin 1892. He shared his birthday with our Republic, and in many \nsignificant and profound ways, he and the Nation grew up and matured \ntogether during those more than 100 years of his lifetime. It was so \nfitting that he was born on the Fourth of July, the founding of our \ncountry, for he was truly the American dream personified.\n  During his long and unusually productive life, Dr. Gaston helped \ncountless young people obtain an education, supported numerous causes, \nincluding the civil rights movement, and inspired several generations \nto achieve great things through hard work, perseverance, and a \ncommitment to lifelong learning. He served his church and his people \nwith passionate dedication, energy, and wisdom.\n  Just a few short years ago, as he celebrated the anniversary of his \n100th birthday, Dr. Gaston remarked, ``The Lord has seen fit to let me \nlive to this age for a purpose and it is my hope that I have served him \nand my people as he wanted me to. I have lived a long life. I have \nreceived many blessings.''\n  A.G. Gaston's life did indeed have purpose and meaning, so much so \nthat it is difficult to capture them in words. Those who knew him, \neither directly or indirectly, knew what that purpose and meaning were \nby the example he set and by the tremendous contributions he made to \nthose around him. He was a remarkable role model--a quintessential \nAmerican success story. There is no doubt that he used his many gifts \nand blessings and served his fellow man in the way the Lord intended. \nIn so doing, he became one of God's most generous gifts to us.\n  Dr. Gaston will be greatly missed, but his legacy is one that will \nnever fade. I ask unanimous consent that a Birmingham News editorial on \nhis life and work be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Birmingham News, Jan. 21, 1996]\n\n                          Arthur George Gaston\n\n\n             His death is a monumental loss for Birmingham\n\n       He was as much an icon of Birmingham as is Vulcan, and the \n     legend of A.G. Gaston was larger than life, as well.\n       And like Birmingham's man of steel, it was easy to think \n     Gaston would be around forever.\n       Friday morning, however, A.G. Gaston died in Medical Center \n     East at the age of 103, a monumental loss for the Birmingham \n     community.\n       Born on the Fourth of July in 1892, the grandson of slaves \n     served in the Army with distinction during World War I, then \n     took a job working in a dry cleaning plant for $5 a week.\n       At a time when black entrepreneurs were almost unheard of, \n     Gaston began a burial insurance business for black people \n     that mushroomed into an empire which eventually included real \n     estate, radio stations, funeral homes and a motel.\n       During the 1960s, Gaston, because of his stature in the \n     community, became a key figure in tense negotiations between \n     black and white leaders as Martin Luther King's campaign in \n     Birmingham brought worldwide attention.\n       Gaston actually worked behind the scenes to get King out of \n     town, until he saw firehoses tumble a little girl down the \n     street.\n       Many will remember Gaston for his business acumen and how \n     he developed other black business people; for his rules for \n     success that sound almost quaint but still apply in today's \n     world (``Save a part of all you earn. Money doesn't spoil. It \n     keeps.''); for his role in Birmingham's civil rights \n     struggles; for virtually giving away his empire to employees \n     in the 1980s; for his work with the city's Boys' Clubs of \n     America.\n       Perhaps the best way to remember Gaston, though, is the way \n     former Mayor David Vann recalled him Friday.\n       Gaston's greatest attribute, Vann said, was that ``he \n     proved a person in a very suppressed minority, with little \n     formal education, could lead a very successful life and \n     proved to our society that a good person can set important \n     standards for the society in which he lives.''\n       He will be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/26/senate-section/article/S394-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S394-S395]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO FLOYD MANN\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, Floyd H. Mann, who served in the cabinets \nof three Alabama Governors and is credited with saving the life of a \ncivil rights activist in Montgomery, died on January 12, 1996 at the \nage of 76.\n  A native of Daviston, AL, located in Tallapoosa County, he served in \nthe U.S. Army Air Corps during World War II. As a tail gunner on a B-17 \naircraft, he flew on 27 combat missions, including the first daylight \nraid on Berlin. He received numerous awards for his brave service, \nincluding the Distinguished Flying Cross.\n  Floyd Mann was a rather remarkable person and leader. He served as \nchief of police in Opelika, AL, from 1950 to 1958. He earned praise for \nhis rapid clean-up of the town, which had suffered from corruption that \nhad spread from nearby Phenix City. The Governor at the time, John \nPatterson, appointed Floyd director of the Alabama Department of Public \nSafety in 1959.\n  During his tenure, he made national headlines for his one-man charge \ninto a rioting mob that was beating a bus full of civil rights freedom \nriders at a Montgomery bus station in 1961. He was credited as having \nhelped save the life of a black Tennessee student and a Birmingham \nnewsman during that painful incident. His heroic actions earned him the \nUnited Press International's Man of the Year in Alabama Award for 1961.\n  Later, Floyd served as director of public safety under Gov. Albert \nBrewer and was administrator of the State Alcoholic Beverage Control \nBoard during Gov. Fob James' first term in 1982-83. He also worked as \nan assistant to University of Alabama President David Matthews, whom he \nfollowed to Washington, DC, to work with at the Department of Health, \nEducation, and Welfare.\n  While at the University of Alabama, he was very active as the head of \nsecurity and was a great public relations person for the school. He \nknew almost all of the alumni personally, and always greeted them with \na bright smile, firm handshake, and warm conversation.\n  I remember being in Tuscaloosa, where the university is located, many \ntimes and going by the old Stafford Hotel early in the morning where a \ngroup of local citizens would be gathered for coffee. Floyd would \nalways be right at the center of the group. Different people would come \nin and he would stay and meet with the groups. He was well liked and \ndeeply respected.\n  Floyd Mann was one of those people who never failed to do what was \nright, even if it meant risking his personal safety. He knew the \nmeaning of being neighborly, of treating others the way he wanted to be \ntreated. He took a considerable degree of pride in his work, and seemed \ngenuinely excited about the things he did and about the people around \nhim.\n  I extend my sincerest condolences to Floyd's wife of 51 years, Grace, \nand \n\n[[Page S395]]\ntheir entire family in the wake of this tremendous loss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/26/senate-section/article/S394-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S395]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO JUDGE JAMES H. TOMPKINS\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I want to pay tribute to a dear friend of \nmine, Judge James H. Tompkins, who passed away on January 9, 1996 at \nthe age of 84. He had an abiding love for politics, public policy, and \nthe law, and was known in Democratic circles all over the country since \nhe attended so many Democratic national conventions over the years.\n  Jimmy Tompkins was a life-long resident of my home county, Colbert \nCounty, AL. He was a graduate of the University of Alabama and was a \nprobate judge, district attorney, and practicing attorney in the \ncounty. He was a veteran of World War II, having served as lieutenant \ncolonel in the Judge Advocate General's Office in Europe, Africa, \nIndia, China, and Burma.\n  The family of Judge Tompkins is truly one of judges. He served as \nprobate judge of Colbert County. His father, Nathaniel Pride Tompkins, \nalso was a Colbert County probate judge, as was his wife, Maybeth \nRobbins Tompkins, who succeeded Jimmy as the judge of probate. Their \nson, Pride Tompkins, is currently a circuit judge in Colbert County. \nJimmy's brother-in-law, David ``Pal'' Cochrane, served as judge of \nprobate of Tuscaloosa County.\n  Jimmy was an outstanding trial lawyer long before he became a probate \njudge. He practiced with the firm of Smith, Tompkins & Hughston, one of \nthe leading firms in the State. Partner James E. Smith was a State \nsenator at one time and was also the Democratic national committeeman \nfrom Alabama. Partner Harold V. Hughston served as a circuit judge of \nColbert County.\n  He had a wonderful, pleasing personality. The smile he always had on \nhis face was hard to forget. Jimmy Tompkins had many friends and he was \na great friend to many, including me, over the years, and will be \nsorely missed.\n  I extend my sincerest condolences to Maybeth Tompkins and her entire \nfamily in the wake of their tremendous loss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/26/senate-section/article/S395-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S395]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              SALUTE TO RETIRING SENATOR WILLIAM S. COHEN\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to honor one \nof the many--and I might add that there are far too many--colleagues of \nmine who have announced they will be leaving us at the close of this \nsession. Senator William Sebastian Cohen announced his retirement \nrecently, and I would like to pay tribute to this close friend of mine.\n  Early on in his career in the Senate, in 1978, Time magazine called \nSenator Cohen ``one of the GOP's brightest new stars.'' Well, Senator \nCohen isn't exactly new anymore, Mr. President, but he remains one of \nthe brightest stars in his party. It is a shame to see him leave when \nhe seems in many ways more brilliant than ever.\n  Senator Cohen became the senior Senator from Maine at a very early \nage, and it was a title that he carried with determination and \ndistinction. He quickly established himself as a leader on foreign \npolicy issues, playing a key role in shaping the foreign policy that \nprepared America for the gulf war and the new world order of the \n1990's.\n  Early on in his Senate career, the temperate young Senator from Maine \nopposed adoption of the SALT II Treaty out of concern that it failed to \ntake a hard enough stand against the Soviets. He was simultaneously an \nunyielding advocate for a strong national defense. His stance proved \nthat one did not have to be an extreme and ardent conservative to have \na patriotic belief in the importance of protecting our country's \nsecurity.\n  He continued to serve as a distinguished leader on foreign policy \nissues, employing intelligence and forethought that often put him ahead \nof the curve. He spoke out strongly against Saddam Hussein's stockpile \nof chemical weapons long before August of 1990. He also advocated \nredesigning our Navy to employ a greater number of smaller ships, with \nthe massive sealift capability that the post-cold war world requires. \nOur Nation's shining success in the gulf war was due to a great many \nfactors, but any attempt to take account of all those factors must note \nthe shifts in our Nation's defense strategy during the 1980s in which \nSenator Cohen played a large part.\n  On domestic issues, Senator Cohen has taken a careful, reasoned \napproach. He has refused to sit beholden to any one ideology or dogma, \ninstead showing an unwavering commitment to the interests of his \nconstituents. He opposed a large dam project in Maine that threatened \nthe environment of that beautiful State, and he pushed hard to relax \nstringent Social Security disability requirements. Many have called \nSenator Cohen a persistent moderate in his own party. Well, Mr. \nPresident, if being a party moderate means recognizing the fact that, \nwhere possible, the Government should try to help out folks who need a \nhand, or having the courage to speak out against those who would, out \nof misplaced zeal and foolhardy arrogance, undermine our Constitution, \nthen I say we need more of it.\n  Mr. President, Senator Cohen and I came to the Senate only 2 years \napart. Over the years, I have come to count him as a close friend, and \nI am sure we will remain close even after he leaves here. But I will \nstill miss him, and I will always be grateful for his loyal service to \nthis Chamber.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/26/senate-section/article/S395-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S395]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        U.S. DEPENDENCY ON FOREIGN OIL BOX SCORE (FIRST REPORT)\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I have been deeply troubled for most of the \n23 years I've been a Member of the Senate about the United States \nhaving become more and more deeply dependent upon foreign countries--\nmany in the highly volatile Middle East--to supply the bulk of the \nenergy needs of the American people. I held hearings on this perilous \nproblem when I was chairman of the Agriculture Committee a decade ago, \nand more recently in my capacity as chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee.\n  The administration acknowledges that this is a national security \nconcern, but, Mr. President, there obviously is a lot of fiddling while \nRome burns--the administration has done precisely nothing about U.S. \ndependency on foreign oil.\n  Mr. President, Americans now are forced to rely on foreign oil for \nmore than 50 percent of our needs. Not too long ago, 50 percent was \npegged as the perilous threshold which must not be crossed. But, it was \ncrossed, under President Clinton's watch, after U.S. blood was spilled \nin the Middle East in Desert Storm.\n  So, Mr. President, I begin today a report on this matter, a report \nthat I will make to the Senate regularly. The American Petroleum \nInstitute has confirmed that, for the week ending January 19, the \nUnited States imported 7,696,000 barrels of oil each day, 12 percent \nmore than the 6,488,000 barrels imported daily 12 months ago.\n  Mr. President, as I say, I shall report to the Senate--and to the \nAmerican people--on a regular basis regarding the increasingly \ndangerous U.S. dependency on foreign oil. We must not delay in seeking \nto solve this troubling problem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/26/senate-section/article/S395-3", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S395]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today as the chairman of the \nSubcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs to express my concern at \nrecent reports in the domestic and foreign media that the Government of \nthe People's Republic of China has formulated plans for a military \ninvasion or blockade of Taiwan.\n  These reports surfaced first a month or two ago in Hong Kong papers \nknown to be sympathetic to Beijing--known, \n\n[[Page S396]]\nin fact, to be instruments of the Chinese Government--such as Ta Kung \nPao. It was further reported in the colony's more mainstream papers, \nincluding a series of reports in the Eastern Express. Clearly, the \ninitial discovery of this information was not the result of \ninvestigative reporting on the part of these papers. Rather, it shows \nall the signs of having been an organized leak on the part of the \nBeijing Government. The same information has been relayed to us through \nhigh-level channels in the People's Republic of China Government and \nmilitary.\n  The purpose of the leak appears to me to be three-fold. First, it \nmust be viewed in light of the present political situation in the \nPeople's Republic of China. As my colleagues know, while President \nJiang Zemin is substantially in control of the Government as the \nsuccessor to Deng Xiaoping, the succession is far from being settled \nwith absolute finality. As a result, the leadership has been careful to \ncourt the conservative elements of the power structure: the People's \nLiberation Army [PLA]. The PLA, like armies everywhere, tends to be \nvery nationalistic, and the reacquisition of Taiwan is at the top of \nits wish-list. Consequently, the People's Republic of China leadership \nhas taken a more hardline approach to the Taiwan question than might \nusually be expected.\n  Second, many observers--and the Taiwanese officials with whom I have \nspoken--believe that the leaked information is designed to intimidate \nthe Taiwanese people and their elected officials. The People's Republic \nof China believes that over the last year the Government of Taiwan, led \nby President Lee Teng-hui, has been increasing its attempts to raise \nTaiwan's status in the international arena. They cite increased \ndiplomatic initiatives in Central America and Africa, the visits of \nPresident Lee and other high-level officials to countries such as the \nUnited States, Canada, and the Czech Republic last summer, and moves to \njoin the U.N. and other international organizations.\n  The People's Republic of China apparently regards these efforts as an \naffront to their one-China policy, and a move by Taipei to create two \nChinas or one China, one Taiwan. In an effort to stem this rising tide, \nBeijing has resorted to a number of reactions. The People's Republic of \nChina conducted a series of provocative air-to-air missile tests from \nJuly 21 to 26 in an area only 60 kilometers north of Taiwan's \nPengchiayu Island. The missiles fired consisted mainly of Dongfeng-31 \nICBM's and M-class short-range tactical missiles. At the same time, the \nPLA mobilized forces in coastal Fujian Province and moved a number of \nJian-8 aircraft to the coast. Following those tests, the PLA conducted \na second round of similar maneuvers between August 15 and 25. In \nconjunction with these tests, Taiwan intelligence reported the movement \nof a number of F-7 and F-8 long-range bombers and aircraft to bases \nwithin 250 nautical miles of Taiwan. There have also been reports that \nthe People's Liberation Army-Air Force has stepped up practicing \nprecision bombing and missile targeting.\n  It was no accident that the tests were so close to Taiwanese \nterritory, or that they coincided with Taiwan's regional elections. The \nmessage to Taiwan was clear: ``continue down this road, continue to \nmove forward toward a complete democracy, and we are more than capable \nof reacquiring you forcibly.'' This message is similarly timed; it \ncomes very close to Taiwan's first fully democratic elections, \nscheduled to be held in March.\n  Third, it appears that the information was intended to send a signal \nto us in Congress, as well as the administration, that we should rein \nin our support for Taiwan and its elected leaders, and reconsider any \nthought of supplying Taiwan with defensive weapons or similar support. \nIt will not surprise anyone here that Congress has been supportive of \nTaiwan and its people. Since 1949, the citizens of Taiwan have made \namazing strides in developing their country both economically and \npolitically. Taiwan has become the world's ninth largest economy; \nmoreover, it has moved from a military authoritarian government to \noligarchy to full participatory democracy. That move will be capped in \nMarch by the first democratic election of the country's President. \nGiven this progress, I know that many Members of Congress, and the \nAmerican people, cannot help but feel a bond with the people of that \nisland. It is that bond that worries the People's Republic of China, \nand which it seeks to stem.\n  The Chinese Foreign Ministry, through two of its spokesmen, Shen \nGuofang and Chen Jian, issued a somewhat vague denial of the reports. I \nwould like to take that denial at face value, and indeed the reaction \nin the military and intelligence circles here has been that the entire \nissue may be somewhat overblown. I would stress that there is no \nconcrete proof of the allegations but for the news reports. However, as \nwe have seen in the past, sometimes the denials of the Ministry do not \nmatch the Government's actions. Just in the unlikely event that this is \nthe case, I'd like to make my position as the chairman of the \nsubcommittee of jurisdiction clear.\n  I will agree, to a point, with Beijing's assertions that any eventual \nreunification of the People's Republic of China and Taiwan is an \ninternal affair for the Chinese people in which other countries should \nnot interfere. But I cannot stress strongly enough my feeling that it \nis not the People's Republic of China's internal affair alone; it is \none for Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan Straits to decide. There \nare 27 million people in Taiwan who have made clear their desire to \nlive in a free and democratic society. It is consequently not for the \nPeople's Republic of China, under the guise of reuniting the motherland \nto unilaterally dictate the terms, timing, or conditions of that \nreunification.\n  The People's Republic of China should make no mistake; I strongly \nbelieve that any attempt to establish a military or economic blockade \nof Taiwan, or other such military threat, will be met with by the most \nresolute condemnation and reaction on the part of the United States, \nand indeed the rest of the community of nations. It is my view that \nactions such as the missile tests and threat of military force will \nhave the exact opposite of their desired outcome. As we have seen, the \npeople of Taiwan did not let themselves be intimidated at the polls by \nthe launching of Dongfeng missiles. I believe that such threats can \nonly serve to make them more resolute in their goals.\n  Similarly, it is my opinion that such actions can only backfire in \nregards to their intended effect on the United States. The People's \nRepublic of China would do well to remember the provisions of the joint \nUnited States-People's Republic of China communiques, and more \nimportantly of the Taiwan Relations Act. We have stated repeatedly that \nwe expect the future of Taiwan to be settled by peaceful means, and \nthat we consider any move to settle it by other than peaceful means to \n``be a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific area and \nof grave concern to the United States.'' The Taiwan Relations Act, and \nthe communiques, safeguard our right to sell Taiwan weapons to enable \nit to protect itself from aggression. If the People's Republic of China \ncontinues to threaten Taiwan and its security, then it is not out of \nthe realm of possibility that in reaction the amount and frequency of \nthose arms sales might increase.\n  In closing Mr. President, while I believe that the reports--\nespecially that in the New York Times--have tended toward the alarmist, \nI feel it is very important that the People's Republic of China know \nexactly where I stand on this issue. That is why I have come to the \nfloor today. And similarly, toward that end I call upon the \nadministration to relay our position to Beijing in the clearest and \nmost unequivocal terms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/26/senate-section/article/S395-5", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S396-S398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE FARM BILL\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, for the first time in nearly half a \ncentury, we are rapidly approaching the end of the first month of the \nfirst year in which American farmers are without a farm bill. To those \nnot directly engaged in agriculture, this fact may be little more than \na slightly interesting footnote to a much larger story of deadlock in \nWashington. Actually, the only people not involved in agriculture are \nthose who don't eat. But to men, women, and families across this Nation \nwhose livelihood comes from the production of food and fiber, this \nsimple fact is keeping them awake at night.\n\n[[Page S397]]\n\n  What is most striking and most disquieting about the failure to enact \na farm bill on time is the apparent disregard by some Members of \nCongress to the plight of family farmers who are desperately calling me \nand other Senators for some signal of what to expect for the 1996 crop \nyear. You can't blame them. If you look at the calendar you will see it \nis 1996 and farmers in my State, especially rice farmers, need to be in \nthe fields in the next few weeks. Unfortunately, before they go into \nthe fields, most farmers need to go into their banks. But bankers are \nunable to complete loans due to the uncertainty in farm policy that has \nresulted from just 1 year of Republican majorities in Congress.\n  I have heard several Senators try to lay the blame for the expiration \nof farm legislation on President Clinton for vetoing the budget \nreconciliation bill which contained a version of the so-called Freedom \nto Farm Act. This, they say, was the 1995 farm bill which was voted, \npassed, and sent to the President. What they fail to mention is that \neveryone knew for months that the reconciliation bill, with or without \nfreedom to farm, was going to be vetoed. the Republican majority in \nCongress knew, far in advance, that if they insisted on freedom to farm \nbeing part of the budget reconciliation bill, there would be no farm \nbill unless they took other action to secure passage of farm \nlegislation outside the budget reconciliation process. The Republicans \nare in charge of the House and Republicans are in charge of the Senate. \nThey clearly had the opportunity and the power to take other action and \nthey not only failed, they failed to try.\n  Not only has the Republican majority failed to achieve any positive \nresult, they have even refused the assistance of their Democratic \ncolleagues. Next to the harm being thrust on the American farmer, the \nmost troubling aspect to the farm bill failure of 1995 is the untimely \ndemise of traditional farm-State coalitions. In every farm bill debate \nI can remember, farm-State Senators, regardless of party affiliation, \nwere able to come together in a common purpose. To us, that purpose had \nbeen to pass a farm bill that is in the best interest of the American \nfarmer and the American consumer while all the time recognizing the \nunique nature of the farm sectors of our respective States. But, for \nsome inexplicable reason, the Republican majority made the decision to \ndisregard this practice which has given rural America successfully \nenacted farm bills for nearly five decades. The result of that decision \nshould have been obvious, but now even the Republican majority has to \nadmit that they couldn't do it alone.\n  In fact, when you look at how we got in this mess, it becomes clear \nthat there was no real agreement within the Republican majority about \nfarm policy. The so-called Freedom to Farm Act was introduced by the \nchairman of the House Agriculture Committee, but he could not even \nsecure passage of his bill in his own committee--even the ranking \nRepublican member voted against it. The Senate Agriculture Committee \nnever gave it any serious consideration because they saw the flaws it \ncontained. The fact that it was wedged into a reconciliation bill \ncompletely outside the purview of any agriculture committee--House or \nSenate--begs the question whether agriculture committees are relevant \nany longer. Even the House Speaker's task force on committee review has \nsuggested terminating the House Agriculture Committee and merging its \nresponsibilities with other committees. The inability of the House \nAgriculture Committee to report a 1995 farm bill will probably do \nlittle to dissuade the speaker from the recommendations of his own task \nforce.\n  The Republican majority may have failed to include Democratic \nparticipation in writing a farm bill because they thought we didn't \nwant farm program reform. If that was their reason, they were badly \nmistaken. Senate Democrats, myself included, want serious farm bill \nreform and we know the only way to achieve it is through serious farm \nbill debate. If we had been allowed to participate in the debate--if \nthere had been a debate--I do not believe we and, more importantly, \nAmerica's farmers would be in the desperate situation we now find \nourselves. There are lots of good ideas out there. There are some I \nwould like to offer, there are others I would like to learn more about, \nbut ideas do not grow well in a vacuum outside the light of public \ndebate. We deserve better and, without question, rural America deserves \nbetter.\n  We can do a lot of finger pointing, but that really accomplishes \nlittle, and nothing positive. Farmers in my State and farmers in every \nState can not be told to wait another day for farm policy guidance. I \nwish we had time to have the farm bill debate we have requested for \nmore than a year. I wish we had time to enact a new 5 or 7-year farm \nbill to completely replace expiring farm and nutrition programs. \nHowever, the calendar tells us the time necessary to do all those \nthings has been lost. All that we have time to do, and what we must do, \nis to enact an extension of expired programs for another year in which \nfarmers can do what they do best and we can do what hasn't been done at \nall: debate and pass a farm bill.\n  What happens if Congress does nothing? What happens if Congress \ndefaults on its responsibility to rural America? As unlikely as that \nseemed 1 year ago, we now have to seriously examine the consequences of \nprocedure in 1996 with no congressional action on farm policy. Should \nthat occur, and I truly hope it does not, farmers would then turn to \nthe programs available under the CCC Charter Act and the agricultural \nacts of 1938 and 1949, the so-called permanent law.\n  It is fortunate for America's farmers that these laws exist, not \nbecause they are good policy for the 1990's, but because they serve as \na hammer that should persuade Congress to reauthorize the 1990 farm \nbill. If we revert to permanent law a couple of things will occur: \nFirst, there is no specific rice program and the Secretary will have to \nrely on very broad authorities to provide some sort of price support \nmechanism; second, wheat and feed grain prices would go through the \nroof. In addition to these features, there are a host of other arcane \nprovisions that would further complicate the lives of farmers and those \nresponsible for administering farm policy.\n  Some farmers might fare well under permanent law. For those farmers \nlucky enough to still have acreage allotments that were established \ndecades ago, they will receive prices tied to parity which means the \nprice they receive will give them the same buying power the price for \ntheir crop held between 1910 and 1914. In some ways it's like playing \nthe lottery. If you are one of the lucky ones, you will receive more in \npayments than you ever expected. If your luck has run out, you may \nreceive nothing. With feed grain prices doubling or tripling, if you \nare a producer of beef, pork, poultry, catfish, bread, cookies, pasta, \net cetera, or if you are a consumer of any of the above, you are going \nto see your costs skyrocket. Farmers have long had to deal with the \nweather, markets, and other unknowns. They should not now have to be \nasked to bear the additional uncertainty of playing the lottery as \nwell.\n  Farmers need certainty. Earlier this week, it was mentioned that an \nextension of current law provides no ``certainty'' and only passage of \nfreedom to farm would give farmers ``certainty'' for the future. In \nfact, it was suggested that if we extended current law, the only \ncertain thing to happen immediately is the repayment of the 1995 \nadvance deficiency payments which would further cripple farmers trying \nto advance a 1996 crop. I will ask to have printed in the Record an \nannouncement by Secretary Glickman on December 22 that advance \ndeficiency repayments are deferred for 3 years, which was the extent of \naction he was authorized to take. This clearly will give Congress time \nto deal more thoroughly with this important matter. Secretary Glickman \nhas already offered American farmers the certainty of knowing there \nwill be no near-term demand for repayment. He should be commended for \ntaking this action and I fully expect that we will be able to more \nfully resolve this problem before the end of the 3-year period.\n  It was further suggested, earlier this week, that if we passed the \nFreedom to Farm Act, farmers would have the certainty of knowing they \nwill receive $43.5 billion in payments over the next 7 years. I do not \nquestion the intent of my Republican colleagues in the Senate that they \nhope these payments \n\n[[Page S398]]\nwould, in fact, be made over the 7 years--although knowing the history \nof the House majority leader's attempts to kill farm programs, I am not \nso sure about the underlining intent of that body. But I must question \nany use of the term ``certainty'' that has been attached to these \npayments.\n  Perhaps the most egregious feature of the freedom to farm scheme is \nthe payment of large sums of money to farmers in years when crop prices \nare bringing record profits and even to farmers who have no requirement \nto farm anything at all except the Federal Treasury. Since their \ninception, farm programs have been designed to allow payments to \nfarmers only when crop prices have fallen below set levels. This \nprovided a form of safety net that has helped stabilize the farm \neconomy and avoid the tremendous social disruptions that we witnessed \nduring the Great Depression. But I must warn my Republican friends who \nthink they are protecting rural America, that providing large payments \nto farmers during periods of high prices or to farmers who no longer \nfarm is an invitation to disaster, the biggest farm disaster we have \never seen.\n  I realize that the Freedom to Farm Act makes reference to the term \n``contracts'' which suggests a guarantee of payments over the 7-year \nperiod. I also realize that many Members of Congress have been trained \nin the legal profession and have had more than a cursory review of the \nelements of a contract. But the requirements of protecting against the \nabrogation by a future Congress of ``contracts'' described in \nlegislation go far beyond simple contract law. American farmers know \nwhat a contract is, or should be, and I am afraid they are being led to \nbelieve that the Freedom to Farm Act is talking about contracts in the \nnormal sense of that term.\n  The abrogation of contracts executed through the authority of \ncongressional legislation is nothing new to the Federal courts. The \ncontracts discussed in the Freedom to Farm Act are not protected by the \ncontracts clause of the U.S. Constitution. The contracts clause is \nfound in section 10 of article I which states: ``No State shall * * * \npass any * * * law impairing the obligation of contracts * * *'' \n(emphasis added). In fact, case law concludes that the sovereign power \nof Congress to subsequently amend legislation--and contracts authorized \nby such legislation--is implied in the absence of ``unmistakable \nterms'' or other strong indications that Congress clearly intended to \nbind the actions of a future Congress.\n  It has been my opinion that nothing in the freedom to farm provisions \nthat were appropriately vetoed by President Clinton approaches the \nthreshold of ``unmistakable terms'' necessary to limit the actions of a \nfuture Congress. My opinion is also shared by many legal experts from \naround the country. Because of my concerns that the American farmer was \nbeing misled by the alleged promises of 7 years of payments, I had \nasked for an opinion by the National Center for Agricultural Law \nResearch and Information as well as leading law schools with strong \nagricultural law programs around the country and they all concur that \nthere is nothing in the freedom to farm provisions that guarantees \npayments over 7 years.\n\n  Why is this fact so important? Why should farmers be concerned if \nCongress can change its mind in a year or two? What does all this have \nto do with ``Certainty''? With all due respect to farm programs enacted \nby Congress and administered by USDA, there are many critics of these \nprograms who would be eager to point out the outrageous use of tax \ndollars to pay huge sums to farmers when market prices are high or who \nhave opted to spend the growing seasons in the Bahamas. It would only \ntake a few headlines and a few news magazine television programs to \ndraw the wrath of the nonfarm public to force Congress to end, once and \nfor all, farm programs.\n  It takes little imagination to conclude that media scrutiny of \nfreedom to farm, once put into practice, would likely result in not \nonly a loss of the remaining freedom to farm payments, but of the \npossibility of any Federal support for farmers in the future. If \nanything is certain, it is that farmers would be without farm programs \na lot sooner than they expected. As I suggested earlier, such a result \nwould not be far removed from the stated objectives we have heard \nexpressed for years by the current House majority leadership. Earlier \nthis week, there was an attempt on this floor to repeal by unanimous \nconsent the underlying agricultural acts which we refer to as permanent \nlaw. Farmers may have more to worry about than they realize. Yes, \nfarmers are asking for certainty, but I don't believe they are asking \nfor the certainty of bankruptcy.\n  Mr. President, it would be truly tragic if the tactics that shut down \nthe Federal Government for an unprecedented 27 days are now used to \nshut down the farm sector, possibly for all time. Clearly, the freedom-\nto-farm provisions are not acceptable to me, they are not acceptable to \nmy Democratic colleagues. If passed they will once again be rejected by \nPresident Clinton, and they will be rejected by every member of the \nfarming community once farmers are given the opportunity to see through \nthe candy store glitter of allegedly promised payments. The task before \nus now is to move the process forward to give farmers some immediate \nguidance for the crops they need now to put in the ground and for all \nof us in Congress to finally work together to craft a reasonable farm \nbill to take American agriculture into the next century.\n  I know there are some reforms that we should all agree on that we can \ninclude in a farm bill extension. Farmers need flexibility to better \nadjust to changing markets and to give them the ability to rotate crops \nin a manner that best serves their conservation needs. We can do that, \nand we must. Republicans and Democrats have proven in farm bills past \nthat we can work together. We ask now for a 1-year extension of current \nlaw with certain modifications. All it takes is 1 year to write, \ndebate, and pass a farm bill. Although 1995 was not such a year, there \nis not reason why 1996 can't be.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the announcement by Secretary Glickman, \nto which I earlier referred, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the announcement was ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n     Glickman Improves Repayment Options for Producers for Advance \n                          Deficiency Payments\n\n       Washington, Dec. 22, 1995--Agriculture Secretary Dan \n     Glickman today announced that wheat, feed grains, and upland \n     cotton producers who must repay their 1995-crop advance \n     deficiency payments will be able to repay under more \n     equitable terms than in the past. Those producers will likely \n     owe about $1.7 billion in the latter part of 1996.\n       Glickman said USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation will \n     propose changes is current regulations to give producers \n     expanded repayment options, including the option to repay in \n     installments over a three-year period, with all of the \n     interest waived, depending on a producer's circumstances. \n     USDA has no legal authority to waive repayment of advance \n     deficiency payment.\n       ``I'm especially concerned about producers who did not have \n     a 1995 crop and are still required by law to repay their \n     advance deficiency payments,'' Glickman said. ``To ease their \n     financial burden, my proposed action will allow them to repay \n     over 3 years with no interest.\n       ``These actions will affect about 90 percent of the \n     producers of these crops,'' Glickman said. ``To ask for a \n     repayment of this magnitude without better terms and \n     conditions would put severe financial pressure on many \n     producers who are trying to recover from a series of bad \n     weather disasters.\n       ``We're nearing the end of the year and we still have no \n     Farm Bill,'' Glickman said. ``At a time of uncertainty--the \n     Clinton Administration is taking this action to give \n     producers clear direction, so they can start planning for the \n     coming year.''\n       Details of the proposal are outlined in FSA Backgrounder \n     #0864.95.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/26/senate-section/article/S396-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S398-S399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NEIGHBOR DAY IN WESTERLY\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the efforts of \ncitizens of the town of Westerly, RI, and the members of its town \ncouncil in promoting Neighbor Day.\n  In 1993, a feud between teenagers took a tragic turn at a local \narcade, leaving one youth dead and another charged with murder. Since \nthen, this community has come together to ensure that such senseless \nviolence is not repeated there or anywhere else.\n  For the past 4 years, Westerly has honored the spirit of \nneighborliness, tolerance, and civility by designating the Sunday \nbefore Memorial Day as Neighbor Day.\n  Now, the Neighbor Day tradition is spreading. The Rhode Island \nGeneral \n\n[[Page S399]]\nAssembly has designated Neighbor Day for statewide observance, and the \nWesterly Town Council would like to see the tradition become nation-\nwide and ultimately worldwide.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me and keep the sentiments of the \npeople of Westerly close to our hearts and minds always, but \nparticularly, this year, on May 19--the day Westerly will celebrate \nNeighbor Day.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that resolution of the \nWesterly Town Council, urging local recognition of Neighbor Day, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Town of Westerly--Resolution\n\n       Whereas, the Town Council of the Town of Westerly, County \n     of Washington and State of Rhode Island, adopted a resolution \n     to celebrate Neighbor Day in May each year on the Sunday \n     before Memorial Day weekend in the Town of Westerly;\n       Whereas, the Town of Westerly proudly displays the adopted \n     Neighbor Day logo on the Town of Westerly Calendar each year \n     on the Sunday before Memorial Day weekend and places a \n     proclamation in the Town's archives for posterity; and\n       Whereas, through the effort of our local legislators, the \n     General Assembly of the State of Rhode Island and Providence \n     Plantations passed legislation designating this special day \n     to be observed in communities throughout the State: Now \n     therefore, be it hereby\n       Resolved, That the Westerly Town Council with deepest \n     respect for all our Rhode Island legislators and United \n     States Congressmen that they unite with one heart in a \n     collaborative effort to aid in the reintroduction of Neighbor \n     Day as a national day and through our representative to the \n     United Nations to introduce and pass a world-wide Neighbor \n     Day to be celebrated the Sunday before Memorial Day weekend \n     in May of 1996 and each year thereafter; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Westerly Town Council, in an effort to \n     help our Congressman, hereby submits petitions signed by many \n     citizens of all ages in our community to be used solely for \n     this purpose and presented in support of this worthwhile \n     effort in the hopes that Neighbor Day will be recognized and \n     celebrated throughout the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/26/senate-section/article/S398-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         MAINTAINING THE MOMENTUM FOR PEACE IN NORTHERN IRELAND\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, earlier this week, the International Body \nchaired by the Honorable George Mitchell, the distinguished former \nSenate majority leader, issued its report regarding the Northern \nIreland peace process. Specifically, the International Body was charged \nby the British and Irish Governments with examining the twin tracks in \nthe peace process--namely the decommissioning of weapons and all-party \ntalks.\n  As my colleagues are aware, the current sticking point in the peace \nprocess is the relationship between the decommissioning of weapons and \nthe convening of all-party talks. The International Body has done an \nexcellent job of reaching out to the various parties to hear their \nviews on this difficult matter, and of characterizing the opposing \nviews on that issue. I would particularly like to commend my friend \nGeorge Mitchell for the fine work he has done in this regard.\n  The report lays out a very balanced set of recommendations focusing \non six principles. Among other things, it recommends that the parties \nto the conflict ``affirm their total and absolute commitment'' to \ndemocratic and exclusively peaceful means of resolving political \nissues, to the ``total disarmament'' of all paramilitary organizations, \nand that they renounce and oppose any effort to use force or threaten \nto use force to influence the all-party negotiations.\n  The report recognizes that ``there is clear commitment'' to \ndecommission weapons as part of the process of all-party talks. It \nsuggests that the parties consider decommissioning during, rather than \nbefore or after the process of all-party negotiations.\n  The report also includes a series of further confidence building \nmeasures that might be taken. On the question of elections, it suggests \nthat ``elections held in accordance with democratic principles express \nand reflect the popular will'' and that ``an elective process could \ncontribute to the building of confidence.''\n  The report does not suggest, however, that elections proceed all-\nparty talks. I know there is real concern among the various parties \nabout the British Government's subsequent proposal that elections be \nheld prior to all-party talks as such elections might further delay the \nprocess.\n  Perhaps most importantly, the report reminds us that ``for nearly a \nyear and half, the guns have been silent in Northern Ireland'' and that \n``the people want that silence to continue.'' For that to happen, there \nmust be continued momentum in the peace process. The timely release of \nthis report has gone a long way toward keeping the process moving. \nDelays at this juncture could scuttle the very real progress that has \nbeen made to date.\n  In establishing the International Body, Prime Minister Major and \nPrime Minister Bruton took decisive action to break the deadlock that \nhad beset the negotiations. Let us hope that they, as well as all \nparties in Northern Ireland, will continue their courageous steps for \npeace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/26/senate-section/article/S399-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S399-S400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO THE LATE COACH FRANK HOWARD\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, one of the most famous institutions of \nthe South is college football. For decades, southern colleges and \nuniversities have produced powerhouse teams that dominate bowl games \nand yield some of the most talented players that are to be found among \nprofessional football clubs. Without question, the Clemson University \nTigers is one of the grand old teams of southern football, and Frank \nHoward was the man who became synonymous not only with Clemson \nfootball, but with Clemson athletics. It is with great sadness that I \nrise today to mark his passing, and to pay tribute to him as a coach, a \nrole model, a man, and a friend.\n  Frank Howard dedicated his life to Clemson University and its \nfootball program. He loved that school so much, that after he retired \nfrom coaching, he remained in South Carolina and continued to be an \nimportant part of Clemson University campus life. Not only did Frank \nattend virtually every Tiger home game, he maintained an office in the \nJervey Athletic Center and was affectionately, and appropriately, given \nthe title of ``Legend.'' During his career, Frank amassed one of the \nmost impressive victory records in college football, fielding winning \nteams year after year, and capturing several Atlantic Coast Conference \nchampionships. In addition to his skills as a coach, Frank was a gifted \nrecruiter, and that combination ensured that Clemson always had a team \nof enthusiastic, talented, and well coached players. Countless \nindividual and team records were set by Clemson players during Frank's \nthree-decade tenure at the University, and many of his players went on \nto become some of the most respected individuals to take to the \ngridiron in the National Football League.\n  Frank was the first to admit that there was no secret to how he won \nfootball games: he believed in playing aggressive football. As he said \ntime and time again, ``Blocking and tackling wins games.'' While Frank \nstood for little nonsense as a coach, as some thought him gruff, he was \na man who truly loved his players and set an example for them to be \nindividuals who not only truly loved his players and set an example for \nthem to be individuals who not only had a commitment to winning, but to \ngood sportsmanship as well. As any coach would be, Frank was proud of \nhis players who went on to play professional football, and believe me \nMr. President, there was no shortage of such individuals. Through the \nyears, Tigers have played on probably every team in both the American \nand National Football Conferences. What separated Frank from many other \ncoaches is that he was equally proud of his players who never made the \nroster of a pro team, but who contributed to the growth and success of \nSouth Carolina. Frank was always quick and pleased to note that many of \nhis former players went on to become influential and respected leaders \nin professions as diverse as the law, medicine, business, academics, \nand religion. No doubt, their accomplishments are in large part \nattributable to the influence that Frank Howard had on them while they \nwere young men.\n  Mr. President, Frank Howard was once quoted as saying,\n\n       When I die I want to be buried up there on that hill near \n     the stadium. I want to be there \n\n[[Page S400]]\n     so I can hear all them people cheering my Tigers on Saturday and where \n     I can smell that chewing tobacco in ever corner of the \n     stadium. Then I won't have to go to heaven. I'll already be \n     there.\n\n  I am pleased to note that as Frank desired, he will be buried on \nCemetery Hill, where he will be able to watch over his beloved Tigers. \nWhile Frank is going to be buried in his version of heaven, I have no \ndoubt that St. Peter ushered him past the Pearly Gates, and at this \nmoment he is gathered around a chalkboard with the other greats of \ncoaching, going over games and plays, and enjoying the praises of his \npeers for his career of accomplishments. Needless to say, Coach Frank \nHoward will be missed by his large circle of friends, tens of thousands \nof football fans, and a grateful State. We all send our heartfelt \ncondolences to his widow, Ruth, and to the rest of Frank's family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/26/senate-section/article/S399-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE STATUS OF THE FARM BILL\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. While the debate continues in Congress over the future \nof farm policy for our Nation, I wanted to outline some of my \npriorities for agriculture in 1996.\n  While Congressman Roberts continues to push for his proposal to \ndecouple farm payments, I am committed to maintaining a safety net for \nour farmers. Coupling payments to both production and the marketplace \nis a good way to preserve the safety net. Farm payments should occur \nwhen prices are low so our farmers can sustain their capacity to \nproduce. When prices are high, the market can and will sustain our \nfarmers.\n  Payments should also be tied to production. Farm payments should be \ngiven to those working the land today, not simply to those who have \nreceived payments in the past. When Congress authorized the 1990 farm \nbill it was understood that the program was voluntary. That is to say, \nyou only needed to be farming in order to be eligible to participate. \nNow the Republican proposal requires participation over the last 5 \nyears in order to continue participating. The farm programs would not \nlonger be open to anyone currently farming, but only to those who had \nparticipated between 1990 and 1995, regardless of whether or not they \nwere still farming.\n  I also think we should preserve the permanent authority for farm \nprograms embodied in the 1949 agriculture law. In my opinion, repeal of \nthe 1949 law sends a clear message that our historic commitment to the \nfarmers of our Nation is ending. We must preserve this law as a \nconstant reminder of our ongoing commitment to maintaining a stable \nfood supply for our Nation. Preserving permanent authority for farm \nprograms also recognizes the vital role that agriculture plays, and \nwill continue to play, in this Nation's economy.\n  I am frustrated that Congress has failed to recognize the vital \nimportance of agriculture to our economy. We must maintain our \ncommitment to farmers, and farm programs must be tied to production and \nmarketplace. I am willing to work with my fellow Members to act quickly \non a farm bill that provides certainty and security to our farmers, \nboth now and in the future.\n  In addition, I feel the farm bill should not be broken up so that \nfood stamps and conservation programs are not addressed in conjunction \nwith the commodity programs. The simultaneous consideration of these \nareas of farm policy represent a balanced approach that recognizes the \nobligations of our Nation not only to our farmers, but also to our poor \nand our environment. While the farm bill is designed to enhance and \nensure the bountiful production of food from our land, it must also \naddress the distribution of that bounty to those of our Nation in need. \nWith all the food we produce, we must make sure it gets to the millions \nof hungry mouths in our cities and towns. While we help farmers to \ncultivate their land, we must also encourage them to preserve it when \nand where appropriate. USDA's Conservation Reserve Program is twice the \nsize of the USFWS National Wildlife Refuge Program. The contributions \nof this program to the preservation of wetlands, woodlands, and \nwildlife cannot be understated.\n  As the debate over the farm bill continues, I am committed to working \nfor these principles and to look out for the best interests of the hard \nworking families on the farms of my great State of Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/26/senate-section/article/S400-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S400-S401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      GREAT PLAINS SYNFUELS PLANT\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my grave concerns \nabout a matter that is currently under review before the Federal Energy \nand Regulatory Commission [FERC].\n  The future operation of the Great Plains Synfuels Plant, located in \nBeulah, ND, is being seriously threatened by a recent ruling in a case \npending before FERC. This decision ignores not only the adverse \neconomic consequences that the decision will have on the people of \nNorth Dakota and the region, but it fails to consider the strong public \npolicy reasons supporting both the initial construction of the Great \nPlains alternative energy plant and its successful operation for years \nto come. I urge FERC to reconsider the ruling in this light.\n  The Great Plains plan now employs 640 people in North Dakota and \nrepresents 20 percent of the lignite coal produced and consumed in the \nState. In addition, there are more than 400 construction workers \npresently employed at the Great Plains site who are involved in two \nongoing capital construction projects valued at hundreds of millions of \ndollars.\n  The Great Plains plant has an enormous impact on North Dakota's \neconomy. Several independent economists have estimated that the direct \nand indirect economic impact of the Great Plains plant is about $500 \nmillion every year--a sizable impact given North Dakota's small \npopulation.\n  Great Plains was constructed with a loan guaranteed by the Department \nof Energy [DOE] pursuant to the Federal Nonnuclear Energy Research Act \nof 1974. Specifically, that act authorized DOE to provide loan \nguarantees to assist in the demonstration of alternative fuel \ntechnologies using coal, oil shale, biomass, and other sources. Great \nPlains is the only alternative energy project still operating today \nthat was built because of the Federal Government's efforts in the late \n1970's and early 1980's to achieve energy independence for this \ncountry.\n  DOE operated the Great Plains plant for several years after its \noriginal sponsors in 1985 abandoned the project. In 1988, DOE sold \nGreat Plains to the Dakota Gasification Co.--a subsidiary of Basin \nElectric Power Cooperative--because Dakota was absolutely committed to \nthe long-term operation of the plant. Dakota's commitment was made \nbased upon the continued validity of FERC Opinion 119, which approved \nthe gas purchase agreements between Great Plains and the four pipeline \npurchasers, and the reasonable assumption that FERC would stand behind \nits opinion.\n  Since purchasing the plant, Dakota has acted to promote, to develop \nand to demonstrate the very technological potential that first prompted \nthe Federal Government to finance the plant's construction. For \nexample, Dakota has produced an annual average of 157 million standard \ncubic feet of synthetic gas a day from a facility designed to produce a \nmaximum of 137.5 million standard cubic feet a day with virtually no \nadditional capital investment. Because of this increased production and \nits other efforts, Dakota has continued to decrease both the real and \nnominal cost of producing synthetic gas.\n  At the same time, Dakota has been developing new by-products from the \ncoal gasification process, such as rare gases and other chemicals, for \ncommercial sale in this country and abroad. Dakota is currently \nembarking on several extensive investment projects costing several \nhundred million dollars. These projects depend upon the long-term \noperation of the plant and the continued application of FERC's Opinion \n119.\n  One important project involves developing one of the plant's by-\nproducts--carbon dioxide--as a method to enhance secondary oil recovery \nin the United States and Canada. The other project uses a significant \nportion of the plant's raw synthetic gas to produce on-site anhydrous \nammonia for use in a commercial fertilizer that is currently imported \ninto the United States and is in short supply. Another cutting edge \ntechnology being developed at the \n\n[[Page S401]]\nGreat Plains site uses the same ammonia by-product as a reagent in a \nflue gas scrubber system to produce yet another fertilizer, ammonia, \nsulfate. This represents the first commercial application in the world \nof this new technology, developed by General Electric Environmental \nSystems, Inc. It is a process that converts a waste by-product, which \nwould have otherwise been disposed of in a landfill, into a marketable \nproduct.\n  Mr. President, one thing is absolutely clear about the Great Plains \nfacility and the work of the Dakota Gasification Co. Not only have they \nsuccessfully commercialized the technologies that Great Plains was \nconstructed to demonstrate as contemplated by the 1974 act, but they \nare also developing important new applications. Given all this, I \nsincerely hope that the FERC Commissioners will reconsider the initial \nruling made in this case and take whatever steps are necessary to \nensure the future operation of Great Plains as a successful alternative \nenergy facility.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/26/senate-section/article/S400-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S401-S416]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE BALANCED BUDGET DOWNPAYMENT ACT, I\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we have been working with the leadership, \nthe chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and the distinguished \nranking member of the Appropriations Committee. We have an agreement \nworked out on proceeding with the continuing resolution and the first \namendment that would be offered thereto.\n  So, I ask unanimous consent the Senate now turn to the consideration \nof H.R. 2880, the continuing resolution, and Senator Kennedy be \nimmediately recognized to offer an amendment regarding education, that \nno amendments be in order to the amendment, and there be 1 hour and 30 \nminutes, equally divided, for debate in the usual form; following \nconclusion or yielding back of time, the majority leader or his \ndesignee be recognized to make a motion to table the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I do not \nintend to object but is the chairman of the Appropriations Committee \ngoing to make a statement for the record?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia will yield, I believe he will. He is on his way to the floor \nat this moment, so he should be here momentarily.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. I have a statement also. I wonder if it would be \nagreeable for the chairman and ranking member to proceed with their \nstatements first? That is the normal thing to do.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I think that is certainly appropriate. I \nwould like to amend the unanimous-consent request to state that after \nthe opening statements by the leadership of the committee, we then \nimmediately proceed to the amendment by Senator Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority whip for \nhis courtesy.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that once \nthe Kennedy amendment has been disposed of, Senator Moynihan be \nrecognized to offer an amendment regarding the debt limit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. For the information of Senators, we do expect to have votes \nto begin sometime around--I guess it would be 2:30, between 2:30 and \n2:45, depending, of course, on the length of the opening statements. \nBut after this time has been used or yielded back, we will have a vote \nthen between 2:30 and 2:45.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2880) making appropriations for fiscal year \n     1996 to make a downpayment toward a balanced budget, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, we have before us now the continuing \nresolution that the House acted upon last night, H.R. 2880. The \nexisting continuing resolution expires today at midnight, the 26th. All \nof us want to avoid another shutdown of the Federal Government, and its \ndepartments' and agencies' funding in the appropriations bills not yet \nsigned into law. Therefore, we need to act expeditiously on the measure \nnow before us, which provides for continued operations until March \n15th.\n  For the activities funded in the Commerce, Justice, State, Judiciary, \nand related agencies appropriations bills and the VA-HUD appropriations \nbill, the measure before us will provide funding at the levels \nestablished in the conference agreements on those bills generally under \nthe terms and conditions of fiscal year 1995. The exception is made for \nthe Department of Justice, which will operate at fiscal year 1996 \nfunding levels, under fiscal year 1996 terms and conditions.\n  Activities funded in the Interior and related agencies appropriations \nbill and the Labor-HHS, Education and related agencies appropriations \nbill will continue to operate until March 15 at the lower of the \nfunding levels established in the House-passed bill, the Senate-passed \nbill, or the current rate.\n  The exceptions made for activities of the Indian Health Service and \nthe Bureau of Indian Affairs, the National Park Service of the U.S. \nForest Service, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which will \noperate until March 15 at the levels established in the conference \nagreement on the Interior.\n  Further, special provision is made for the activities funded in the \nforeign operations bill. My colleagues will recall that for fiscal year \n1996, the foreign operations bill has been a contention between the \nHouse and the Senate for some time over the matter of population \nplanning assistance programs. The Senate has voted three times on this \nmatter, one during the Senate consideration of the bill reported from \nour committee and twice in connection with an amendment in disagreement \non the conference report.\n  Since the House returned the bill to us in November after further \ninsisting on its position, we have found ourselves in an extraordinary \nparliamentary situation that requires unanimous consent--unanimous \nconsent--to take further action. Unable to secure that consent, we have \nbeen unable to once again uphold a Senate position, or even to have the \nSenate consider a compromise.\n\n  To break that impasse, the House has now presented us with provisions \nin the measure which will fund all activities in the Foreign Operations \nbill with the exception of population planning assistance at the level \nof the conference agreement for the remainder of the fiscal year 1996. \nThere will be no funding for population planning assistance programs \nuntil July 1, unless expressly authorized. And, as you know, the \nauthorization bill has yet to be completed. Following July 1, funding \nmay be provided at 65 percent of the fiscal year 1995 level apportioned \non a monthly basis for 15 months.\n  Mr. President, this is a near calamitous formulation of these \nprograms, and it may very well provoke a result entirely antiethical to \nthe ``pro-life'' position. These programs promote family planning and \nbirth control in the developing nations of the world. Without them, \nthere will inevitably be more unwanted pregnancies, which will result \nin either more abortions or more unwanted children facing lives of \ndisease and deprivation.\n  I cannot for the life of me understand the action of the House. I \nbelieve it is wrong. It puts the gun to our heads, \n\n[[Page S402]]\nMr. President. I speak as a pro-life Senator. I do not see any reason, \nany legitimate rationale, that people who stand in a pro-life position \nshould do a thing of this kind to increase the possibilities of \nabortion--increase them, not diminish them.\n  There is a substantial majority in this Senate that would reject the \ncuts in population planning assistance, and I am one. But if we prevail \non amendment, the bill must be returned to the House for an uncertain \nfuture, and a Government shutdown could ensue. I am not sure the House \nis in a business position this afternoon or this evening to take \nfurther action on this. We are sort of in one of those situations \nwhere, as I say, it is a gun to our head. Otherwise, we then stand the \nresponsibility of shutting down the Government.\n  This predicament graphically illustrates why we should avoid \ncontinuing resolutions of any sort. As our former chairman, Senator \nByrd, has told us many times, the right to debate and amend is the very \nessence of the Senate. We, in effect, are being deprived of this by \nthis timetable and this kind of procedure. When we allow ourselves to \nget into this position, we risk losing those rights.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, I do not blame our colleagues in the other body \nentirely. It is not their job to protect our prerogatives. But I will \nsay that the Senate cannot and will not indefinitely forgo its right to \namend. Perhaps we should consider initiating further action in this \nrealm rather than waiting for the House to act and then hand us a \ndocument that is a fait accompli. We may not prevail, but we will not \nbe reduced to the mere ministerial function of approving what the other \nbody may determine and hand to us.\n  With that off my chest, Mr. President, let me summarize briefly the \nother major provisions of this bill and yield the floor to Senator \nByrd, our ranking member and former chairman, for any opening comments \nhe wishes to make.\n  The no-furlough provision of prior continuing resolutions has been \ndropped. A new provision is included, however, to give agency managers \nthe flexibility to avoid immediate severe staffing reductions. \nFlexibility.\n  Ten programs in the Labor-HHS bill are terminated. New grants for \nanother two dozen are held to 75 percent of their prior monthly rate.\n  I would like to also indicate on this one there has been \ncommunication at least from our side with the White House and the \nagencies involved, and even as late as last night I had further \nconversation with the Secretary of HHS, and it is not one of those \nthings that is perhaps advocated or welcomed, but there is at least an \nindication of acquiescence to these actions on the part of the \nadministration.\n  Travel by Cabinet Secretaries in excess of 110 percent of the 1995 \naverage is prohibited. A national security exemption is granted for \ndefense, the Secretary of Defense, that is, the Secretary of State, the \nDirector of the CIA, and the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations.\n  Authority is granted for the sale of a House office building.\n  Section 128 prohibits certain embryo research. I might indicate that \nno such research is underway or contemplated at this time, but it is a \nfurther definition of the congressional position.\n  Provision is made for the sale of oil from the Weeks Island facility \nof the strategic petroleum reserve in keeping with the conference \nagreement on the interior bill.\n  Legislative provisions from the VA-HUD conference agreement that will \nachieve significant savings in the operation of housing programs are \nincluded.\n\n  The maximum Pell grant award is established to be at least $2,440. \nThat is a $100 increase over the previous fiscal year.\n  Those are the issues. Those are the parts of this bill that we will \nbe discussing and hopefully act upon in an expeditious manner.\n  At this time, I thank also the Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. \nKennedy] and the Senator from New York [Mr. Moynihan] for entering into \na time agreement on their two amendments to further expedite this \nprocess.\n  Mr. President, again, I wish to say this is not the kind of document \nI believe would have come out of the Senate Appropriations Committee. \nYet, we are in this situation. I wish I could be enthusiastic about \nthis product, but I do see the fact that we live with it but until \nMarch 15. And hopefully within that period of time we can resolve these \ndifferences and have them peeled out of the CR and enacted in a regular \nform with the consensus of both the House and the Senate in the product \nrather than this being exclusively a House product.\n  Mr. President, I now yield to my good friend and colleague and mentor \nand compatriot who shares the misery, as we share misery together in \nthe many duties that we have to perform. And I thank the Senator from \nWest Virginia again for his cooperation, for the fine cooperation \nbetween Keith Kennedy and Jim English representing our respective \nstaffs, that represent a bipartisan approach to as many issues as \npossible within the context and the framework of this moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I also thank my \ncolleague, my cherished colleague, the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Oregon, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, from whom I \nhave learned much, indeed. I thank him for his very thoughtful remarks. \nThey were cogently articulated, reasonable in every degree. I share \nwith him a concern about the situation that has developed in which the \nSenate at least for a time is being deprived of its right to amend, in \nessence it is being deprived of its right to amend. We do not have to \nagree to that. But that is a right of the Senate which the Framers were \nvery careful to include in the Constitution of the United States, which \nsays that revenue bills shall begin in the other body, but the Senate \nshall have the right to amend as in all other bills. So we, I think, \nhave to zealously guard those rights but at the same time we have to \nkeep in mind some other circumstances that are prevailing at the \nmoment.\n  Mr. President, the House of Representatives has chosen to call the \npending measure ``The Balanced Budget Downpayment Act, I.'' In reality, \nH.R. 2880, the pending measure, is the latest in an unprecedented \nstring of continuing resolutions. H.R. 2880 is the ninth continuing \nresolution for fiscal year 1996, and since this resolution will expire \non March 15, 1996, it is likely that one or more additional continuing \nresolutions will be required subsequent to the enactment of H.R. 2880.\n  I have been advised by the Congressional Research Service that this \nis by far the largest number of continuing resolutions for any fiscal \nyear since 1977, and perhaps the most for any year. During Mr. Reagan's \n8 years in the White House, which covered fiscal years 1982-1989, \ncontinuing resolutions were the norm. In fact, for every year except \nPresident Reagan's last year in office--fiscal year 1989--continuing \nresolutions were required. But, over this 8-year period the largest \nnumber of continuing resolutions that were required for any 1 year \nduring Mr. Reagan's terms was fiscal year 1987, when six continuing \nresolutions were required. In three other years, fiscal years 1985, \n1986, and 1988, five continuing resolutions were required; for fiscal \nyear 1982, four continuing resolutions were required; and for fiscal \nyears 1983 and 1984, two continuing resolutions were required.\n  During President Bush's 4 years in the White House, fiscal years \n1990-1993, three continuing resolutions were required in his first year \nin office, fiscal year 1990, and five continuing resolutions were \nrequired for fiscal year 1991, the year of the 1990 budget summit. At \nthe end of that summit, it was determined that a full-year continuing \nresolution should be enacted for all 13 appropriation bills and that \nwas done on November 5, 1990. For fiscal year 1992, four continuing \nresolutions were required; and for fiscal year 1993, one continuing \nresolution was required to carry appropriation measures through October \n5th in order to give the President time to sign all appropriation bills \nfor that year.\n  It is not unusual for a number of continuing resolutions to be \nrequired for any given fiscal year to give the President and Congress \ntime to complete their work on annual appropriation bills. But this is \na different situation. Never before in my memory have the \n\n[[Page S403]]\nCongress and the President been unable to reach a successful conclusion \non the amounts to be appropriated for the 13 appropriation bills \nwithout having to pass nine and perhaps even more continuing \nresolutions.\n  This has been a unique year in that respect, but it is \nunderstandable. The Republican leadership in Congress feels very \nstrongly about not only the levels of funding they think should be \nappropriated for a number of these appropriation bills, but also about \na number of legislative, policy-type issues that they have chosen to \nattach to each of the six unsigned fiscal year 1996 appropriation \nbills. The President has made it clear that he is unable to sign five \nof the remaining bills because of insufficient funds or because of the \nlegislative riders attached to them, or both. So it appears that this \nimpasse is unlikely to be resolved until a final determination is made \nin relation to the 7-year budget agreement. The President hopes that \nsuch an agreement, if achieved, would result in additional \ndiscretionary spending for fiscal year 1996 and other years. If those \nadditional funds are allocated, obviously the difficulties remaining on \nthe six unsigned appropriation bills would be greatly lessened. Even \nthen, however, the issue of legislative riders will have to be \nresolved.\n  So, it is difficult to know when or if we will be able to finally \nenact appropriations for the remaining fiscal year 1996 appropriation \nbills for the rest of the fiscal year.\n  Meanwhile, turning to the pending measure, let me compliment the \nchairman of the committee, Senator Hatfield, as well as the very \ncapable and articulate chairman of the House appropriations committee, \nMr. Livingston, for their efforts in putting together this bill. They \nand their staffs worked very closely with Mr. Obey, the distinguished \nranking minority Member of the House Appropriations Committee, and with \nmy office and our staffs in attempting to solve as many problems as we \ncould in connection with this current continuing resolution.\n  Mr. President, I also want to thank our staffs. The names have \nalready been mentioned by the distinguished chairman. I would simply \nsay without their expertise and their dedication and hard work, we \nwould not be where we are today. But this bipartisan approach was, I am \nsure, a key reason why this bill passed the House by a vote of 371 to \n42.\n  I will not give a brief summary of the bill. The distinguished \nchairman has already laid that in the Record. I will just simply \ninclude that in my remarks.\n  The resolution as passed by the House funds four bills through March \n15, 1996: VA/HUD, Commerce/Justice/State, Interior, and Labor/HHS.\n  The resolution funds the Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill \nthrough the balance of the fiscal year, September 30, 1996, at the \nlevels contained in the conference report on the bill. Also included in \nthe foreign operations portion in the resolution is a special provision \nprohibiting population assistance funding until July 1, 1996, unless \nexpressly authorized.\n  A floor of 75 percent of fiscal year 1995 funding has been set for \ncertain programs which would have received little or no funding. Those \nprograms are: Advanced Technology Program; Ounce of Prevention Council; \nGLOBE/Climate change-Internet; Cops on the Beat; Drug Courts; \nAmeriCorps; Community Development Financial Institutions; and HHS \nOffice of Consumer Affairs.\n  Additionally, the resolution contains a number of general provisions, \namong which are the following: travel expenses of Cabinet Secretaries \nmay not exceed 110 percent of the 1990-1995 average, except for \nDefense, State, CIA, and the Ambassador to the United Nations; Section \n128 of the bill prohibits the use of funds for embryo research; ``no-\nfurlough'' language of the existing continuing resolution is dropped \nbut furloughs are limited to no more than one day per pay period per \nemployee; full furlough protection for the Council on Environmental \nQuality; a freeze of new grants and elimination of 10 programs in \nLabor/HHS; the Architect of the Capitol is directed to sell an excess \nHouse Office Building; a maximum Pell Grant of ``at least'' $2,440 \n($100 above fiscal year 1995); and $1.2 billion in legislative savings \nagreed to in the VA/HUD conference.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, while I would prefer to have enacted \nall of the 13 appropriation bills through the balance of the fiscal \nyear in this measure, that was not possible for the reasons that I have \nstated. Under the circumstances that we face, I believe that this \nmeasure is the best that we can achieve at this time. The House passed \nit overwhelmingly; the President indicated that he will sign the \nmeasure when it reaches his desk; so I urge my colleagues to refrain \nfrom offering amendments to the measure unless they address urgent and \ncritical matters. Failure to enact H.R. 2880 by midnight tonight would \nresult in another government shutdown, which is an unacceptable \nalternative.\n  I urge the adoption of H.R. 2880.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMassachusetts is now recognized to offer his amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3119\n\n         (Purpose: To maintain funding for education programs)\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment on behalf \nof myself, Senator Jeffords, Senator Snowe, Senator Simon, Senator \nBingaman, Senator Wellstone, Senator Pell, Senator Dodd, Senator Reid, \nSenator Harkin, and others, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy], for himself, \n     Mr. Jeffords, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Simon, Mr. Pell, Mr. Dodd, Mr. \n     Reid, Ms. Murray, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. \n     Wellstone, proposes an amendment numbered 3119.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title I, insert the following new section:\n       Sec.   . (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     Act (except sections 106, 115, 119 and 120), the amount \n     appropriated for each education program under this Act shall \n     be not be less than the amount made available for such \n     education program under the Departments of Labor, Health and \n     Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies \n     Appropriations Act, 1995.\n       (b) For the purpose of subsection (a), the term ``education \n     program'' means each continuing project or activity of the \n     Department of Education and each continuing project or \n     activity under the Head Start Act and the School-to-Work \n     Opportunities Act of 1994.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As I understand, at the request of the two leaders, the \ntime allocated for this was to be an hour and a half evenly divided. I \nwould yield myself now 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today we are asked to consider the fourth \ntemporary funding measure of this fiscal year. The proposed continuing \nresolution, if extended for the entire year, contains the largest \neducation cut in the Nation's history, over $3 billion, and will cause \ndisruption and chaos in colleges and school districts across the \ncountry.\n  President Clinton has made clear that he will not consider a budget \nagreement unless it protects education. But the longer we accept these \nshort-term cuts, the more damage is being done to the very areas, \nparticularly education, that we have vowed to protect. We are in danger \nof accepting, through the back door, what we would have never accepted \nthrough the front door.\n  This amendment, cosponsored by Senators Simon, Jeffords, Snowe, and \nothers, stops the hemorrhage of Federal education dollars. It provides \nfunds for education programs at the 1995 levels, so that schools and \ncolleges have the funds they need to plan for the next academic year. \nWithout those funds, schools and colleges across the country face \ndrastic cuts in vital education programs.\n  Boston, for example, is required by State law to submit its school \nbudget for next year to its school committee by the first Wednesday in \nFebruary. The school committee must submit its \n\n[[Page S404]]\nbudget to the mayor by the last Wednesday in March. Teacher contracts \nrequire teachers to be notified of any layoffs for the next year by May \n15, or else teachers must be paid for the entire year.\n  Because there are no 1996 figures for key Federal programs, the city, \nfor example, must adopt a budget based on the worst-case level of \nfunding for the title I program. This would be a 15-percent cut for \nBoston schools. The city will have to eliminate title I services at 14 \nof their 79 title I schools. They will also have to lay off teachers.\n  The Detroit public schools are planning their budget for a worst-case \nscenario, will lose $16 million in title I alone--an 18-percent cut \nthat will force them to lay off 419 teachers and serve 10,000 fewer \nstudents. They will also lose $4 million in Medicaid funding that helps \npay for 800 special education teachers and medical professionals. \nDetroit Superintendent Dr. David Snead says that the burden of these \nFederal cuts will be transferred squarely onto the back of the local \nschool district. Mr. President, the list goes on.\n  According to Lyn Guy, superintendent of Monroe County Public Schools \nin West Virginia--25 percent of her $13.5 million budget comes from \nFederal funds. Her district has begun its planning process, and she has \nno choice but to plan for the lowest cuts. She must announce teacher \ncontract renewals by April 1, and she expects to be forced to lay off \n15 to 20 teachers in her 6 schools. Yet in Monroe County, the public \nschool system is the largest employer and teachers are the highest paid \nworkers. A loss of 15 to 20 teacher jobs will cause significant \neconomic hardship.\n  In addition to personnel cuts, Monroe County will have to dismantle \nprograms begun last year that are helping the district serve children \nfrom birth to 8 years old more effectively. It will be forced to \neliminate a coordinated services project begun this year to bring \ncomprehensive health and nutrition services to all students. It will \nalso be forced to eliminate Project TLC, which uses title I and Head \nStart funds to help children come to school ready to learn. It will be \nforced to eliminate the Parents as Teachers Program, which brought 50 \nparent volunteers to the elementary schools that had never had parent \nvolunteers before.\n  Mr. President, this chart here indicates where we have been going in \nthe recent years in education funding. We have seen a modest increase \nin total numbers over the past few years. This $0.9 billion, almost $1 \nbillion, increase also reflects a $600 million rescission from the last \nyear.\n  All we are trying to do is go back to the 1995 levels. If this \ncontinuing resolution that is before us today were extended for a year, \nwe would effectively cut $3.1 billion from the 1995 levels, which would \nbe the largest cut in education in the history of the United States. It \nis not warranted. It is not justified.\n  Mr. President, the effect of this will mean some 1,100,000 children \nthat are receiving the title I services for extra help in reading and \nmath would be denied those services, and 31,000 teachers would be laid \noff. More than 250,000 students who otherwise would be eligible for \nPell grants, will not be eligible.\n  In the Safe and Drug-free Schools Program, 14,000 school districts \nwill eliminate or drastically reduce their drug abuse and violence \nprevention programs. The Goals 2000 Program, which helps States and \ndistricts establish the higher standards for students across the \ncountry, would be slashed.\n  Mr. President, we have to ask ourselves where these priorities are. \nThis is a simple amendment. All we are trying to do, for the period of \nthis amendment, which is some 49 days, is to say that we will set the \nmark for these school districts and for the colleges at the 1995 level. \nWe are not extending the continuing resolution for a year, and that is \nexplicit in the legislation.\n  Mr. President, arguments are going to be made here that if we extend \nthe continuing resolution, with our amendment, for a year, it will take \nscarce resources from other programs. What we have before us, Mr. \nPresident, and before the country is what the President offered the \nother evening, and that was his hand to the Republican leadership in \nthe House and Senate to work out an agreement. Every one of us want the \nagreement to work out. But the President also said that he will work \nout an agreement to protect education.\n  If we are going to continue the funding of education at 75 percent of \nthe 1995 level, we are going to be sending the message to school \ndistricts and colleges across this country to count on a significant \ncutback in funding, and that is not correct.\n  So, Mr. President, we are hopeful that this amendment will be \naccepted. We are prepared to deal with the various challenges that will \nbe made about the budget order and various procedures and allocations \nin various agreements. What we have seen at other times is that when an \nagreement is going to be made between the President and the Congress, \nand he is going to make that agreement with regard to education, then \nthe ceilings and limits and terms of allocations under the Budget Act \nwill be expanded.\n  This is in the best tradition of a bipartisan education effort. We \nhave seen for years that Republicans and Democrats work together in \neducation. We saw it last year when the Senator from Illinois and the \nSenator from Maine worked together to bring us all together with 67 \nvotes indicating the Nation's priorities on education.\n  Today, we are trying to make sure that in these final hours, when \nthis legislation was called up at 2 o'clock on a Friday afternoon with \na 1\\1/2\\-hour debate on this measure, without having the full knowledge \nof what was going to be included in that continuing resolution until 6 \nor 7 o'clock last night, that we can raise this important issue. We \nbelieve that this is the kind of amendment that the American people \nstand for.\n  I will introduce in the Record the sentiments which have been \nexpressed by the American people on education. More than 80 percent of \nthe American people say, Do not cut education programs. We are \nsupporting the elimination of those education programs which have been \neliminated in the continuing resolution. But when you are talking about \nHead Start, when you are talking about moving children from high school \ninto work, School to Work, when you are talking about title I, when you \nare talking about the Pell grants, when you are talking about the \nPerkins loan program, when you are talking about Safe and Drug-free \nSchools, when we are going to see our school population increase by 10 \npercent--some 8 million children--we ought to be willing to say that no \nmatter how necessary it is to balance the budget--and it is--we are not \ngoing to do it on the backs of the schoolchildren of this country.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. How much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania controls 45 \nminutes. The Senator from Massachusetts controls 37 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I agree with a great deal of what the distinguished \nSenator from Massachusetts has had to say. During the course of my \ntenure in the Senate, I have been a strong supporter of education \nfunding. I am the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee which \nfunds education, and when the Senate drew a larger education allocation \nthan the House did, I took the lead, along with Senator Harkin, the \ndistinguished ranking minority member, in putting the $1.5 billion \nextra all into education.\n  I would like to see education funded at the 1995 level. But the \nimport of this amendment, as I understand it, and I qualify it to that \nextent because we are dealing in great complexities--one thing I \nstrongly disagree with the Senator from Massachusetts on is when he \nsays this is a simple amendment. If there is anything that I think is \nplain, it is that this is not simple.\n  As I have gone through the work with very able staff in trying to \nunderstand the implications of this matter, because I did not get \nnotice of it until a telephone call from Senator Kennedy last evening, \nthere would be a reduction--if I may have the attention of the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, because I would like to have a dialog with the \nSenator. We just had one informally before the amendment was called up, \nand I think we ought to have a discussion to see if we can agree as to \nwhat the import of this amendment is or if we can agree to disagree. \n\n[[Page S405]]\n\n  As I understand the amendment, if these funds came to fruition in the \ncontext of what we currently have available, there would be a 10.5-\npercent reduction across the board in funding on the subcommittee \nappropriations which covers the Departments of Education and Labor and \nHealth and Human Services.\n  So if we come to employment and training programs--and I know that no \none is a stauncher advocate for that than the Senator from \nMassachusetts, although there are some equally as strong, such as \nSenator Kassebaum, myself, and others--there would be a reduction of \nalmost $334 million. And if this spending came to fruition without an \nincrease in the allocation, there would be a decrease in spending on \nNIH, the National Institutes of Health, of $1.253 billion, and on \nLIHEAP--so necessary in Massachusetts, as well as Pennsylvania and \nmany, many other States; the distinguished Senator from Minnesota, \nSenator Wellstone, has spoken emphatically on this subject, as well as \nmany others--there would be a decrease in funding of $105 million.\n  When Senator Kennedy says we need to know what funding will be \navailable for education, I agree with him totally. But if his amendment \nis adopted, there will be a doubt as to what the funding will be for \nNIH, for employment and training programs, and for many, many programs, \nso it will all be confused.\n  When he says President Clinton extended his hand to work out an \narrangement here, when he extended his hand, I stood up and extended \nmine when he made that point in his speech about Americans working \ntogether. But I suggest that this amendment is not going to accomplish \nthe purposes the Senator from Massachusetts looks for.\n  When he says it is for 49 days, it is not annualized, that is true, \nbut what does it mean? If it only lasts for 49 days and the funds are \nnot expended until July 1 and after, nothing will happen unless there \nis an increase in the allocation for this subcommittee----\n  Mr. President, will you call the Senate to order, please?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). I thank the Senator. The Senate is \nnot in order.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, if the Senator from \nMassachusetts is correct, that it is not annualized, that it stands for \nonly 49 days, no other funds are added and this money is then spent for \neducation, which I would like to see, it is going to come out of other \nprograms.\n  If the Senator from Massachusetts wants to make a point that we \ndiscussed privately, I would like to find a way to do that. I have sat \nrepeatedly, as recently as the day before yesterday, with Congressman \nPorter, who chairs the House committee, trying to preconference a \nreport covering education.\n  We have not been able to bring this bill to the floor because of a \ndisagreement. I am prepared to accept 50 percent of the responsibility. \nI would like to divide it equally between the Democrats and the \nRepublicans for a change, instead of arguing that it is all the \nDemocrats because you are filibustering striker replacement, or it is \nall the Republicans. We have not brought it to the floor, and there is \nenough blame on all sides.\n  The question I ask the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts is, \non the basis of the current allocation for the subcommittee which \ncovers education and also the Departments of Health, Human Services and \nLabor, if that figure is not increased, and if the amendment stands, if \nit is adopted and is not rescinded, is it not true that, if you add \nthis money to education and the allocation for the subcommittee stands, \nthere will have to be a $686 million reduction from the AIDS funding \nfor the Ryan White Program? That is my question.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The answer to the Senator----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will yield on the Senator's time, if I can.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I say to Senator Kennedy, why not take your time? This \nis an argument on your behalf.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will come back and answer it, but I have a number of \nSenators who are here. It was at the request of the majority side that \nwe limit our time in this way, over my objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Pennsylvania yield to \nthe Senator from Massachusetts?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. When the Senator is going to yield the floor, I will \nmake a brief comment, and then I want to be able to yield time to \nothers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I will yield time, reasonably, to the Senator from \nMassachusetts. Parliamentary inquiry. What are the magic words if I \nwant to regain the floor after yielding the time if the Senator goes \ntoo long?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator can reclaim the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield to the Senator on my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I listened to the Senator's question. The Senator may \nnot like the answer, but I am going to give the answer that I believe \nis responsive to the question.\n  The other side of what the Senator asked is committing this country, \nover the period of the next year, for the 25-percent cut in many \nprograms, which is in effect in the continuing resolution. I say I am \nnot prepared to accept those allocations that the Senator has \nmentioned, the straitjacket that the Senator has indicated we put \nourselves into, because I believe that that straitjacket can be lifted, \nand the American people are going to demand that we lift it.\n  If the Senator is saying, look, we have agreed to some procedure and \ntherefore we are going to see a continuing diminution of support for \neducation, I reject that. I will join with the Senator from \nPennsylvania, because he has been a leader in this body, in making sure \nthat we are going to have adequate funding. I say that the best way to \nget that adequate funding is to accept this amendment and build on that \nwith the President and the congressional leaders, as they work out a \nfinal agreement on the balanced budget to reflect the President's \npriorities and the American people's priorities, and that is to \nincrease the funding on education, certainly not to cut it 25 percent.\n  Mr. SPECTER. My next question for the Senator from Massachusetts is, \nis it not true that if the funding is not increased and the amendment \nof the Senator from Massachusetts stands, that there will be a decrease \nof $1.253 billion from NIH?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield to the Senator from \nMassachusetts?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield on my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, that question is like saying, if we \naccept what happened here in the U.S. Senate in cuts on Medicare and \nMedicaid, we are going to have to live with them. I reject that \npremise. The President rejects that, and the American people do. The \nway we are going to see the significant cuts of some 25 percent on the \neducation budget and these $3.1 billion cuts is by rejecting this \namendment. We will be able to deal with the allocations as part of the \noverall agreement, which, as I understand, there are negotiations \nbetween Republicans and the President at the same time. The President \nsupports this amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I take the answer from the distinguished \nSenator from Massachusetts to be a yes. The import of his answer is \nthat there will be a decrease in NIH funding, and there will be a \ndecrease in funding for every other program covered by the \nappropriations allocation for my subcommittee, which has the Department \nof Health and Human Services, Department of Labor, as well as the \nDepartment of Education.\n  I have asked the question twice, and twice the Senator from \nMassachusetts has said that he does not accept the allocation. Well, I \ndo not accept the allocation either, but Senator Kennedy does not run \nthe U.S. Government, and neither does Arlen Specter. Before there is \ngoing to be a change in the allocation, there has to be an agreement \nbetween the executive branch, the President, and the Congress of the \nUnited States. Right now, what we are dealing with is an allocation for \nthree departments. I do not like the allocation, but that is the \nallocation. And you cannot take $3 billion and add it to education \nwithout crippling many, many other vital accounts. You will be taking \nan enormous amount of funding out of the older worker's jobs program, \ncommunity and migrant mental health \n\n[[Page S406]]\ncenters, maternal and child care, substance abuse; and if I did not \nhave a limitation of time, I could go through many, many programs, \nwhich I know the Senator from Massachusetts would not want to take \nfunding out of.\n  But the answer is--and it is reading between the lines on what the \nSenator from Massachusetts has responded--these programs will lose \nfunding under the current allocation. I am prepared to fight with him \nto increase the allocation. But I am not prepared to see an amendment \npass here today which gives false and unrealistic hopes to the \neducation community. It is not even Confederate money that Senator \nKennedy is offering here today, it is illusory money, it is pie-in-the-\nsky. He says it lasts for 49 days. There is no expenditure in that \nperiod of time. If it lasts longer, he is going to gut many, many other \nprograms.\n  So I think it just has to be rejected.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 32 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 15 seconds. If the Senator \nwants to continue to defend the Republican position of having $245 \nbillion in tax cuts as part of his premise, when we are going ahead and \ncutting these education programs, go ahead. But this President is not \naccepting it, and this Congress is not accepting it.\n  We are stating, with this amendment, our priorities. It is in \neducation. There are good bean counters around here, but we are talking \nabout the hearts and souls of the American people. If we gut the $245 \nbillion, when the President sits down, he is going to say, Let us put \nat least $3 billion of that right back here in education.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am a little surprised to hear the \nSenator from Massachusetts make the statement that this Senator \nsupports a $245 billion tax cut. I am surprised to hear the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts make that representation because, even though he \ncannot be on the floor all the time, I know he very seriously reads the \nCongressional Record. He must have noted my vote against the tax cut \nrepeatedly when it came up on the reconciliation bill. This Senator has \nnot supported any tax cut at all.\n  On my time, let me ask the Senator from Massachusetts if he agrees \nwith President Clinton that there ought to be a $130 billion tax cut.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. On the Senator's time, I supported the tax cut for \ntuition and also for the child care program. I think it ought to be \nsomewhat smaller. But the Senator knows that he is speaking as the \nfloor manager for the majority party. He can have an independent \nposition, but to disclaim the fact that his side of the aisle is \ncommitted to a $245 billion tax cut and to also cut back education is \ndisingenuous, I would say.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, let me make strong exception to the \nSenator from Massachusetts using the word ``disingenuous.'' That is the \nmost inappropriate thing he has said here today, among many \ninappropriate things. I am interested to know that he supports a tax \ncut.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized and has \nbeen yielded 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the \namendment. I commend the Senator from Pennsylvania for the work he has \ndone. I am on the subcommittee. I know what an incredibly difficult job \nit is to try and divide too few dollars among too many very valuable \nand worthwhile programs. I also believe that at this critical time, in \nthis year when all of the cities and towns of my State and others are \ntrying to figure out what they are going to be doing with their \neducation budgets for the next year. They have the problem of having to \nnotify teachers of their plans. It appears that the track we're on now \ndoes not provide schools with sufficient information to make decisions. \nIt would be much better to do what we are proposing in this amendment, \nand that is to let them know that at least is they should be able to \nplan on not having any substantial cuts in the educational programs.\n  If I read the minds of the budgeteers as represented in their \nstatements to the press, the only real agreement that has come out is \nthere should not only be no cuts in education, but that education \nservices should be increased to account for inflation. There seems to \nbe unanimity even within the House on this point. I do not think we are \nin any way misrepresenting to our people if we say that this year we \nshould at least have a freeze on funding at the 1995 levels. That is \neven less than it appears they have agreed to at the summit.\n  What we have in Vermont, and I am sure across the country--we have \nall our town meetings in March. We have all the dates that we have to \nsend out notices on contracts. The 45 days provided for in this \ncontinuing resolution will take us almost halfway through the fiscal \nyear and yet this continuing resolution leaves the Senate on record \nsaying to States figure it out for yourselves.\n  If the budgeteers, in principle, have agreed to giving current \nservices--it will create problems for the Appropriations Committee. \nHowever, those dollars do not necessarily have to come out of the \nallocation of the education subcommittee. There can be allocations from \nother subcommittees to fund education programs at the current services \nlevel. We can do anything in the Senate and the House if we work \ntogether to make promises and to keep promises to the people.\n  In all 50 States, 14,000 school districts are currently developing \ntheir financial plans for the 1996-97 school year. As I said, it is \nextremely difficult to move forward on such planning without a funding \nresolution in place.\n  It has been pointed out that 80 percent of those who are in favor of \na balanced budget, those who are fiscally conservative, have said, ``Do \nnot cut education.'' Passage of this amendment would show that the \nCongress of the United States is living up to what has already been \nagreed to in principle in the budget discussions.\n  For instance, if you have to lay off 10 percent of your teachers, who \ndo you notify? You have to notify them all, probably, because you do \nnot know which ones you will pick--the terrible dilemmas that will go \non if we do not give them an idea if there will be funding available. \nIn Vermont, layoff notices will have to go out in March.\n  In Vermont, we lose $2.4 million for title 1, which accounts for \n2,000 students. The current budget situation creates chaos in Vermont's \ntown meetings because they have little guidance in setting their \nbudgets.\n  I am hopeful this amendment will pass. I cannot believe that the \nCongress, working with the President, will not agree to what they have \nalready agreed to in the budget discussions. That is, we should not cut \neducation, at least carrying through another 45 days, and hopefully, \nthen, of course, we can get a further commitment to the funds that are \nnecessary to do what must be done.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Illinois, and then \nthe Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, first of all, in response to what Senator \nSpecter had to say, we are not asking that these funds be taken out of \nthe Ryan White Program or NIH. Everyone knows the budget figures are \nnot written in stone yet.\n  Ask the American people, instead of a $245 billion tax cut, should we \nhave a $240 billion tax cut or $5 billion more for education, and 90 \npercent of the American people would say, ``Let's do that.''\n  Every economic study that has been made--conservative, liberal, \nwhatever--says we have to do more in education in this country, both \nquantitatively and qualitatively. Yet, you look at those figures on the \ngraph back there that Senator Kennedy has, and they are even warped to \nthis extent: They do not count inflation. When you eliminate inflation, \nfor example, on that $900 million, that brings it down to about zero \nfor 1995. When you add inflation to the $3.1 billion cut, that brings \nit up to a $4 billion cut.\n  What does this mean in practical terms? The Chicago School District \nreally is a struggling school district, \n\n[[Page S407]]\nand they see us cutting back. They get 15 percent of their funds from \nthe Federal Government. They are making the assumption, on the basis of \nthese 25 percent cuts, that they will get 18 percent less Federal \nfunding. That may be optimistic. On the basis of that, they are \nplanning to discharge 600 teachers.\n  Does anyone believe we can build a better Chicago or Illinois or \nAmerica by discharging 600 teachers in a desperate school district in \nurban America?\n  What about our colleges and universities? Students going to colleges \nand universities right now say, ``What kind of help can I get when I go \nto the University of Idaho,'' or whatever school it is. Colleges and \nuniversities are saying, ``We cannot tell you.''\n  Now, I recognize that the continuing resolution in theory raises the \nPell grant to $2,440. But that is public relations. Am I for that? \nSure. I want to raise it to $10,000. I am for it. These are not \nentitlements. I would love to make an entitlement out of that program. \nThose have to be appropriated. So while we raise the Pell grant to \n$2,440, we say we are cutting back on the appropriations to make that \npossible. That is just nonsense.\n  What we are doing here is sending a signal to the House, to the \nAmerican public, as you work out a budget agreement, education has to \nbe a priority. That ought to be a simple reality that every American, \nevery Senator, every House Member can recognize.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I again agree with a good bit--almost \nall--of what the distinguished Senator from Illinois has had to say. \nHowever, if we do not pass this continuing resolution--the House of \nRepresentatives rejected a motion to recommit last night by a vote of \n222-193. Now, there is an additional factor beyond what we have debated \nso far. That is, at least according to the information provided to me, \nthere is not a quorum in the House to act on what the Senate will do.\n  I do not like the posture that we are in. The practical fact of life \nis that if we add this amendment, there will be a disagreement, no \ncontinuing resolution, and the funding which now goes to the schools in \nyour State, Senator Simon, including Chicago, on education, schools in \nmy State, schools across the country, will not have any additional \nfunding.\n  Mr. SIMON. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Briefly. On Senator Kennedy's time?\n  Mr. SIMON. If you could on your time, I would appreciate it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield half a minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, there are really three alternatives. If my \ncolleague is correct about not having a quorum, they can accept it by \nvoice vote. That is not unprecedented. No. 2, it could come back here \nand we could decide in desperation we can take this off. And No. 3, we \ncan decide we are going to have a continuing resolution by voice vote \nfor another 5 days while we get this worked out.\n  We do not need to supinely say, whatever the House decides we are \ngoing to have to do. I have never known the Senate to do that on any \nconsistent basis.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I agree with the Senator from Illinois that we ought not \nto simply accept anything, what the House says or anyone else says. I \ncompliment him on his imaginative three alternatives, but none is going \nto come to pass. I yield the time.\n  Mr. PELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. How much time does the Senator from \nMassachusetts yield the Senator from Rhode Island?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield him 3 minutes, and I will just yield myself 15 \nseconds.\n  Mr. President, just for others who are interested, the Senator from \nIllinois has stated it correctly. We could extend the continuing \nresolution that expires tonight into next week. The House is meeting \nnext week and they expect a vote. We could extend it for 96 hours. That \nwould bring it into Tuesday, and the House of Representatives could \nvote.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Notwithstanding the suggestion by the Senator from \nMassachusetts, you cannot do that unless the House of Representatives \nagrees to it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island has been yielded \n3 minutes.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I know I speak for many of my constituents \nwhen I say that the continuing resolution before us is a welcome \nbreakthrough in the protracted deadlock that has stalled our National \nGovernment for the past 2 months.\n  But as welcome as that breakthrough is, I would be remiss if I did \nnot state my disagreement--in the strongest terms--with the provisions \nof the resolution dealing with education. And I join in wholehearted \nsupport of the amendment offered by the Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. \nKennedy].\n  In doing so, I recognize that the pending resolution is a product of \nconsiderable compromise across partisan and ideological lines and that \nno one among us is completely satisfied with its terms.\n  But the Federal commitment to education, to my mind, should be the \nvery last area of concession. As I have said before, we should treat \neducation as a vital capital investment of the Nation's future. It is \nan investment which is closely tied to our objective of deficit \nreduction because a well-educated citizenry is essential to preserving \na strong and vibrant economy.\n  The continuing resolution before us would finance programs of the \nDepartment of Education at 75 percent of fiscal year 1995 levels, which \nI view as an unduly and unwisely low level of funding. If extended over \nthe fiscal year it would cut education funding by $3.1 billion and \nadversely impact many programs of proven merit.\n  I am particularly concerned about the impact of a 25-percent cut in \ntitle I spending, which provides compensatory education for \ndisadvantaged children. I am told that the result could be reduced \nservices for 1.1 million children and the layoff of some 90,000 support \npersonnel.\n  And the damage would go beyond that. Goals 2000, Safe and Drug Free \nSchools, vocational education, adult education, Perkins loans, and \nother programs would suffer from loss of a quarter of their funding. In \nRhode Island, the loss to the six programs affected by the cuts would \namount to $5.6 million, of which $3.5 million would be taken from title \nI funding.\n  And as the Senator from Massachusetts has reminded us so cogently, \nwith every passing week without a correction of these adverse impacts, \nschool districts across the country and educational institutions at all \nlevels are facing a dilemma in planning their commitments for the \ncoming year.\n  The effect of the CR on education therefore is another step in the \ndrastic defunding of Federal education programs. There is still room to \nhope that the direction of this unwise course of action can still \nsomehow be changed before the expiration of the pending resolution on \nMarch 15. Far better that we do so now if we can. So I support the \nKennedy amendment and hope that we can remedy the faulty provisions of \nthe resolution before us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for \n3 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts \nfor his leadership on this issue. I strongly support the amendment he \nhas offered because it would put back into some kind of reasonable \nbalance the priorities that we should be pursuing here in this \nCongress.\n  In a few hours we are going to vote on a defense authorization bill. \nIn that bill the Congress has decided to add $7 billion to what the \nPentagon requested in funding for this year. At the same time we are \nvoting $7 billion extra for defense, we are, in our appropriations \nprocess, proposing to cut $3.1 billion from what goes to education.\n  Those priorities are out of whack, in my opinion. They are out of \nline with the priorities of the American people, and this amendment \nwould help correct that. I strongly support it. \n\n[[Page S408]]\n\n  I would like to mention one other area, the issue of educational \ntechnology. The President spoke the other night about the importance of \nbringing all of our students up in educational technology and making \nthem all technologically literate as they go into the next century. He \nsaid each of our classrooms should be hooked up to the Internet by the \nyear 2000. The truth is, the President asked for $50 million to begin \nthis process. On the House side the proposal is to cut that in half. On \nthe Senate side the proposal is to cut it by two-thirds. The bill which \nwe are now considering, this continuing resolution, cuts it by even \nmore. Our priorities are not what they should be.\n  Let me also say something about the procedure we are following here. \nThis is the ninth continuing resolution since the beginning of this \nfiscal year. In addition to that, we have in this continuing resolution \na statement that the act should be cited as the Balanced Budget \nDownpayment Act, No. 1. Essentially, what we are saying here is that \nnot only have we had nine continuing resolutions so far, but that this \nis the first of a series of additional continuing resolutions.\n  Our States cannot plan. They do not know what their funding is going \nto be from the Federal Government. Our school districts cannot plan. \nOur teachers, our parents, our students cannot plan. This is an \nirresponsible way for us to be conducting our business. People deserve \nbetter from the U.S. Congress than they are getting with this process. \nA great nation like this should deal with its children in a more \nresponsible way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The President had a request for $122 million. Last \nyear's funding was $55,625,000. The subcommittee recommended a figure \nof fiscal year 1996 of $57,475,000. So we did not cut the President's \nrequest by two-thirds.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, could I just respond to that and respond \nto the Senator from Pennsylvania?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield time for that response?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. The figures I was given were that in the Improving \nAmerica's Schools Act, which we adopted in the last Congress, we \nadopted the technology for education provisions. The President \nrequested $50 million for K-12 funding for educational technology \nthere.\n  The House has cut that request from $50 to $25 million. The Senate \nAppropriations Committee cuts it down to $15 million. The bill we are \nconsidering here would result in even less funding for educational \ntechnology.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the matter which the Senator from New \nMexico refers to involves the K-12 technology learning challenge, where \nthe request was in at $50 million and the House was at $25 million and \nthe Senate was at $15 million. But the overall education technology, \nESEA, title III, are on the figures I cited where we are funding in \nexcess of last year, more than twice the funding recommended by the \nHouse.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has been yielded 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from \nMassachusetts.\n  I feel a little uncomfortable out here in debate with the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania because I think he cares fiercely about these \nprograms, and I certainly do not think he represents the full \npriorities of some of those in the House who have sort of been the \nimpetus for these programs. But let me just say, processwise, I view \nthis as slash and burn on the installment plan. I think that is really \nwhat is going on here, and I think it is a backdoor way of making some \nfairly deep cuts in educational programs. I do not think that reflects \nthe priorities of the people in the country. \n\n[[Page S409]]\n\n  Altogether, on present course, this continuing resolution for the \nwhole fiscal year would cut education by $3.1 billion. The Senator from \nMassachusetts mentioned this earlier, but I think it is worth \nrepeating. Title I reading and math programs are cut by $1.1 billion, \nmeaning that over 1 million children will lose services and 31,500 \nteachers could be laid off.\n  The first argument we made was that, really, we cannot restore this \nfunding for education and children because, if we do it, then that \nwould mean less for low-income energy assistance or that would mean \nless for other very important programs. But that is not the tradeoff. \nWe do not have to do the $245 billion of tax cuts. We do not have to \nhave $7 billion in the Defense bill over what the Pentagon wanted. We \ndo not have to go forward with B-2 bombers to the tune of $2 billion \neach. That is not the real national security of this country. The real \nnational security is when we invest in the health and skills and \nintellect and character of our children.\n  Mr. President, then the second argument, all of a sudden, as we were \ngoing through this debate, was a different one than I heard, which was \nOK. But the problem is that if this should pass, then the House will \nnot accept it and we would have a Government shutdown.\n  What that means to me, as I hear this argument, is that the House of \nRepresentatives, because, in fact, we decided to invest $3 billion more \non the projected, year-wise, because we decided over this next critical \nperiod of time to invest more money in safe and drug-free schools, in \nsupport for children with special needs, in making sure that higher \neducation was accessible for our young and not so young students--many \nof our students in higher education have gone back to school. Men and \nwomen, some having lost their jobs, are going back for additional \neducation so they can be independent. What I am hearing is that, if we \nshould restore funding for this investment in people in our country, \nthe House of Representatives would find that so unconscionable that \nthey would then shut the Government down. I mean, what kind of \npriorities are we talking about here in this Congress? Certainly it is \nnot the priorities of people in this country.\n  Mr. President, I am also concerned just thinking about my own State. \nI will not even talk about this numberwise. I will talk about it \npeoplewise. I am hearing from higher education people, from some of our \ncolleges and universities, and they do not really know what the \nsituation is with low-interest loans or Pell grant programs. Students \nneed that assistance.\n  By the way, Mr. President, I will tell you that in the State of \nMinnesota, many undergraduates are now taking 6 years because they are \nworking two and three minimum-wage jobs. I mean, students sell plasma \nat the beginning of the semester in order to buy textbooks. These are \nstudents who need this financial assistance. They do not know what the \nsituation is.\n  Mr. President, school boards do not know what the situation is. They \nare trying to figure out what is going to happen with this title I \nmoney. These are kids with special needs, kids with special problems. \nAre we going to walk away from them? Are we going to provide fewer \nservices? Is it going to be made up through higher property taxes? \nNobody knows.\n  I hear people from our school boards, whether they are Democrats or \nRepublicans or Independents alike, saying to me, ``Senator, what in the \nworld is going on? This is the last place we should be making these \ncuts.''\n  Mr. President, I mean, from Head Start, which is not a part of this \namendment--but we now have proposed reductions in Head Start programs, \nwhich is nothing more than an effort to give some children who need a \nhead start a head start all the way to higher education, all the way to \nkids with special needs and vocational education and safe and drug-free \nschools. These are distorted priorities. So today we are taking on \nthose distorted priorities. We are not going to let this be slash and \nburn on the installment plan. We are not going to let this be a back-\ndoor disinvestment in education.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I inquire of the distinguished Senator \nfrom Minnesota. The question is about what happens on the current state \nof the allocations. Again, with much of what he has had to say, I do \nnot disagree in terms of priorities. But if you do not increase the \nallocation to the subcommittee which I chair, which has jurisdiction \nover Health and Human Services, which has funding for LIHEAP as well as \neducation--what happens to the other programs.\n  I ask this of the Senator from Minnesota because he spoke extensively \nand eloquently on this subject. Unless we increase the allocation, \nwhich I would like to do, is it not true that we are going to lose $105 \nmillion in funding for LIHEAP?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the answer is, if we do not increase \nthe allocation--and we must increase the allocation. I do not accept \nthese priorities.\n  What I understand the Senator from Pennsylvania is doing is putting \nsome of us in the position of having to argue for a zero-sum-game \nsituation. We do not believe that there should be these tax cuts to the \ntune of $245 billion. We do not believe in some of these other \npriorities. We believe some tax cut--some of which goes to people who \ndo not need it--you should have enough revenue to make sure people do \nnot go cold in Pennsylvania, or Minnesota, or Massachusetts, and, in \naddition, we do not make cuts in educational opportunities for \nchildren. You are presenting a false choice for the Senator from \nMinnesota and, for that matter, for the people of the country.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Minnesota, because \nhe talks about the tax cuts, does the Senator from Minnesota agree with \nPresident Clinton to cut the tax by $130 billion?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. No, I do not, Mr. President.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, when the Senator from Minnesota talks \nabout choices and says that I am putting him in that position, this \namendment puts the whole subcommittee in that position because if it \npasses and there is no increased allocation, the fact of life is that \neverything in the whole bill with the exception of the Department of \nEducation, Headstart, and school-to-work programs would be cut by 10\\1/\n2\\ percent.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on this point, just before the Senator \nfrom Washington speaks, I would like to yield a minute to the Senator \nfrom Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Pennsylvania is \naware of this, but we have not passed the appropriations bill out of \nthe Senate yet in this area. So there is nothing in concrete yet. The \nCongress has not passed an appropriations bill for education. So there \nis nothing locked in concrete at this particular time.\n  So there is certainly not only time but obviously the ability to \nmodify the figures and not to have to cut back on these other programs. \nIt will take some doing. But you still have to negotiate with the \nHouse. Changes can be made in the whole process on these things right \nnow.\n  It is not the fault of the Senator from Pennsylvania that the Senate \nhas not acted on this, and we have a problem that everybody knows about \nin this area. But there is nothing locked in concrete at this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, reluctant as I am to disagree with my \ndistinguished colleague from Vermont, the Senate is locked into the \nallocation. We are locked into the allocation which has been given to \nthe subcommittee which has jurisdiction over these three Departments.\n  If the amendment by the Senator from Massachusetts passes, there is \nonly so much air in the balloon. If you take it out of one section, we \nare going to lose by 10\\1/2\\ percent over everything else unless the \nallocation is increased.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 16 minutes remaining. \n  \n[[Page S410]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleague from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kennedy, for his leadership on this critical \nissue of making sure that our children across this country have \nadequate funding for the education they so desperately need for the \nworld they are being handed.\n  Recently a poll showed that 92 percent of the American public say \nthat we should fund education at either the same or increased levels \nfor Federal education. Why this continuing resolution speaks only about \n8 percent of the population makes no sense to me.\n  But before I address that, let me also express my frustration and my \nincreasing anger at this Congress and the way it is governing this \ncountry today by passing continuing resolutions for 30 days, 25 days, \n45 days, and on and on. What we are doing to this country is wrong. We \nhave the responsibility to govern in a way that gives security to \neveryone that we represent and give the ability to people out there \nacross this country who serve our constituents' needs the security they \nhave to put in place their ability to make sure that their programs \nwork effectively. And we are really undermining that effort today.\n  I speak to you as a former school board member who knows well what \nthe impacts of these 35- and 45-day continuing resolutions are and this \n$3.1 billion reduction in funding. What it means to those poor school \nboard members is that in a few short weeks, they are going to be facing \nangry parents across this country telling them that their class size \nwill be reduced, that they will have to let teachers go, that textbooks \nwill not be available, that security guards will not be in their \nschools next year because they simply do not know what this Government \nis going to do for them in the coming year. That is not right.\n  Every Member should know that the real answer here is, we are asked \nto pass a budget. The numbers are on the table. There are budgets that \nbalance the budget by the year 2002. That is what we should be doing \ninstead of these continuing resolutions.\n  Mr. President, as we do this, every one of us is going to have to go \nhome and face our constituents. I assure all of my colleagues they will \nmeet a young woman like I met just a few short weeks ago in a grocery \nstore who looked at me and told me she is trying to go to college next \nyear, and the only way she will be able to go is if she has a student \nloan or a grant or gets Federal help. Yet the college she is applying \nto told her they cannot tell her what is going to happen because they \ndo not know what we are going to do.\n  That is not fair to that young girl, it is not fair to her family, \nand it is certainly not right for the future of this country.\n  Mr. President, my colleagues have done a good job of outlining how \nimportant this education amendment is, but let me make it even more \nclear for you. For the State of Washington, we will lose $24 million. \nThat is about $24 or $25 per student in my State. That translates to a \ntextbook. That translates to a few less hours with a teacher. That \ntranslates to actually losing real dollars for every one of our kids. \nYes, it speaks to specific programs but school boards are going to have \nto go back into their budgets and transfer dollars around in order to \nmake up the funding that we are taking away. And every single one of \nour children in this country is going to lose.\n  It seems crazy to me that we are going to sacrifice our children and \nAmerica's future for the sake of political ego. We have the good \nfortune in this country of changing political leadership every few \nyears in our democracy, but we do not have the fortune of reversing an \nuneducated and unprepared generation. For our kids, for our future, for \nthis country's ability to compete in the worldwide technological \nsociety that we have today, let us support this resolution. Let us send \na message to our kids that we do care about them, we understand their \nneeds, and we are not going to neglect them in this Nation's Capital.\n  Just last week, headlines across America rang out. Education is our \ntop priority. Polls throughout our Nation strongly show that Americans \nsupport an investment in education; 92 percent would like the same or \nincreased levels of Federal funding for education.\n  Apparently some of my colleagues are listening to that 8 percent of \nour population. They are forcing upon the American people a continuing \nresolution that would cut $3.1 billion from education through this \nyear. This would be coupled with the $600 million in rescissions in \neducation already enacted for fiscal year 1995.\n  This would represent the largest setback to education in the history \nof the United States. Why? It is very easy to target a group that has \nno vote, no political action committee, no lobbying dollars to create a \npolitical voice--our children. These are the same kids who are already \ngiving up. They are faced with overcrowded classrooms, outdated \ntextbooks, and frustrated teachers. They lack purpose knowing they \ncannot afford or gain entrance to an institution of higher education \nand wonder if the skills they learn today will ever lead to a job \ntomorrow.\n  Certainly, throwing money at a problem is not the answer. But \neliminating programs that have been proven to provide long-term \neducational skills and enhance school-to-work training are essential to \nour society. Last week in hearings before a joint House-Senate \ncommittee, we heard from Dr. Milton Goldberg who emphasized that the \nneed for skilled labor from the business community has never been \ngreater. NYNEX recently interviewed 60,000 applicants to fill 3,000 \njobs and Motorola found less than 10 percent of job applicants are \nqualified for their entry level jobs.\n  Yet, the existing continuing resolution would deny millions of \nAmerica's children and young adults valuable educational opportunities. \nAlready, a third of the fiscal year has elapsed with no funding levels \nfor education and school districts are facing an 18-percent increase in \nenrollments over the next decade.\n  These cuts would deny 1.1 million students crucial help in reading, \nwriting, math, and advanced reasoning; 100,000 would lose English \nassistance and hundreds of thousands more would be denied vocational \ntraining; 14,000 school districts would have to cut back their safe and \ndrug-free school programs and many would jeopardize their disabled \neducation programs.\n  We will continue to debate the role of our Federal Government in the \neducation process. Michael DiRaimo of the Pittsburgh public schools \ntold us last week, however, that though Federal funds account for a \nsmall portion of the district's budget, the services provided with \nthose funds are vital to the district's ability to serve needy and at-\nrisk children.\n  My own State of Washington will lose over $24 million for education \nunder this continuing resolution. Washington State has been a national \nleader in the school-to-work field and will lose $3 million in \nvocational education dollars because we are unable to reach agreement \non the budget. Additionally, the State will lose $16 million in title I \nfunds that greatly aid our classrooms in basic educational skills.\n  At the very least, we cannot cut education programs beyond fiscal \nyear 1995 levels. Let us not sacrifice our children and America's \nfuture for the sake of political ego. We have the fortune of changing \npolitical leadership every few years in this democracy. We do not have \nthe fortune of reversing an uneducated and unprepared generation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 3 minutes to my friend and colleague from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has been \nyielded 3 minutes. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, first of all, I congratulate and thank my \nsenior colleague from Massachusetts for his leadership and for his \neffort, a very important effort to bring before the Senate the real \nchoices that are facing our country.\n  I listened to my friend from Pennsylvania and while, indeed, we must \ncontend with some so-called caps, funding levels that have been \nallocated among the Appropriations subcommittees, et cetera, everybody \nhere knows that we are engaged in tough bargaining right now and that \nnone of those \n\n[[Page S411]]\ncaps is set in concrete--because if we were to resolve this budget \ncrisis, we could make any number of changes in the budget. We could \ndecide that we were going to find some more revenue and use it to fund \nservices critical to our nation's future. We could remove the firewall \nthat protects funding for the Defense Department and take some of the \n$7 billion that the Congress added to the budget request of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff and instead put it into education or another priority \nof the American people.\n  So let us not fool the American people. These choices are in our \nhands. We are not helpless here. We are not powerless. If we believe \nsomething is sufficiently important to this Nation's people and future, \nwe can make it happen. Everybody understands that what we are doing now \nis drawing dramatic lines between one group's set of priorities and \nothers' priorities.\n  I do not understand how my colleagues in the Senate can ignore every \nsingle analysis from the best educators in our country, the best \nscientists in our country, the best child psychologists in our country, \nthe best criminologists in our country, all of whom say that we have to \nfind a way to impart to our children the high skills they need to \ncompete for jobs here, and to permit our industries to compete \nglobally. This is absolutely essential if we are to create and fill \nhigh value-added jobs that will raise the incomes of the American \npeople. Analysts agree that last year, if you were a graduate degree \nholder in America, you lost income by 1 percent. If you were a high \nschool graduate, you lost income by about 15 percent. And if you were a \nhigh school dropout, you lost income by about 27 percent.\n  Each of those categories, in addition to experiencing significantly \ndifferent income change, experiences significantly different health \ncare coverage--as a reliable rule, the workers with the lowest \neducational levels have the least health care coverage. In this way, \nthe success of our educational system has a profound social effect that \nextends well beyond the job market and personal finances. Failure of \nour educational system contributes directly to our nation's health care \ncrisis.\n  Those are the choices, and here we are in the Congress being told we \nhave to accept a continuing resolution that accepts and perpetuates a \ncontinuing process of diminishing all of these opportunities for our \ncitizens.\n  It is fundamental; Pell grants cut by 40 percent in the budget. Why? \nWhy do we want to make it harder for people to get the higher education \nthat is the gateway to good jobs? Why is it that we are going to reduce \nthe capacity of our kids in the most hard hit, economically depressed \nareas of our country where there is the least property tax base from \nwhich to draw in order to support the school system? Why would we want \nless Federal assistance that is provided in an effort to minimize that \ninequity according to a national standard, and thereby attempt to make \nreal the commitment of equal opportunity?\n  The Federal Government does not run the schools. We do not tell them \nwhat they have to do. We do not intrude on local control. We are simply \nholding out this enormous carrot and saying: Look, if you will raise \nyour standards, if you will teach better, if you will make these \nimprovements, we will offer to pay some of the costs in order to help \nyou put your kids in a higher education status.\n  Eliminating this assistance and the incentives it provides is just \nincomprehensible. We must face this directly, and add these funds for \neducation programs--recognizing the fact we then must come back and \nadjust budget allocations in order to prevent other vital services from \nbeing inadvertently reduced as a result.\n  Funding for badly-needed services offered by the Departments of Labor \nand Health and Human Services must not be further reduced as a result \nof this amendment. Indeed, there is a crying need to increase funding \nfor a number of these other key services as well.\n  The amendment before us will increase Federal spending through the \nexpiration date of this resolution--March 15--for a handful of \neducation programs, in order to enable schools and colleges to plan for \nthe year ahead and not find themselves forced to cancel vital services \nand programs for their students. This is something we must do. But \nbefore this resolution expires, we must act to restore the amount of \nthis amendment that technically will be deducted from other services \nfunded by the Labor/HHS/Education appropriations bill--for example, to \nensure sufficient resources for training adult workers, retraining \ndislocated workers, and assuring summer jobs for at least 600,000 \neconomically disadvantaged young people who otherwise will be tempted \nto spend their summertime in pursuits that may jeopardize their lives \nor their futures as well as the health and safety of other Americans. \nThe House-passed appropriations bill will deprive Boston alone of $2.3 \nmillion for summer youth jobs, and will deprive all of Massachusetts of \nnearly 11,000 summer jobs.\n  We also must restore funds for helping dislocated workers which are \nslashed by 30 percent in the House Republicans' appropriations bill. \nThis program is extremely important in Massachusetts in helping laid-\noff workers--most recently, 448 workers from Raytheon Corporation and \n2,400 workers who lost their jobs as a result of the tragic Christmas \nfire in Methuen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KERRY. I urge my colleagues to vote with the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts to provide this minimal but vital increase in funds for \neducation.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, when the Senator from Massachusetts, \nSenator Kennedy, denigrates my arguments, I have to respond. When he \nsays, ``Let us not fool the American people,'' I would suggest that his \narguments and this amendment do precisely that, and the reason they do \nit is because this amendment proposes to reinstate funding to the 1995 \nlevel, makes that representation, but in fact it does not do it. It \ndoes not do it because it lasts for only 49 days, and because almost \nall of the expenditures in an appropriations process do not take effect \nuntil July 1.\n  When you talk about the expectations of the educators as to what they \nare going to do and representations made about how many teachers will \nbe laid off, they are not going to derive any solace from this \namendment. What this amendment really is, is a grand show to say that \nthere are many people who are arguing for it who think education ought \nto have a higher funding level. That is something that I agree with. \nAnd that when the Senate was allocated $1.6 billion more with my \nleadership and the leadership of Senator Harkin, that was all put into \neducation.\n  To personalize it for just a minute, I have expressed repeatedly, on \nthis floor and off, my support for education. And on the personal \nlevel, neither of my parents had any education to speak of. My father \ncame to this country as an immigrant, had no formal education. My \nmother came at the age of 5, went to the eighth grade, and my brother \nand my two sisters and I have been able to share in the American dream \nbecause of our educational opportunities.\n  I do not take second place to either Senator from Massachusetts on my \ndevotion to educational funding or to anybody else who has argued in \nfavor of it. If they seek to gain momentum, I think they are \ncounterproductive here. They are going to lose votes on this amendment. \nIf you want to say how many Senators support an increase in funding for \neducation, you are not going to be able to tell it when this vote is \ntaken. I know the distinguished Senator from Oregon, the chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee, is going to vote against it. He has told \nme so. I am going to vote against it because of what it does, if it \nstands, it is going to take tremendous sums of money from many, many \nother programs which everybody who has spoken in favor of the amendment \nwould hate to see happen. This is an exercise in futility and an \nexercise in counterproductivity. So that when you say, ``Let us not \nfool the American people,'' let us identify who is trying to fool the \nAmerican people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nConnecticut. \n\n[[Page S412]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is yielded how \nmuch time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Four minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Let me begin by thanking our colleague from Massachusetts as well as \nmy colleague from Maine, Senator Snowe, and our colleague from Vermont, \nSenator Jeffords, Senator Simon of Illinois, and others, who have been \nthe prime movers of this amendment. I commend them for it.\n  My colleague from Pennsylvania suggests this amendment is meaningless \nand that everybody is for increases in education. Well, if that is the \ncase, this amendment ought to be adopted by voice vote. But instead \nwhat we are doing here with this CR is nibbling and nibbling away at \neducation. So in 49 days when we come back to another continuing \nresolution this becomes the floor for the next continuing resolution.\n  We have viewed continuing resolutions as a procedure used to delay \nany final action until a broader solution could be reached on spending \nmatters. That is how they have been used historically.\n  This year we are seeing a whole new use of the continuing resolution. \nIt is now becoming a vehicle by which we make policy decisions on a \npiecemeal basis. Even though there is broad agreement at the leadership \nlevel of each of our parties to protect education from cuts, these \ncontinuing resolutions are cutting education. That is what this effort \nis, despite the fact that 75 to 80 percent of the American public have \ntold us from one end of this country to the other, we want you to \nbalance this budget, we want you to do it in 7 years; and, we also hope \nyou understand that we need to grow in this country.\n  Our economic growth levels are too low. If we are going to grow as a \nNation in the next 7 to 10 years, one of the critical ingredients is \ngoing to be education. My colleague from Pennsylvania talks about the \nstatus of his parents and the difficulty as immigrants coming to this \ncountry. His story is an ennobling one, and one that could be told by \nmillions of American families.\n  The problem in the fall of 1996 is that opportunity will be limited \nfor millions of American students. In higher education, where an awful \nlot of institutions now have tuitions of $20,000 a year and more, \nfinancial aid is more important than ever. Even public institutions \ncost thousands of dollars. And yet, institutions are telling us, ``We \ncannot plan. We cannot process applications for student aid or student \nloans because you in Washington can't get your act together. We don't \nknow what you are going to do on Pell grants or work study. We don't \nknow what you are going to do on student loans.'' And each of these \ninstitutions represents hundreds or thousands of students who do not \nknow how they are going to pay for college next year, because of our \ndelay.\n  I mention higher education. It is also true at the elementary and \nsecondary level. School boards all across America are looking to this \ndebate today and saying, ``What message are you sending us? How do we \nplan for the next school year? What do we tell our teachers, aides and \nworkers on contract? What do we do to our local tax base?''\n  We should not be going through this process here. It is one thing to \nhold Federal workers hostage to our inaction. Now we are holding \nmiddle-class, working families and their children hostage because we \ncannot get our work done. This is an abuse of our privilege here.\n  We want to send a different message today with this amendment. \nInstead of cuts, we should be talking in terms of restoring education \nfunding levels to at least the 1995 levels. We do have to deal with the \nlarger budget question for the next 7 years and education must be a \npart of this. But cutting education for the next 49-days sends all the \nwrong signals on certainty of funding.\n  Washington has got to grow up. We have to learn how to get our \nbusiness done. Education is no area in which to play games. It is too \ncritically important for the well-being of this Nation and for families \nwho are planning for the education of their children.\n  So, Mr. President, I sincerely hope that on this one issue, despite \nwhat other differences we have in other areas--because my colleague \nfrom Pennsylvania has said over and over again it is not in debate \nwhether or not we ought to be doing in education--let us send the other \nbody the signal this afternoon that we agree with our colleague from \nPennsylvania and that we are going to take education off the table \nhere, not for these 49 days, but also down the road. We can send that \nmessage by voting for the amendment offered by the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time remains, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 4 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. On the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The other side has 20 minutes 41 seconds \nremaining.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Generally, Mr. President, the proponents of amendments \nget a chance to make the final comment. I do not know what the desire \nof the opponents would be. I would yield myself, Mr. President, 3 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, sometime around Thanksgiving, when there \nwere negotiations about continuing resolutions, the Republican \nleadership and the President of the United States agreed to work out a \nprocess that would put the budget in balance over 7 years using CBO \nnumbers but also protect education. It included the environment, \nMedicare, and Medicaid, and protected education. That was agreed to. \nThat was after the assignment of these numbers that are constantly \nreferred to here on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  One has to ask, as we are considering this amendment, how in the \nworld are we going to protect education, which Republicans and \nDemocrats and the President agreed to, if we are going to cut the funds \nthat were implemented just last year? The school population is \nexpanding by 10 percent, rising to over 50 million students. We need \nnew technologies and computers in the schools. We are asking our \nschools in this country to do more and more as they are faced with \ndifferent kinds of challenges, whether it is violence, substance abuse, \nimmigration, use of many languages, or other kinds of challenges, how \ncan we cut education now?\n  All we are saying with this amendment is let us fulfill the promise \nthat was given by Republican and Democratic leaders at that time when \nthey agreed to a balanced budget in 7 years, CBO numbers, but protect \neducation.\n  Mr. President, as these negotiations continue, with the clear \nadmonition by Republicans and the President of the United States to say \nwe are going to protect education, we believe that the only way you are \ngoing to protect it is at least use the same kind of commitment to \neducation programs that were used in 1995. Do not increase it to take \ninto consideration the expansion of the school population, do not \nincrease it to meet the additional kind of challenges in technology, do \nnot increase it to try to raise additional academic standards, which \nare the possibilities, but just keep it to 1995 levels.\n  Mr. President, the logic of the other side that we have to continue \nalong with a continuing resolution that is going to result in a \ndiminution of those funds by some $3.1 billion defies all logic and all \nunderstanding. I hope the Senate will accept this amendment. I reserve \nthe remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania controls 20 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto use some of my leader time to make a statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader has that right.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me commend the distinguished Senator \nfrom Massachusetts for his eloquent remarks and his leadership on this \nissue. This issue obviously is one of great importance to all of us, \nbut it is not the \n\n[[Page S413]]\nonly problem that is created as a result of this continuing resolution. \nThe problem is not just education; the problem is funding for the \nenvironment, the problem is in funding for housing, for parks, for \nreservations, for veterans hospitals. This situation is getting worse \nand worse because we have not been able to pass the appropriations \nbills that directly address the many funding issues that this \ncontinuing resolution does in a very inefficient and unsatisfactory \nway.\n  The 75 percent funding level represents the largest cut in education \nin history, Mr. President. Others stated that, but it bears repeating. \nWe are cutting $3.1 billion out of education this year. There is no \nother time and no other situation that we have ever cut education that \ndeeply. That is what this continuing resolution represents.\n  It means cuts in reading and math programs for the disadvantaged \nstudents in title I. It means deep cuts in technology. It means cuts in \nour efforts to bring about meaningful school reform and the Goals 2000 \nand national education goals that are really a bipartisan effort that \nwe called for all the way back in 1989. It means deep cuts in teacher \ndevelopment and training. It means cuts--in some cases elimination--of \nsafe and drug-free schools.\n  That 25 percent cut in title I, just that alone, means over 1 million \npeople will be deprived of help in reading and math. It means 31,500 of \ntheir teachers will be given pink slips in the near future. Cities \nacross this country are going to be very hard-hit. In Detroit that 25 \npercent reduction means a loss of $16.8 million in their budget this \nyear alone. Ten thousand fewer children will be served; 419 teachers \nwill be laid off.\n  The chairman of the Democratic mayors in this country was kind enough \nto come to the Hill this morning with a very simple question. His \nquestion was: Which 25 percent of my students in Detroit should I not \neducate? Which 25 percent do we tell they can no longer come? Which 25 \npercent are the ones who are going to be detrimentally affected simply \nbecause we have not resolved this problem?\n  In Dallas, Mr. President, public schools must submit a budget by \nMarch 21. They expect an increase of 4,000 students next year, but do \nnot yet even know if Federal funding will meet the demand they know \nthey have.\n\n  In Philadelphia, they could lose $14 million for math and reading \nprograms. Many of our Republican colleagues say that their only agenda \nis to protect our children's future, but I ask, how do we protect our \nfuture, how do we protect their future, if we deprive children of the \nquality education they need to succeed in the future? Siphoning off \nmoney for education consigns America's children to a second-class \nfuture of reduced opportunities.\n  Speaker Gingrich has often talked about the importance of bringing \nstudents and classrooms into the computer age, and I agree with that. \nBut the GOP budget rejects that goal. The President's budget had \nrequested $50 million for technology to do exactly what the Speaker \nsuggests, but the House Appropriations Committee cut it in half, and \nthe Senate proposed to cut that by two-thirds.\n  The problem is not just funding. It is the uncertainty that we are \ncreating in every single school district about the budget that they \nmust endure and the extraordinary decisions that they are going to have \nto make if we have not resolved this matter in the near future.\n  Schools have to submit budgets. They are doing that right now. But \nthey do not know what their funding levels are going to be. The \ncontractual obligations will force districts right now--as they \nconsider the obligations they have and the ramifications of this \nfunding--to send pink slips to teachers across the country.\n  Trinity College just recently indicated that, because of problems \nwith past continuing resolutions, they have been able to provide only \nestimates with regard to financial aid eligibility and that the \nuncertainty about funding and budgeting has complicated the application \nprocess tremendously. This situation has the potential to discourage \nqualified students from applying to college.\n  The Federal Government provides only 7 percent of overall education \nfunding, but those dollars can mean 100 percent of the resources for a \nyoung person who needs help.\n  Mr. President, children learn by example. Let us set an example of \nresponsibility, of foresight. Let us keep our commitment to America's \neducation. Let us keep our commitment to America's children. Let us \nadopt this amendment this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator from \nOklahoma desire?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield me 4 minutes?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first, I compliment my friend and \ncolleague from Pennsylvania for his leadership, and I just want to make \na couple of general comments. I, for one, would like to see us pass the \nLabor, Health and Human Services appropriations bill. We should have \npassed it by the end of September. We did not get it done. We should \nhave passed it by the end of the year. We did not get it done.\n  You might ask, Why didn't you pass an appropriations bill? Because we \nhad something very unusual. As a matter of fact, I have been in the \nSenate now--this is my 16th year. I cannot remember a party holding up \nmoving to considering an appropriations bill for months. That is \nunique. That is historic, and the reason is because the Democrats in \nCongress, in the Senate, did not want us to take up the Labor and \nHealth and Human Services bill. We tried. We even had votes.\n  On September 29, we had a vote on whether or not we would move to \nthis bill, and they said, ``No, we don't want to move to the bill.'' \nThey did not want to move to the bill because there is a provision in \nthere dealing with striker replacement. Somebody said, ``Well, that \nwasn't a germane amendment to this bill.'' It certainly was. It said no \nmoney should be used to enforce the President's Executive order dealing \nwith striker replacement.\n  There is also money in the bill that says no money will be used to \nenforce the President's order dealing with the prevailing wage on \nhelpers. That has been in there for a few years. I wanted it out. I \nmight mention, the helper amendment I wanted out. I had an amendment \nagainst that a couple years ago and I lost. I was willing to accept \ndefeat, and we went ahead and passed the appropriations bill.\n\n  In this case, most people in this body favor keeping this language \nfor striker replacement so that the President would not legislate by \nExecutive order. Some of us feel strongly about that. Legislation \nshould pass through Congress, not by Executive order. The President had \na chance to pass the legislation a year or two ago, and he did not get \nit passed. Now he is trying to do it with Executive order. We are \ntrying to protect the prerogatives of the Congress. Article I, section \n1: Congress shall pass all laws.\n  Because we had that striker replacement provision in, the Democrats \nwould not allow us to take up the bill. It has been several months. So \nwhen I hear my friend and colleague say we are so concerned that \neducation school districts do not know what their budgets are, they \nshould not be looking on this side of the aisle, because we wanted to \npass this bill.\n  I might mention as well, Mr. President, if we pass the Labor and \nHealth and Human Services bill, we have $1.5 billion more in the Senate \nbill than the House. We would come up with higher education figures in \nthe conference if we could get to conference. We cannot even get to \nconference with this bill because, unfortunately, Members on the \nDemocratic side have not allowed us to take up the bill.\n  They will allow us to take up the bill if we do it under unanimous \nconsent and they win on all their issues. That is not the way we should \nlegislate. There are about five fairly contentious issues dealt with in \nthe Labor and Health and Human Services bill--about five. I am willing \nto let the majority vote on all of those and let us find out how the \nSenate votes--let the majority rule--and pass the appropriations bill \nand go to conference and work out the differences with the House and \nthen send the bill to the President. If he vetoes it, then we will have \nto come back. Maybe we will still be under a \n\n[[Page S414]]\ncontinuing resolution, but this is the only bill in the Senate this \nyear we have not been able to pass. I think that is regrettable.\n  The reason we have not been able to pass it, unfortunately, is \nbecause Members on the Democratic side of the aisle have not allowed us \nto proceed to the bill, and that needs to change.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleague for an additional minute.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Agreed.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, we did finally, under this bill, pass the \nforeign operations bill. That was one of the contentious bills. We \nfinally have that resolved. We should pass the Department of the \nInterior bill. That was vetoed by the President. That shut down the \nparks; that shut down the museums. That is unfortunate. It should not \nhave happened. But we have really an agreement on every contentious \nissue to pass the Department of the Interior bill.\n\n  I compliment Senator Gorton for his leadership. We should send that \nto the President. He should sign that bill. There is no reason for that \nbill to still be caught up in some of this controversy.\n  We still have Commerce, State, Justice, VA-HUD, Labor, and Health and \nHuman Services. Labor and Health is the only one that has not passed \nthe Senate, and it has not passed because our friends on the other side \nof the aisle have refused to let us proceed to it. We should proceed to \nit, vote on those amendments in disagreement and send it to the House, \ngo to conference and finish our bill.\n  I yield the floor and thank my colleague and compliment the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania, because he has tried endlessly to bring this bill \nbefore the Senate and have it finally resolved.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The programs included in our amendment are not the only \nones that deserve to be fairly funded. They are not the only programs \nthat will experience damaging effects under the current CR. I am \ncommitted to addressing those other programs at the earliest \nopportunity.\n  I am particularly concerned about programs in the Department of Labor \nthat provide critical protection for the lives, and health and economic \nsecurity of America's workers. The CR makes deep cuts in funding for \nthe agencies that protect workers from being forced to work long hours \nof overtime without adequate compensation. Child labor inspectors will \nbe laid off, and the sweatshop conditions the Labor Department has \nattacked in the garment industry this year will only worsen.\n  The Department's pension protection initiatives will be seriously \ndamaged by these cuts. One out of twelve employees in the pension \nagency could be laid off, leaving hundreds of troubled pension plans \nunaudited. The pension agency recovers $350 million a year as a result \nof its investigations. Thousands of employees will be hurt if plans \nthat have cheated them go undetected because of these budget cuts. The \nDepartment's recent success in prosecuting abuse of 401(k) plans cannot \nbe continued if these cuts are not rescinded.\n  In addition, as a result of these cuts, OSHA will see its budget \nreduced by 16 percent by this bill. Already, we spend less than $3 per \nworker on workplace safety and enforcement. Dangerous workplaces can \nalready go years without an inspection, because there are so few OSHA \ninspectors already. Thousands of workers will be jeopardized by these \ncuts, because hazards that would have been found and corrected go \nundetected. It is not just the inspectors who will be cut, but the \nconsultants who work with employers to improve their safety, as well.\n  We cannot fix everything that is wrong with this budget today. But I \nlook forward to working with others in Congress to see that funding for \nthese critical agencies that protect the lives and pocketbooks of \nAmerican workers is restored.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of my colleagues' \namendment to the continuing funding resolution regarding education \nfunding.\n  The Kennedy, Simon, Jeffords, Snowe amendment will provide that for \nthe duration of this continuing resolution, funding for education \nprograms will not go below the fiscal year 1995 appropriation.\n  Education is a priority among the American people. In 1995, 75 \npercent of Americans said that aid to education should be expanded--not \ncut. In poll after poll, the American people strongly oppose cuts to \neducation programs and youth programs to balance the Federal budget.\n  This continuing resolution funds education programs at the lower of \nthe House or Senate levels, with no program being funded at less than \n75% of the fiscal year 1995 funding levels. With these funding levels, \neducation cuts will exceed $3 billion in the current fiscal year.\n  The Kennedy amendment would restore funding for education programs to \nthe full fiscal year 1995 funding levels for the duration of the \ncontinuing funding resolution.\n  Although the continuing funding resolution extends only through March \n15, it hits school districts and colleges in their peak planning and \nbudgeting cycles for the next school years.\n  If the funding levels in this continuing resolution continue \nthroughout this fiscal year many educational programs will be affected.\n  Title 1 reading and math programs will lose $1.1 billion, which means \nthat over 1 million children will lose services and 31,500 teachers \nwill have to be laid off this year.\n  Goals 2000 will face a $93 million cut, which will jeopardize \ninnovative projects for 8 million students in 9,000 school districts. \nIn my State, that is over a $10 million loss in this fiscal year.\n  Safe and Drug Free Schools will face a $115 million cut, which \nendangers violence and drug-abuse prevention programs in more than \n14,000 school districts. In my State that means over a $12 million \ndollar loss in this fiscal year.\n  Political fights cannot and should not get in the way of important \neducational programs. I urge my colleagues to support the Kennedy \namendment and restore funding for education programs to its full fiscal \nyear 1995 funding level, even if it is only for 45 days--45 days is \nbetter than none.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby Senator Kennedy. This amendment would go a long way toward easing \nfears of educators and parents alike by locking in education at a \nstrong level under this funding measure.\n  Holding education funding hostage during the ongoing budget struggle \nis wrong. In the process of reaching a budget agreement we should not \nleave education programs underfunded and adrift in uncertainty.\n  Absent a miraculous and quick resolution to those issues holding up \nthe Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations \nbill, we should approve funding for education consistent with last \nyear's levels. The Kennedy amendment would do just that.\n  Mr. President, shutting down the Government as a budget bargaining \nploy was the height of fiscal irresponsibility. The piece-meal, short \nterm budget measures are not much better. Although necessary to end or \nprevent further Government shutdowns, the temporary spending bills have \nmeant severe reductions in education resources.\n  Many critical education programs have been cut by 25 percent under \nthe short term spending bills. As a result, school administrators and \nparents are left wondering whether the Congress really is committed to \neducation.\n  The American people know that improving our elementary and secondary \nschools, and increasing access to higher education are sound \ninvestments. Like money spent on our Nation's defense or a safe \nenvironment, resources directed toward educating young people is \nessential to our competitiveness and quality of life in the next \ncentury.\n  We all profess to support our students and communities, but now is \nthe time for action and not just words.\n  As we demand that students stay in school, study harder, and act \nresponsibly, we must fulfill our own responsibilities to children and \ntheir schools by passing a strong education budget.\n  Communities in each of our States are waiting for us to pass annual \nlegislation so that they can make decisions on what to fund and what \nmust be sacrificed. Superintendents and school boards are trying to act \nresponsibly and balance their own budgets for next year, yet their \nhands are tied until the Congress takes decisive action. \n\n[[Page S415]]\n\n  This amendment would assure educators, parents and students that \nCongress is commited to improving education. Such an assurance is long \noverdue.\n  I am pleased to support the Kennedy amendment and I encourage my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, education determines our future--the \nfuture of our children, our States, and our Nation. Without a good \neducation, children in West Virginia cannot fulfill their potential. \nOur country must increase its commitment to education, not pare it \nback, in order to meet the fierce challenges of a highly competitive \nworld and to ensure the long-term security of our citizens.\n  While I recognize the need to enact this next continuing resolution \nto keep the Federal Government open, I am immensely sorry to see that \nthe majority party still persists in cutting education and other \nprograms that are so essential to the families of our States. The $3 \nbillion cut in education programs, implicit in the funding levels of \nthis bill, is exactly what Americans fear.\n  Obviously, the continuing resolution has to pass to avoid a much \nlarger crisis. But this education amendment I am cosponsoring will \nestablish a clear record that some of us believe education should be \ntreated as the priority that it is for children and families, and some \ndo not.\n  Education is a priority for the people of West Virginia and our \ncountry. And it has been a priority for me throughout my career in \npublic service.\n  Because of other, noneducation issues, the full Senate has not had \nits opportunity to vote on education funding this Congress, and \nconsequently this continuing resolution endorses the House-passed \neducation cuts, up to 25 percent. This is too harsh, and it will \ndevastate education funding in counties across my State, potentially \ncausing lay-offs among title 1 teachers.\n  When the House of Representatives passed its appropriations bill that \ncuts education programs so severely, I wrote to West Virginia school \nsuperintendents to ask what would happen in their counties if such cuts \nbecame law. According to the Nicholas County Superintendent:\n\n       . . . a reduction of federal dollars would be hard to \n     overcome. The cuts in Title 1 would mean loss of services to \n     our students in critical programs that would reflect in lower \n     test scores. . .. The increasing cost of equipment and \n     supplies for Vocational Education especially in the area of \n     technology have doubled yearly. Our students desperately need \n     the equipment and supplies to gain the skill necessary for \n     productive and worthwhile lives after graduation. . .. Our \n     country cannot be put in the position of having a second rate \n     educational system as compared to other countries in the \n     world. If our students are not prepared both academically and \n     with the skills necessary to compete in a worldwide job \n     market, our country will fall behind and eventually \n     deteriorate.\n\n  Other superintendents sent similar letters.\n  I completely agree with William Grizzell, the Nicholas County \nSuperintendent, and the other West Virginia educators who wrote to me. \nWe must continue to invest in education for our children and I support \nthe Kennedy amendment for them and for the students who need title 1, \nSafe and Drug-Free Schools programs, vocational education, and other \neffective education programs.\n  Opponents of the Kennedy amendment claim that this amendment will \nhurt other programs within the Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill. \nThey say that it will impose harsher cuts on the National Institute of \nHealth and other meritorious programs. Such an argument is a smoke-\nscreen. This argument assumes that Congress and the President will \nultimately accept the spending levels approved by the House of \nRepresentatives in August 1995. Since then, the President and \ncongressional leaders have already acknowledged that funding should be \nincreased in the key areas. We should not accept the argument of \nopponents and allow a short-term, 7 week spending bill dominate--and \ndevastate--education funding for an entire year.\n  We should not kid ourselves and pretend that we are ``helping our \nchildren in the future'' with a Federal budget that cripples education \nand program cuts that limit educational opportunities for children from \nHead Start through college. It is simply wrong. We should not accept \nsuch harsh cuts in education programs and risk our children's future. I \nam sorry to see the majority party pushing a continuing resolution that \ntreats education and children so poorly. This is a big mistake, and I \nsupport this amendment to make it clear that some of us really stand by \nour words about the importance of educating every child to his and her \npotential.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote to waive the \nbudget act to increase funds for education. I certainly agree with the \ngoal of the amendment. Federal programs such as Impact Aid and title I \nare important to South Dakota schools and students across the country. \nHowever, although this amendment looks favorable at first glance, \nfurther study reveals two significant problems.\n  First, in order to pay for the amendment, other vital programs would \nbe cut. The National Institutes of Health, elderly nutrition programs, \nMaternal and Child Health block grants, and job training programs would \nbe reduced beyond the levels outlined in the continuing resolution. \nThis amendment simply would rob Peter to pay Paul.\n  Second, this amendment would risk another Government shutdown by \nsending the bill back to the House of Representatives. The previous \ncontinuing resolution expires at midnight tonight, and any delays in \nsending this bill to the White House could cause a shutdown. Good \nprogress has been made in budget talks this week. We must continue to \nmove forward to a balanced budget. We cannot afford to slide backward \nto gridlock.\n  Let me emphasize, the funding levels for education are temporary, \nuntil March 15 of this year. I will continue working to ensure that \nvital education programs receive sufficient funds for the remainder of \nthe fiscal year. In fact, the Senate should consider the Labor, HHS, \nand Education appropriations bill, I intend to offer an amendment to \nincrease funding for the Impact Aid Program. I hope to offer this \namendment in the near future.\n  In the meantime, we must pursue the goal of a balanced budget without \nwavering. The greatest single threat to education and a bright future \nfor younger generations is runaway Federal spending. If we do not act, \nyoung people will be saddled with a much greater burden--the burgeoning \n$4.8 trillion debt. Without balanced budgets, interest on the Federal \ndebt will continue to skyrocket, eventually squeezing out funding for \nlegitimate programs such as title I or school lunches. The most \nimportant step the Federal Government can take to improve the \nopportunities for young people is to control Federal spending and \neliminate the deficit. I look forward to working with my colleagues to \nthis end.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). The Chair recognizes the \nSenator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's side has 16 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I will be in a position to yield back \ntime after a brief statement. The Senator from Massachusetts has \nclaimed the prerogative of the last argument. I do not know that he is \nentitled to it, but I will let him have the last minute.\n  The essence of this matter is that the Senator from Massachusetts has \noffered an amendment to restore funding in education to the 1995 level, \nand that is a proposition that I agree with on the merits. I chair the \nsubcommittee which has jurisdiction over the Departments of Labor, \nHealth and Human Services, and Education. When the subcommittee \nreceived an allocation which was $1.534 billion more than the House, \nall of that money was put into education, with the leadership of the \ndistinguished ranking member, Senator Harkin, and myself.\n  While I agree that we ought to have more money in education, I must \noppose this amendment. If the allocation stays as it is, and no \nadditional money is added to the subcommittee allocation by an \nagreement reached between the President and the leadership in the \nCongress, then there will be a 10.5 percent cut on many, many very, \nvery important programs. These programs included the National \nInstitutes of Health, employment and training and older workers' jobs \nprograms, Social Security Administration, nutrition and \n\n[[Page S416]]\nother programs for the elderly, LIHEAP fuel assistance, community and \nmigrant health centers, Ryan White on AIDS, maternal and child health \nsubstance abuse, railroad retirement benefits and many, many others.\n  Now, that is simply an intolerable situation. What the Senator from \nMassachusetts may be intending to do here is to get momentum to have \nmore money in education. I have already suggested that I believe that \nis counterproductive because I would favor that as a matter of \nprinciple, but cannot support this amendment. There are other Senators \nI know who would also favor it as a matter of principle. So if you take \na look at the number of Senators who are going to vote in favor of this \namendment, it is not going to be representative of those who would like \nto have more funding in education.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield to Senator Nickles.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask my colleague from Pennsylvania, is it not correct \nthat the House has finished their business, and if we amend this, we \njeopardize--or have the possibility of having another Government \nshutdown because of this amendment?\n  Mr. SPECTER. That is correct. That argument was made earlier. It led \nto the counterargument of should we have to defer because the House is \nnot in session? I am somewhat unwilling to base action on the House not \nbeing in session. But the Senator from Oklahoma is correct that the \nHouse is not in session and that the practical reality would be that \nthere would be no continuing resolution. I had said earlier to the \nSenator from Illinois that, as much as the funding is in jeopardy in \nIllinois and Pennsylvania and Oklahoma, it would be more so if we shut \ndown the Government.\n  I have relied principally on the substantive arguments that this \namendment simply takes too much away from Peter to pay Paul, and that \nthe resolution is going to have to come with the subcommittee bill and \nwith the reallocation of funds. I think there will be more funds, Mr. \nPresident. There have been signals given that there will be an \nadditional $5 billion on a number of programs, which will have to be \nshared with the Environmental Protection Agency and the Veterans \nAdministration. But I expect a significant amount of money to be added \nas a result of the negotiations to the subcommittee which has \njurisdiction over education.\n  That concludes my argument. I will allow my colleague from \nMassachusetts to take his last minute, and then I will seek to regain \nthe floor before formally yielding the remainder of the time before \nmaking a point of order under section 311 of the Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in response to Senator Nickles, the House \nis in session for a pro forma, or whatever, and it can be ratified by \nthe House later this afternoon.\n  The Republicans will raise a point of order. The point of order is \nbased on section 311 of the Budget Act, which requires that levels of \nall spending should not exceed the totals in the budget reconciliation \nfor the whole year. By that standard, we are already over the 1996 \nallocation because there is no budget reconciliation bill enacted at \nthis point. So by the majority's reasoning, the two underlying \ncontinuing resolutions and previous continuing resolution, as well, \nalso would violate the Budget Act, and a point of order could have been \nraised against them, as well, which shows the double standard applied \nto this education amendment.\n  Mr. President, with this amendment, we are taking the commitment of \nthe President and the Republican leadership in the House and Senate \nthat says we are going to protect education, and we are going to insist \nthat that be the case by, at least, assuring the 1995 levels for the \nnext 49 days so that the budget can be worked out between the President \nand the Congress and enacted--and protect education. This provides the \nbasis for that program.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I do not believe I have yielded back my \ntime yet. I intend to do so, but first I wish to say that the current \nlevel of budget authority and outlays exceed the aggregate levels set \nforth in the budget resolution for fiscal year 1996. The pending \namendment provides additional new budget authority and will result in \nadditional outlays in that year and its adoption will cause the \naggregate levels of budget authority and outlays to be further \nexceeded. I, therefore, raise a point of other under section 311 of the \nBudget Act against this amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of that act for the consideration of the pending amendment and \nthe underlying bill.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I send a resolution to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The resolution will be stated.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 213) commending Senator Sam Nunn for \n     casting 10,000 votes.\n\n                              S. Res. 213\n\n       Whereas, the Honorable Sam Nunn has served with distinction \n     and commitment as a \n\n[[Page S417]]\n     U.S. Senator from the State of Georgia since January 1973;\n       Whereas, his dedicated service as a U.S. Senator has \n     contributed to the effectiveness and betterment of this \n     institution;\n       Whereas, he has dutifully and faithfully served the Senate \n     as chairman of the Armed Services Committee (1987-1994);\n       Whereas, his expertise and leadership in defense and \n     military policies has been of tremendous benefit to our \n     Nation and to our men and women in uniform;\n       Resolved, That the U.S. Senate congratulates the Honorable \n     Sam Nunn, the senior Senator from Georgia, for becoming the \n     17th U.S. Senator in history to cast 10,000 votes.\n       Sec 2. The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy of \n     this resolution to Senator Sam Nunn.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it was on January 23, 1973, that a young, \nnewly elected, freshman Senator from Georgia cast his first vote in \nthis chamber--a vote to confirm a nominee to be Assistant Secretary of \nDefense.\n  Today, 9,999 votes later, that Senator has become the Senate's \nleading authority on defense policies.\n  Mr. President, it is with great pride and pleasure that I announce \nthat Senator Sam Nunn has just become the 17th Senator in U.S. history \nto cast 10,000 votes. I am pleased to congratulate him for this \nremarkable achievement and thank him for his service to this \ninstitution and our country.\n  In his leadership role on defense policies, Senator Nunn is following \nin the footsteps of two other great legislators from the State of \nGeorgia.\n  Representative Carl Vinson, who happened to be Senator Nunn's great \nuncle, chaired the House Armed Services Committee. Senator Richard \nRussell, who held for 38 years the Senate seat that Senator Nunn now \nholds, chaired the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  Senator Nunn served as chairman of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee from 1987 to 1994, and is currently the ranking Democrat on \nthe committee.\n  He has introduced or cosponsored the most important legislation \nconcerning military and defense issues of the past two decades, \nincluding defense reorganization, measures to reduce the threat of \nnuclear war, Pentagon procurement reform, base closing, and \nrestructuring of military pay and benefits.\n  He has earned the respect of both Republican and Democratic Senators \nthrough his efforts to ensure the integrity and mission of our military \nestablishment in the face of massive budget cutting. Thanks to his \nefforts, while we now have a leaner military, it is a more cost-\neffective military, rather than a weaker one.\n  Senator Nunn's expertise in military and defense policy has been \nrecognized and appreciated far beyond Capitol Hill. Every \nadministration since the Carter administration has consulted him on \nmilitary matters. And each of those administrations has considered him \nfor a top level position in the administration. We in the Senate are \nextremely fortunate that Senator Nunn has chosen to serve here.\n  Most importantly, his expertise and leadership has been recognized by \nthe people of Georgia. In 1984, they re-elected him with 80 percent of \nthe vote--defeating his opponent by a 4 to 1 margin. That was exceeded \nin 1990, when Senator Nunn was unopposed in both the State's primary \nand the general election for U.S. Senator.\n  Still, I would like to point out that Senator Nunn's career has not \nbeen confined to or consumed by military and defense issues. In the \nSenate, he has played monumental roles in laying the groundwork for \nnational service legislation, on deficit reduction, and on efforts to \nredirect our national economic and tax policies.\n  Put simply, Senator Nunn has been a leading figure in American \ngovernment. The Senate's foremost historian, Senator Robert C. Byrd, \nhas appropriately remarked that Senator Nunn is one of those rare and \nextraordinary Senators ``who would have been recognized as [a] great \nsenator in any age * * * in any period during the [past] 200 years'' of \nthe Republic.\n  Indeed, he would, and how pleased and honored I am to have the \nopportunity to recognize and congratulate our Senator, Senator Sam \nNunn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the resolution and preamble \nare agreed to.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 213) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n       Whereas, the Honorable Sam Nunn has served with distinction \n     and commitment as a U.S. Senator from the State of Georgia \n     since January 1973;\n       Whereas, his dedicated service as a U.S. Senator has \n     contributed to the effectiveness and betterment of this \n     institution;\n       Whereas, he has dutifully and faithfully served the Senate \n     as Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, (1987-1994);\n       Whereas, his expertise and leadership in defense and \n     military policies has been of tremendous benefit to our \n     nation and to our men and women in uniform,\n       Resolved, That the U.S. Senate congratulates the Honorable \n     Sam Nunn, the senior Senator from Georgia, for becoming the \n     17th U.S. Senator in history to cast 10,000 votes.\n       Sec. 2. The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy \n     of this resolution to Senator Sam Nunn.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as a Senator who has witnessed the services \nthat have been rendered to our country by this very remarkable American \nand extraordinarily remarkable Senator, I wish to add just a few words \nabout Samuel Augustus Nunn.\n  He is the second individual who has served in the Congress by the \nname of Nunn. The first was David Alexander Nunn, who served from the \nState of Tennessee, elected to the House of Representatives in 1867, \nserved for 2 years, and then was not reelected, but in 1873, was \nelected to a second term.\n  I was looking over these names last night, and something struck me \nabout them in particular. There is David Alexander Nunn. David, as we \nall know, is a Biblical name. Alexander, as we all know, was a great \nmilitary general and ruler. And Nunn is a Biblical name. It is spelled \nN-u-n in the Bible. And often I have asked Sam, facetiously, if he \nnamed one of his sons Joshua. We are told that Joshua was the son of \nNun.\n  And then I noted Sam's name--Samuel, again a Biblical name, who \nanswered God's call. He said, ``Here am I. Send me.''\n  And I saw this Senator who said in response to the needs of the \npeople of Georgia, ``Here am I. Send me.'' ``Speak, Lord, thy servant \nheareth.''\n  And then his middle name is, as I indicated, Augustus. I do not know \nhow many of you knew that. But Augustus was the first Roman emperor. He \ndefeated Cleopatra and Anthony at the Battle of Actium in 31 B.C. on \nSeptember 2, the same birth month as Sam's. Sam was born September 8th, \nnot that long ago, but in 1938. But he was born in September, the same \nmonth that this great battle was fought in 31 B.C.--it has been called \none of the decisive battles of the world. The Emperor Augustus was one \nof the great administrative geniuses of all time.\n\n  So I think of Sam Nunn as someone who has demonstrated a great genius \nin his work in this body. He has demonstrated that work as chairman of \nthe committees. He has been a remarkable chairman. And he has been a \nremarkable Senator.\n  He will be leaving us after this year, and I will have more to say \nabout that later. But today, I could not constrain myself. I had to say \nsomething by way of tribute to this fine Senator. I watched him come \nhere. I have watched him grow. I served in the House of Representatives \nwith his granduncle, Carl Vinson, who lived to be 97. He was in his \n98th year when he died. He was chairman of the Armed Services Committee \nof the House of Representatives when I was in the House.\n  So this has been a long line of famous Georgians who have been great \nchairmen, who have rendered great services in the field of national \ndefense--Carl Vinson, Senator Richard Russell, and now Senator Sam \nNunn.\n  I close with the words of a poet, if I can remember them, which I \nthink are appropriate at this moment.\n\n     It isn't enough to say in our hearts\n     That we like a man for his ways;\n     It isn't enough that we fill our minds\n     With psalms of silent praise;\n     Nor is it enough that we honor a man\n     As our confidence upward mounts;\n     It's going right up to the man himself\n     And telling him so that counts.\n\n     If a man does a work that you really admire,\n     Don't leave a kind word unsaid.\n     In fear to do so might make him vain\n     And cause him to lose his head.\n     But reach out your hand and tell him, ``Well done.'' \n     \n[[Page S418]]\n\n     And see how his gratitude swells.\n     It isn't the flowers we strew on the grave,\n     It's the word to the living that tells.\n\n  I will break the Senate rules in this instance by addressing another \nSenator in the second person. Congratulations to you, Sam Nunn. We will \nlong wait to see someone who can fill your shoes as you have filled the \nshoes of that great patriarch, Richard Brevard Russell. \nCongratulations!\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, Sam Nunn is a man of integrity, ability, \nand dedication. I have been on the Armed Services Committee since 1959, \nand I was so pleased that he joined the committee when he came to the \nSenate. He rendered outstanding service as a member of the committee \nand as chairman of the committee. He is known as an expert on defense \nmatters. Not only in defense; he has done a fine job in every endeavor \nsince he has been in the Senate. This country would be better off today \nif we had more people like Sam Nunn in the Senate and the House as well \nas the judicial and executive branches. I am proud of his friendship, \nproud to have worked with him. He has been a great citizen of America \nand he has rendered outstanding service of which we can all be proud.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nNebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, many of my most distinguished colleagues, \nincluding the minority leader, including the great, distinguished \nmember and the former chairman of the Appropriations Committee and now \nthe ranking Democrat, Senator Byrd, my very able colleague from South \nCarolina, the chairman of the committee, and others will follow to give \ntheir accolades to our dear friend, Sam Nunn.\n  I rise as a man who has worked closely with him under his tutelage \nfor the last 18 years on many matters in the Senate and primarily with \nregard to the national security interests of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  I simply wish to add my name to the accolades of others who have \nspoken so eloquently on this true favorite son of the State of Georgia.\n  Sam Nunn, you have set an example for all of us to follow while you \nhave been here, and you are setting an example as others have set in \nother work for other people who are most concerned about the United \nStates of America. Regardless of political affiliation, you have set a \nrecord for others to follow.\n  Thank you, Sam, for all the help you have been. You have been great \nfor the United States of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, on behalf of the majority--and, of course, \nour distinguished President pro tempore has already spoken--I would \nlike to join our colleagues in congratulating the outstanding Senator \nfrom Georgia for this monumental accomplishment of 10,000 votes.\n  We came to Congress together in 1973. I am going to have to go back \nand check to see how many votes I have cast, both in the House, of \ncourse, and the Senate. But it truly is a remarkable achievement. I had \nno idea actually how few had achieved this mark in history. But I also \nconcur in the statements that have been made about the tremendous \ncontributions the Senator from Georgia has made over the years. He has \nreally continued the tradition of leaders from Georgia, particularly in \nthis body, the Senate, who have left an indelible mark on the history \nof our country.\n\n  We have all grown to respect and admire Senator Nunn, from Georgia, \nhis integrity, his intelligence, his leadership in armed services and \nbudget matters. It is one that we truly appreciate. I had not had an \nopportunity to express my admiration to the Senator and say how much I \nenjoyed working with him. I am glad we have at least 11 more months to \nwork together. And I know that even though he will be leaving this \nbody, the leadership he has provided will live on in many, many ways \nand we will be working together on other issues. So I congratulate the \nSenator on this fine achievement.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. NUNN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, that vote was easier cast than to respond to \nthe aftermath. I would have to say that I was surprised. I knew that I \nwas nearing the 10,000 mark, but I did not know I would reach it today.\n  I must say that to be honored in this fashion is, indeed, touching \nand is a reminder of how much serving in this body has meant to me. I \nthank my friend from Mississippi, and my friend from South Carolina, \nand my friend from Nebraska. I thank the majority leader, and I thank \nthe man that is really the person we all look to to carry on the \ntraditions and ideals of the Senate, Senator Robert Byrd of West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. President, I am also delighted that my friend and colleague from \nGeorgia, Senator Coverdell, is presiding at this special moment in my \nlife. I think this has been a historic week not because I have cast my \n10,000th vote but because we have placed in the Russell Building, named \nafter my predecessor from Georgia, Senator Dick Russell, a statue of \nSenator Russell, and as the Vice President said, Dick Russell, one of \nthe greatest Senators who ever served in this body, is now where he \nbelongs. He is standing tall in the Russell Building.\n  So this is the culmination of a very historic week, and I cannot help \nbut recall the words that Senator Byrd offered in the dedication of \nthat statue this week when he said that he had never--in spite of the \nfact of serving with Senator Russell all those years, had such \nreverence for him; he knew him well--called him anything but ``Senator \nRussell.''\n  That is a tribute that cannot be exceeded. I have used the word \n``Robert'' time and time again because we are such good friends, but in \nthat tradition I would like to address you for the rest of my days here \nas ``Senator Byrd,'' in the great respect that I have for you because \nin the heat of battle, when we have so many substantive differences, I \nthink too many times all of us forget what a tremendous honor it is to \nserve in this Senate, which is in my mind, without a doubt, the \ngreatest legislative body not only in the world today but in history.\n  We have all of our frustrations with delays and schedules, and we \nalways have a hard time knowing what we are going to do from day to \nday, but when you think about the things that make the schedule so \nuncertain here and the things that make us so many times so frustrated \nare also the things that make this body unique, the right of any \nSenator to take the floor and continue uninterrupted as long as they \nchoose until there is an appropriate implementation of cloture, and \neven then someone has to get the floor, it is a rare body. It has its \ndistinctions from any other body in the world and I think we should \nalways remember that.\n  I cannot say, I say to my friend from West Virginia, and my \ncolleagues, that I have enjoyed every vote I have cast here. Some of \nthem have been agonizing, as we all know. And I cannot say I have \nenjoyed every hour I have served here. But I can say I have enjoyed \nevery day I have served here, and I will always cherish as long as I \nlive my service in the Senate and my friendship with each of you. So I \nthank the Chair and I thank my colleagues, and I look forward to a lot \nmore votes before my day is done.\n  [Applause, Senators rising.]\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3120\n\n              (Purpose: To increase the public debt limit)\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. \n  \n[[Page S419]]\n\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Moynihan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3120.\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n                       TITLE V--PUBLIC DEBT LIMIT\n\n     SEC. 501. INCREASE IN PUBLIC DEBT LIMIT.\n\n       Subsection (b) of section 3101 of title 31, United States \n     Code, is amended by striking the dollar amount contained in \n     the first sentence and inserting ``$5,400,000,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I will remark, if I might, on the \nbrevity of this measure, the succinctness of its purpose, which is to \nincrease the debt ceiling of the United States from the present $4.9 \ntrillion to $5.4--one should not use decimal points when referring to \ntrillions--$5.4 trillion. This $500 billion increase will provide \nsufficient borrowing authority for the Federal Government until about \nthe end of May 1997.\n  Mr. President, I offer this amendment on the circumstance of the 11th \ntime since 1984 that the Federal Government has been in a ``debt \nissuance suspension period,'' commonly known as a debt ceiling crisis. \nThe repeated past crises of the debt ceiling, and the present \nunprecedented, protracted crisis that has been upon us since the debt \nceiling was reached over 2 months ago, has left the Secretary of the \nTreasury, the distinguished Secretary Robert Rubin, with little \nrecourse under law by which he could allow the Government to continue. \nBut he has now stated that there are three remaining ones, with the \nvery specific sums associated with each, and that in no circumstances \ncan the Government meet its financial obligations after the 29th of \nFebruary or the 1st of March.\n  What we face, Mr. President, is the prospect of default. Moody's \nInvestors Service has placed on review for possible downgrading--those \nare the terms--some $387 billion of obligations of the U.S. Treasury \nfor interest payments falling due between February 29 and April 1, the \nfirst time in our history that the credit of the United States has been \npotentially brought into question by an investment advisory service.\n  How to scale this event? We are not going to have many people \nparticipate in this debate and not many people will be on the floor as \nwe proceed. I wonder if there is not some apprehension about this issue \nthat leads to a kind of avoidance.\n  How would you scale this prospect of default, Mr. President? I give \nyou the typical prospect. It would be the equivalent of losing a war. \nWe are not talking about a program. We are not talking about \nappropriations. We are talking about the United States of America.\n  The War of 1812 was perhaps the closest we ever came to losing a war. \nIn 1814 the British seized Washington. They burned the White House. \nThey burned the Treasury building. They burned the Capitol. But the \nservice of the debt of the U.S. Government went forward undisturbed out \nof subtreasuries elsewhere, prominently New York and Philadelphia.\n  We were a debtor then, a debtor nation, rapidly paying off our debt. \nWe would have none whatever by 1837. We had acquired that debt in the \ncourse of the Revolutionary War. State governments incurred this debt, \nand Alexander Hamilton insisted that the Federal Government assume that \ndebt. Paying it off established the credit of the United States in \nEurope and in a mode that allowed us to be a great importer of capital \nthrough the 19th century as we built our industries and infrastructure.\n  Today we are not only a debtor once again but we are the world's \nlargest debtor, the result, Mr. President, not of the War for \nIndependence, but of the working out of the long-term strategy that \ntook shape in the late 1970's designed to refashion the American \nNational Government by dismantling its finances.\n  Mr. President, I spoke upon that subject on any number of times in \nthe 1970's. In July 7, 1980, I wrote a long article for the New York \nTimes describing it. And I said of that strategy which came to be known \nas starve the beast:\n\n       The Republicans' dominant idea, at least for the moment, \n     seems to be that the social controls of modern Government \n     have become tyrannical or at the very least exorbitantly \n     expensive. This impression, so the strategic analysis goes, \n     is made possible by taxation such that cutting taxes becomes \n     an objective in its own right, business cycles \n     notwithstanding.\n\n  And 3\\1/2\\ years later, with the new administration in place and a \nbudget deficit now steadily rising, I wrote of this same subject. Might \nI just add, Mr. President, that on January 20, 1981, the debt was about \n$900 billion. In the intervening 15 years we have added $4 trillion.\n  I spoke again of this basic proposition, not easily understood, not \nwidely even noted. The proposition is that the deficits were \npurposeful, that is to say, that the deficits in the President's \ninitial budgets were purposeful. They were expected to disappear. They \nhave not disappeared.\n  The then-Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mr. David \nStockman, said there are $200 billion deficits as far as the eye can \nsee. And in that mode, the debt was beginning to accumulate.\n  I put it up to the whole legislative budgetary agenda at that time. I \nquote--this is in the New Republic of December 31, 1983. I said:\n\n       There was a hidden agenda. It came out--hidden in plain \n     view like pearls of a purloined necklace.\n       It came out in a television speech sixteen days after \n     President Reagan's inauguration, when he stated, ``There were \n     always those who told us that taxes couldn't be cut until \n     spending was reduced. Well, you know we can lecture our \n     children about extravagance until we run out of voice and \n     breath. Or we can cut their extravagance by simply reducing \n     their allowance.''\n\n  That was the pattern, starve the beast. It would be pointless to try \nto argue out of existence this program, that program, another \nappropriation. Simply make it impossible to go forward because there \nare no funds, and indeed we looked the unthinkable prospect of default \nin the very face.\n  I wrote then that there was an alternative, that the possibility of a \nhistorical compromise was present.\n  Democrats might come to understand the sense of the opposing party \nthat Government, indeed, had become too big, too interventionist, at \ntimes, indeed, an obstacle to the private lives and private fortunes of \nthe citizenry. There is that edge, the regulatory state.\n  Republicans would have to understand that they could not put it in \nservice of the political strategy, they could not put the integrity of \nthe United States of America at risk and that compromise may finally \nhave been reached. It has been agreed that we will balance the budget \nin 7 years. This will involve reducing a great many programs. It will \ninvolve preserving others.\n  I stand here, Mr. President, to say to the Republican Members across \nthe aisle, ``Your strategy has worked.'' The President, in the State of \nthe Union message 2 days ago, declared: ``The era of big Government is \nover.'' He said it not just once, he said it twice.\n  The debt service did it, not quite as anticipated but effectively so. \nThe strategy has worked. I might give you a specific, and I will not be \nlong. In 1994-1997, the period we are in, spending on Government \nprograms is less than taxes for the first time since the 1960's. If you \ngo back 30 years to the Kennedy-Johnson era, you will find a time when \nwe were spending less than we collected in revenues, and at that time, \na great source of concern arose for economists: the phenomenon of \nfiscal drag. Congress was not spending as much money as it brought in.\n  That changed so dramatically. The deficits of the 1980's, as far as \nthe eye can see, continued until, in 1993, under President Clinton, we \npassed legislation that reduced spending and increased revenues by half \na trillion dollars. After that, the deficit premium, as it is called, \non interest rates declined. The anticipation that we would deal with \nthe deficit reduced interest payments, and outlays were reduced by \nanother $100 billion.\n  So right now, revenues are running ahead of outlays, save for the \ndebt service. The debt service has done its work. Debt has done its \nwork, and now it seems to me, it appears to me, that we have an \nunderstanding of the reality. However little either side might like it, \nit is there.\n  Can we not go forward now to agree to extend the debt ceiling in the \ncontext of an agreement to bring about a balanced budget, not to put \nthe United States at risk in a world in which we are the largest \ndebtor, and our debt is held by central banks and elsewhere all around \nthe world? To bring it into \n\n[[Page S420]]\nquestion is to bring the fundamentals of the American Government into \nquestion as well.\n  I urge the Senate, I urge my friends on the other side of the aisle \nto declare victory and preserve the authority and integrity of the \nUnited States Government because, Mr. President, nothing less is at \nissue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the two articles I \nmentioned be printed in the Record.\n       There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be \n     printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the New Republic, Dec. 31, 1983]\n\n       The Biggest Spender of Them All--Reagan's Bankrupt Budget\n\n                      (By Daniel Patrick Moynihan)\n\n       In his first thousand days in office Ronald Reagan \n     increased the national debt of the United States by half. If \n     he should serve a second term, and the debt continues to \n     mount as currently forecast by the Congressional Budget \n     Office, the Reagan Administration will have nearly tripled \n     the national debt. In eight years, one Republican \n     Administration will have done twice, you might say, what it \n     took 192 years and thirty-eight Federalist, Democratic, Whig, \n     and Republican predecessors to do once. The numbers are so \n     large they defy any ordinary effort at comprehension (a \n     billion minutes ago St. Peter was fourteen years dead), but \n     for the record they are as follows. On President Reagan's \n     inauguration day, January 20, 1981, the national debt stood \n     at $940.5 billion. In the next thirty-two months, $457 \n     billion was added. The projected eight-year growth is $1.64 \n     trillion, bringing us to a total debt, by 1989, of $2.58 \n     trillion.\n       Debt service, which is to say interest on the debt, will \n     rise accordingly. It came to $75 billion in fiscal year 1980. \n     By the end of this fiscal year, it will be something like \n     $148.5 billion. And so it might also be said that the Reagan \n     Administration will have doubled the cost of the debt in four \n     years.\n       A law of opposites frequently influences the American \n     Presidency. Once in office, Presidents are seen to do things \n     least expected of them, often things they had explicitly \n     promised not to do. Previous commitments or perceived \n     inclinations act as a kind of insurance that protects against \n     any great loss if a President behaves contrary to \n     expectation. He is given the benefit of the doubt. He can't \n     have wanted to do this or that; he must have had to do it. \n     President Eisenhower made peace, President Kennedy went to \n     war; President Nixon went to China.\n       Something of this indulgence is now being granted President \n     Reagan. Consider the extraordinary deficits, $200 billion a \n     year, and continuing, in David Stockman's phrase, as far as \n     the eye can see. This accumulation of a serious debt--the \n     kind that leads the International Monetary Fund to take over \n     a third world country's economic affairs (or in olden times \n     would lead us to send in the Marines to collect customs \n     duties)--is all happening without any great public protest, \n     or apparent political cost.\n       As such, this need be no great cause for concern. If Ronald \n     Reagan is lucky, good for him. There is little enough luck in \n     the business. But, unfortunately, something much larger is at \n     issue. If nothing is done, the debt and the deficit will \n     virtually paralyze American national government for the rest \n     of the decade. The first thing to be done, to use that old \n     Marxist terminology, is to demystify the Reagan deficit.\n       If I may say so, what I now write, I know. That is not and \n     should not be enough for the reader. I will ask to be judged, \n     then, by whether the proposition to be presented is coherent, \n     and whether any other proposition makes more sense.\n       The proposition is that the deficits were purposeful, that \n     is to say, the deficits for the President's initial budgets. \n     They were thereafter expected to disappear. That they have \n     not, and will not, is the result of a massive \n     misunderstanding of American government. This is not \n     understood in either party. Democrats feel uneasy with the \n     subject, one on which we have been attacked since the New \n     Deal. Republicans are simply uncomprehending, or, as Senator \n     John Danforth of Missouri said in a speech on the debt \n     ceiling in November (referring to the whole Senate, but \n     permit me an inference), ``catatonic.''\n       Start with the campaign. Although we may be forgiven if we \n     remember otherwise, as a candidate, Mr. Reagan did not \n     propose to reduce federal spending. Waste, yes, that would be \n     eliminated, but name a program, at least one of any \n     significance, that was to go. To the contrary, defense \n     spending was to be considerably increased. That was the one \n     program issue of his campaign. It was the peculiar genius of \n     that campaign that it proposed to increase defense \n     expenditures while cutting taxes. This was the Kemp-Roth \n     proposal, based on Arthur Laffer's celebrated curve. As a \n     candidate, Mr. Reagan went so far as to assert that this \n     particular tax cut would actually increase revenues.\n       What follows is crucial: no one believed this. Obviously a \n     tax can be so high that it discourages the taxed activity and \n     reduces revenue. This is called price elasticity and is a \n     principle that applies to pretty much everything from the \n     price of The New Republic to the price Justice Holmes said we \n     pay for civilization. But any massive reduction in something \n     as fundamental as the income tax was going to bring about a \n     massive loss of revenue. And this was intended.\n       There was a hidden agenda. It came out in a television \n     speech sixteen days after President Reagan's inauguration, \n     when he stated, ``There were always those who told us that \n     taxes couldn't be cut until spending was reduced. Well, you \n     know we can lecture our children about extravagance until we \n     run out of voice and breath. Or we can cut their extravagance \n     by simply reducing their allowance.'' The President genuinely \n     wanted to reduce the size of the federal government. He \n     genuinely thought it was riddled with ``waste, fraud, and \n     abuse,'' with things that needn't or shouldn't be done. He \n     was astute enough to know there are constituencies for such \n     activities, and he thought it pointless to try to argue them \n     out of existence one by one. He would instead create a fiscal \n     crisis in which, willy-nilly, they would be driven out of \n     existence.\n       If his understanding of the government had been right, his \n     strategy for reducing its size would have been sound. But his \n     understanding was desperately flawed. There is waste in the \n     federal budget, but it is of the kind generic to large and \n     long-established enterprises. Thus we have an Army, a Navy, \n     and an Air Force. They compete, they overlap, they duplicate. \n     Well, yes. But they also fight, in no small measure because \n     these uniforms mean something to those men and women, and \n     have, in the case of the Army and Navy (and of course the \n     Marine Corps, which is part of the Navy) for more than two \n     centuries. A management consultant might merge them. I sure \n     as hell wouldn't, except perhaps way at the top. For the \n     rest, well, there is the F.B.I. at $1 billion; the Coast \n     Guard (equally long established) at $2.5 billion, and so on. \n     Welfare? In the sense of welfare mothers? The Aid to Families \n     with Dependent Children program comes in at about 1 percent \n     of the whole budget. (The Washington Post has half-seriously \n     proposed that it be abolished altogether so that people will \n     stop talking about it.) There are areas in the budget where \n     expenditure is indeed growing at enormous rates, principally \n     that of medical care. But for the most part, and especially \n     in the case of medical care, expenditure is growing at \n     similar rates in both the private and public sectors. Large \n     social forces are at work, not simply a peculiarly \n     pathological tendency of government.\n       A notable area of miscalculation, or rather misinformation, \n     among the Reaganites was that of foreign affairs. President \n     Reagan has acted much as his predecessors have done in \n     foreign affairs, and for the elemental reason that he is \n     faced with much the same situations. Invariably, this has \n     meant spending money. This fall the President had to plead \n     with Congress to increase appropriations for the \n     International Monetary Fund, something he cannot have \n     expected ever to be doing, but there you are. As I write, the \n     Kissinger Commission on Central America is no doubt drawing \n     up a massive ``Marshall Plan'' for the area. Is there any \n     doubt that in the next session the President will be pleading \n     with Congress to increase this particular form of foreign \n     aid? (Just as, had his supporters in the Senate been \n     successful in blocking the Panama Canal treaties in the \n     Carter years, he would be pleading today with the Senate to \n     consent to their ratification.)\n       President Reagan's tax cut--the largest tax reduction in \n     history--became law in August 1981. Critics, if they are \n     members of Congress, typically must begin by explaining why \n     they voted for the tax cut. I am one. (There were only eleven \n     Senators who voted no.) I have an explanation, but no excuse.\n       After years of intense inflation and the accompanying \n     ``bracket creep'' in the income tax, we did need to reduce \n     personal tax rates. A year earlier, the Senate Finance \n     Committee, controlled by the Democratic majority, had \n     reported out just such a bill, but Mr. Carter's White House \n     would not hear of it. This helped lose the Senate for the \n     democrats, but the lesson was not lost.\n       The great recession of 1981-82 made it painfully clear that \n     the tax cut was too small for the first year, when a neo-\n     Keynesian stimulus was in order. At the time, however, a \n     bidding war broke out in the House, sending the parties into \n     senseless competition to offer loopholes to special \n     interests. The result was a tax cut much too large for the \n     later years. Thus the $200 billion annual deficit. Again, no \n     excuses from this quarter, but in the Democratic response to \n     the President's televised speech of July 27, 1981, I did say, \n     ``In the last few days something like an auction of the \n     Treasury has been going on . . . what this is doing is taking \n     a tax cut we could afford and transforming it into a great \n     barbecue that we can't afford. I would say to the President \n     that some victories come too dear.\n       Enter the Federal Reserve Board which looked at the huge \n     tax cuts in the midst of high inflation and decided to create \n     an economic downturn. Of all the structural anomalies of \n     American government, the arrangements for setting \n     macroeconomic policy are the most perverse. Although fiscal \n     policy (the amounts of money the government spends, receives, \n     and borrows) is made through a painfully elaborate public \n     process by an elected President and an elected Congress, \n     monetary policy (the total amount of money in the economy and \n     the cost of borrowing it) is made in secret by appointed \n     officials. The Reserve Board tightened the growth of the \n     money supply so strenuously that it actually declined in the \n     third quarter of 1981. Real interest rates reached the \n     highest levels in our nation's history, and the economy fell \n     off the cliff. At the end of September 1981, the steel \n     industry was operating \n\n[[Page S421]]\n     at 74.5 percent of capacity; by the end of 1982, it was operating at \n     29.8 percent of capacity.\n       To be sure, the Fed does not control the precise money \n     supply and cannot precisely determine interest rates. But it \n     can set the direction and range for both and this it did. \n     Anyone who tried to dissent was soundly rapped. Its two dozen \n     or so central bankers decided to bust the economy, and bust \n     it they did. In a White House appearance in October 1982, \n     Nobel Economist George Stigler used the term ``depression'' \n     to describe the economy.\n       There is a tendency for any government to live beyond its \n     income. The Reagan Administration transformed this temptation \n     from a vice into an opportunity. Put plainly, under Ronald \n     Reagan, big government became a bargain. For seventy-five \n     cents worth of taxes, you got one dollar's worth of \n     return. Washington came to resemble a giant discount \n     house. If no tax would balance the budget, and no outlay \n     would make it any worse, why try?\n       A boom psychology moved through government. Defense came \n     first, from space wars to battleships--the latest defense \n     appropriations reactivates the World War II-vintage U.S.S. \n     Missouri. Hog wild is the only way to describe the farm \n     program. Jimmy Carter left behind a $4 billion enterprise, \n     somewhat overpriced at that and the object of incessant \n     right-wing criticism. Whereupon the fundamentalists and their \n     political brethren took over. Within thirty-six months they \n     increased the annual cost of the farm program more than \n     fourfold. Their most recent enthusiasm, signed into law by \n     President Reagan, is a program paying dairy farmers not to \n     milk their cows.\n       What is to be done? The economy is at stake. The country \n     can bankrupt itself. According to the latest budget \n     projections, prepared by the Congressional Budget Office \n     under the impeccably conservative new director, Rudolph G. \n     Penner (formerly of the American Enterprise Institute), the \n     deficit for the six years 1984 to 1989 will come to \n     approximately $1,339,000,000,000. In order to support and \n     service this debt, the government will have to absorb more \n     and more of the capital that is coming available in the \n     nation's credit markets. Direct federal borrowing for the \n     deficit and federally guaranteed loans absorbed 62 percent of \n     all credit raised on the nation's financial markets this \n     year, compared to an average absorption rate of 8.3 percent \n     in the 1960s and 15.3 percent in the 1970s. This ``crowding \n     out'' was not much felt, because few others were borrowing to \n     invest. But when the day comes that business, consumers, and \n     government all compete for the same funds, interest rates \n     will go up, with predictable consequences.\n       Under these circumstances, the only thing a Republican \n     Administration and a Republican Senate will be able to \n     consider doing will be to revert to their original agenda: \n     use the budget deficit to force massive reductions in social \n     programs. This time they will be able to cite not mere \n     illusions but necessity. Even if interest on the debt climbs \n     to $200 billion a year, as now seems likely, presumably there \n     will still be an Army, an F.B.I., and some kind of customs \n     service and border control. What then will be left to cut?\n       Entitlements, or more precisely, Social Security.\n       The word is already the rage. There is scarcely a \n     Republican member of the Senate who does not know that \n     entitlements must be cut, and cut deeply. Many Democrats \n     agree; almost none dissent. Remember, at least twenty \n     Senators are millionaires, living at considerable social \n     distance from those who would be most affected. It will be \n     much the same in the House. The budget deficit in the year \n     ahead will threaten any sustained recovery. The members of \n     the House, as a rule, are not millionaires, but they know \n     their street corners. The street corners will say, ``Cut. \n     Something must be done.''\n       Cut back Social Security in desperation, and you abandon a \n     solemn promise of the Democratic Party and of American \n     society. This promise, once broken, will fracture a little \n     bit of society. (Moreover, cutting Social Security will not \n     improve the deficit problem. As Martin Feldstein, chairman of \n     the Council of Economic Advisers, has noted, Social Security \n     is funded by separate payroll taxes and contributes not a \n     cent to the deficit.)\n       There is an alternative. There is the possibility of a \n     historic compromise that can bring the now dominant branch of \n     the Republican Party to grips with reality, while shaking the \n     now dominant branch of the Democratic Party from its illusion \n     that no one will listen to Republicans for very long. Such a \n     compromise cannot await a change in the political culture. It \n     must be negotiated. We need a structure, a forum in which \n     negotiations can take place. A Presidential commission might \n     be such a structure.\n       The National Commission on Social Security Reform--on which \n     I served--would provide a model. It was established by \n     President Reagan in December 1981, after Congress rejected \n     his original plan to sharply reduce Social Security benefits. \n     One point in particular is crucial. Alan Greenspan, who \n     chaired the commission, adopted a simple rule: each member \n     was entitled to his own opinion but not his own facts. Within \n     a year Mr. Greenspan had established the facts, which showed \n     that the problem was neither trivial nor hopeless. The \n     commission as such could reach no agreement. But with the \n     facts established, we put together a bipartisan legislative \n     package last January in exactly twelve days.\n       The budget crisis presents a harder problem, but it can be \n     approached in the same way. Martin Feldstein made a good \n     beginning in a speech to the Southern Economic Association on \n     November 21. He agreed with the Congressional Budget Office \n     that by 1988 the deficit will absorb 5.1 percent of the \n     nation's G.N.P. Of this, Feldstein noted, 2.4 percent will \n     come from increased defense spending, 1.7 percent from the \n     tax cut, and the remaining 1 percent from higher interest \n     payments. The facts about the structural deficit flow readily \n     from such quantification.\n       The members of the budget commission--representatives from \n     the Administration, Congress, the Federal Reserve, and the \n     Congressional Budget Office--would determine the actual \n     effects of deficits on employment, real interest rates, \n     capital formation, investment, and the prospects for vigorous \n     economic growth. Then they would propose the steps to reduce \n     the deficit, making certain that the burden of these \n     reductions did not fall disproportionately on any economic or \n     social group. Delaying tax indexing, reforming corporate tax \n     law deductions and credits, cutting defense spending, and \n     reducing farm price supports, among other proposals, would \n     have to be considered. Medicare, secure in the short term, \n     will be in deep trouble before the end of this decade. The \n     deficit commission must face up to this problem. Democrats \n     should agree to do so in return for assurances that the \n     Social Security agreement will be respected and that the \n     Social Security trust fund will not be raided (the plain \n     purpose of those who say entitlements are the problem).\n       Moreover, a solution to the deficit crisis will require \n     more than adjustments in spending and taxation. It will \n     demand change in the way we make fiscal and monetary policy \n     and the way those policies are coordinated. Monetary policy \n     and the operations of the Federal Reserve must be an integral \n     part of any fiscal resolution. Nothing can be achieved \n     without a joint monetary-fiscal effort to promote an \n     expanding economy and an approach to full employment--a one \n     percentage point drop in unemployment alone reduces the \n     budget deficit by $30 billion.\n       But let's stop here. I have my own thoughts. The reader \n     will have his or hers. On the final day of the last session \n     of Congress, I introduced legislation to establish the \n     National Commission on Deficit Reduction. Now, can we get the \n     President to join?\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 7, 1980]\n\n                  Of ``Sons'' and Their ``Grandsons''\n\n                      (By Daniel Patrick Moynihan)\n\n       Once upon a time, before the Coming of the New Deal, there \n     was a group of Republican Senators who were not sound men on \n     subjects such as the High Tariff. Their names were well \n     enough known--Johnson of California, Norris of Nebraska, La \n     Follette of Wisconsin, Shipstead of Minnesota--but you might \n     say their families were not. They were definitely Western, \n     arguably Populists, and assuredly Not Quite in the Best of \n     Taste.\n       In a speech on the Senate floor in 1924, an Eastern \n     Republican, drawing on Jeremiah 14:6, referred to them as \n     ``sons of the wild jackass.'' The phrase was much in vogue in \n     the brief period remaining to that era, after which \n     Republicans generally lapsed into an undifferentiated and \n     glum opposition.\n       Soon the wild jackasses were no more. But of a sudden their \n     grandsons have appeared. In the Senate surely, and in their \n     party generally, and the reaction has been much the same, \n     except that this time it has come from--Democrats!\n       Take this business of cutting taxes. The Secretary of the \n     Treasury was not amused. The White House received \n     unimpeachable intelligence from the Best Sources that it was \n     a Bad Idea. Dissenting Democratic Senators were informed that \n     the Chief Executive Officer of the largest corporation in \n     Delaware had reported that industry was not at all impressed \n     by the Republican proposal, whilst the head of the Federal \n     Reserve branch in New York City reported that The Street was \n     definitely not in favor.\n       Psychologists call this role reversal. As a Democrat, I \n     call it terrifying. And to miss it is to miss what could be \n     the onset of the transformation of American politics.\n       Not by chance, but by dint of sustained and often complex \n     argument there is a movement to turn Republicans into \n     Populists, a party of the People arrayed against a Democratic \n     Party of the State.\n       This is the clue to the across-the-board Republican tax-cut \n     proposal now being offered more or less daily in the Senate \n     by Dole of Kansas, Armstrong of Colorado and their \n     increasingly confident cohorts.\n       It happens that just now they are ``right.'' The economy is \n     in a steep recession, facing a huge tax increase (windfall \n     profits and Social Security payments, combined with the \n     ``bracket creep'') next year. Certainly a $30 billion cut in \n     1981 taxes is in order, and ought to be agreed on quickly, \n     with luck using the opportunity to get better depreciation \n     schedules for industrial investment.\n       But these same Republicans were calling for tax cuts in \n     1978 and 1979 when clearly they were ``wrong--by, that is, \n     established standards of fiscal policy. The point is that \n     these are no longer men of that Establishment.\n       The process of change has been unremarkable enough. After a \n     half century of more or less unavailing opposition \n     (Republicans have controlled the Congress only four years \n     since 1930) it was possible to agree that new ideas were \n     necessary.\n     \n[[Page S422]]\n\n       Observe Bill Brock, chairman of the Republican National \n     Committee, announcing the appearance, in 1978, of A \n     Republican Journal of Thought and Opinion: Commonsense:\n       ``We must not forget that the last great partisan coalition \n     of American politics was built on ideas. These were no less \n     forceful and appealing, if also debatable, for all their \n     identification with a political party. The notion of an \n     activist federal government, with an obligation to use its \n     centralized power to meet new social problems with new social \n     controls, was a new idea in the 1930s. But it took hold, \n     built a durable coalition, became the foundation for decades \n     of programmatic public policy, and tended to capture the \n     terms of the political debate.\n       ``As an idea, it had consequences. Only lately have these \n     come to be generally understood as having mixed implications \n     for the nation and for individuals in it. Accordingly, the \n     Republican Party finds itself in opposition, at this writing, \n     not only to a majority party that controls the machineries of \n     government, but to the force of certain such idea. It is our \n     continuing obligation, therefore--to articulate our own.''\n       This journal has been faithful to its promise: The material \n     is first-rate. (We Democrats have nothing approaching it.) Of \n     a sudden, the G.O.P. gas become a party of ideas.\n       The Republicans' dominant idea, at lest for the moment, \n     seems to be that the social controls of modern government \n     have become tyrannical or, at the very least, exorbitantly \n     expensive. This oppression--so the strategic analysis goes--\n     is made possible by taxation, such that cutting taxes becomes \n     an objective in its own right, business cycles \n     notwithstanding.\n       Similarly, ``supply-side'' economics speaks to the people \n     as producers, as against the Government as consumer. Within \n     the Republican Party this is put forth as populism and argued \n     for as such. To be wild jackasses, to be Teddy Roosevelts, \n     and to trust the people. Asked by a commentator whether an \n     across-the-board tax could really lead to the needed increase \n     in savings, a Republican Senator replied that he took for \n     granted that the people would know what to do with their own \n     money.\n       There is much G.K. Chesterton in this--indeed, Brock cites \n     how in another passage to his introduction of Commonsense--\n     who raged against the elitism of Tory and Socialist alike. \n     Beer and Liberty, as it has been put, verus Soap and \n     Socialism. And property for all versus the goods for all, if \n     such goods came only from giant businesses.\n       And then there is also much of the Frontier in this New \n     Republicanism. Some get plenty; and some get none. But it is \n     surely also a challenge. For we Democrats have been in power \n     so long we have not been able to avoid becoming in ways the \n     Party of the Government, and it shows. The party, to be \n     specific, of those classes and professions and enterprises, \n     public and private, that depend on Government subvention and \n     guarantee. With the public sector at a third of gross \n     national product, (and the Federal share tending toward one \n     quarter), this is no small constituency. But it is not yet a \n     majority. And we would do well to take heed when Republicans \n     start campaigning, as indeed they have, on platforms that \n     they are the ``party of the working man.'' Do us both good.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I see my distinguished chairman of the Committee on \nFinance is on the floor, and I look forward to his agreement and \ncollaboration.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to vote against \nthis amendment to raise the debt ceiling on this occasion. Without a \ndoubt, the debt ceiling will eventually be raised as it needs to be and \nas it should be in order to avoid default.\n  The problem with addressing the debt ceiling issue at this point is \nthat there is some urgency in our need to enact the continuing \nresolution. To keep Government from shutting down, this resolution must \nbe enacted today and it must be clean.\n  This CR has already been negotiated with the House, the Senate, and \nthe White House. The President has said that he will sign this bill \ntonight. This is critically important to maintain uninterrupted \nGovernment services for the American people.\n  To open the CR now for amendment is to create an obstacle that will \nmost certainly keep this bill from passing and result in a Government \nshutdown. We must reach closure today.\n  We will address the debt ceiling. Secretary Rubin has asked us to do \nso before March 1. That's over a month away. Consequently, there is no \nurgency to extend the debt limit now--not if it means once again \nshutting down the Government.\n  The Finance Committee is currently in discussions with Treasury \nregarding various aspects of this issue. And we will move forward with \nthe debt ceiling issue when the moment serves. But not now.\n  The amendment violates the Constitution. Revenue bills must arise in \nthe House, and that includes legislation affecting the debt ceiling. If \nwe adopt this amendment, the House will blue slip the legislation, and \nwe will be further behind than if we pass this CR and address the debt \nat a more appropriate time.\n  It is customary for Congress to consider debt ceiling legislation \ntogether with provisions to reduce the deficit. The House is in the \nprocess of fashioning such a package. The Speaker has talked with the \nPresident.\n  Leon Panetta has indicated the administration is willing to work on \nsuch a package. This amendment derails that effort. It is clear, then, \nthat this amendment, even if it were legal, would not be well received \nin the House. Rather than achieve gridlock once again with the Moynihan \namendment, we need to send this continuing resolution to the President.\n  Mr. President, again, I urge my colleagues to vote against the \namendment to raise the debt ceiling on this occasion.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, may I say to my friend, the \ndistinguished chairman--and I understand his reasons full well, and \nthey are wholly appropriate--what separates this moment from others in \nthe past is that the full faith and credit of the United States is even \nnow being questioned in international markets. That has never happened. \nIt has not happened since 1792 when Hamilton worked out the assumption \nof the State debt.\n  I think the fact that the President and the Republican leaders in the \nHouse and here in the Senate have come to an understanding that there \nwill be a balanced budget agreed to--and the distinguished chairman of \nthe Budget Committee was there--that should be enough for us to say \nthat will happen. And, incidentally, do not for a moment ever think \nthat the United States would default on their debt. That is all we seek \nin the spirit of good will.\n  I point out that the budget agreement, already tentatively marked up, \ncuts domestic discretionary spending of the Federal Government by one-\nthird in 7 years. David Stockman, in his moment of the utmost optimism, \ncould never have conceived that such an amount of drastic reduction \nwould not only be agreed to but hardly remarked upon. The era of big \nGovernment is, in fact, over. But the era of default, bankrupt \nGovernment, surely must not commence.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Senate can be assured that I want to \nexpedite the vote on this issue as much as anyone else. So I will be \nvery brief. There are some people in the country that are concerned \nabout the full faith and credit that has been such an advantageous \nthing for our Treasury bills and the financing of our debt. Our \nTreasury bills have been almost the greatest currency in the world. \nThey are the money market in many parts of the world. Certainly, it \ndoes not behoove the Senate or the U.S. House, Democrat or Republican, \nto do anything to tarnish that.\n  But I believe today the issue before us is: Shall we open the \nGovernment, pay our workers, and get on with the ordinary daily \nactivities of the Government and, at the same time, assure the \nmarketplace and those who are concerned that there is no intention on \nthe part of those on this side of the aisle that are in a position \nduring the next 4 or 5 weeks to get that debt limit extended, and that \nthere is no intention on our part that we let the Treasury bills of the \nUnited States go into default? \n\n[[Page S423]]\n\n  I stand before the Senate because some of those people that are \ninfluenced by our actions are, from time to time, interested in my \nopinion and my views. Frankly, I am saying tonight that I think we \nought not cause the Government of the United States to be closed down \neven for 24 hours while we add an amendment that is not necessary \ntonight.\n\n  We are saying as strongly as we can--I have been with our leader; \nthere is no intention to do anything other than to work with the \nPresident to extend the debt limit. I cannot say here to Senator \nMoynihan that it will be absolutely a clean debt limit, but I can say \nthere is an intention to extend it in a way that would be signed by the \nPresident.\n  I remind everyone it would be almost historic if in this kind of a \nsituation you had a clean bill. There would be some things worked out \nbetween the White House and the Congress. It is always a vehicle that \nsends some things to the White House that get done that everyone wants \ndone. I do not believe we ought to leave the notion out there in \nAmerica that if this proposal of Senator Moynihan is tabled, and I hope \nit is tabled, that there is any intention to do anything but have a \ndebt limit extension in an orderly and timely manner.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from New \nMexico and the distinguished Senator, the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, because I have risen in both our caucuses here recently and \nexpressed my grave concern about this issue of the full faith and \ncredit of the United States, how that could be combatted by the actions \nwith relation to the debt limit.\n  I, like the distinguished Senator, the chairman of the committee \nhere, feel very strongly, as does the Senator from Delaware and the \nSenator from New Mexico, that we cannot shut down the Government \ntonight.\n  I ask unanimous consent that two editorials on this subject be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorials were ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Plain Dealer, Jan. 24, 1996]\n\n                        Hitting the Debt Ceiling\n\n       It is all well and good for House Republicans to fight hard \n     for their budget priorities. But using the good faith and \n     credit of the United States government as a weapon in that \n     fight is short-sighted and dangerous. It is also likely to \n     backfire.\n       Until very recently, at least a few top House Republicans \n     seemed to understand this. Both House Speaker Newt Gingrich \n     and Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich had signaled a \n     willingness to pass legislation that would allow the \n     government--which will soon reach its credit limit--to borrow \n     more money to avoid default. But on Sunday, House Majority \n     Leader Dick Armey took a different tack.\n       Speaking on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' Armey said Congress \n     would not increase the debt ceiling unless conditions were \n     attached. The conditions, he said, would have to advance the \n     GOP agenda of ``decreasing the size and the intrusiveness of \n     government.''\n       The next day, Gingrich adjusted his tune to harmonize more \n     closely with Armey's. To get a debt-ceiling bill from \n     Congress, Gingrich said, President Bill Clinton will have to \n     propose ``substantial reforms'' in future spending.\n       However much dissent there may still be in Republican \n     ranks, clearly some party leaders are again embracing the \n     notion that the goal of forcing an ideologically palatable \n     budget deal warrants dramatics of the highest order. That is \n     troubling.\n       Though deficit-reduction and long-term entitlements reform \n     are supremely worthy ends for Republicans to pursue, they do \n     not justify any means. Forcing the U.S. government to default \n     on its obligations is irresponsible. It is bad policy and bad \n     politics.\n       The price of a default--which could include a dive in the \n     stock market, a leap in interest rates, and a worldwide \n     ripple of doubt about the reliability of U.S. securities--is \n     simply too high. If the goal of the most ardent GOP budget \n     cutters is to promote America's long-term economic well-\n     being, they defeat their purpose if they ruin America's \n     credit rating along the way.\n       It is not hard to understand why some House Republicans \n     would be feeling acutely frustrated these days. Not only has \n     budget-making become mired in an extended state of \n     indecision, but numerous policy initiatives have become \n     stuck. . . .\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Chicago Tribune, Jan. 24, 1996]\n\n                    The Madness of Courting Default\n\n       For months, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin has used every \n     loophole and opening he could find to extend the government's \n     borrowing powers and keep Republican lawmakers from using the \n     debt ceiling to muscle budget concessions out of President \n     Clinton.\n       But now, Rubin says, he has run out of options that are \n     legal and acceptable to Clinton. Unless Congress raises the \n     debt ceiling, he warns, the nation will for the first time in \n     its history default on its debts--probably by March 1.\n       Don't worry, some cynics say. Rubin has more tricks up his \n     sleeve and will do anything to avoid default.\n       Start worrying, say others. The Treasury is at the end of \n     its line, and House Speaker, Newt Gingrich won't raise the \n     debt ceiling unless Clinton agrees to some GOP-proposed \n     reforms on entitlements or welfare. The president insists he \n     won't be blackmailed.\n       Wherever the truth lies, it's time to stop this reckless \n     gamesmanship. It's one thing to reach an impasse over how to \n     balance the budget and agree to take the issue to the voters, \n     which both Democrats and Republicans seem content to do. But \n     it's totally irresponsible to jeopardize the credit of the \n     United States.\n       Congress' primary concern in the weeks ahead must be to \n     protect the reputation of the nation as a rock of financial \n     stability and as a debtor that always has honored its \n     obligations. Despite their frustration at being stymied on \n     budget reforms, Gingrich and the Republican hard-liners must \n     pass an extension of the debt ceiling, without extraneous \n     conditions.\n       So far, the financial markets haven't been roiled by the \n     budget gridlock in Washington. And no one can be sure what \n     default, or even the imminent threat of it, could mean to the \n     economy and markets. But it couldn't mean anything good.\n       Felix Rohatyn, the respected investment banker who is being \n     considered by the Clinton administration for vice chairman of \n     the Federal Reserve Board, wrote recently that it ``could \n     create a catastrophe.'' Politically, the rest of the world \n     would think America's institutions had collapsed and the \n     country was no longer governable. Financially, because more \n     than $500 billion of the nearly $5 trillion in U.S. debt is \n     held overseas, a default could ``trigger a global financial \n     crisis of completely unpredictable proportions.''\n\n  Mr. WARNER. As I understand, both Senators are giving the assurance \nto the Senate that we will, in an orderly manner, work this thing out \nin a manner that will not have an adverse impact upon the financial \nmarkets of our Nation. I believe the Senator is giving that assurance.\n  Mr. ROTH. I say to the distinguished Senator from Virginia, that is \nexactly what we are doing. We are acting in a responsible way today; we \nare taking action that will ensure that the Government can continue to \nfunction, which I know is of primary interest to our distinguished \nSenator from Virginia. That is the reason we do not want it to be \namended further. That would only delay the process and bring about the \nshutdown that I think no one wants.\n  As a second step, we are working already, together with the House, \nwith the administration. I was in contact yesterday with the Secretary \nof the Treasury. We are proceeding to do something about the debt \nceiling because I, like Senator Warner, want full faith from the \nPresident. So we are working to provide the type of legislation that \nmeets everybody's requirements and can be enacted by the Congress.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the distinguished Senator from Delaware. \nYesterday we had a discussion about this in our caucus, and he \nresponded in a way similar to that of today.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Before yielding to the distinguished Senator from Rhode \nIsland, may I welcome the statements by the chairman of the Committee \non Finance and the chairman of the Committee on the Budget. I take them \nwholly with integrity and give them the full faith and credit of the \nU.S. Senate.\n  I have to point out that we have not always had as good an experience \non the House side. A Member on the House side, the counterpart to the \ndistinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, once openly said, \n``Let's do this,'' and then disappeared. We cannot put the United \nStates, the integrity of the United States of America, at risk this way \nwith complete understanding of the Senator from Virginia's concern that \nthe Federal Government stay open. I still hope we might have a vote on \nthis. I do not want to prolong matters.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island has risen. I yield 3 minutes.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I wanted to rise in full support of the \namendment by the distinguished Senator from New York. If ever there was \na valid reason for stalling an increase in the debt limit, I believe it \nhas evaporated. The basic agreement has been achieved on \n\n[[Page S424]]\nthe objective of controlling the deficits that contribute to the debt.\n  While policy disagreements still persist on some issues, including \nMedicare, there appears to be sufficient agreement on other budget \nissues to provide $700 billion in long-term savings. Surely, there has \nbeen more than adequate demonstration of good faith.\n  The apprehensions of Moody's Investor Service with respect to the \ncredit rating of the U.S. Federal securities should dispel any glib \nassurances that the Secretary of the Treasury can still perform acts of \nfiscal wizardry to stay under the present limit.\n  We can only wonder what the motive might be of those who would delay \nfurther. There is no good purpose economically or fiscally.\n  I want to commend the Senator from New York for raising this matter \nand bringing the amendment to the floor. The full faith and credit of \nthe United States should not be clouded for another single day, and the \nSenator from New York is acting responsibly. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support for the \namendment offered by Senator Moynihan to attach a clean debt limit \nextension to the continuing resolution. Congress must not play politics \nwith the full faith and credit of the United States. We must extend the \ndebt limit within the next 5 weeks or the consequences will be \ncatastrophic.\n  If we fail to raise the debt limit by March 1, the United States will \ndefault on its financial obligations for the first time in the history \nof our Republic. As a result, bondholders will not receive the payments \nthey are due. Social security recipients and veterans may not receive \ntheir monthly benefits, and long-term interest rates will increase \nacross the board.\n  Interest rate increases mean that the United States will waste \nbillions of dollars on increased debt service costs, ironically, making \nit even more difficult to balance the budget. But perhaps most \nimportant, higher interest rates mean that the millions of Americans \nwith any kind of loan--mortgages, car loans, even credit card \nbalances--can expect higher monthly payments for years to come.\n  I would urge my colleagues to heed the words of former Treasury \nSecretary James A. Baker, who stated in 1985, ``It would be an absolute \ndisgrace if the United States defaulted for the first time in its over-\n200-year history. Any default will have swift and severe implications \nboth domestically and internationally.''\n  On November 9, 1995, six former Secretaries of the Treasury, who \nserved in Democratic and Republican Presidential administrations, \nwrote, ``We urge that prompt action be taken either to raise the debt \nlimit permanently * * * or that a sufficient short-term increase be \nenacted to allow the debate over priorities to proceed in an orderly \nmanner without impairing market confidence in our Nation's commitment \nto discharge its obligations''.\n  Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, has written, ``a \nfailure to make timely payment of interest and principal on our \nobligations for the first time would put a cloud over our securities \nthat would not dissipate for many years''.\n  Furthermore, former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Paul Volker wrote \nthat ``The appropriate approach, short of early agreement on a \ncomprehensive budget program * * * [is] raising the debt ceiling so \nthat authorized expenditures--including payment of interest on Treasury \ndebt--can be made in a timely fashion.''\n  In addition to these current and former leaders of the Treasury \nDepartment and the Federal Reserve, leading credit agencies have warned \nof the dire consequences of default. Standard & Poors has warned, \n``Even a short-lived default on the U.S. Government's direct debt \nobligations would profoundly impact a broad range of securities and \nfinancial market participants.''\n  Again, Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York for offering \nthis very important amendment.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me reinforce the statement made by the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth. I have been meeting \nwith Republican Senators throughout the afternoon. We are, I think the \nSenator from New York would appreciate, acting in good faith. We \nbelieve we can resolve this.\n  Having been chairman of the Finance Committee and having to deal with \ndebt ceilings, I know there is always a problem. When there is a \nRepublican in the White House, the problem is on that side of the \naisle; when there is a Democrat in the White House, the problem is on \nthis side of the aisle, the problem as far as the administration is \nconcerned.\n  I remember going to conference with amendments on Nicaragua. I think \nthere were 19 amendments--foreign policy, everything you could think of \nwas on the debt ceiling. I assure the Democratic leader on the floor \nand the former chairman of the Finance Committee, as I did Secretary \nRubin the night of the State of the Union Message, we believe we can \nget this done in a timely fashion so no checks will be late, nothing \nwill be interrupted in any way.\n  Having said that, as one who did not favor the shutting down of the \nGovernment in the first place, I do not think we ought to risk doing it \non a Friday afternoon. If this amendment should be accepted, it has to \ngo back to the House. The House is in recess. I assume they could come \nback Sunday or whenever.\n  I really believe we have an agreement here that has been approved by \nthe White House and by the leadership in both parties, in both the \nHouse and the Senate. I hope we will not make it more difficult by--I \nknow that is not the intent of the Senator from New York, do not \nmisunderstand me, but I think it would make it more difficult. I know \nthat is not the Senator's intent. I respectfully move to table the \namendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \nmotion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  \n[[Page S425]]\n\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I would like to thank all of those who \nhave participated in the debate. I would like particularly to thank the \nchairmen of the Committee on Finance and the Committee on the Budget \nfor the undertakings that they have made, and to say again that I hold \nthem in full faith and credit of the United States. I think we can work \nthis out, and clearly we intend to do so. It can be done.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I assume one of the votes that we will have \ntoday will be the continuing resolution. The fiscal year 1996 Foreign \nOperations conference report has been attached in its entirety to this \ncontinuing resolution. That means that foreign aid programs will be \nfunded through the fiscal year at the levels agreed to by the House and \nSenate conferees.\n  The conference report represents a devastating assault on many \nforeign operations programs that are vital United States interests \nabroad. For that the House Republican leadership bears primary \nresponsibility. But our alternative, a year long continuing resolution, \nwould be far worse. It would cause irreparable harm to these programs \nand many of the Federal employees who implement them would have to be \nlaid off. For that reason it is essential that this conference report \nbe enacted into law.\n  The conference report funds a wide range of activities that are \nstrongly supported by both Democrats and Republicans. Although I \nbelieve the funding provided for many programs falls far short of what \nis required to effectively combat global threats to the American \npeople--whether it is environmental pollution, the spread of infectious \ndisease, unchecked population growth, political and economic \ninstability caused by enormous numbers of people living in abject \npoverty, the growing problem of international crime and terrorism, and \nthe proliferation of nuclear and conventional weapons, it is better \nthan no funds at all.\n  On a more positive note, it also contains a provision of special \nimportance to me, which was passed by two-thirds of the Senate, \nRepublicans and Democrats, to impose a moratorium on the use of \nantipersonnel landmines.\n  Since the NATO operation began in Bosnia just a little over a month \nago, over 20 NATO soldiers have been injured or killed by landmines, \nincluding 1 American. That is in addition to the 225 UNPROFOR landmine \ncasualties in Bosnia, and the thousands of civilian landmine victims, \nsince the war began 4 years ago. Of the estimated 100 million \nunexploded landmines in the world, 6 million are in the former \nYugoslavia. Landmines are killing and maiming an average of one person \nevery 22 minutes, every day of the year.\n  My amendment aims to put the United States in the forefront of the \neffort against these inhumane weapons. It follows by just 1 week the \nannouncement by the Canadian Government that it will unilaterally halt \nall production, use and export of antipersonnel landmines. In just the \npast year, Belgium, France, Austria, Switzerland and the Philippines \nhave taken similar steps.\n  It follows by just 2 weeks the announcement in Geneva that 22 nations \nhave called for an immediate total ban on these weapons.\n  Mr. President, this amendment represents a dramatic shift in the \npolicy of the U.S. Government, from one which has lagged behind several \nof our NATO allies to one which aims to exert U.S. leadership to build \ninternational support for ridding the world of these inhumane weapons.\n  That is the goal President Clinton announced at the United Nations \nover a year ago. This amendment sets the stage for making that goal a \nreality. Once this provision is signed into law, the President, the \nVice President, the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, the Pentagon bureaucracy, the Secretary of State, and \nour U.N. Ambassador should all speak forcefully and with one voice. The \nmessage should be that antipersonnel landmines are unacceptable. They \nare indiscriminate, inhumane, impossible to control, and the United \nStates is going to stop using them and do whatever we can to convince \nother governments to join with us in making their use a war crime.\n  Mr. President, the one amendment in disagreement in the Foreign \nOperations conference report which deals with international family \nplanning has also been resolved, but I want to be sure Senators \nunderstand what the House has done. Essentially, the House has \npresented us with a fait accompli. The choice is either take their \noffer on the amendment in disagreement, with no opportunity to amend \nit, or the entire Foreign Operations budget, with none of the policy \nlanguage, will be governed by a continuing resolution.\n  I know that the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, Senator Hatfield, is as frustrated about this as I am. I \ncertainly intend to do whatever I can to resist these heavy handed \ntactics in the future. But given the choice, we have no alternative. A \nyear long CR at either the House level or 75 percent of fiscal year \n1995 levels would be far worse for many important programs.\n  Our conference report categorically prohibits the use of any funds \nfor abortion. Yet the House, at the behest of the right-to-life lobby, \nwould cut $88 million from programs that have only one purpose--to give \ncouples the means to avoid unwanted pregnancies and reduce the \nincidence of abortion. Why anyone would want to do that is beyond me, \nbut that is what the House has done. Anyone who wants to see fewer \nabortions, and fewer women die from botched abortions, should deplore \nthis action.\n  The provision in this CR would prohibit the obligation of any family \nplanning funds--funds to purchase and distribute contraceptives, to \nprovide technical assistance for improving the quality and safety of \ncontraceptives, to educate couples about birth spacing--none of these \nfunds could be spent before July 1 unless they are specifically \nauthorized.\n  If there is no authorization bill by that date, and I have yet to \nmeet anyone who thinks there will be, only 65 percent of the fiscal \nyear 1995 level for family planning could be obligated, and then only \nin monthly installments. The net effect of this will be an $88 million \ncut in family planning assistance.\n  That is the pound of flesh the right-to-life lobby will have won, if \nit does not succeed in its goal of reinstating the Mexico City policy--\na policy that has been ridiculed around the world, repeatedly rejected \nby the Senate, is opposed by a majority of Americans, and which the \nPresident has said he would veto.\n  I am very pleased that we successfully resisted attempts to reinstate \nthe discredited Mexico City policy. I will continue to oppose any \neffort to do that. But I will vote for this continuing resolution only \nwith great reluctance, because of the harm it will do to family \nplanning.\n  If I thought there was any way to amend this provision without \njeopardizing the entire conference report, I would not hesitate because \nI know a majority of the Senate would support me. Indeed, a majority of \nthe House would too--although perhaps not a majority of House \nRepublicans--but the House Republican leadership would never have the \ncourage to put it to a vote.\n  Mr. President, the United States has been a leader in the effort to \nstabilize the world's exploding rate of population growth. Tens of \nmillions of people are born into abject poverty every year, but today \nwe are cutting programs to give couples the means to avoid unwanted \npregnancies. Anyone with an ounce of brains can see that the logical \nresult will be more abortions, not less. That is what the right-to-life \nlobby, and their defenders in the House have accomplished.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank Senator McConnell, for his efforts to \nget this conference report enacted. I also want to pay special tribute \nto Senator Hatfield, who has been a strong supporter of funding for \nfamily planning assistance and who played a central role in the \nnegotiations with the House over the past few days.\n\n\n                     International Family Planning\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, of the many controversial issues in the \ncontinuing resolution we are considering today, few have been as \ncontentious as \n\n[[Page S426]]\nthe debate about international population programs in the foreign \noperations appropriations bill. Astoundingly, the entire foreign aid \nbill has been held up for months by several antichoice Members, mainly \nin the House, who have, illogically, sought to impose restrictions \nconcerning abortion on international family planning assistance.\n  These misguided provisions are not included in today's CR. Instead we \nare faced with provisions withholding population funds until July 1, \nunless there is an authorization, and then limiting funding for the \nprogram to 65 percent of today's levels. It is a victory for those of \nus who are prochoice on the question of abortion, but not very good \nnews for those of us--presumably the vast majority of the Congress, and \nincluding most of the people who fought against the original Senate \nprovisions--who support family planning. What a bizarre, if not \nridiculous, situation we are in today.\n  As my colleagues will remember, in the name, supposedly, of stopping \nabortion, the House sought to prohibit U.S. contributions to the United \nNations Population Assistance Fund, and reimpose the regressive Mexico \nCity policy on population. Of course, such propositions would not do \nanything to reduce incidents of abortion, but would actually harm \nefforts to increase family planning assistance--the best remedy, \nobviously, for avoiding abortion. Fortunately, these anti-abortion \nrestrictions have all been stripped from the foreign ops bill, and \npopulation assistance will not be hindered by irrelevant but damaging \nrestrictions. In that, we have succeeded, finally, in separating \npopulation assistance from abortion, and have scored a victory for \nfamily planning. The Mexico City policy has been rebuffed by the 104th \nCongress, and our support for the work of the UNFPA has been \nreaffirmed.\n  But, Mr. President, the cause of curbing abortion will not be served \nwell by the cuts in population assistance legislated in this bill. In \nfact, the only inroads the antifamily planning forces made today was in \ntaking gratuitous and harassing shots at the budget for population. \nWhile other programs will be held to 75 percent of current funding \nlevels, population programs will be funded at only 65 percent of \ntoday's budget. The money will not be distributed until July 1, and \neven then, it will be apportioned only on a month-to-month basis. Mr. \nPresident, this is nothing more than a formula for disarray, and will \ndo nothing to achieve the goals of its sponsors.\n  Who really believes that the rapid, exponential growth of the world's \npopulation--regardless of our positions on abortion--does not impact \nAmerican interests? Population pressures are a linchpin of so many \nglobal concerns, such as economic development, health, food security, \nmigration, environment, and improving the status of women. Through the \nU.S. bilateral population program, as well as our contribution to the \nUNFPA, we have affected significant successes in all those fields.\n  It is beyond me--and saddens me--that these issues have been \nentangled in a debate about abortion. It reflects a fundamental \nmisunderstanding that family planning and abortion are not the same. \nSupporters of family planning have been subjected to charges and \ninsinuations that we support China's appalling coercive abortion \npolicy; that we want to fund lobbies that promote pro-abortion policies \nworldwide; and that we actually want to promote abortion as a method of \nfamily planning. All these propositions are untrue, and are in fact red \nherrings. I'm pleased that they have been recognized as such, and \ndropped in the final provisions of this bill.\n  Unfortunately, however, the presumptions that underlie this \nthinking--that family planning is somehow not essential to curbing \nabortion--are prevailing in this bill. Population assistance should be \ntreated just as any other foreign aid account, and by subjecting it to \ndeeper cuts, and odd distribution guidelines, no one's goal is being \nreached.\n\n\n THE EFFECTS OF THE CONTINUING FUNDING RESOLUTION ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL \n                           PROTECTION AGENCY\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this morning Administrator Carol Browner \nof the Environmental Protection Agency testified before the Senate \nAppropriations Committee on the consequences of this continued funding \nresolution. She said that it: ``represents a severe cutback that will \nnot allow us to adequately protect public health and our environment. \nOur air, our water, our land, will not be as safe''.\n  The cuts in this continued funding resolution compromise our Nation's \npublic health and environment. This bill appropriates 5.7 billion \ndollars for EPA--that's a 14-percent cut--or nearly one billion dollars \nfrom the fiscal year 1995 level. It's a 22.5 percent cut--or 1.7 \nbillion dollars--from the President's fiscal year 1996 request.\n  Mr. President, the cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency in \nthis bill mean that an already stretched agency will not be able to \ncarry out critically important work that ensures the health and safety \nof all Americans, and will result in a set-back of national efforts to \nensure that every American citizen breaths clean air, drinks clean \nwater, and is safe from the dangers of hazardous waste. These are the \nEPA funds that are spent working with States and municipalities in the \ndevelopment of our air quality, water quality, lead abatement, and food \nsafety standards; the funds that allow EPA to keep track of the level \nof pollution in our air, our water, our food, our environment; that \nallow the EPA to work with states and with industries to help them \ndiscover the sources of pollution problems and helps they comply with \nFederal safety standards; that allow the EPA to give technical \nassistance to State pollution control agencies and county air and water \nquality boards; that allow the EPA to carry out environmental impact \nstatements on industry actions that may hurt the environment; that \nallow EPA to work all over this country to educate industry and small \nbusiness and help comply with the law so that enforcement actions are \navoided. In the long run this will mean more water pollution, more smog \nin our cities and countryside, more toxic waste problems. For example \nfunding cuts are seriously jeopardizing cleanup of 12 toxic superfund \nsites in and around the Los Angeles area including the Newark San \nBernadino site and San Gabriel sites.\n  Republicans seem to take great pride in their efforts to dismantle \nkey social programs that Americans hold dear, but they have chosen to \ntake their war against the environment underground. The cuts to the EPA \nbudget show us the covert war that is being waged by Republicans \nagainst our environment. It has to be covert because they have seen the \nresults of poll after poll showing that the vast majority of Americans \nfeel that our environmental laws should be strengthened not stripped \naway. In my many years in public office not once has anyone told me, \n``Senator, our air is too clean,'' or ``our water is too safe.'' The \nback door attack on our environmental laws seen here is cuts in EPA's \nbudget that will cripple EPA's ability to set and enforce environmental \nstandards.\n  This continued funding resolution cuts enforcement of all \nenvironmental programs by 14.6 percent, $77 million from fiscal year \n1995. It hits at the heart of EPA administration and management in \nEPA's ability to set and enforce environmental and public health \nstandards with a 7-percent cut, $115 million from fiscal year 1995.\n  This bill also cuts EPA's budget in other crucial areas: A 9-percent \n$110 million cut from fiscal year 1995 in funds that go straight to the \nStates to help cities all over the country build sewage treatment \nplants that keep raw sewage from flowing into our coastal waters, \nrivers, lakes, and streams.\n  A 79-percent; $1 billion cut from the pre-rescissions fiscal year \n1995 level in funds that go to States to protect our drinking water \nnationwide.\n  A 13-percent; $168 million cut from fiscal year 1995 in funds that go \ntoward cleaning up hazardous waste sites.\n  Mr. President, it is for all these reasons that I am very distressed \nat having to have to vote for this continuing resolution.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I cannot support the continuing resolution \nwhich is before the Senate today. This resolution cuts education funds \nto the House passed level, except for those programs that were not \nfunded by the House in which case they are cut by 25 percent. If we \nwere to extend this continuing resolution for the remainder of the \nfiscal year, the impact would be an \n\n[[Page S427]]\nunprecedented $3.1 billion cut in education funds from the fiscal year \n1995 funding level. And, it contains deep cuts in a range of important \ndomestic priorities, like a 25 percent reduction in the funds to put \n100,000 cops on the streets of America. This in a year in which $7 \nbillion more has been appropriated in defense spending than the \nPentagon asked for.\n  We are presented on the last day before funding once again runs out \nfor these agencies of the Government and for their programs with a \ncontinuing resolution that makes deep cuts in vital and proven \neducation programs.\n  The failure to support a simple continuing resolution that adequately \nfunds education programs at fiscal year 1995 levels is creating serious \nproblems for schools, teachers, and students. Our children--America's \nfuture--are the innocent victims of this retreat from education. Here \nare just a few examples, Mr. President, of the devastating impact if \nthe funding level in this continuing resolution is continued through \nthe remainder of the fiscal year.\n  The $1 billion cut in title I funding will deny 1.1 million \neducationally disadvantaged children the crucial help they need in \nreading, writing, math, and critical thinking.\n  The Safe and Drug Free Schools Program in almost every school \ndistrict in the country--more than 14,000--is cut by 25 percent, $115 \nmillion less than the fiscal year 1995 level of $466 million. These \nprograms help schools reduce drug abuse and prevent violence.\n  The innovative School-to-Work Program, which helps youths make the \ntransition from school to future careers and education by forming a \nthree-way partnership between Government, educators, and private \nindustry is cut by $55 million.\n  The $93 million cut in Goals 2000 comes at a time nearly 17,000 \nschools and communities have already completed planning and are \nbeginning to implement comprehensive reforms based on their own \nacademic standards and will deny funding to programs serving over 5.1 \nmillion children.\n  The Eisenhower Professional Development Teacher Training Program, \nwhich supports State and local efforts to better prepare educators to \nreach high standards in core academic subjects, such as mathematics and \nthe sciences, is cut by 25 percent or $63 million.\n  Mr. President, the impact of this continuing resolution will be \nimmediate and long-lasting because of the way in which school budgets \nare set. Now is the time for teacher contracts to be signed. Schools \nmust by law send layoff notices to teachers as early as March and \nApril, advising them they will not be rehired in the fall, but \ncommunities cannot make these decisions because the funding is \nuncertain. Plans for professional development, technology purchases, \ntraining, and school safety programs could be delayed or eliminated. \nNow is the time for cities to submit their school budgets, but they \ncannot adequately do this because they do not have any numbers to work \nwith. Now is the time for colleges to project what aid they will have \nto offer newly enrolled students, but they cannot make funding \nprojections because they have not been told how much they are going to \nhave to offer students. If students cannot be assured they will have \nfinancial aid, many will have to forgo plans to go to college.\n  The strategy of causing Government shutdowns and threatening to raise \nthe debt ceiling, thereby threatening the credit rating of the United \nStates, has been inappropriate and discredited. We are told by the \nmajority that there is no longer a quorum available in the House of \nRepresentatives, so we cannot amend this continuing resolution. The \nimplication is that we have to accept these cuts and make no \nadjustments, otherwise the Government would be shutdown tomorrow--the \nthird time this year. Again, we are painted into a corner. Well the \nHouse can return to work at the call of the Speaker. If we do the right \nthing by education, they can quickly do so too.\n  I think we should reject this bill which does not reflect priorities, \nparticularly in education and the environment. The Congress should stay \nhere, all night, all weekend, if necessary, and work out and adopt a \nclean continuing resolution with adequate domestic funding and a clean \nbill to raise the debt ceiling so that the credit rating of the United \nStates is not in doubt for weeks to come.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I want to say at the outset that \nour Federal employees, our financial markets, and our economy in \ngeneral, should never have been subjected to the risks created by \nshutdowns, threats of shutdowns, and the failure to act responsibly \nwith respect to the debt ceiling. Hostage-taking and legislative \nblackmail is not the way to arrive at the kind of solution we need to \nsolve our budget problems.\n  I am a firm believer in tightening our Government's fiscal policies \nand will continue to work toward that end. I am convinced that \nrestoring budget discipline will help ensure that our children--and \nfuture generations--will be able to achieve the American Dream. We have \nan obligation to our children to protect their future opportunities, \nand not to leave them a legacy of debt.\n  But passing one short-term funding bill after another--one every few \nweeks or so, is not the way to do it. This is unfair to our students \nwho want to pursue educational opportunities. It is unfair to our \nscience community whose research is interrupted. It is unfair to \nGovernment employees who want to work. And it is unfair to all others \nwho depend upon the appropriations contained in these bills.\n  Of the 13 appropriations bills Congress is supposed to pass every \nyear, 6 are still undone even though the fiscal year is almost one-\nthird over. Nine Federal Cabinet departments have been without fully \napproved spending plans.\n  Now, 4 months into the fiscal year, we are considering a fourth \nextension. Mr. President, it's time to act on these appropriations \nbills--not just by temporary extension, but by getting them passed. We \nshould not hold these six appropriations bills hostage in the name of \nbalancing the budget.\n  It is ironic, isn't it, that the activities financed by these \nuncompleted appropriation bills, or what is also known as domestic \ndiscretionary spending, is not the part of Federal spending that has \ncaused the budget crisis the Federal Government is facing. \nDiscretionary spending is not the sole problem. Domestic discretionary \nspending has not grown as a percentage of the GDP since 1969, the last \ntime we had a balanced budget. Domestic discretionary spending \ncomprises only one-sixth of the $1.5 trillion Federal budget, and it is \nsteadily declining.\n  Every dollar of Federal spending must be examined to see what can be \ndone better, and what we no longer need to do. However, the budget \ncannot be balanced by looking in this one area, no matter how large the \ncuts.\n  We are debating issues that have little or nothing to do with \nbalancing the budget.\n  The budget proposed by the majority party calls for $349 billion in \nsavings from discretionary spending, but that comes from a portion of \nthe budget that constitutes only 18 percent of the overall Federal \nbudget--the part of spending that is not growing and the part of the \nbudget that funds education and police and basic services we all count \non. This part of the budget is not the major source of our deficit \nproblem. We need to focus our savings on those areas of the budget that \ndon't conflict with our priorities and values.\n  How we bring back fiscal discipline makes a real difference. If we \ncare about our children, if we care about our future, if we care about \nour Nation and ensuring an opportunity for every American to achieve \nthe American Dream, we cannot abandon our commitment to education, \naccess to health care, and to creating economic opportunity.\n  That is why I cosponsored and voted for Senator Kennedy's education \namendment because I believe that we should meet our obligation to our \nchildren and to the future. If the current CR were extended for a full \nyear, education funding would be cut $3.1 billion below last year's \nlevel. Illinois would lose $72.4 million, including a $54 million cut \nin title I funding.\n  Continuing to fund education programs at 75 percent of their 1995 \nlevels will, at some point, simply become a 25-percent cut in education \nfunding. Schools that are trying to plan for the coming year will soon \nhave no choice but to assume a 25-percent cut and plan accordingly.\n  There are scientists at my alma mater, the University of Chicago, and \n\n\n[[Page S428]]\nat universities all throughout the Nation, who are awaiting approval of \ntheir grants because the National Science Foundation and NASA do not \nknow how much money is available and cannot make decisions about grant \nawards.\n  Health and safety inspections at public housing may be forced to \ncease. In Chicago last week a tragic fire took four lives; HUD couldn't \ncheck fire alarms due to budgetary uncertainty.\n  The Fish and Wildlife Service will experience delays in issuing \nwetlands permits--Illinois already has a backlog of permit requests \nfrom the last shutdown that is 8 feet tall.\n  Furthermore, there are five Superfund sites in Illinois, including \nWaukegan, Rockford, and East Cape Girardeau, that will experience \ndelays in cleanups.\n  Mr. President, these are just a few examples of how my State will be \naffected. We need to move to a balanced budget. And we need to do it in \na way that does not sacrifice the long-term goals of the American \npeople to achieve illusory short-term cuts. We need a budget that \nrestores fiscal discipline to the Federal Government. We need a budget \nbased on the realities facing Americans. Most importantly, we need a \nbudget for our future.\n  I believe that we can achieve that kind of budget, if we put aside \npartisan bickering and political point scoring, and if we get down to \nthe work the American people elected us to do.\n  I will reluctantly support this bill not because it's the answer but \nbecause we must avoid a shutdown. I hope we will use the next 45 days \nthat this CR gives us to reach the kind of overall permanent budget \nagreement that the American people want and deserve.\n\n\n                     INTERNATIONAL FAMILY PLANNING\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The continuing resolution being considered will severely \nundermine the Nation's support for the International Family Planning \nProgram. According to the terms of the CR, the International Family \nPlanning Program will receive funding at only 65 percent of its fiscal \nyear 1995 level. Also, program administrators will be forced to spend \nmoney in predetermined monthly allotments. Let's not pretend that any \nprogram can work efficiently and effectively in this manner.\n  We all know the purpose of this provision--the elimination of the \nInternational Family Planning Program. Opponents of abortion apparently \nbelieve that less family planning will lead to fewer abortions. Nothing \ncould be farther from the truth.\n  We know that abortions are reduced when family planning services are \navailable. This CR will lead to serious reductions in family planning. \nThe effect will be an increase in abortions in other nations. Our \ncolleagues opposed to abortion should not be encouraging this result.\n  International family planning is also good international health care \npolicy. By providing a wide range of services and information, family \nplanning makes a difference to millions of women around the world. It \nis estimated that approximately 300 million women will require family \nplanning services in the next decade. It is estimated that such \nservices can prevent 125,000 women from dying of complications related \nto pregnancy and childbirth. We know that these programs have reduced \ninfant mortality. Inevitably, disease, unintended pregnancies, \nabortions, and maternal deaths will increase if this restrictive \nlanguage continues to apply.\n  International family planning programs are important to the overall \nhealth of large numbers of women and children in many other countries. \nThe family planning provision in this CR is bad policy, and it should \nbe reversed at the next opportunity.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I will gladly vote for the \nKennedy amendment to restore funding for education to last year's \nlevel. Education is an area that we should not shortchange.\n  The bill before us today will continue funding for programs that do \nnot yet have year-long funding until March 15. Education programs are \ncut $3.1 billion on an annual basis, the largest Federal education cut \nin history. This is a cut our schools cannot sustain.\n  Under this bill, California's elementary and secondary schools could \nlose at least $169.8 million. For title I, programs for disadvantaged \nstudents, service to 1 in 5 students could be eliminated. Schools will \nhave to lay off title I teachers and teaching assistants that provide \nthose extra services that help these students learn. Programs like Safe \nand Drug-free Schools, Goals 2000, and student loans could lose 25 \npercent. The University of California will lose $111 million, much of \nwhich is student aid.\n  I am also concerned about the stop-and-go pattern of Federal funding \nthat we have undergone this year. This is the ninth short-term bill \nwe've considered. We are almost 4 months into the school year and 3 \nmonths into the fiscal year. Once again, we are called on to vote on a \nshort-term funding measure. This bill only funds programs for 49 days, \nuntil March 15.\n  These short-term bills are particularly unfair to our schools. Like \nbusinesses, they have to plan. In my State, at the end of January, \ncourtesy notices go out to teachers who are likely to be laid off. \nSchool districts are beginning to plan their budgets for the next \nschool year. For title I programs, schools are preparing contracts for \nteachers and other personnel. Our school districts cannot effectively \nplan with this on-again, off-again funding stream.\n  Our students, teachers, and administrators should not be held hostage \nany longer. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to restore these \neducation funds and put education funding on a more stable footing.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I think it is outrageous that, of all \nthings to choose, this latest temporary spending bill cuts spending for \nthe 100,000 Cops on the Beat Program under the 1994 crime law. I want \nto make clear that the only reason I'm voting for this continuing \nresolution is because it is a compromise and would allow States and \nlocalities to continue hiring cops for the next 49 days. The \nalternative is no cops.\n  But this is a terrible way to implement public policy. This \ncontinuing resolution would, if extended over a full year, cut the Cops \non the Beat Program by over one-half--over $1 billion promised to the \nAmerican people for cops on the street. That means that communities \nacross the Nation would lose over 13,000 police officers. That is \ntotally unacceptable.\n  This continuing resolution funds the Cops Program at 75 percent of \nthe 1995 level for outlays, which was $1.187 billion. Seventy-five \npercent of that would be $890 million for the year.\n  In contrast, full funding for the 100,000 Cops Program for 1996 is \n$1.9 billion. That is what we agreed on in the 1994 crime law. That is \nwhat was requested by the President. So this resolution would actually \ncut over $1 billion from the Cops on the Beat Program--over one-half--\nif it continued for the full year.\n  Let no one be fooled. This continuing resolution is a back door \nattempt by Republicans to reverse the gains of the 100,000 Cops Program \nand the American people will not stand for this the next time around. \nWe all know the Republicans want to change the crime law now at work. \nThey said so in their Contract With America. We all know the \nRepublicans want to eliminate the 100,000 Cops on the Beat Program.\n  They would rather see the money squandered away in a block grant that \nfunds virtually anything under the sun than to send the money directly \nto COPS for the one anticrime measure we know works--community \npolicing. Cops on the Beat.\n  The Cops on the Beat Program is overwhelmingly supported by the \nAmerican public as well as every major law enforcement group in the \ncountry. I don't know a single responsible police leader, academic \nexpert, or public official who does not agree that putting more police \nofficers on our streets and in our neighborhoods is the best way to \nfight crime.\n  Community policing enables police to fight crime on two fronts at \nonce--they are better positioned to respond and apprehend suspects when \ncrime occurs, but even more importantly, they are also better \npositioned to keep crime from occurring in the first place.\n  The reports from the field all across the Nation are the same--\ncommunity policing works. When it comes to anticrime efforts, the one \nthing we know is that more community police officers means less crime. \nAnd we should keep our word to the American people.\n\n[[Page S429]]\n\n  The 1994 crime law targets $8.8 billion for States and localities to \ntrain and hire 100,000 new community police officers over 6 years.\n  And as we pass the 1-year mark, it is already clear that the Cops \nProgram is working even beyond expectations. Already, more than 33,000 \nout of 100,000 cops are funded in every State in the Nation. And \nbecause of the way we've set it up--with a match requirement and \nspreading out the cost over a period of years--the money will continue \nto work, keeping these cops on the beat and preventing crime in our \ncommunities far into the future. In a word, the law is working.\n\n  But that progress will come to a screeching halt if my Republican \ncolleagues get their way--either through drastic spending cuts as under \nthis continuing resolution or through block grants with loopholes you \ncould drive a truck through.\n  What is one to conclude from the efforts of the Republicans to gut \nthe 100,000 Cops on the Beat Program? Is it that tax cuts to a few are \nmore important than protecting the safety of average Americans?\n  Apparently my Republican colleagues in Washington just don't seem to \nget the message. So let me make this crystal clear. If they think that \nthey will use their new targeted appropriations strategy to kill the \nCops on the Beat Program--to cut $1 billion and thousands of cops--they \nare sorely mistaken. I will do everything in my power to prevent the \nRepublicans from further undermining the 100,000 Cops Program.\n  So, although this continuing resolution funds cops at 75 percent of \nlast year's outlays for the next 49 days, this indirect ambush on the \n100,000 Cops on the Beat Program--a program demanded by the American \npeople--will not be tolerated for the full year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/26/senate-section/article/S418-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S429-S441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TAXPAYER FUNDING OF HUMAN EMBRYO RESEARCH\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I want to congratulate my colleagues in the \nHouse for adding the language in section 128 of this bill, which \nprohibits the use of taxpayer funds to create human embryos, to perform \ndestructive experiments on them, and ultimately, to destroy and discard \nthem.\n  We funded the National Institutes of Health in the earlier targeted \nappropriations legislation, but that bill did not contain this \nimportant restriction on the use of Federal funds. I have been working \non this issue for the past several months, trying to call attention to \nthe issue, and I am very pleased that we are very close to getting this \nimportant provision enacted into law.\n  Many of my colleagues might not totally understand what exactly we \nmean when we talk about human embryo research. So, before we vote on \nthis critical legislation, I would like to give a brief explanation of \nthe issue.\n  Mr. President, this is an issue that calls upon us to reaffirm the \nethical limitations that govern taxpayer-funded scientific research. It \nis an issue that calls upon us to uphold the dignity of humanity \nitself.\n\n  We know that science has benefited all of humanity in countless ways, \nbut every one of us knows that the history of scientific inquiry also \nhas its dark chapters. We have learned painful lessons from the \natrocities that have been committed in the name of scientific progress. \nWe have learned that the human subjects of scientific experiments must \ngive their fully informed and voluntary consent. We have learned that \nethical experimentation requires a proper respect for the dignity of \nthe human subject. We have learned that an experiment that is likely to \nresult in the death of, or disabling injury to, the human subject \ncannot be ethical and must never be permitted to occur.\n  These principles are enshrined in the Nuremberg Code. They can also \nbe found in the World Medical Association's Declaration of Helsinki as \nwell as other major international conventions governing scientific \nethics. They make it clear that no human being can be ethically \nregarded as an instrument--a mere means to serve the ends of another \nperson or group of persons.\n  These are absolute principles. Their framers clearly intended to \nestablish limits beyond which an ethical science would not be permitted \nto go. Suppose for a moment that it could be proven that a large number \nof people could benefit and live happier lives if we all agreed to use \na few of our fellow human beings as research subjects in experiments \nthat we knew would harm or kill them. Of course, the benefits of \nscientific research are never certain, but let's put that aside. It \nwouldn't matter. Certain ethical principles are inviolate. That means \nthat we do not subject them to cost-benefit analyses.\n\n  I must commend President Clinton for his Executive order banning \ntaxpayer-financed creation and destruction of research embryos. In \nmaking this decision, the President acted on the belief that ethics \nimposes certain limits on science. I only wish he had followed that \nlogic to a more honest and consistent conclusion.\n  Unfortunately, however, President Clinton continued to allow so-\ncalled spare embryos from in vitro fertilization programs for \nexperimentation and destruction. In other words, it's still permissible \nto use developing human beings as raw material for bizarre experiments \nthat will result in death.\n  First of all, the distinction between specially created embryos and \nso-called spare embryos is unenforceable and meaningless in practice. \nWhen the Australian Parliament considered this issue, Dr. Robert \nJansen--an advocate of embryo research--put it very plainly:\n\n       It is a fallacy to distinguish between surplus embryos and \n     specially created embryos . . . any intelligent administrator \n     of an in vitro fertilization program can, by minor changes in \n     his ordinary clinical way of going about things, change the \n     number of embryos that are fertilized. . . . It would be but \n     a trifle administratively to make these embryos surplus \n     rather than special.\n\n  The Warnock Committee, which investigated this issue in Great \nBritain, reached an identical conclusion. Furthermore, how can we say \nthat it is wrong for Government to use taxpayer money to fund the \ncreation of life for experimental purposes but say that it is \nnevertheless permissible to fund its destruction?\n  More importantly, just because a private party plans to destroy life, \nwhy should Government force taxpayers to give their blessing to that \nact? Let private parties use private money for their ethically \nchallenged experiments. Taxpayer dollars should be used to protect and \nuphold human life, not to destroy it.\n  Columnist Ellen Goodman has stated that scientific inquiry must \nrecognize the existence of ethical stop signs. President Clinton also \nacknowledged that there are ethical limits on scientific inquiry when \nhe drew the line and prohibited the creation of human life for research \npurposes. Former NIH Director Bernadine Healy probably put it best:\n\n       It's a rather profound decision to say that a government \n     agency will use taxpayer dollars to designate a class of \n     subhuman humans that will be there solely to be experimented \n     upon and then discard them at the whim of science.\n\n  Mr. President, the supposed benefits of a kind of scientific research \ndo not make that research ethical. Today, when we pass this legislation \nwe will be saying to the American people that ethics determine the \nlimits of science and not vice versa. We will be saying that in the \ninterest of science, we should not violate the fundamental principle of \nthe sanctity and dignity of all human life. I urge the President to \nsupport this important provision.\n\n\n                            balanced budget\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the provisions of the Balanced Budget \nDownpayment Act that relate to the Commerce, Justice, State, the \njudiciary, and related agencies [CJS] appropriations bill provide for \nfunding at the levels outlined in the fiscal year 1996 conference \nreport under fiscal year 1995 terms and conditions, with certain \nexceptions which are spelled out in the legislation.\n  Along with the distinguished ranking member of the subcommittee, \nSenator Hollings, I want to notify all departments and agencies funded \nunder the CJS bill that the fiscal year 1996 conference report and \nstatement of managers and the House and Senate reports relating to the \nfiscal year 1996 CJS bill should be used to the maximum extent possible \nin allocating resources under this legislation. With very few \nexceptions, the guidance provided in these documents will likely become \nthe final guidance for expenditure of fiscal year 1996 funds.\n\n[[Page S430]]\n\n\n\n                         department of justice\n\n  Office of Justice Programs--Funding is included for discretionary and \nformula grants under the Edward Byrne Memorial State and Local Law \nEnforcement Program. It is the committee's intent that discretionary \ngrants should be made in accordance with the joint statement of \nmanagers, and, that among those grants, the Justice Department should \nmake funding the requirements of State and local law enforcement \nrelated to the 1996 Olympic Games a priority.\n  Truth-in-sentencing grants--The pending bill contains language that \nwithholds all funding for a new Truth-in-Sentencing Prison Grant \nProgram until an agreement on revised legislative language can be \nreached. The sole exception to this provision is funding included under \nthis program in the conference report to help reimburse States for the \ncosts of incarcerating criminal aliens.\n  The pending bill includes a provision that applies the terms and \nconditions of the 1996 conference report and statement of managers to \namounts provided in the previous targeted appropriations legislation \nfor various Department of Justice programs for the remainder of the \nfiscal year. Within these terms and conditions, Senator Hollings and I \nwant to clarify the following points:\n  Under the Interagency Crime Drug Enforcement Program, it is the \ncommittee's intent that the Attorney General, in consultation with the \nOffice of Investigative Agencies Policies, will allocate resources \namong agencies participating in interagency crime and drug task forces \nbased on current task force requirements. It is our intent that this \nreview include a results-oriented analysis of task force operations.\n  It is the committee's intent that funding provided for the Federal \nPrison System includes both the construction of new prisons under the \nterms specified in the statement of managers and continued support for \nthe National Institute of Corrections.\n\n\n                         department of commerce\n\n  Advanced Technology Program--The pending bill provides funding for \nthe Advanced Technology Program [ATP] at a rate of operations of up to \n75 percent of the final fiscal year 1995 appropriated level. The bill \ncontains language which would prohibit funding for new ATP awards or \ngrant competitions during the period covered by this legislation. \nDuring this period, ATP funding will be restricted to program \nadministration and continuation grants for ATP projects awarded in \nfiscal year 1995 or earlier.\n  The pending bill includes language similar to a provision contained \nin the conference report on the fiscal year 1996 Commerce, Justice, \nState Appropriations Act requiring that costs associated with personnel \nactions resulting from funding reductions included in subsection 201(a) \nbill be absorbed within the total budgetary resources available to each \ndepartment or agency. This provision allows each department or agency \nto transfer funds between appropriations accounts as necessary to cover \nthe personnel costs associated with program closeouts or downsizing \nrequirements. This transfer authority is provided in addition to the \nauthorities available under fiscal year 1995 terms and conditions and \nis subject to the committee's standard reprogramming procedures.\n\n\n                DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND RELATED AGENCIES\n\n  With respect to title IV of the CJS bill, covering the Department of \nState, the United States Information Agency [USIA], and the Arms \nControl and Disarmament Agency [ACDA], funding at the conference level \ngenerally provides an operating level above what has been in effect \nunder the previous continuing resolutions.\n  For contributions to international organizations and contributions \nfor international peacekeeping activities, the amount of funds \navailable to be obligated is intended to be no higher than the \nproportionate amount of the full-year funding level provided in the \nconference report that corresponds to the number of days covered by \nthis legislation.\n  Under USIA, continued funding for the inspector general [IG] has been \nprovided for the term of this legislation. The funding is to be derived \nfrom the conference level of funding for the State Department's \ninspector general, because that level of funding was based upon the \nmerger of the USIA IG office into the State IG office. Both offices are \nto continue to prepare for the merger, which is fully anticipated to \noccur during this fiscal year.\n  With respect to educational and cultural exchange programs, the \nstatement of managers language in the conference report concerning the \ntenth paralympiad should be carried out on an expedited basis. \nSufficient funds should have been appropriated under previous \ncontinuing resolutions and the pending bill to permit this issue to be \naddressed during the period in which the current legislation is in \neffect.\n\n\n                            RELATED AGENCIES\n\n                        FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION\n\n  The committee expects that amounts provided in the bill for both the \nFederal Trade Commission and the Justice Department's Antitrust \nDivision will allow these agencies to function at the full operating \nlevels assumed in the conference report on H.R. 2076, based on \nestimated offsetting collections of $48,262,000 for each agency.\n\n\n                       LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION\n\n  Funding in this bill for the Legal Services Corporation [LSC] \nincludes interim funding for basic field programs until a new \ncompetitive grant program is implemented. The committee expects LSC to \nbegin a competitive grant program on April 1, 1996, and to be prepared \nto implement restrictions outlined in the conference report on H.R. \n2076.\n\n\n                     SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION\n\n  Small Business Development Centers--the bill provides funding for the \nSmall Business Administration [SBA] Small Business Development Center \n[SBDC] Program at the fiscal year 1996 conference level. This will \nallow SBA to continue to make funding commitments with State resource \npartners in the SBDC Program based on the fiscal year 1996 funding \nlevel provided in the conference report.\n  Disaster assitance--the committee is aware that funding levels \nprovided for the SBA Disaster Loan Program subsidies and administrative \nexpenses may be insufficient to continue the program for the full \nfiscal year, especially considering the rate of disasters thus far this \nfiscal year. The committee notes that there are two primary reasons for \nthe shortfall. First, the request for subsidy amounts for the loan \nprogram was based on proposed legislative changes modifying the \ninterest rate on SBA disaster loans. While the full request for loan \nsubsidies was appropriated, the proposed legislative changes, which are \nnot under the jurisdiction of the Appropriations Committee, have not \nbeen enacted yet. Additionally, the administration has not amended its \nbudget request to provide additional resources needed to maintain \nprogram operations, nor has it identified the offsets necessary to \nprovide those resources.\n\n  The second reason for the shortfall is the failure of the Small \nBusiness Administration to adequately budget for the appropriate level \nof administrative costs for even a normal disaster year within the \nappropriate account for this program. The committee expects SBA to \nreprogram an amount to cover the base requirements for disaster loan \nmaking within the funds provided under this act. Furthermore, the \ncommittee expects that future budget requests for administrative \nexpenses under the Disaster Loan Program account will fully cover the \ncosts of providing the services required to manage the loan program \nlevel assumed in the budget request.\n  The committee recognizes the severity of disasters such as the \ndevastating flooding in Pennsylvania and other Mid-Atlantic States \nfollowing recent storms, and is confident that the SBA will be able to \nrespond appropriately and responsibly to these dire situations within \nthe resources currently available under the Disaster Loan Program \nduring the period covered by the Balanced Budget Downpayment Act. The \ncommittee recognizes that additional funds for the SBA Disaster Loan \nProgram may be required prior to April, and believes that if additional \nresources are needed, they can be provided through the reprogramming \nprocess to assure continuation of the program through March 15. The \ncommittee will work with the administration to determine the \nappropriate level of funding for this program as well as potential \nsources of funding offsets.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I will vote for the continuing \nresolution that will prevent another Government shutdown. I do so \nbecause I do \n\n[[Page S431]]\nnot believe our country can withstand another Government shutdown.\n  I am budget weary. My home State of Maryland is budget weary. I have \n260,000 Federal employees in my State. They are budget weary. And the \nNation is budget weary.\n  Running our Government by shutdown and 30-day funding measures is \nwasteful and irresponsible. It's harmful to our country--harmful to our \ninternational standing, harmful to our credit rating, and harmful to \nthe future of our country.\n  Mr. President, the State of Maryland is home to some of the flagship \nagencies of the Federal Government. It is home to the National \nInstitutes of Health, where dedicated researchers are fighting to \ndiscover a cure for Alzheimer's disease, to Parkinson's disease, to \ncancer, and other devastating ailments. We are the home to the Food and \nDrug Administration, to the National Institute of Science and \nTechnology, and to Goddard which is piloting the Mission to Planet \nEarth.\n\n  During the last shutdown, I spent time throughout my State talking to \nFederal Employees about how the shutdown was affecting them. I talked \nto the dedicated doctors, nurses, and lab technicians at our excellent \nVeterans' Administration Hospital in Baltimore. They were on the job, \ntending to our veterans health care needs, but they weren't getting \npaid.\n  I met with agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. They were \nworking to protect our safety, to fight the war on drugs and crime--but \nthey weren't getting paid.\n  I spoke with the good people at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center--\nwhere they are scanning the universe for the secrets to life here on \nEarth. But their work was imperiled because essential contractors were \nnot getting paid.\n  After having met with these essential and valuable Federal employees, \nI am more determined than ever that we can never have another \nGovernment shutdown.\n  So, Mr. President, I will vote for this continuing resolution today. \nBut I must say that I have profound problems with many of the terms and \nconditions of this bill. The need to avoid a third shutdown cannot \nignore the very real harm that will result from the terms of this CR.\n  First of all, I am very disappointed that we are not providing the \nsame furlough protection for Federal employees that we did in previous \ncontinuing resolutions. This CR will allow agencies to furlough \nemployees for 1 workday per pay period. This could amount to a 10 \npercent pay cut for Federal employees in Maryland and across the \nNation.\n  I don't see how we can expect to maintain an effective and dedicated \nwork force when Federal employees are under constant attack. These \nassaults must stop.\n  I am also deeply distressed by the inadequate funding for education \nthat this measure contains. For this reason, I supported Senator \nKennedy's amendment to protect education programs. I know all too well \nthat schools in my State of Maryland could use any additional Federal \nfunding because times are hard right now for the public school in my \nState.\n  Without the Kennedy amendment, Maryland's college students will not \nknow if they can afford to go back to college next semester, services \nfor Maryland's disadvantaged youngsters in elementary school would end, \nand teachers would be laid off.\n  As an appropriator, I know first-hand how difficult it is to allocate \nand balance limited Federal dollars. But if the current funding levels \nare extended over the next year, it would cut education by $3.1 \nbillion--the largest education cut in history. That's why I supported \nthe Kennedy amendment. I'm disappointed it could not be approved today.\n  Furthermore, the cuts to agency budgets will have very negative \nconsequences. Cuts in the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] truly \nthreaten public health and safety.\n  This continuing resolution will cut the EPA by $1 billion. That's a \n25-percent reduction in enforcing environmental and public health \nstandards for air pollution, pesticides, and clean water. It's a 45-\npercent cut in funds needed to protect community drinking water. It's a \n30-percent cut in funds going directly to States to build wastewater \nand sewage treatment plants, and a 25-percent cut in Superfund \nhazardous waste cleanup.\n  The American people want clean drinking water. The American people \nwant hazardous and contaminated waste sites cleaned. But these deep \ncuts would make it impossible for EPA to protect the environment and \npublic health and safety and it would cause staff cuts at EPA.\n  I am also opposed to the way HUD is treated in this process. This \nNation cannot run its housing programs by continuing resolution. HUD \ncannot effectively enter into contracts to provide basic housing \nservices. Community development and emergency housing services have \nbeen unable to spend any funds to meet the very real needs of the \npeople. The uncertainty of program funds and guidelines make it \ndifficult for HUD to proceed in an intelligent fashion.\n  In addition to concerns over the education, the environment, and the \nhousing provisions, I strongly oppose the provisions in this bill that \ndeal with international family planning. By delaying and reducing our \ncontribution to international family planning, we are denying healh \ncare to the world's poorest women.\n  Those who support this provision claim to want to reduce the number \nof abortions. But the effect of this provision will be just the \nopposite. Family planning prevents unwanted pregnancies and abortions. \nYou would think this basic fact would not need to be restated on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate.\n  U.S. international family planning funds are not spent on abortion. \nSo now they are going after basic health care services that prevent \npregnancy.\n  Over 100 million women throughout the world cannot obtain or are not \nusing family planning because they are poor, uneducated, or lack access \nto care. Twenty million of these women will seek unsafe abortions. Some \nwomen will die, some will be disabled. We could prevent some of this \nneedless suffering.\n  This issue won't go away. The majority of the Senate opposes this \nirrational and cruel provision--and we will continue the fight to \nenable the world's poorest women to control and improve their lives.\n  There are other examples of how running a government by CR makes no \nsense and hurts the employees of those agencies. But the bottom line \nremains that we cannot afford another shutdown. Despite the onerous \nprovisions contained in this continuing resolution, shutting down the \nGovernment would be worse. This is why I will vote for this bill, but I \ndo so with great anguish.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to voice my strong support for \nsection 126 of H.R. 2880. That provision was sought by many American \nIndian and Alaska Native communities throughout the Nation who rely on \nthe Indian Health Service and the Bureau of Indian Affairs to provide \nessential governmental services and to build, operate, and maintain \ncritically-needed facilities for them. I comment the House and Senate \nleadership, as well as the leadership of the Appropriations Committees, \nfor including this provision.\n  Earlier this week, Senator Stevens and I asked that the House include \nfunding, through September 30, 1996, for all Native American-related \nprojects and activities within the Interior and related agencies \nappropriations bill at the level of funding provided for in the \nInterior conference report approved by the House and Senate last \nDecember. Most of what we sought finally was adopted as section 126 by \nthe House late yesterday and is before the Senate for consideration \ntoday.\n  Section 126 of H.R. 2880 provides funding through March 15, 1996, at \nthe December 1995 conference markup for all projects and activities \nfunded through two Federal agencies under the Interior and related \nagencies appropriations bill--the Indian Health Service and the Bureau \nof Indian Affairs. It is my understanding that this includes all health \nservices and related health facilities projects and activities \nadministered by the Indian Health Service, as well as all those \nprojects and activities administered by the Bureau of Indian Affairs \nunder the account headings operation of Indian programs, construction, \nIndian land and \n\n[[Page S432]]\nwater claim settlements and miscellaneous payments to Indians, \ntechnical assistance of Indian enterprises, and the Indian guaranteed \nloan program account.\n  Mr. President, on January 5, 1996, Senator Stevens and I and many \nother Senators and Representatives were able to secure funding through \nSeptember 30, 1996, for all projects and activities administered by \nNative American tribes and organizations under self-determination \ncontracts and self-governance compacts authorized by Public Law 93-638, \nas amended. Under Public Law 104-91, the full-year funding level for \nthese tribal operations was set at the amounts provided for in the \nDecember conference report.\n  Although a substantial number of native American tribes and \norganizations have assumed operational responsibilities under Public \nLaw 93-638, many of the more dependent tribes have not done so and thus \ncontinue to rely on Federal employees of the Bureau of Indian Affairs \nand the Indian Health Service to provide essential governmental \nservices. Under the continuing resolution expiring tonight, these non-\nPublic Law 93-638 activities have been funded at a sharply lower rate \nthan that provided Public Law 93-638 activities carried out by tribes, \nbecause of the great differential between the funding levels passed by \nthe House and Senate last summer in the Indian accounts. As a result, \nthere has been a huge disparity between funding levels for tribally \noperated activities and projects and for those operated by Federal \nagencies on behalf of other tribes in recent weeks.\n  Section 126 of the bill under Senate consideration today will fund \nall remaining federally operated projects and activities under the \nBureau of Indian Affairs and the Indian Health Service at the same \nlevel the Congress funded tribal-operations earlier this month. This \nwill remove any difference in funding levels between tribally-operated \nand federally operated projects or activities for the benefit of native \nAmericans. I urge my colleagues to support this provision.\n\n\n                     clarifications on restrictions\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the foreign operations provisions included in today's continuing \nresolution.\n  Some questions have been raised concerning the Brown amendment on \nPakistan and the extent of its application. I would like to take a \nminute to clarify the intent behind the amendment. The purpose of the \nBrown amendment was to release equipment bought and paid for by \nPakistan that has been held by the United States and prevented from \ndelivery. As a party to the contract between the United States and \nPakistan, it is my firm belief that the United States has significant \nobligations to tender goods that meet our contractual obligations. It \nis my view that the United States should deliver to Pakistan military \nequipment and technology that is in full working order, and that costs \naccrued in the process of bringing the equipment up to full working \norder should come from reprogramming funds from within existing \nbudgetary resources.\n  Second, questions have been raised about the provision of defense \nservices. The Brown amendment specifically states:\n\n       (4) Notwithstanding the restrictions contained in this \n     subsection, military equipment, technology, or defense \n     services, other than F-16 aircraft, may be transferred to \n     Pakistan pursuant to contracts or cases entered into before \n     October 1, 1990.\n\n  It is the specific intent of this subsection to ensure that all \ncontracts or cases entered into prior to October 1, 1990, are able to \nbe reinstated, as well as all military equipment or technology \ntransferred other than F-16 aircraft. This authorizes the provision of \ndepot level assistance, contract follow-on support and contractor \nengineering, management and technical services, including engine depot \nrepair. Included would be the ability for Pakistan, under existing \nforeign military sales cases, to renew existing support contracts or to \nenter into new contracts for the support of the equipment that is \ntransferred.\n  Also questioned has been the subsection permitting the President to \nreimburse the Government of Pakistan for any amounts paid in storage \ncosts. The subsection requires that the payments have no budgetary \nimpact, which means that the President may reprogram any existing funds \nto repay the Pakistani Government, but that he is not authorized to \nexpend funds that would be scored by the Congressional Budget Office as \nrequiring an additional appropriation.\n  Pakistan has been an important friend and ally of the United States. \nIt is my hope that this amendment will begin the process of \nreinvigorating our relationship.\n\n\n opposition to prohibition of federal funding for human embryo research\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the language in \nthe continuing resolution which prohibits Federal funding of human \nembryo research.\n  All this prohibition does is close out venues for medical research \nthat could save people's lives. Prohibiting Federal funding of human \nembryo research will hold the health of millions of Americans hostage \nto antichoice politics.\n  Let me highlight a few important facts about human embryo research. \nHuman embryo research does not involve human embryos or fetuses \ndeveloping inside the body. Rather, this research involves the \nexamination of embryos only in a culture dish.\n  Nor does human embryo research involve abortion or the use of aborted \nfetal tissue. Human embryo research also does not involve cloning or \nthe creation of nonhuman life forms. Lastly, human embryo research does \nnot involve genetic engineering or the sale of embryos.\n  This research involves embryos donated by couples who have undergone \ncertain medical treatments which help them have children. A woman \nreceives hormone shots that cause her ovaries to produce eggs, which in \nturn are removed and fertilized in a petri dish by a man's sperm.\n  Some of the embryos are returned to the womb with hopes a pregnancy \nwill result. If there are remaining embryos, they can be used for \nresearch with the couples permission.\n  A prohibition on embryo research will severely restrict high-quality \nscientific research that could lead to a variety of beneficial medical \ntreatments. Medical research on human embryos shows promise for the \ntreatment and prevention of some forms of infertility, cancers, and \ngenetic disorders, and may help lead to a reduction in miscarriages and \nthe development of improved contraceptive methods.\n  Human embryo research could help enable hospitals to create tissue \nbanks which would store tissue that could be used for bone marrow \ntransplants, spinal cord injuries, and skin replacement for burn \nvictims.\n  As doctors have discovered, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's \ndisease are the result of damaged degenerating nerve cells and tissues. \nHuman embryo research could ultimately result in development of \nuniversal donor cells and tissue to replace what was lost to nerve \ndamage.\n\n  Human embryo research is also vital in the prevention of cancer. \nKnowing how cells divide and grow will help researchers to better \nunderstand how and why cancer cells grow. This research may lead to \nbetter methods of prevention and treatment for leukemia, breast cancer, \nprostate cancer, and many other cancers.\n  Between 1975 and 1993, due to a combination of regulatory \nrestrictions and administrative inaction, no Federal funding was made \navailable for human embryo research. As a result, the United States has \nfallen far behind the rest of the world in this area.\n  Although the United States often leads the world in biomedical \nresearch, the most recent breakthroughs in assisted reproductive \ntechnologies and human embryology have come from England, France, \nItaly, and Australia.\n  In 1994, the Director of NIH created a Human Embryo Testing Research \nPanel to recommend guidelines for reviewing applications for Federal \nresearch funds. In September 1994, the panel endorsed human embryo \nresearch finding that ``the promise of human benefit from research is \nsignificant, carrying great potential benefit to infertile couples, and \nto families with genetic conditions, and to individuals and families in \nneed of effective therapies for a variety of diseases.''\n  Federal funding for these studies will help assure that a single set \nof scientific and ethical standards is put in \n\n[[Page S433]]\nplace for this research. No such official standards exist now.\n  Compromise language was proposed in the House and should be \nconsidered in the Senate as well. Pursuant to recommendations developed \nby an NIH panel of experts the language would state: ``None of the \nfunds made available by this Act may be used to support the creation of \nhuman embryos for research purposes.''\n  This prohibition on medical research, which could save people's \nlives, is yet another example of the misguided attack by anti-choice \nforces on women's health and on their reproductive rights.\n  We cannot let this happen. I urge Members to vote to strike the \nlanguage in this continuing resolution which calls for a total \nprohibition of Federal funding for human embryo research.\n\n\n                  foreign operations conference report\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \ndistinguished Senator from Kentucky, Senator Mitch McConnell, on his \nunending efforts to produce a foreign operations conference report. It \nhas been a very difficult and controversial process, but he has \npersevered and deserves the Senate's praise as we pass the bill today. \nRobin Cleveland of his staff and Jim Bond of the Appropriations staff \nalso deserve recognition for their hard work.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to ensure that the language included \nin the continuing resolution will enact all terms, conditions and \ngeneral provisions that were included in the original conference report \npassed by both Houses of Congress. Is that the intent of the chairman \nof the subcommittee?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Senator from Colorado is correct. \nIt is our intent that the language included in title III of the \ncontinuing resolution, H.R. 2880, will incorporate by reference the \nentire conference report for H.R. 1868, the appropriations bill for all \nForeign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs other than \nthe substitute for amendment 115 included in the language of the \nconference report.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank my distinguished colleague, and note that included \nwill be important legislative provisions such as the Middle East Peace \nFacilitation Act, clarifications on restrictions in our relationship \nwith Pakistan and improvements to the NATO Participation Act of 1994.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to make a few brief \nremarks on one section of the continuing resolution which includes the \nforeign operations conference report.\n  Over the past several months the Senate and House have sent the bill \nback and forth because of differences over the population program and \nabortion restrictions. After no less than nine votes on the issue we \nhave finally produced a solution which satisfies the concerns of those \nof us who strongly oppose abortion with the interests of those who wish \nto fund AID's current population programs. It is not a perfect solution \nby any account, but it is the best we were able to achieve.\n  I am pleased we were able to negotiate a solution to the abortion \nconcerns because I believe there are many provisions in this bill which \nserve important national priorities. Let me briefly review some of the \nkey provisions and conditions of the foreign operations bill.\n  We have fully funded our Camp David partnership and strengthened our \ninterests in the region by extending the Middle East Peace Facilitation \nAct. Once again, the Congress has made clear how high a priority we \nplace on securing a regional peace and advancing stability. The tragic \nloss of Itzhak Rabin's life and leadership serves as a reminder of how \nquickly events may change in the region but our commitment must remain \nsteadfast.\n  As we are all well aware, there have also been major changes over the \npast several months in Russia. President Yeltsin has fired or removed \nevery single person who advanced our common interests in economic and \npolitical reform. While the administration continues to sing the same \ntune, that reform is inevitable and there is no looking back, I am \ndeeply concerned about the implications of these developments.\n  For 3 years, I have pressed for a shift in both policy and resource \nemphasis to assure balance in our relations with the NIS. With the \nchange in the Congress, we have now been able to change the ``Russia \nfirst'' approach insofar as this bill is concerned. This year, we have \nearmarked $225 million for Ukraine, a minimum of $85 million for \nArmenia and recommended $30 million for Georgia. We have also directed \n$15 million be made available to establish a Trans-Caucasus Enterprise \nFund and $50 million for the Western NIS and the Central Asian \nEnterprise Funds to support the emerging private sectors.\n  Within those earmarked resources we have set aside funds for specific \nprograms which directly serve American interests including a nuclear \nsafety initiative in Ukraine to prevent another Chernobyl incident and \nresources targeting law enforcement training and exchanges.\n  The alarming increase in international crime emanating from Russia \nand other NIS republics is already having an impact here in the United \nStates. The $12.6 million included in the conference report will allow \nthe FBI, DEA, and other U.S. agencies to aggressively address these \nproblems. It is my expectation that Judge Freeh will have primary \nresponsibility for developing and coordinating a strategy for the \nregion and, he will, in turn, work closely with his counterpart agency \nheads to disburse funds either through our international law \nenforcement center in Budapest or on a country by country, case by case \nbasis.\n  The final provision regarding the NIS which I believe serves our \ninterests links aid to Russia to termination of the nuclear deal with \nIran. In the interest of maximizing the administration's leverage the \ncondition begins 3 months after the date of enactment of this bill \ngiving the administration ample time to negotiate a solution to this \nproblem.\n  Beyond the NIS, I think it is worth pointing out that the Senate's \npositions on a range of issues have been included in the conference \nreport. We linked the provision of assistance to the Korean Peninsular \nEnergy Development Organization to concrete progress in the North-South \nrelationship. We resolved the long standing dispute over equipment \npurchased by Pakistan. We included legislative language introduced by \nSenator Brown which I cosponsored and strongly supported outlining a \nspecific strategy for expanding NATO. We have earmarked $2 million to \nsupport democracy and freedom of the press in Burma, one of the most \nrepugnant and repressive regimes on Earth. And, the bill also included \nthe terms of the Humanitarian Corridors Act which should help guarantee \nsafe passage of crucial assistance to countries with dire needs.\n  Finally, I think we provide strong support for our export agencies \nand activities. I just received a note from Ken Brody, the recently \nretired Chairman of the Export-Import Bank. He pointed out that with \nbillions of people joining the free market for the first time, \n``initial market shares are being established that will set the \npatterns for years to come. We cannot afford to let other countries \ngive their companies an unfair advantage.'' With the strong backing of \nthis bill, Exim and our other trade agencies have helped U.S. companies \nand ``exporters compete and win the global economy and thereby create \nhigh paying American jobs.''\n  We have included each of these initiatives and funding levels while \nstill affording the administration a measure of flexibility. \nSpecifically, flexibility has been enhanced by consolidating a variety \nof development assistance accounts into a single flexible fund and we \nhave provided transfer authority between accounts. For example, NIS \nresources can be used to fund the Warsaw Initiative and Partnership for \nPeace programs.\n  In conclusion, this bill sets a new course for our foreign assistance \nprograms. The taxpayers should be enormously relieved to learn that we \nwere able to reduce foreign assistance from last year's level by nearly \n$1.5 billion and were $2.6 billion below the administration's actual \nrequest. Even with these significant cuts, I believe the foreign \noperations bill effectively promotes democracy, free markets, and U.S. \neconomic interests and protects our national security.\n  Mr. President, I would appreciate inserting a colloquy between \nSenator Brown and myself in the Record immediately following my \nremarks. Apparently, because of the abbreviated nature of the text of \nthe continuing \n\n[[Page S434]]\nresolution, there appears to be some confusion over the meaning of the \nlanguage. I hope this colloquy clarifies that the entire conference \nreport funding levels, terms, and conditions accompanying H.R. 1868 are \nincluded in this bill and will be law when the President signs the \ncontinuing resolution.\n\n\n         Authorities Exercised under the Continuing Resolution\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I seek recognition to engage in a brief \ncolloquy with the chairman of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee.\n  I ask the distinguished Senator from Washington the following \nquestion: Does the continuing resolution we are about to adopt fulfill \nour commitment to continue funding for departments and agencies for \nwhich regular appropriations measures have not been provided, and our \ncommitment to Federal workers at those departments and agencies that \nthey will continue to go to their jobs and be paid for their hard work?\n  Mr. GORTON. The continuing resolution we are about to adopt fulfills \na commitment to continue reasonable funding of those departments and \nagencies for which regular appropriations measures have not been signed \ninto law. It also fulfills our commitment to eliminate significant \nuncertainty for Federal workers who will stay on the job through the \nresolution's coverage period, seeing that the Federal Government \ncontinues to operate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. In that context, I believe we must also be very clear \nabout certain priorities we expect to see addressed by the departments \nand agencies that will continue to operate under this resolution. \nFirst, employees who are at work are expected to fulfill their \nadministrative and other regular program duties within the funding \nlevel provided. Under this measure all activities are covered through \nMarch 15, not just visitor services. Those duties that are necessary to \ncontinue the revenue generating activities of the Federal Government \nshould certainly be a priority for continuation under this resolution \nas should other statutory responsibilities assigned to the agencies. \nThat means that normal approval of permits for such activities as oil \nand gas operation on Federal lands and offshore should continue, as \nshould the administration of other programs that provide income to the \nU.S. Treasury. Surely the continuation of such activities should join \nthose necessary to protect human health and safety as priorities under \nthe reduced spending levels of the continuing resolution we are \nconsidering. Would my distinguished colleague agree that this is a \nreasonable expectation under continuing authority for agency \noperations?\n  Mr. GORTON. I fully agree with the Senator from New Mexico that \nroutine operations should continue under this continuing resolution.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator for this understanding. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, every Senator is aware that the continuing \nresolution now before the Senate represents a less than perfect \nsolution to the impasse over the unsigned fiscal year 1996 \nappropriations bills. As chairman of the Interior Appropriations \nSubcommittee, I'd like to take a moment to discuss why the Interior \nbill remains unsigned, and why I am beginning to question whether we \nwill be able to enact a bill this year.\n  Our system of Government is based on checks and balances. To enact \nlegislation and govern effectively, cooperation, and compromise are \nrequired. Indeed, the President made cooperation and compromise the \ncentral theme of his State of the Union Address Tuesday night.\n  Sadly, there seems to be little cooperation and virtually no \ncompromise with regard to the Interior bill. Despite the fact that \nHouse and Senate negotiators have made many significant changes to the \nbill to address the President's concerns, the administration has shown \nlittle willingness to accommodate a number of serious congressional \npolicy concerns.\n  Unfortunately for those agencies funded by the bill, this refusal \nwill result in continued uncertainty and reduced funding. In many \ncases, the agencies hit hardest by continued operation under continuing \nresolutions are the very agencies for which the administration \nexpresses its support.\n  The administration's demands include complete elimination of a number \nof legislative provisions, as well as additional funding for a variety \nof programs.\n  The House and Senate remain willing to consider additional funding \nfor some Interior programs should such funding become available as part \nof a broader balanced budget agreement. But in the absence of such an \nagreement, the subcommittee cannot simply print additional money to \nfund the President's wish list and agree to send the bill to our \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  Without a budget agreement, any increases for favored programs must \nbe offset within the subcommittee's 602(b) allocation. The \nadministration is well aware of this fact, but has not made a single \nproposal to reallocate funds within the bill to benefit the programs it \nhas identified as priorities. This is not a constructive approach.\n  Neither has the administration proposed compromise language to \nresolve the legislative provisions in dispute. It simply continues to \ninsist that such provisions be removed entirely--refusing to recognize \nthat these provisions address real problems and concerns, expressing \nlittle appreciation for the many compromises already made by Congress, \nand scarcely acknowledging that some provisions objectionable to the \nadministration have already been dropped altogether.\n  As we have moved through the various steps of the appropriations \nprocess, the Interior subcommittees have consciously taken into account \nthe administration's policy statements and the President's veto message \nof December 18. A deliberate effort was made to address the \nadministration's concerns as well as the concerns of many Members of \nthe House and Senate.\n  I think it is worth reviewing just how far we have come in addressing \nthe administration's objections.\n\n\n                             FUNDING ISSUES\n\n                            Indian programs\n\n  The Administration has criticized the level of funding provided for \nIndian programs. In response to these concerns--as well as those of \nother Members--House and Senate conferees have agreed to provide $111.5 \nmillion more for the Bureau of Indian Affairs than was provided in the \noriginal Senate bill. This includes $25 million in new funding added to \nthe bill since completion of the first conference agreement.\n  Conferees have also agreed to add $25 million to the bill for Indian \nhealth programs, giving the Indian Health Service a 1-percent increase \nover its fiscal year 1995 funding level.\n  Indian programs account for $3.6 billion of the $12.2 billion \nincluded in the Interior bill that was vetoed by the President. This \nrepresents 30 percent of the total funding provided. In a year in which \noverall funding for the Interior bill was reduced by 10 percent from \nfiscal year 1995, it is remarkable that these Indian programs were \nreduced by only 4 percent. For the administration to assert that these \nprograms have been treated unfairly is simply false.\n\n                          Energy conservation\n\n  The Administration has also expressed its opposition to funding \nlevels for energy conservation programs. While these programs have, \nindeed, been reduced significantly, 29 percent, from the fiscal year \n1995 level, this reduction comes only after a 105-percent increase \nsince fiscal year 1990.\n  The fiscal year 1996 bill that was vetoed by the President would fund \nconservation programs well above fiscal year 1993 levels. I cannot \nthink of any other major program in the Interior bill that seen such an \nastronomical increase over the last 3 years.\n\n                  National parks, refuges, and forests\n\n  Because this Congress shares the President's desire to protect our \nnatural heritage and provide for the effective management of public \nlands, the operating accounts of the land management agencies were \nprotected.\n  Though funding provided in the Interior bill is reduced by 10 percent \noverall, the combined operating accounts of the National Park Service, \nthe Forest Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Bureau of \nLand Management are reduced by just 3 percent. The operating account \nfor the Park Service actually receives a slight increase, and $2 \nmillion has been added to the continuing resolution as a downpayment \nfor the catastrophic flood damage to the C Canal Park.\n\n                      National Biological Service\n\n  Partly in response to administration concerns--and because I \npersonally \n\n[[Page S435]]\nagree that good science is vital to the effective management of our \npublic lands--funding for research currently conducted by the National \nBiological Service has been increased by $24 million over the level \noriginally proposed by the House.\n  Though the Biological Service would be terminated in name, natural \nresource research critical to the missions of the various Interior \nagencies will continue to be performed under the strong leadership of \nthe U.S. Geological Survey.\n\n\n                            LANGUAGE ISSUES\n\n                             Mining patents\n\n  The fiscal year 1996 Interior bill continues the moratorium on new \nmining patents demanded by the President and the House of \nRepresentatives. This represents a major concession from the original \nconference provision, which received 53 votes in the Senate and had the \nsupport of a majority of conferees.\n\n                         Endangered Species Act\n\n  The fiscal year 1996 Interior bill includes a moratorium on \nEndangered Species Act listings and critical habitat designations \npending reauthorization of the act itself. While the administration \nobjects to this provision, exactly such a moratorium was signed into \nlaw by the President in 1995.\n  Sixty Senators voted to support the moratorium in the hope that a \ntime out would promote enactment of a bill to reauthorize and reform \nthe ESA. To this end, I and several other Members of the House and \nSenate have introduced legislation to reauthorize the act and make \nreforms we feel are long overdue. For all its expressions of support \nfor the existing act, the administration has yet to propose legislation \nto reauthorize it.\n  It should also be noted that the fiscal year 1996 bill vetoed by the \nPresident includes $65 million explicitly for ESA programs--a \nsignificant sum considering that authorization for such funding expired \nin 1992.\n\n                        Tongass National Forest\n\n  President Clinton's veto message states that the Tongass provision in \nthe Interior bill would allow harmful clear-cutting, require the sale \nof timber at unsustainable levels, and dictate the use of an outdated \nforest plan.\n  In response, we have proposed to modify the Tongass language to \nprevent explicitly the mandating of clear-cutting or the sale of \ntimber. In addition, the language would be modified to stipulate that \nnothing in the Tongass provision should be construed to limit the \nSecretary's use any new information, or prejudice future revision, \namendment, or modification of the forest plan. These latest \nmodifications would be applied to the most recent Tongass language, \nwhich has already been modified substantially from its original form. \nModifications already made include dropping sufficiency language, \ndropping the reference to the preferred forest plan alternative, and \ndropping the prohibition of habitat conservation areas.\n  Despite these compromises, the administration continues to insist on \ncomplete removal of the language, contrary to the views of a majority \nof Alaskans and those who represent them.\n\n                        Mojave National Preserve\n\n  The Interior bill vetoed by the President provides the National Park \nService [NPS] $500,000 to develop the general management plan for the \nMojave National Preserve. Management of the preserve would remain the \nresponsibility of the Bureau of Land Management, which has had the \nmanagement responsibility of the area for years.\n  However, the Bureau of Land Management would be able to use NPS \nseasonal employees to assist in the management of the preserve. The \noriginal House provision did not allow for any Park Service \nparticipation in the preserve, and would have provided only $1 to the \nPark Service for related activities. The effect of the current \nprovision would be minimal in terms of the management of the preserve, \nbut would be significant in allowing the Park Service an opportunity to \ngain the trust of the people who will be its neighbors for the \nforeseeable future before taking over on a permanent basis.\n\n                            Marbled Murrelet\n\n  The administration objects to a provision in the Interior conference \nagreement that would have prohibited it from redefining the known to be \nnesting provision included in previously passed timber salvage \nlegislation. The House and Senate offered to remove this provision from \nthe conference agreement in an effort to reach an agreement with the \nadministration on the overall bill. The offer by the House and Senate--\nwhich represents a significant compromise--is scarcely acknowledged by \nthe administration.\n\n                        Columbia basin ecosystem\n\n  The administration's veto statement expresses several concerns about \nthe Columbia basin ecosystem provision in the conference agreement. The \nstatement specified that the provision ``would impede the \nimplementation of our comprehensive plan for managing public lands,'' \nand exclude ``information on fisheries and watersheds.'' The result of \nthe conference provision, according to the administration, is ``a \npotential return to legal gridlock on timber harvesting, grazing, \nmining, and other economically important activities.''\n  The House and Senate presented an offer to the administration that \nwould have met some of these concerns. That offer would expressly \npermit the administration to include information on fisheries and \nwatersheds in the Columbia basin plan. Once again, however, even this \nsignificant concession was not enough.\n  There is one point, however, on which the administration and the \nHouse and Senate authors of this provision fundamentally disagree--\nproviding increased opportunities for legal gridlock and frivolous \nlawsuits. The administration's veto statement states that the \nconference language would present a potential return to legal gridlock. \nThis makes for a nice sound-bite--but the exact opposite is true.\n  We believe that the administration's current policy--based upon the \nlack of success of similar endeavors by this administration--presents a \ntremendous opportunity for legal gridlock. The current policy is a one-\nsize-fits all approach, created in response to a legal challenge by \nenvironmentalists, and will undoubtedly create opportunity for further \nchallenge by environmentalists. The House and Senate offer to the \nadministration would preclude the filing of frivolous lawsuits--exactly \nthe goal the administration professes to seek.\n\n                      Rescission bill flexibility\n\n  The administration has professed a desire to repeal portions of \nlanguage relating to timber sales included in section 2001(k) of the \nfiscal year 1995 rescissions bill. However, when Senator Hatfield and I \nput together a proposal to grant the administration greater flexibility \nin implementing section 2001(k), it was not greeted with much \nenthusiasm. The provision will allow the administration to trade out of \nsensitive harvest areas while at the same time keeping the modest \nharvest levels it promised as a part of a timber settlement.\n  Mr. President, there are countless other instances in which conferees \non the Interior bill modified provisions or increased funding for \nprograms to address administration concerns. Yet these efforts have \ngone virtually unacknowledged. Until yesterday, during my conversation \nwith the President's Chief of Staff, there had been little indication \nthat there was any serious desire to reach closure on the Interior bill \non any basis other than a complete agreement with the administration's \nbig, intrusive Government policies.\n  In the absence of a settlement, agencies funded in the Interior bill \ncontinue to lurch along from month to month, from continuing resolution \nto continuing resolution. Employee morale is low, and programs \nsupported by both the administration and Congress are suffering.\n  Mr. President, we have come more than halfway in compromises with the \nWhite House on provisions it finds objectionable. It is time for the \nadministration to stop posturing and close the deal.\n\n\n                      NINTH CONTINUING RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the Continuing Appropriations Resolution \nbefore us today is the ninth, let me repeat, the ninth continuing \nresolution for fiscal year l996. I cannot recall during my service in \nthe U.S. Senate another time when the funding of basic services that \npeople need and the concern for people's daily lives have been treated \nso cavalierly by the majority. This is a misuse of the appropriations \n\n[[Page S436]]\nprocess, and the fact that this is the ninth continuing resolution \ndemonstrates amply and clearly in my mind the inability of the party \nthat currently holds the majority in Congress to govern.\n  In some areas, the amounts contained in this stop-gap resolution will \nbarely keep basic services operating. This is not, in my view, what the \nAmerican people want, it is certainly not what they deserve, and it \nmost assuredly does not reflect the American people's priorities. The \nAmerican people will have the opportunity in the elections this fall to \nexpress their views on the priorities we have seen the Republicans \nadvance. I am confident the proponents of those misplaced priorities \nwill be shaken by the voice of the people.\n  The last Government shutdown cost Americans $1.4 billion. Its effects \nare still being felt. Approximately 170,000 veterans did not receive \ntheir December GI bill education benefits on time, delaying action on \nsome 87,000 initial benefits claims and nearly 70,000 certifications. \nMore than 200,000 veterans disability and compensation claims were \nadded to the backlog during the last shutdown. More than 5,000 small \nbusinesses saw their government-guaranteed financing delayed. Hundreds \nof Superfund toxic waste cleanups were suspended, and more than $2.2 \nbillion in American exports were delayed because their licenses could \nnot be processed. Thousands of Americans were prevented from business \nor other travel abroad because passports were not issued. Thousands of \nAmericans were prevented from enjoying or learning from their natural \nor historical American heritage as national parks and forests and \nfederally funded museums and art galleries were closed to them.\n  We simply cannot afford another Government shutdown, so this measure \nrepresents a compromise. The funding levels it contains are far from \nadequate for many Government activities upon which Americans depend or \nwhich have a daily impact on their lives. I speak specifically about \nthose items supported through the Labor/Health and Human Services/\nEducation budget--education grants for students, assistance for \ndisadvantged students, worker training and retraining, summer youth \njobs, Americorps and Head Start, and through the VA-HUD-Independent \nAgencies budget, like health care for veterans and environmental \ncleanup activities.\n  I also am deeply disturbed by the funding caps imposed by this \nlegislation at 75 percent of last year's expenditures on such critical \nlaw enforcement activities as the cops on the beat program--or COPS--\nand drug courts. Which 25 percent of our communities will not see a cop \nwalk down their streets because of these caps? Which 25 percent of the \ndrug offenders will not be prosecuted in the drug courts because of \nthese caps?\n  These caps also will hurt the Advanced Technology Program that has \nhelped dozens of entrepreneurs and researchers in Massachusetts with \ngood ideas for new technologies to bring their ideas to the \ncommercialization stage. ATP has worked in Massachusetts to bring forth \nnew products as diverse as hip replacement procedures and fire \ndetection codes to benefit consumers.\n  Funds are also affected for critical scientific research to help cure \ndiseases, research conducted through National Institutes of Health \ngrants by medical institutions and teaching hospitals in \nMassachusetts--whose world-renowned research institutions have been \nchosen to receive grants from NIH sufficient to rank the Commonwealth \nthird among States in receipt of NIH grants.\n  Mr. President, it is not with great enthusiasm or, indeed, any \nenthusiasm that I will support this measure. The process that has \nbrought us to this ninth continuing resolution is a disgrace. And it is \nalso a disgrace that once this bill passes, which I reluctantly hope it \nwill, the Senate will not remain here to work at hammering out an \nagreement on the budget or to pass the normal appropriations bills, or \nto cleanly extend the debt limit to honor this Nation's full faith and \ncredit commitment to those from whom it borrows money. I predict we \nwill be back here to repeat this shameful exercise again and again this \nyear. The American people deserve better.\n  But we are caught in a momentous clash of philosophies and politics--\nwith a new group of Republicans zealously committed to imposing their \npersonal ideological beliefs throughout Government. Those ideologues \nhave proven themselves entirely willing to bring Government to a \nwrenching, grinding halt, regardless of who is hurt or how badly, if \nthey are not satisfied with the rapidity or extent of movement toward \ntheir goals.\n  In the face of such a group, the best we have been able to hope for \nis a compromise--with which neither side is satisfied. President \nClinton spoke eloquently during his State of the Union Address Tuesday \nnight about the necessity under the circumstances to negotiate and \nenact such compromises in order to keep the business of our Nation \nmoving forward and minimize injury of innocent Americans who must \ndepend on the services that only Government can provide. Up until \nyesterday, the Republican majority in the House has been entirely \nunwilling to countenance any significant compromise.\n  While I am extremely disappointed about the contents of this \nlegislation, and believe the American people will be the ones who are \nhurt by its contents--or, more accurately, its omissions--I am relieved \nthat the House Republicans have finally exhibited a willingness to \nengage in legislative compromise. At least the Government will keep \nrunning so that it will continue to provide most of its services to \nmost of those who need them. There will be some who will be hurt, I \nregret to say. But we will struggle along. That is to be preferred to \nthe unquantifiable and needless suffering that the Republican House \nmajority imposed on the Nation up to this point.\n  I am hopeful that we will be able during the remainder of this year \nto reach more suitable solutions regarding more of the services on \nwhich Americans depend--while we also find agreement on a fair way to \nachieve a balanced budget in 7 years that provides for needed \ninvestment in our future, human, technological, and infrastructure.\n  Ultimately, I look toward November for the American people to \npronounce their views and priorities, and to elect a Congress that will \npursue the best interests of the country and not a narrow ideological \nagenda. In the meantime, we will pass this resolution, the President \nwill sign it, and the Nation will limp on for a while longer.\n  Mr. HATFIELD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I do not know of any other amendments \nthat we have to be discussed or debated on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will withhold just one moment, \nthe Senate will be in order.\n  The chairman of the Appropriations Committee is recognized.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, we stand ready to do any further \nbusiness on this CR. If not, I would ask for a third reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further amendment----\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I know there is a lot of anguish on the \npart of our colleagues who would like to exercise the constitutional \nright of the Senate to amend a bill on revenue related matters that \ncomes to us from the House, even though the Constitution says it must \nbe originated from the House of Representatives. But as I said in the \nopening statement today, we are literally here today with a gun to our \nhead in the parliamentary situation in which the House provided us with \nthis product as of today and have declared that they are not in session \ntoday for legislative business. Therefore, any changes in this \nparticular product is going to require return to the House. \n\n[[Page S437]]\n\n\n  If they are not in session today for legislative business, we are \nfacing a midnight curfew of whether the Government shuts down. So \nconsequently, as much as I detest and decry this process we find \nourselves in--I would like very much to offer some amendments to this \nmyself because family planning is not satisfactory to me--as Senator \nByrd, as the comanager of this bill, indicated in his opening \nstatement, he affirmed my analysis of where we were in this particular \nbind and also urged his colleagues not to offer any amendments, because \nany change on this continuing resolution we have--any change--is \nrequired to go back to the House of Representatives.\n  They made it very clear that they may be subject to the call of the \nChair, but not for legislative business. So there we are.\n  I want to just say to my colleagues, Senator Byrd and I have not \ncontrived this situation. We have had absolutely nothing to do with it, \nexcept in the sense that we had given to them many of our own thoughts \nand hoped they would incorporate them. They incorporated some. \nCongressman Livingston, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, \nsigned off on a Florida tomato problem. I signed off on a Florida \ntomato problem. We have another committee that is involved in this and \nhas objected. Therefore, it was not included.\n  We have been trying to craft this by telephoning across the great \nrotunda of the Capitol Building. And that is not a satisfactory way to \ndo business either.\n  So here we are, not just with the House alone, but with the \njurisdictions, that are very legitimate jurisdictions, that have a part \nin these actions that are taken by the Appropriations Committee.\n  We had a problem on timber salvage. We cannot get the White House to \nsign off on that one because we are trying to help the White House have \nmore flexibility in that action taken.\n  So there are a lot of players here involved between the House, the \nSenate, both sides of the aisle, authorizing committees, the White \nHouse. We are in a very complex situation made more so by the gun to \nthe head that we have in dealing with this issue.\n  So I urge my colleagues to refrain from offering amendments because, \nas much as I may agree and sympathize, understand the need, I am in a \nsituation as a comanager of this bill. Senator Byrd urged as well, \nplease do not offer amendments because we will have to fight every \namendment, not on the merits of the case, but on the parliamentary \nsituation we are in.\n  I do not think anyone here wants to raise the issue or the \npossibility of shutting the Government down again. Nobody wins. \nEverybody loses on that one, I think we have all come to understand.\n  But if the Senate, constitutional as it is--the House has to take any \naction on any change we make on this. And they are not in today for \nlegislative business which has freed up their membership. We face the \nproblem of shutting down the Government. So that is the problem we \nhave.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have listened closely to the words of \nthe chairman of my committee, and my friend, someone I admire very \nmuch. I realize he is in an untenable kind of position. But it is this \nSenator's understanding that the House is in session subject to the \ncall of the Chair.\n\n  The chairman of our committee, the Senator from Oregon, has stated \nthat they would be in subject to the call of the Chair, but not for the \npurpose of working on this continuing resolution. It seems that we have \nbeen put in a position that no matter how bad the CR might be, we have \nto take it or else.\n  If we have an amendment--and I do have an amendment that no one can \nargue does not save us money. It saves money by getting the Office of \nInspector General funded so they can go after waste, fraud and abuse. I \nhave a letter from her dated 2 days ago where we are literally losing \nmillions of dollars every day because the Office of Inspector General \nhas not been funded fully. I think this is not anyone's purpose. I \nthink this is probably just an oversight of the House that they did \nthis.\n  I cannot imagine that, if we were to adopt that amendment, send it \nback to the House, they could not approve that in 30 seconds. It does \nnot add to the debt or anything like that. In fact, it is going to save \na lot of money for our taxpayers by going after waste, fraud and abuse \nin the Medicare Program.\n  So I, as much as I sympathize with the chairman of the committee, \nmust really object to having a gun held at our heads to the point where \nwe cannot even add an amendment that will save hundreds of millions of \ndollars for our taxpayers by going after the scam artists and others \nwho are ripping off the Medicare system. I just find this startling \nthat we cannot do that, if I understand this correctly.\n  So, Mr. President, I will be sending an amendment to the desk. It is \nvery straightforward. It simply assures that our efforts to stop fraud, \nwaste and abuse in Medicare will not be cut. The funds are our main \nline of defense against Medicare fraud by the Office of the Inspector \nGeneral of Health and Human Services through the end of the fiscal year \nat last year's level.\n  I am told that it would add about $5.2 million to this effort. That \nis, in the scheme of things, not a lot of money. But what does that get \nus? The GAO has reported that as much as 10 percent of Medicare funds \nare lost each year to fraud, waste and abuse.\n  How much money is that? Well, this year the Medicare funds are going \nto send out about $180 billion. So 10 percent of that is $18 billion, \nthis year alone, lost to fraud, waste and abuse. That is over $500 for \neach and every Medicare beneficiary.\n  As I said, the inspector general's activities are our main line of \ndefense against Medicare fraud. Even at last year's funding level, they \ndo not have enough to do the job. Now they are being cut even further. \nAt a time when there is a discussion of major cuts to Medicare, \ndoubling the Medicare premiums that seniors have to pay, we should not \nbe cutting our effort to stop the fraud, waste and abuse.\n  I think it makes common sense to stop the waste first. It is clearly \ndocumented that for every dollar we invest in the inspector general's \nactivities, we save the taxpayers $15. That is not something in the \nfuture. That is actual money that they are recouping for us on a daily \nbasis. Yet this bill before us cuts that program.\n  Mr. President, I was very concerned about the possible impact that \nGovernment shutdowns and these cuts have had and is having on our \nnational fight against Medicare fraud, waste and abuse. So last week I \nwrote to the inspector general, Inspector General June Gibbs Brown, to \nask her what the impact was. I received her letter the day before \nyesterday. The findings are shocking and deserve our immediate action.\n\n  In her letter she said:\n\n       Dear Senator Harkin: Thank you for your recent letter \n     expressing concern about the extent to which the critical \n     anti-fraud and abuse activities of the Office of Inspector \n     General . . . are suffering from the government shutdowns and \n     under the current stop-gap spending bill. Specifically, you \n     asked the following questions:\n\n  And this is what I asked of the inspector general.\n\n       [First] [w]ere major enforcement initiatives, \n     investigations and audits suspended?\n       [Second] [a]re fewer initiatives, investigations, and \n     audits being initiated?\n       What is the potential impact on Inspector General \n     activities of being forced to operate under another short-\n     term funding measure similar to the one currently in effect?\n\n  Three questions. Here are her answers:\n\n       Presentations of cases to United States attorneys for \n     prosecution dropped from 92 in the first quarter of Fiscal \n     Year (FY) 1995 to 51 in the first quarter of this FY 1996--\n\n  Almost a half.\n  Criminal convictions dropped from 84 for the first quarter of last \nyear to 36 for the same period this year.\n  Investigative receivables--this is money that they actually brought \nback, money that they recouped for our taxpayers--fell from \napproximately $77.7 million for the first quarter of last year to about \n$30.8 million for the same period this year.\n  Recoveries are down more than 50 percent; 60 percent of ongoing and \nplant audits will be stopped or reduced if these cuts remain in place.\n  Last year, Mr. President, these audits saved over $5.5 billion. So \nthe losses to Medicare and taxpayers from the reduction in audits could \nbe in the billions. \n\n[[Page S438]]\n\n  There is one other point in her letter. The Inspector General said \nthat considering the program savings generated in past years as a \nresult of their reports, as much as $1 billion could be lost from the \ndrop in program inspections alone this year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe full text of the letter from the inspector general dated January \n24.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              Department of Health\n\n\n                                           and Human Services,\n\n                                 January 24, 1996, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee on Labor, HHS, and \n         Education, Senate Committee on Appropriations, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: Thank you for your recent letter \n     expressing concern about the extent to which the critical \n     anti-fraud and abuse activities of the Office of Inspector \n     General (OIG) in the Department of Health and Human Services \n     (HHS) are suffering from the government shutdowns and under \n     the current stop-gap spending bill. Specifically, you asked \n     the following questions:\n       Were major enforcement initiatives, investigations, and \n     audits suspended? Are fewer initiatives, investigations, and \n     audits being initiated? What is the potential impact on \n     Inspector General activities of being forced to operate under \n     another short-term funding measure similar to the one \n     currently in effect?\n\n\n             Suspension and Curtailment of Pending OIG Work\n\n       [Note: Social Security related activities have been removed \n     from FY 1995 figures because the Social Security \n     Administration became an independent agency on March 31, 1995 \n     with its own Inspector General. The FY 1996 figures include \n     some activities funded by Operation Restore Trust--a limited \n     Medicare demonstration project funded through the Health Care \n     Financing Administration.]\n     Investigations and Audit Activity--Comparison of the first \n         fiscal quarters of 1995 and 1996:\n       Presentations of cases to United States Attorneys for \n     prosecution dropped from 92 in the first quarter of Fiscal \n     Year (FY) 1995 to 51 in the first quarter of FY 1996 while \n     indictments fell from 50 to 34.\n       Criminal convictions dropped from 84 for the first quarter \n     of last year to 36 for the same period this year with civil \n     judgments going from 27 to 19.\n       Investigative receivables fell from approximately $77.7 \n     million for the first quarter last year to about $30.8 \n     million for the same period this year.\n       The OIG issued 33 percent fewer reports (54 reports \n     compared to 82 reports), processed 30 percent fewer \n     nonfederal audits (861 compared to 1,223), identified 40 \n     percent fewer dollars for recovery to the Federal Government \n     ($14.2 million compared to $23.8 million), and is collecting \n     30 percent fewer dollars approved for recovery ($83.2 million \n     compared to $120.1 million).\n     HHS Financial Statement Audits\n       The Government Management Reform Act requires that agencies \n     have financial statement audits beginning FY 1996. The HHS-\n     wide financial statement audit requires audits of eight \n     operating agencies accountable for about $280 billion. The \n     financial statements of the Health Care Financing \n     Administration alone comprise expenditures in excess of $230 \n     billion that are material to the overall departmental \n     financial statements and to the General Accounting Office \n     effort to report on governmentwide financial statements. If \n     travel funds are not obtained, all such audit work will be \n     suspended with resultant impact on HHS-wide and \n     governmentwide statements. Audit activity must be performed \n     at multiple State agencies and Medicare contractor locations, \n     all requiring substantial travel funds. In addition, funding \n     must be sought for expert medical assistance to review \n     medical claims.\n     Administrative Sanctions--Fines, penalties, and exclusions:\n       The shutdowns prevented us from excluding individuals and \n     entities from participation in Medicare and Medicaid. \n     Providers were allowed to continue to bill the Medicare and \n     Medicaid programs even though they should have been excluded \n     due to convictions or because they are abusive to patients.\n       By comparison, there were 493 health care exclusions \n     implemented for the first quarter of 1995 versus 210 \n     exclusions for the same period this year. Approximately 400 \n     exclusion cases are presently awaiting implementation.\n\n\n                     Impact on New OIG Initiatives\n\n       During the first quarter of last year, the OIG \n     investigations component opened about 560 cases and closed \n     about 605 cases. For the same period this year, under the \n     continuing resolution, we opened only 425 and closed about \n     390. During the furlough period this year, we opened and \n     closed only 2 criminal cases.\n       Starts on 100 audit assignments were delayed or postponed \n     indefinitely because of the furlough. An example of this is \n     the national review of prospective payment system (PPS) \n     transfers. The United States Attorney in Pennsylvania \n     proposed a joint review of PPS transfers based on prior audit \n     work that identified over $150 million of overpayments to \n     hospitals. If we are able to follow the Department of Justice \n     proposal, we anticipate recoveries of over $300 million under \n     the provisions of the Federal False Claims Act. The project \n     has been suspended due to the furlough and lack of \n     adequate travel funds.\n\n\n               Potential Effect of Continued Underfunding\n\n     Lack of funds for travel and other expenses of field work:\n       For investigations, audits, and inspections not funded \n     under Operation Restore Trust, travel has been reduced to \n     about one-third of the prior year's expenditure for the same \n     period. If the underfunding of OIG activities continues, most \n     travel will be suspended and employees furloughed. \n     Approximately 60 percent of ongoing or planned audits will be \n     curtailed or severely reduced in scope because of travel \n     requirements with the resultant loss in program savings. The \n     FY 1995 audit-related savings totaled $5.5 billion.\n       Last year the OIG issued 68 program evaluation reports. \n     Under the continuing resolution scenario, the number of \n     completed inspections may drop to approximately half that \n     number. Considering the program savings generated in past \n     years as a result of such reports, as much as $1 billion \n     could be lost from the drop in program inspections alone. \n     Program inspections identify sources of fraud and abuse and \n     recommend program adjustments to prevent future occurrences.\n     Effect on sanctions activity:\n       The OIG expects a decline in potential settlements and \n     exclusions as a result of fewer investigative and audit \n     initiatives. In addition, since many of the false claim cases \n     originating from the Department of Justice are generated \n     through OIG investigations and audits, we expect a decline in \n     that caseload as well.\n       Currently, the OIG administrative sanctions staff has under \n     development 292 cases including false claims, Qui Tams, and \n     civil monetary penalties, all of which will be put on hold \n     during another furlough. Activity on them would be greatly \n     reduced if we are operating under a continuing resolution \n     with an inadequate level of funding.\n       Since the furlough, we have not been able to respond to \n     more than 2,217 inquiries from licensing boards and private \n     sector providers, who are required by law to inquire about \n     the exclusion status of a practitioner before hiring, \n     concerning the current status of a health care practitioner.\n       The minimum funding that would allow the OIG to meet its \n     basic obligations and maintain its infrastructure is the \n     amount shown in the Senate markup of the HHS appropriations \n     bill ($75,941,000). We have enclosed at Tab A a copy of the \n     Committee recommendation.\n       We sincerely appreciate the effort you have made toward \n     achieving a level of funding for the OIG that would allow us \n     to sustain basic services. We also appreciate your consistent \n     support year after year toward curtailing waste, fraud, and \n     abuse in Medicare, Medicaid and other HHS programs. The \n     attention you give to our findings and recommendations and \n     your enthusiastic encouragement assist us greatly in \n     strengthening the integrity of these important programs.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 June Gibbs Brown,\n                                                Inspector General.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, so much of the problem is that they are \nfunded but they do not have funds for travel. Most of their \ninvestigative and audit work requires travel. So what we really have is \nhundreds of audit professionals, auditors sitting at their desks unable \nto do their jobs. Every day that they are underfunded, our taxpayers \nlose money.\n  What kind of actions are not happening? Convictions, recoveries in \nfines relating to a wide range of abuses. In fact, the inspector \ngeneral even said in her letter that they are unable to cut off people \nwho are receiving money from Medicare even though they have been \nconvicted.\n  Here it is, she says:\n\n       The shutdowns prevented us from excluding individuals and \n     entities from participation in Medicare and Medicaid. \n     Providers are allowed to continue to bill even though they \n     should be excluded due to convictions or they are abusive to \n     patients, again, costing us millions of dollars each and \n     every day.\n\n  So I do not think there should be any disagreement on either side of \nthe aisle with this amendment that simply ensures the inspector general \nefforts to combat Medicare fraud are not cut from last year's level. \nAgain, we seem to have our priorities out of whack.\n  The previous continuing resolution provided full-year funding to a \nnumber of programs, including, for example, the Kennedy Center for the \nPerforming Arts. I have no problem with that. I support that. However, \nthis bill does not even provide last year's funding for the Office of \nInspector General to go after fraud, waste, and abuse. I think that \njust defies common sense.\n  I want to also, just for the Record, read a couple of examples from \nthe semiannual report of the Office of Inspector General about the kind \nof cases \n\n[[Page S439]]\nthey have gone after and what they have earned for the taxpayers.\n  Here is a Michigan carrier that agreed to pay $27.6 million to settle \na suit initiated by a former employee. The carrier was responsible for \nauditing, participating in hospitals' cost reports to ensure accuracy. \nAn investigation by the OIG showed that the carrier performed \ninadequate cursory audits in which it disregarded hundreds of dollars \nin overpayments.\n  The carrier later gave HCFA, the Health Care Financing \nAdministration, fraudulent work papers in an attempt to show that \ncomplete and accurate audits had been performed. The precise amount of \nloss to the Government could not be determined because it would have \nrequired auditing more than 200 hospitals. As part of the settlement, \nthe carrier agreed to pay the entire amount that HCFA had paid to \nperform audits over the last 4 years, approximately $13 million. Mr. \nPresident, $13 million, one case, recouped for the taxpayers of this \ncountry. And yet for $5 million, we cannot even provide for that kind \nof investigation.\n\n  A Texas ophthalmologist signed an agreement to pay the Government \n$849,000 to resolve allegations of submitting false claims for \nreimbursement for physician and related medical services to the \nMedicare Program. Many of the fraudulent claims submitted to Medicare \nwere for services not actually provided; were for services not provided \nas claimed or were billed at an inflated rate. This was a global \nsettlement which also involved a criminal plea based on kickback \nallegations as well as submission of false claims.\n  Mr. President, this book is full of these examples of what the Office \nof Inspector General has done for our taxpayers just in one-half of \nlast year. These are the kinds of audits and investigations and \ncriminal prosecutions that they will not be able to conduct given the \nreduced funding level that they have.\n  So my amendment is very simple. It will simply provide for the same \nlevel of funding for the Office of Inspector General. That is all, just \nthe Office of Inspector General from now through the end of this year. \nIt will save the taxpayers literally--well, do not take my word for it. \nThe inspector general said this could save up to $1 billion. So \nanywhere from probably $100 or $200 million to $1 billion just this \nyear alone could be saved.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3122\n\n   (Purpose: To provide for additional funding to the Office of the \n   Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I send my amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3122.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill insert the following: \n     ``Notwithstanding any provision of this Act, all projects and \n     activities funded under the account heading ``Office of the \n     Inspector General'' under the Office of the Secretary in the \n     Department of Health and Human Services at a rate for \n     operations not to exceed an annual rate for new obligational \n     authority of $58,493,000 for general funds together with not \n     to exceed an annual rate for new obligational authority of \n     $20,670,000 to be transferred and expended as authorized by \n     section 201(g)(1) of the Social Security Act from the \n     Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Supplemental Medical \n     Insurance Trust Fund.''\n\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are not in controlled time.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Senator \nfrom Iowa. I have been involved with the inspector general issue for a \nlong time. The Governmental Affairs Committee, back about 1980, put in \nlegislation to establish inspectors general across Government. There \nwere some that were voluntarily in place at that time. We put it into \n10 more agencies of Government on sort of an experimental basis. They \nran for 10 years, and in 1990, I put in legislation that expanded the \nIG's.\n  We have them now in 61 different agencies or departments of \nGovernment. They have done a superb job. They save in the billions and \nbillions of dollars, and I do not know how many dollars they return for \nevery dollar spent, but they have done a great job. To cut back on \nfunding in those areas may be penny wise, but it is tens of dollars \nshort.\n  It is sort of indicative of the problem we have right now. We passed \na Chief Financial Officer Act a little bit along the same line. We \nrequire audits in all departments and agencies in Government, and GAO \nis to supervise that, monitor them, and try and get decent accounting \nsystems in Government. We are cutting those when we should be expanding \nthe money for that kind of operation.\n  We talk every day here about a balanced budget, yet to do the things \nthat will get efficiency in Government, like IG's and CFO's, we cut the \nmoney for them. There was an article in the paper this morning about \nhow the GAO is not going to have enough money now to do the supervising \nof the Chief Financial Officer Act that just comes into full compliance \nrequirements this year. They have been building up to this since 1990, \nand now we are going to not even provide them the money for this.\n  I cannot imagine what people are thinking about to put this kind of \nrequirement in over in the House to cut back on money that is going to \nmake more efficiencies in Government.\n  Another one along the same lines is the IRS. There is something over \n$115 billion, $118 billion owed to the Government that we do not \ncollect. Most of that is in bankruptcies, individual and corporate \nbankruptcies. But we say there is $28 billion, I believe it is, that \nthey estimate is collectible. Yet, we are cutting the money for the tax \nsystem modernization system. We are cutting the personnel requirement \nor provisions at IRS, when we have $28 billion out there that we should \nbe going after. It is collectible from people who are deadbeats, and it \nmeans that you and I and every other American that is honest about \ntheir taxes has to pay more taxes. Yet, in the interest of economy over \nin the House, they are cutting those fundings back. I just think it is \nridiculous.\n  Now the argument is that we are up against a Government shutdown. I \nagree that we sure are. I add that we are up against it for the third \ntime, and every single time what they have done over in the House is \nput part of their legislative agenda on the CR, send it over to us on a \nshort-term basis and say, ``Take it or leave it,'' and ``You have to \nget it passed on our basis, you cannot change it. And if you do, the \nGovernment shuts down.''\n  I am tired of legislative blackmail. That is exactly what this is. I \nplan to vote against this whole thing this time, just in protest. I \nthink it is ridiculous. We are cutting back at least one-fourth for \nfunding for VA and HUD, national service, EPA, and education. We are \nchanging right-to-life matters in this. I just think we are legislating \non a CR that should be passed as a clean CR to keep the Government \nrunning for a certain period while we then take up these individual \nmatters, see what the proper level of funding should be, and make a \nrational decision on how we go ahead with funding all these things that \nare very important.\n  We brought up the farm bill. What do the farmers in Iowa think about \nthis? Do they know what their loans are going to be and deficiency, \nguaranteed next year? Do they know how much to borrow at the bank? No, \nthey do not, because we have not done our job here. Yet, we try and \ntake some of these things up and sock them on to a CR because now we \nare up against it. We are going to say the Government shuts down \ntonight unless we pass this on the basis that the House sent it to us, \nwhich has half of their legislative agenda on it that we do not agree \nwith. They deliberately waited until a day before the deadline to send \nit over to us, and we can take it or leave it.\n  Well, I do not plan to vote to take it. I just think we have been \njerked around too many times here. And to say once again that, well, \nthis is the last time and next time we are going to be tough, this is \nthe third time we have done this. How many times do we have to get hit \nin the head before we do something about it? \n\n[[Page S440]]\n\n  I think the Senator from Iowa makes a good point. I hope he keeps his \namendment in, and I hope we have to vote on it. If there are other \namendments to try and correct this, so be it. I think for us to be made \nthe heavies here and say we cannot possibly vote against this or have \namendments without being irresponsible, that we are going to stop the \nGovernment, it is the House that sent this over and put us in this \nshort timeframe. I disagree with that way of doing business. I do not \nthink we should accept these things. If there are changes we want to \nmake, we ought to make them.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Ohio for his \ncomments. He has long been a champion of inspectors general. I ask the \nSenator again, with his long experience in the area of inspectors \ngeneral and what they do, is it not true that this is real money we are \ntalking about? In other words, we always pass bills and they say this \nis going to save us so much money in the future. We are all akin to \ndoing that. But this is money right now, and every single day the \ninspector general's office is out there getting fines, payments. I just \nread examples from last year. This is real money that people have to \npay back to the Government. Is that not true?\n\n  Mr. GLENN. It is absolutely true. If the Senator will yield further, \nthere is not a single Senator in the U.S. Senate that would come out \nand say they favor fat, fraud, waste, and abuse in Government. Who is \ncutting out the fraud and abuse in Government? Who is on the front line \nout there in every department looking into fraud and abuse, stopping \nit, getting money back, referring cases to the Justice Department by \nthe hundreds--hundreds and hundreds of them, that we did not used to \nhave? It is the inspectors general.\n  I just cannot say how shortsighted I think it is that they have cut \nthese funds to begin with and cut the funds for the chief financial \nofficers, for IRS compliance. It just is the most foolish activity in \nGovernment that I possibly can think of. I certainly urge my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle to back the amendment of the Senator from \nIowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator. Again, it seems to me--I know the \nSenator said something about having them hold a gun at our head. The \nHouse is in session. They are in session subject to the call of the \nChair. If they can hold a gun at our heads, why can we not adopt this, \nwhich saves the taxpayers' money, and send it back to them? We will see \nwhat they do. We have until midnight. I bet they can pass this in 5 \nminutes. I cannot imagine there would be any opposition to this \nwhatsoever.\n  So why do we have to not save the taxpayers' money because they have \na gun at our head? Why do we not adopt this amendment and send it back \nand let the gun be at their head. I bet they will pass it in a New York \nminute--whatever that is; I do not know what that is because I am not \nfrom New York.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, the Senator from Ohio and the Senator \nfrom Iowa raise the issue of logic. Unfortunately, neither this body or \nthe other body has always functioned under the great label of logic. We \nare in a ridiculous situation. Obviously, we are, and we are having to \ndeal with it in a very--we will attempt to do it in an orderly fashion. \nI would like to point out that this is the seventh CR since October 1--\nsix were signed into law--and the Office of Inspector General has been \noperating at the House level since October 1. They have not been \nrequired to furlough any employees. This is the first time this issue \nhas been raised in six of those CR's. Consequently, they have survived, \nyou might say, or have functioned at a reduced level, or whatever. But \nthe point is they are functioning.\n  I also want to add that the Senate has not been able to act on the \nLabor-HHS appropriation bill due to the objections raised primarily by \nthe Democratic side of the aisle, and on a couple of occasions by the \nRepublican side of the aisle. Those usually circulated around rider \nissues rather than the substance of these issues, such as the inspector \ngeneral's office. We are, therefore, in a further deficient role as \nwith the House because the House did pass a Labor-HHS, and we have not \nyet passed such appropriation bill here in the Senate.\n  This is not a permanent situation because of the fact that it goes \nuntil March 15. I am very hopeful that we can find $5 billion more. Let \nme say, very frankly, that I have said in my leadership meeting, and in \nother areas of this process of trying to resolve these appropriations \nbills, that even if we got rid of the riders that have become a strong \nproblem for the Labor-HHS bill, different issues and riders that \nreflect a problem for both sides of the aisle, we still do not have \nenough money to satisfy the administration's requests in order to get \nthem to sign the bill. I have said whatever budget comprehensive \nagreement can be reached has to have $5 billion to get the Labor-HHS; \nHUD and Independent Agencies; State, Justice, and Commerce, signed by \nthe President. I think from time-to-time we have to remind ourselves \nthat the President has a role in the legislative process. We cannot \njust think of the President as someone downtown that does not have a \nlegitimate constitutional role in the legislative process. I can say to \nyou, in dealing with the administration, that we have that $5 billion \nmore in nondefense discretionary funding. I believe we can resolve \nthese problems and have no more CR's. I am not going to argue what kind \nof a vehicle we get that $5 billion on. But that is the real guts of \nthe problem. Anytime that you add something back into a bill at this \npoint, or a CR, it is subject to a point of order that I am going to \nhave to make because it exceeds our allocation under the budget \nresolution.\n\n  That is not a comfortable position to be in. I could not agree with \nthe focus and the goal being sought by the Senator from Iowa any more \nthan he has that commitment. I have the same commitment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I have a parliamentary question. There is an \nopportunity for the Senator from Iowa to have further discussion if I \noffer a point of order. If the Chair sustained a point of order and the \nSenator from Iowa appeals to waive the Budget Act, then he at that \npoint has additional debate or discussion? I do not want to cut him \noff.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the point of order is made by the Senator \nbefore the Chair rules, the Senator may waive.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. And at that point he may have further discussion?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the motion to waive.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. The current level of budget authority exceeds that of \nthe budget resolution for fiscal year 1996. The pending amendment by \nthe Senator from Iowa provides additional new budget authority and will \nresult in additional outlays in that year, and its adoption will cause \nthe aggregate levels of budget authority and outlays to be further \nexceeded.\n  I therefore raise a point of order under section 311 of the Budget \nAct against this amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of that Act for the purposes of the pending amendment and the \nunderlying bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is made.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the chairman for his kindness. He did raise one \nquestion about this--it is the first time it has been raised in six \ntries; that is so. I have been on this issue for several years, \nformally as chairman of the appropriations subcommittee and as ranking \nmember now with the Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, as \nchairman, who has been very supportive in all of our efforts to go \nafter waste, fraud and abuse.\n  I must say I had no idea that the reduced level of funding for the \nOffice of Inspector General would have the kind of impact it has had. I \nmust also be frank. I thought before Christmas we would have settled \nthis. It was not. I thought it would be settled soon after. It was not. \nIt is going from month to month to month, and you have to stop and say, \nWhat is happening? That is what precipitated my letter to the inspector \ngeneral a couple weeks ago. I \n\n[[Page S441]]\nwanted to know if they had any data to see what was happening.\n  They did. They have the data from October, November and December of \nthis fiscal year, the first quarter, compared to last year. It is \nreally shocking what is happening because they do not have adequate \nfunding to recoup money for taxpayers.\n  I am going on what the inspector general said in her letter. I just \nindicate to the Senator from Oregon, that was the only reason I had not \nraised it before, because I had no idea it was as bad as it is. That is \nwhy I sent the letter. Now is the time to get the money in to stop this \nbleeding of the Medicare money.\n\n  Lastly, I inquire of the Chair, the Senator from Oregon has stated \nthat this is in violation of the Budget Act and it goes over the \nallocation. It is this Senator's understanding that the whole CR, the \nwhole continuing resolution, is in violation of the Budget Act. I have \na parliamentary inquiry: Is the underlying continuing resolution in \nviolation of the Budget Act?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will need some time to make that \ndetermination and will give an answer to the Senator in due course.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Might the Senator inquire as to how long? I do not want \nto tie this up.\n  In conversations with the Parliamentarian of the Senate earlier this \nafternoon, I asked the Parliamentarian that question: If, in fact, the \nCR was subject to a point of order and if it violated the Budget Act. I \nwas told it was, unless I misunderstood the Parliamentarian.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is prepared to rule on the bill. In \nits current form, it is in violation of the Budget Act.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I wonder how many Senators know that the underlying \ncontinuing resolution is, itself, in violation of the Budget Act. I do \nnot intend to raise a point of order. I could, within my legitimate \nrights, raise a point of order against the entire continuing \nresolution. I do not want to do that.\n  I also do not want to be told that this amendment that I am offering, \nwhich by any accounting will save the taxpayers hundreds of millions of \ndollars, cannot be accepted because it is in violation of the Budget \nAct, when the entire continuing resolution is in violation of the \nBudget Act.\n  I do not see my distinguished chairman on the floor. Again, with all \ndue respect, I do not know how one can argue that my amendment should \nnot be adopted because it violates--and a point of order raised against \nit, when it truly saves the taxpayers a lot of money, but then go right \nahead and vote for the continuing resolution which also is in violation \nof the Budget Act. I want the Record to show that.\n  Again, I am not here to throw a bomb or a handgrenade or to blow this \nthing up. If I was, I could raise a point of order against the \ncontinuing resolution and there would have to be 60 votes to pass it. \nMaybe there is, maybe there is not. That is not my object. My object is \nto try to save the taxpayers some money, to make sure that the Office \nof Inspector General is funded, not at any increased level, just at \nlast year's level.\n  There is a bleeding going on every day, I tell my colleagues. There \nis a bleeding going on every day in Medicare. Millions of dollars are \nlost every day. It is the inspector general that is out there on the \nfront lines stopping it and recouping real dollars for our taxpayers. \nWe can close our eyes if we want. We can say it does not amount to a \nheck of a lot of money. As I pointed out, the inspector general said up \nto maybe $1 billion will be lost if they are not at least funded at \nlast year's level. We are talking about $5 million to keep the Office \nof Inspector General going.\n  I say again, Mr. President, I am not here to disrupt, but I am here \ntrying my level best, as I have for a long time, to cut at the waste, \nfraud, and abuse in Medicare. The main agent we have to do that is the \ninspector general's office. I do not cast any aspersions on what the \nHouse did. I do not accuse them of anything other than perhaps \noversight. I cannot believe they would not accept this. I think it was \nsimply an oversight.\n  Because of that, I believe if the Senate were to adopt this, send it \nback to the House--as I said, they are in session subject to the call \nof the Chair--I bet there would not be a House Member object to it. How \ncould they possibly object to something like this? And then send it to \nthe President and save our taxpayers some of their money.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/26/senate-section/article/S429-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S441-S442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n AMENDING THE TRADE ACT OF 1974 TO CLARIFY THE DEFINITIONS OF DOMESTIC \n    INDUSTRY AND LIKE ARTICLES IN CERTAIN INVESTIGATIONS INVOLVING \n                    PERISHABLE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, earlier this afternoon on behalf of my \ncolleague Senator Mack and myself, the Senate was asked to consider, by \nunanimous consent, S. 1463. It is my understanding that unanimous \nconsent has now been granted.\n  Mr. President, I rise to urge the immediate adoption of S. 1463, a \nbill that advances fairness for American farmers in crisis.\n  The bill, which I introduced last December on behalf of myself and \nSenator Mack of Florida, would make it easier for seasonal industries, \nsuch as winter vegetable growers, to seek relief under section 202 of \nthe Trade Act of 1974.\n  Sections 201-204 of the Trade Act of 1974 authorizes the President, \nafter an investigation and determination by the International Trade \nCommission, to withdraw or modify concessions or impose duties for a \nlimited period of time on imports of like or directly competitive \narticles.\n  Section 202(c)(6) defines ``domestic industry'' as the producers as a \nwhole of the article or those producers whose collective production of \nthe article constitutes a major portion of the total domestic industry, \nincluding flexibility to define the industry as a limited geographic \narea.\n  During early 1995, the domestic winter tomato industry sought relief \nfor injury resulting from surges of imports of Mexican tomatoes. The \nInternational Trade Commission, viewing the domestic industry as \nnationwide and year-round, denied relief.\n  In its opinion, the ITC recognized that perishable agricultural \nproducts have limited marketability. Page I-12 of the opinion states:\n\n       The perishable nature of fresh-market tomatoes precludes \n     the interchangeability of tomatoes harvested and marketed at \n     different times of the year. Given that a fresh-market \n     mature-green or vine-ripe tomato harvested in any month would \n     not be suitable for consumption after about three weeks, \n     arguably a tomato harvested in one month could not be \n     substituted for a tomato harvested a month later.\n\n  Nonetheless, the ITC determined that, under the statutory definition, \nthe appropriate domestic industry included all growers and packers of \nfresh tomatoes during the entire calendar year.\n  This legislation is intended to facilitate a different result by the \nITC in cases with facts similar to those presented in the case filed by \nthe winter tomato growers. If this legislation is enacted, industries \nsuch as the winter tomato industry would be deemed to be a separate \nindustry under the modified definition of a domestic industry.\n  Currently, seasonal growers may be considered to be part of an \nindustry that grows, ships, and sells during an entirely different time \nduring the year. For example, fresh tomato growers in California grow, \nharvest, and sell during the late spring, summer, and fall, while those \nin Florida do the same thing in the late fall, winter, and early \nspring. Quite literally, while one group is in business, the other is \nnot. While the product may be the same, it is a fact that the market, \nthe competition, and the trade involved are totally separate.\n  S. 1463 would modify the definition of domestic industry in section \n202 cases involving perishable agricultural products. In those cases, \nthe ITC would be authorized to define the industry to include only \ndomestic producers who produce the product during a particular growing \nseason if two things are proven.\n\n[[Page S442]]\n\n  First, the domestic producers must sell all or almost all of the \nproduction during that growing season. Under this requirement, however, \nsales of a perishable agricultural product during the weeks immediately \nfollowing the end of the growing season would not disqualify a seasonal \nindustry.\n  Second, during the growing season, other domestic producers of the \narticle who produce in a different growing season must not supply, to \nany substantial degree, demand for the article. Again, this would not \npreclude the other industry from selling any produce during the growing \nseason.\n  Instead, the purpose of these two limitations is to preclude \narbitrary season cutoffs from meeting the standard. The scope of the \nmodified definition is limited to situations where international \nproducers compete directly with domestic producers of the same like \nproduct during the same growing season.\n  This does not mean that there cannot be any overlap between the \npartial-year growing season in which the domestic industry alleges \ninjury and another growing season. Various factors such as weather \nconditions may cause one growing season to begin early or end late and \nyet not affect a separate growing season.\n  While this change will allow the ITC to conclude that a partial-year \nindustry constitutes a domestic industry under section 202, I believe \nthat it is consistent with the NAFTA and other international \nobligations.\n  This amendment, by itself, will not solve the myriad post-NAFTA \nchallenges facing America's winter vegetable industry. Domestic winter \ngrowers are suffering from dramatic increases in imports of Mexican \nsquash, eggplant, sweet corn, beans, bell peppers, tomatoes, and other \nvegetables. These crops are seasonal and perishable.\n  Without prompt legislative reform, the domestic winter vegetable \nindustry will soon end its second post-NAFTA growing season with unfair \nrules and hampered ability to redress harm. In human terms, too many \nfarm families have bankrupted, stopped production, and lost confidence \nin their Government to assure fairness.\n  In addition to S. 1463, we should enact and implement additional \nlegislative and administrative measures to make NAFTA work as it was \ndesigned.\n  But today, we do have a chance to take a positive step toward \nfairness for American farmers. Let us not forfeit that chance as we \ncontemplate adjournment until next month. On behalf of fundamental \nfairness for farm families, I urge you to support this bipartisan \nreform.\n  I would like at this time, therefore, to ask unanimous consent that \nthe Finance Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. \n1463, a bill to clarify the definitions of domestic industry and like \narticles in certain trade actions involving perishable agricultural \nproducts, that the Senate then proceed to its immediate consideration, \nthat the bill be read three times, passed, and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table; further, that any statements relating thereto \nbe placed in the Record at the appropriate place as if read; provided \nfurther that the above occur without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, was read \nthe third time, and passed as follows:\n\n                                S. 1463\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I ask the Chair if there is an \nopportunity to make a statement without interrupting the discussion on \nthe amendment of the Senator from Iowa?\n  Mr. President, clearly, since there is a moment of time, I just \nwanted to make a point about an amendment that I was going to offer. I \nhave decided not to do so, not because I do not think it is warranted \nand justified and ought to be presented, but it is very obvious to me, \nafter having seen the vote that was taken on the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Massachusetts to increase education funding \nsubstantially so we can meet our needs for our young people and to \nprovide the kind of education that is essential if the United States is \ngoing to maintain or improve its leadership in global affairs, \neconomics, science, et cetera--I saw what happened with that vote. We \ndid not get 60 votes in favor of it, whatever the technicality was, to \nwaive the budget, et cetera.\n  So, when I look at an amendment I was going to offer on environmental \nprotection, it seemed to me that the handwriting was on the wall or \nthat the toxics were in the ground or in the air, and that we were not \ngoing to get anywhere with a vote.\n  Mr. President, the American people clearly want to see an end to the \npartisan bickering, and it seems we are making some progress in that \ndirection.\n  At the same time, Mr. President, I do want to register my concern \nabout the stop-start way we are now financing much of the Government.\n  Continuing resolutions and shutdowns are no way to run a Government. \nThe resulting uncertainty and chaos has a serious impact on States and \nlocal governments, on Federal employees, and on Americans throughout \nthe country.\n  I also want to take a few moments to discuss the impact of the \ncurrent CR on an area of particular concern to me: the environment.\n  Mr. President, I had planned to offer an amendment to protect \nenvironmental programs during the life of this short-term spending \nmeasure. My amendment would have frozen EPA's funding at last year's \nlevels, as opposed to the roughly 14-percent cut called for in this \nbill.\n  However, I recognize that my amendment would be subject to the same \npoint of order that was raised on Senator Kennedy's amendment. As with \nhis amendment, I am confident this amendment would receive a majority \nof votes, but not enough to overcome the parliamentary objection.\n  I also am concerned that, if my amendment were adopted in the Senate, \nthe House leadership would refuse to put such a CR up to a vote, and \nthe result would be another Government \n\n[[Page S443]]\nshutdown. I do not want that to happen. And I will not be offering my \namendment. But I do want to take this opportunity to emphasize the \nimportance of adequately funding EPA--and preferably doing so on a \nlonger-term basis--when the pending CR expires in March.\n  Mr. President, it is time to make protection of our environment a \nnational priority. Americans have a right to know that their air is \nclean enough to breathe, their water is clean enough to drink, and \ntheir children are not going to get sick because they live near a toxic \nwaste dump.\n  The American people feel strongly about this, Mr. President. Poll \nafter poll shows very strong public support for protecting our \nenvironment. Even Republican polls have reached that conclusion.\n  One recent Republican poll by Linda DiVall showed that only 35 \npercent of voters would support a candidate who supported the one-third \ncut in EPA funding in the House Republicans' VA/HUD appropriations \nbill. The same poll showed that while 6 out of 10 Americans say there \nis too much Government regulation generally, only 1 in 5 believe that \nstatement applies to the EPA.\n  Unfortunately, despite the broad public support for environmental \nprotection, this Congress has treated these programs very poorly. \nFunding for EPA has been under serious attack. And EPA's budget has \nbeen subject to stop-start budgeting, which has created tremendous \nuncertainty and which has had a serious impact on environmental \nprograms.\n  For example, many toxic waste sites are not getting cleaned up \nbecause of budget uncertainties and inadequate funding. These cleanups \ntypically take a long time, and sometimes are costly. Since EPA does \nnot know how much money it will have, it has been forced to shut down \nmany projects that already have been underway, and to delay others.\n  This will end up costing taxpayers millions of dollars. It also will \nmean that many sites will remain filled with toxic wastes, placing \nnearby residents at additional risk.\n  Mr. President, EPA is not an agency with a fat budget. It has been \nunderfunded for years. EPA has already eliminated all of its temporary \nemployees, and the Agency now has 1,300 employees less than its \nauthorized ceiling. If the level in the continuing resolution continues \nfor the rest of the year, EPA will be forced to furlough all its \nemployees for 10 to 12 workdays.\n  Mr. President, furloughs at EPA are not what the people want. They \nwant a Federal Government that will take responsible and prudent steps \nto improve our environment. To to that, in my view, we should be \nincreasing EPA's budget, not cutting it, as this bill would do.\n  Mr. President, deep cuts in EPA's budget inevitably will have an \nadverse impact on our environment, and on the many hard-working people \nwho work at the Agency. But I also want to point out to my colleagues--\nespecially those on the other side of the aisle--that cuts in EPA have \na direct impact on many businesses in the private sector. Under \nPresident Reagan, EPA entered an era of substantial privatization.\n  Today, over 80 percent of the Superfund budget and 52 percent of the \nrest of EPA's budget goes to private contractors. Those companies and \ntheir employees will suffer needlessly if EPA's budget is slashed.\n  Other companies that rely on EPA also will be hurt by EPA cuts. For \ninstance, EPA is required to certify new pesticides before they can be \nmarketed. However, under this CR, many of these certifications will not \nbe done. That means these products will not be approved for the coming \ngrowing season. Farmers, consumers and the agricultural chemical \ncommunity all will be adversely affected.\n  Mr. President, our Nation has made enormous progress since the \nenvironmental movement was ignited by Earth Day in 1970. Environmental \nlaws have made our water safer to drink, cleaned up our oceans and \nrivers, made the air cleaner, and protected our land from destruction. \nWe can not afford to turn back now.\n  I have heard it said over and over that we need to balance the budget \nbecause we are piling debt onto our children. But what about the \nenvironment we are leaving our children? In my view, and the view of \nthe American people, that simply has to be a national priority.\n  Mr. President, at the expiration of this continuing resolution, I \nreally hope that the Congress will approve a budget for EPA that \nprotects the environment. And not for 6 weeks at a time. But for the \nrest of the fiscal year.\n  That is important for the Agency to operate effectively. It is \nimportant for its employees, who need to plan their work, and their \nlives. It is important for the many private contractors and their \nemployees, who depend on this funding. It is important for States and \nlocalities, which also rely on EPA funding to administer environmental \nprograms. And, most critically, it is important to all Americans who \ncare about the quality of our environment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent an article appearing today in \nthe New York Times, on the front page as a matter of fact, be printed \nin the Record at the appropriate place.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 26, 1996]\n\n     Worried Republicans Begin Backpedaling on Environmental Issues\n\n                       (By John H. Cushman, Jr.)\n\n       Washington.--Republicans are increasingly worried that by \n     imposing deep cuts on environmental programs they are doing \n     even deeper political damage to their party, and they are \n     beginning to back away from further confrontations on \n     environmental issues.\n       As a result, it now appears more likely that Congress might \n     loosen somewhat the fiscal vise that has gripped \n     environmental agencies during the long budget impasse, while \n     a number of proposals favoring mining, logging, oil and other \n     big industries could vanish from the legislative landscape.\n       Administration officials and environmentalists can hardly \n     claim victory yet. The administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency, Carol M. Browner, said that at a Senate \n     hearing on Friday, she would testify that the cuts already \n     imposed, and the slightly less severe ones still to come, \n     would force the agency to delay some of its highest \n     priorities, including new measures to control dangerous \n     pollutants in drinking water.\n       But some environmentalists are starting to say, with a hint \n     of wonder in their voices, that they are close to success in \n     making environmental programs what one lobbyist called a \n     ``third rail,'' political slang for issues like Social \n     Security that are best not touched because they carry such \n     voltage with voters.\n       Increasingly, Republicans are echoing the same message.\n       This week, 30 Republican moderates in Congress wrote \n     Speaker Newt Gingrich to complain that the party had ``taken \n     a beating this year over missteps in environmental policy'' \n     and calling on him to correct the course during the \n     continuing budget talks.\n       ``If the party is to resuscitate its reputation in this \n     important area, we cannot be seen as using the budget crisis \n     as an excuse to emasculate environmental protection,'' said \n     the letter, drafted by Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, a maverick \n     Republican environmentalist from upstate New York.\n       Even some of the party's more conservative advisers are \n     sounding similar alarms these days.\n       ``Our party is out of sync with mainstream American \n     opinion,'' wrote Linda DiVall, a Republican pollster, in \n     reporting to congressional clients on a recent nationwide \n     survey on environmental issues.\n       But many in the party's leadership are reluctant to change \n     course. They say the problem is not their agenda but the way \n     they have explained it.\n       ``What is out of sync is the distortion of our record by \n     the administration and by radical environmental groups who \n     want to continue to overregulate the economy,'' said Rep. \n     John A. Boehner of Ohio, head of the House Republican \n     Conference.\n       Environmental groups have mounted a sustained campaign all \n     year to get their millions of members to complain to \n     lawmakers about the Republican agenda, and it appears that \n     the effects are increasingly being felt.\n       Last week, during the congressional recess, the entire New \n     Jersey delegation of eight Republicans and five Democrats \n     wrote to the Republican leadership asking that full financing \n     be restored to the Superfund program, a reaction to news that \n     the EPA had suspended the clean-up of hundreds of toxic waste \n     sites.\n       In his State of the Union address, President Clinton spoke \n     at length about environmental issues, which usually take a \n     back seat to others. He won applause and loud cheers when he \n     denounced the environmental proposals of the Republicans and \n     challenged Congress to ``re-examine those policies and \n     reverse them.''\n       The problem for the Republican leadership, though, is that \n     many of those proposals are at the heart of their promise to \n     roll back federal regulations, and many of the party's \n     leaders, including Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority \n     leader, and Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, one of Gingrich's loyal \n     lieutenants, are among their most vigorous advocates.\n       In a speech to the National Association of Manufacturers on \n     Thursday, DeLay, the majority whip, accused Clinton of lying \n     in his \n\n[[Page S444]]\n     speech when he said that by voting to cut environmental enforcement by \n     25 percent, Congress was serving the interests of corporate \n     lobbyists at the expense of clean water and children's \n     health.\n       ``That isn't just misrepresenting the truth; that is \n     outright lying,'' DeLay said.\n       But Ms. DiVall, whose clients include a conservative \n     Republican presidential candidate, Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, \n     said in her polling report that some of the party's \n     environmental policies were broadly disdained by Democrats \n     and Republicans alike--and by most independents, most young \n     people and most women.\n       ``By greater than a 2-to-1 margin, voters have more \n     confidence in the Democrats than Republicans as the party \n     they trust most to protect the environment,'' her report \n     said. ``Most disturbing is that 55 percent of Republicans do \n     not trust their party when it comes to protecting the \n     environment, while 72 percent of the Democrats do trust their \n     party.''\n       The poll came up with especially strong signals on the \n     Republicans' efforts to cut spending at the EPA.\n       ``Attacking the EPA is a nonstarter,'' Ms. DiVall wrote.\n       Her polling found that only 35 percent of the public would \n     vote to re-elect members of the House who supported the \n     Republican-backed bill cutting financing for the agency, by a \n     third, while 46 percent said they would vote not to re-elect \n     them. If voter turnout in November is higher, she warned, the \n     results would be worse.\n       Warnings like that seemed to be having an effect on \n     Thursday, as the House leadership brought to the floor the \n     latest stop-gap spending bill, to keep the federal government \n     open until March. Previous temporary spending bills have \n     singled the EPA out for especially severe cuts, especially in \n     enforcement and clean-up activities.\n       The measure, passed by the House on Thursday night, would \n     still cut the agency's financing, just as deeply as the \n     spending bill Clinton vetoed in December but not as deeply as \n     the cuts since Oct. 1, when the fiscal year began.\n       The Interior Department, another environmental agency that \n     has been operating without a final agreement on its budget, \n     would be financed until March. But the real issue facing that \n     agency is not how much money it can spend, but rather what \n     environmental policies it must follow.\n       One of the biggest fights of the past year was over changes \n     the Republicans proposed in the mining law. Favored by \n     industry and opposed by environmentalists, the measure was \n     part of Interior bill and the broader budget bill, both of \n     which Clinton vetoed.\n       On Thursday, Jack Gerard, an industry spokesman, said the \n     budget impasse had ``at least for now halted progress toward \n     passage of mining law reform.''\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. So, I am hoping we get on with the resolution, the \nCR, not that I like it, frankly, but we do have to maintain the \nconstancy of our work force, get the jobs done as well as we can at the \nmoment. I am terribly disappointed at the relatively low levels of \nfunding----\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, may we have order so the Senator can be \nheard?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Will the majority leader yield for a question? Can we \nmake those votes 10-minute votes?\n  Mr. DOLE. Sure. I would put them en bloc.\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and \nsworn not having voted in the affirmative, the motion is rejected, and \nthe amendment fails.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, with the passage of the Balanced Budget \nDownpayment Act, instead of the headline reading ``Government Shuts \nDown,'' it will read ``Government Scaled Down.''\n  Instead of adding to the frustration that the American people have \nwith Government, we'll be adding to the amount of money we are saving \ntaxpayers.\n  Instead of punishing Federal employees; we'll be eliminating \nunnecessary Federal programs.\n  Everybody knows that this bill is not perfect.\n  Each of us, if given the opportunity, would write it differently.\n  Some, like President Clinton, would prefer to spend more tax dollars.\n  Others, like me, would spend less. But I think we can all agree that \nthis bill is much better than shutting down the Government.\n  The bottom line here, Mr. President, is that with this Balanced \nBudget Downpayment Act, we fulfill our commitment to keep the \nGovernment open, while at the same time we ensure at least $30 billion \nin budgetary savings for the current fiscal year.\n  This puts the focus back where it belongs: On cutting unnecessary \nWashington spending and reducing the budget deficit.\n  And let me leave no doubt: The Republican promise to the American \npeople to balance the budget the right way in 7 years is not something \nwe are willing to sacrifice.\n  We will never relent in our fight to protect future generations of \nAmericans and leave them the legacy of a better America. And today's \ncontinuing resolution is a genuine downpayment on that promise.\n  Let me also briefly mention that this continuing resolution includes \nthe fiscal year 1996 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, which has \nbeen held up for many months by pro-abortion special interest groups.\n  I am pleased that the resolution contains many provisions which I \ndrafted or strongly supported. These include:\n  An assurance that countries which have embarked on the peace process \nin \n\n[[Page S445]]\nthe Middle East--Israel, Egypt, and Jordan--will receive important \nsupport for their search for a just and lasting peace.\n  A restriction on aid to Bosnian Serbs, a doubling to $100 million in \nmilitary draw down authority to equip, arm, and train Bosnian \nGovernment forces, and a provision limiting assistance to any country \nwhich harbors international war criminals.\n  A requirement of human rights certification before additional \nassistance can be provided to Haiti. This is in response to the \noverwhelming evidence indicating that elements of the Government of \nHaiti have been involved in political assassinations--a sad outcome for \na U.S. military operation that was alleged to be about democracy and \nthe rule of law.\n  Assistance for critical states on the periphery of the newly \nresurgent Russia--especially Ukraine and Armenia. This bill also \nprovides for the Transcaucus enterprise fund--an idea I first proposed \nin 1994.\n  This bill also contains provisions to encourage the administration to \nhonor its stated commitment to expand NATO eastward--sooner, rather \nthan later. The Republican Congress has repeatedly been forced to push \nthe Clinton administration on the issue of NATO expansion--another case \nwhere the administration's deeds have not matched their words.\n  Finally, the bill contains the Humanitarian Aid Corridors Act--a \nlimitation on aid to countries which impede the delivery of U.S. \nhumanitarian aid to other countries. This important provision will help \nensure we get the best bang for our foreign aid buck. I was proud to be \nthe lead sponsor of this provision.\n  Mr. President, it has been a long and difficult process to get the \nforeign operations conference report to this point. And let me \ncongratulate subcommittee Chairman McConnell for his leadership and \nperseverance.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I wanted to take this opportunity to \naddress several of the votes cast today. Among other items, the Senate \nvoted today to uphold the Budget Act with respect to the Kennedy and \nHarkin amendments. Let me make my position clear; I support full \nfunding for education and continued vigilance over Medicare fraud. In \nthe past, I have offered several amendments to protect education \nspending from cuts as well as to create new initiatives to fight \nMedicare fraud. My Medicare fraud amendment was a key part of the \nMedicare reforms vetoed by the President as part of the Balanced Budget \nAct of 1995.\n  Nevertheless, I did not support any amendment to the continuing \nresolution which would result in the shutdown of the Federal \nGovernment. By forcing this bill to return to the House for additional \ndebate, these amendments would have done just that. Already we have \nseen the Government shut down twice in the past few months. The most \nrecent shutdown lasted a record 21 days. Another shutdown is simply \nunacceptable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Before final passage, I would like to take the \nopportunity to explain further my concerns about several provisions in \nthis bill.\n\n\n             Restrictions on Population Planning Activities\n\n  I am dismayed by the provision in this continuing resolution which \nrestricts the funds that may be made available for our international \npopulation assistance program and the U.S. contribution to the United \nNations Population Fund [UNFPA].\n  The proponents of this language know that it is extremely unlikely \nthat an authorization bill will pass before the July 1, 1996 deadline. \nTherefore, the bill provisions restricting funding to 65 percent of \nfiscal year 1995 levels and the obligation of funds to monthly \napportionments of 6.67 percent will go into effect. When this occurs, \nour international family planning efforts will be devastated. The \nresult--more unintended pregnancies and more abortions.\n  Let me give you a present day example. The former Soviet Union has \nthe highest abortion rates in the world. In 1991, an estimated 12 to 15 \nmillion legal and illegal abortions were performed. The average woman \nwill have between four and six abortions during her lifetime. Some \nwomen have as many as 20 abortions. This is appalling. Why do these \ncountries have such high abortion rates? The answer--the unavailability \nof modern contraceptives.\n  Last year, in the foreign operations bill I was able to secure \nfunding to allow the Agency for International Development to develop a \ncomprehensive family planning program in the former Soviet Union. AID's \nefforts in Russia, Moldova, Belarus, and Ukraine have begun to have an \nimpact on the abortion rate. We have data from the Ukraine that shows a \nreduction in the number of abortions.\n  So what are we doing today? We are drastically cutting funding to \nUnited States-supported international family planning programs, and we \nare reducing AID's flexibility to respond to areas, like the former \nSoviet Union, where the need for family planning is so great. We are \nensuring that the world will return to the old ways--the old Russian \nmodel--with increases in unintended pregnancies and abortions.\n  As a pro-life Senator who strongly opposes abortion, I am \ndisheartened by the lack of understanding and foresight of our \ncolleagues in the House who have been unrelenting in their insistence \non these restrictions.\n\n\n                         Human Embryo Research\n\n  I remain concerned about using this continuing resolution to place \nrestrictions on research. However, I understand from the National \nInstitutes of Health that this will not effect any current grants \nbecause the NIH is not funding research in this area at this time. It \nis my hope that the authorizing committees will take the time necessary \nto fully examine the issue of human embryo research and its \nramifications before further restrictions are placed on funding. This \nis an important issue which deserves our full consideration.\n\n\n                           Education Funding\n\n  I would like to add, Mr. President, that I regretfully oppose the \namendment by my colleague from Massachusetts, to increase funding for \neducation programs. While one of my highest personal priorities is to \nincrease funding for these programs. I cannot in good conscience \nsupport an effort which gives us all a rhetorical win but not a \nsubstantive win. Increasing funding for these programs for 45 days has \nlittle to no practical effect. Aside from the fact that most education \nprograms are forward funded and thus, not impacted in the next 45 \ndays--over $13 billion or 54 percent of education moneys are, by law, \nnot available until July 1 and another $7.5 billion or 31 percent are \nnot obligated until the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year--\nthis amendment does not provide any certainty for the long term. It may \nalso jeopardize our ability to enact legislation necessary to stabilize \nnational education spending.\n  The best action we can take for education is to pass this continuing \nresolution and then proceed as rapidly as possible to consider the \nfiscal year 1996 Labor, HHS, Education appropriations bill. The Senate \nbill, reported from the committee on September 15, includes $22.3 \nbillion indiscretionary spending for education programs, an increase of \n$1.5 billion more than the House-passed bill and the entire amount of \nincrease given to the Senate Labor/HHS Subcommittee in its 602(b) \nallocation. Without a Senate-passed bill we are negotiating from a \nposition of weakness with the House. Passage of this bill will provide \nthe baseline on which true long-term planning can take place in school \ndistricts and classrooms all across this country.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report the conference report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendments of the House to the bill (S. \n     1124) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 1996 for \n     military activities of the Department of Defense, to \n     prescribe personnel strengths for such fiscal year for the \n     Armed Forces, and for other purposes, having met, after full \n     and free conference, have agreed to recommend and do \n     recommend to their respective Houses this report, signed by a \n     majority of the conferees.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of January 22, 1996.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am disappointed that the Senate has to \nconsider the revised Defense authorization conference report for fiscal \nyear 1996. To the dismay of many Members, President Clinton vetoed the \noriginal bill on December 28 because of his objections to: Deploying a \nmissile defense system able to defend all 50 States; certifying that \ndeployments of U.S. forces under U.N. command and control are in the \nnational interest; and, requiring the President to seek congressional \napproval of funding of unanticipated contingency operations.\n  The primary reason for the President's veto of the bill was the \nadministration's uncompromising opposition to deploying a system to \ndefend the United States against ballistic missiles. The first duty of \nthe President, as defined in the Constitution, is to defend America. \nMissile defense for America is a very achievable goal; it is hard to \nunderstand the opposition to providing protection for America.\n  Mr. President, we are told that there is no immediate threat, but I \ncan assure you that when we are threatened, it will be too late to \nstart. We will then be at the mercy of an aggressor's blackmail, or \nworse. In order to complete action rapidly on the renewed conference \nwithout further diluting the national missile defense provisions, the \nconferees dropped the NMD sections from the conference report. Although \nthe conference report we are now considering does not include language \non NMD, Republicans remain determined to enact forceful NMD legislation \nin the near future. I remain strongly committed to the deployment of a \nmultiple-site NMD system by 2003 and am working with Senator Lott, \nSenator Smith, Senator Kyl, and others in formulating a new bill.\n  Mr. President, the requirement to submit a supplemental request of \nfunds to pay for contingency operations was also listed as a reason for \nthe President's veto.\n  Unfortunately, President Clinton continues to deploy our military \nforces overseas for a variety of non-traditional military operations \nwithout due regard to cost or funding. These operations absorb \nsignificant human resources and funds which had been budgeted and \nappropriated for military readiness and modernization.\n  Our provision would merely have required the submission of a \nsupplemental request to ensure that readiness is maintained, while at \nthe same time allowing the Congress to carry out its constitutional \nresponsibility. Although I disagree with President Clinton's argument \nthat such a requirement is unconstitutional, the conferees agreed to \nchange this requirement to a sense of Congress.\n  In his veto message, the President asserted that he thought his \nauthority as commander in chief would be undermined by a requirement to \ncertify that placing U.S. troops under operational control of the \nUnited Nations is in our national security interest. I do not \nunderstand how any President can possibly object to a requirement that \nexplicitly states to the American people that any deployment of \nAmerican troops is in the national interest. This was a broadly \nsupported provision and the President's veto ensures that neither the \nCongress nor the President has seen the last of this common-sense \nlegislation.\n  While I disagree with the objection, since certification is an \naccepted way \n\n[[Page S447]]\nfor Congress to exercise oversight responsibility, I do not want this \nimportant bill delayed by another veto. Further, if we had watered down \nthis section as the President would have liked, the Congress would be \nabdicating its oversight responsibilities.\n  For these reasons, the conferees concluded that it would be better to \ndrop the section in its entirety. A separate bill will preserve the \nintegrity of Congress' intention to ensure U.S. forces are placed under \nUN control only when it is in the U.S. national security interest.\n  Mr. President, the House National Security Committee and the Senate \nArmed Services Committee have moved swiftly to resolve the President's \nobjections to the previous defense authorization bill because we \nrecognize the importance of the bill to our Armed Forces. This \nconference report retains the many important initiatives of the earlier \nbill.\n  The conference agreement contains a number of acquisition reform \nprovisions which make it easier for Federal agencies to buy commercial \ntechnologies, while preserving the standard of full and open \ncompetition. Other initiatives range from improved quality of life for \nservicemembers and their families, to a full pay raise. Our Armed \nForces should not have to wait any longer for the support they deserve.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to say we will now have the opportunity \nto express our support for our military men and women by voting to \napprove the conference agreement on the National Defense Authorization \nAct for Fiscal Year 1996. I urge my colleagues to pass this conference \nreport in a strong, bipartisan show of support for our Armed Forces.\n  Mr. President, I wish to express my appreciation to the able ranking \nMember, Senator Nunn, for the great contribution he has made to this \nbill. Without his cooperation and counsel it would have been very \ndifficult to get this revised bill enacted.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Thurmond \nin support of the revised conference report on the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for fiscal year 1996, which has just passed. The \nannual Defense authorization bill is one of the major responsibilities \nof the Congress each year. It has become the primary vehicle for \nfulfilling the responsibility of Congress, set forth in article I, \nsection 8 of the Constitution, to raise and support the Armed Forces \nand to provide rules for the governance and regulation of our military \nforces. The fact that we have a Defense authorization bill that is \nlikely to be approved by the Congress and signed by the President \nreflects the determination of Senator Thurmond, and many other Members, \nto make significant changes in the bill that was vetoed on December 28, \n1995.\n  The Senate debated the first conference report on December 19, 1995. \nI voted against that conference report, which was the first time in my \n23 years in the Senate, that I voted against a Defense authorization \nconference report. I had supported every previous Defense authorization \nconference report, including 6 years in which I served in the minority \nunder two Republican chairmen. I concluded then that the conference \nreport contained fundamental flaws that were contrary to the best \ninterests of the taxpayers and the sound management of our national \ndefense activities. On balance, the bill's bad policy outweighed its \ngood policy. My floor statement on December 19 detailed the serious \nreservations that I had about the first conference report.\n\n\n                             major changes\n\n  Mr. President, the revised conference report satisfies a number of \nthe concerns which I addressed in my December 19 remarks on the Senate \nfloor in opposing the bill and in the President's veto message. I view \nthese changes as very substantial.\n  The revised conference report completely eliminates the objectionable \nNational Missile Defense language from the previous conference report. \nAs I noted on the Senate floor, the language in the first conference \nreport amounted to an anticipatory breach of the Antiballistic Missile \nTreaty. I had expressed serious objection, as had the administration, \nto that language. The language in the first conference report could \nhave had a significant impact on Russian consideration of the START II \nTreaty which is designed to produce a major reduction in Russian \nnuclear weapons. The language also could have lead the Russians to \nabandon other arms control agreements if they conclude that it is \nUnited States policy to take unilateral action to abandon the ABM \nTreaty. All that language is has been removed from the conference \nreport.\n  The revised conference report changes the first conference report in \na number of other significant respects:\n  The new report completely eliminates the proposed restrictions on \nU.S. forces under U.N. command and control, which the administration \nhad viewed as interfering with the constitutional prerogatives of the \nPresident.\n  The new report eliminates the mandatory requirement in the \ncontingency funding provision for a supplemental appropriation, and \nreplaces it with a sense-of-Congress provision, thereby removing \nanother constitutional concern expressed by the President.\n  The new report completely eliminates the language which would have \nrepealed the statutory authority for an independent Director of \nOperational Test and Evaluation--a key position in terms of ensuring \nunbiased tests of major weapons systems.\n  The new report makes it clear that the conferees support placing the \noversight of special operations under a senior DOD official who is \nsubject to Senate confirmation in order to ensure strong civilian \ncontrol of special operations activities. The action of the conferees \nreflects the fact that when Congress created this position of Assistant \nSecretary for Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict, we were \nnot simply trying to give visibility to an Assistant Secretary. There \nare significant substantive differences between the Assistant Secretary \nof Defense for Special Operations and each of the other Assistant \nSecretaries. The position of Assistant Secretary for Special Operations \nis tied directly to a unique combatant command that exercises \nmanagement powers similar to those of a civilian Service Secretary. The \nconference report makes it clear that there is a continuing requirement \nfor a senior, Senate-confirmed official to exercise these \nresponsibilities as the individual's principal duty.\n\n  The new report extends the time period for the sale of the naval \npetroleum reserve from 1 to 2 years. The 1 year period in the previous \nversion was insufficient to ensure that the taxpayers would obtain the \nmaximum value through knowledgeable competitive bidding.\n  The new report specifically requires consideration of costs and risks \nin the development of plans for future submarine technology. The \nprevious report omitted these vital factors, which could have lead to a \ngreat deal of wasted effort on theoretical and impractical approaches \nto modernizing our submarine fleet.\n\n\n                   important legislative initiatives\n\n  The conference report contains important legislative authorities \nwhich I support, such as:\n  Important military pay and allowance provisions, including a 2.4-\npercent pay raise for the troops and a 5.2-percent increase in the \nbasic allowance for quarters.\n  Approval of Secretary Perry's family and troop housing initiative, \nwhich would provide new authorities--including shared public and \nprivate sector funding--to finance needed construction and improvements \nin military housing.\n  Detailed acquisition reform legislation that complements last year's \nlandmark Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act. Key provisions would: \nUse simplified procedures to streamline the process of procuring \ncommercial products and services while preserving the requirement for \nfull and open competition; reduce the barriers that inhibit acquisition \nof commercial products by eliminating the requirement for certified \ncost and pricing data for commercial products; streamline the bid \nprotest process by eliminating the separate bid protest authority of \nthe General Services Board of Contract Appeals and providing for all \nbid protests to be determined by the General Accounting Office; \nconsolidate and clarify the standards of conduct for Federal officials \nin the acquisition process to ensure consistent treatment of such \npersonnel on a government-wide basis.\n\n[[Page S448]]\n\n  Establishment of a Defense Modernization Account. This provision, \nwhich I sponsored, will encourage the Department of Defense to achieve \nsavings in procurement, R, and operations and maintenance by allowing \nthe Department to place those savings in a new account, the Defense \nModernization Account. The Department could use amounts in the account \nto address funding shortfalls in the modernization of vital weapons \nsystems.\n\n\n                            continuing flaws\n\n  I am disappointed, however, that the conferees retained a variety of \nflawed provisions that were contained in the previous conference \nreport. I recognize that there was a reluctance to rewrite the entire \nconference report at this point in time, but I am particularly \nconcerned about a number which are contrary to the best interests of \nthe taxpayers and the national interest. I detailed the problems with \nthese provisions in my floor statement on December 19, and I will \nsimply highlight a number of my continuing concerns today.\n\n\n                               earmarking\n\n  Mr. President, I am particularly concerned about the provisions of \nthe bill which earmark the procurement of specific ships in specific \nshipyards. These anticompetitive provisions are contrary to the \nlongstanding practices of the Armed Services Committee. In the past, we \nhave provided appropriate guidance on the development and procurement \nof major weapons systems and to leave to the executive branch the \nprocess of awarding contracts. We have done this to ensure that the \nGovernment achieves the best price and quality based upon bids and \nproposals reviewed under merit-based criteria. We have endeavored to \navoid legislation and conference report language which earmarks \nspecific contracts to specific contractors. We have avoided earmarking \nbecause there is too great a danger that awards under such a system \ncould be based on political and parochial considerations rather than \nthe best interests of national defense. I am very concerned about the \nshipbuilding provisions of the conference report, which could lead to \nsubstantial unnecessary expenditures for the procurement of Navy \nvessels.\n  I am also concerned that section 1016 of the bill has the effect of \nearmarking a ship maintenance contract for a specific shipyard. This is \na provision that not only precludes competition, it also directs work \nto be performed that the Navy says is unnecessary. Once we start down \nthis route, other shipyards--as well as repair and maintenance \ncontractors for aircraft and vehicles--will want their share of these \ndirected, noncompetitive contracts. The Competition in Contracting Act \nis designed to save money through effective competition. From time to \ntime, there are exceptions which can be justified on the merits in \nterms of industrial base considerations--but those decisions should be \nmade on the basis of sound analysis and thorough consideration of \nexecutive branch views, not on the basis of legislated earmarks.\n\n\n                             protectionism\n\n  The conference report establishes new Buy American legislative \nprovisions for ships and naval equipment which will result in enormous \ncost increases for naval vessels and which could produce an unfavorable \nreaction against U.S. military sales abroad--one of the strongest \nelements of our export economy. As a result of the conference, foreign \ncountries which lose the right to bid on American contracts as a result \nof this provision will likely retaliate by imposing their own \nrestrictions on American products, thereby damaging the export sector \nof the United States that currently has a strong surplus.\n  There is ample existing authority for DOD to exclude foreign \ncompanies from competing on contracts when there is a valid industrial \nbase requirement for a domestic producer. The Department of Defense has \nnot requested any additional legislative authority to impose specific \nBuy-American requirements on the components listed in the conference \nreport. There has been no showing of a critical domestic industrial \nbase need that would justify singling out these vessel components, \namong the hundreds of thousands of items procured by the Department of \nDefense, as warranting protection from competition. Mr. President, I \nfind it strange that a Republican majority in the House and Senate \ncommitted to free trade and market competition, would inject the most \nsweeping Buy American provisions we have placed in a Defense \nauthorization bill I have ever seen. This will damage the U.S. defense \nindustry and the American taxpayer.\n  A more onerous Buy-American provision is set forth in the bill's \nauthority to use sealift funds to purchase vessels for the National \nDefense Reserve Fleet. Unlike the Buy-American provision that applies \nto components, which I previously discussed, the provision governing \nNational Defense Reserve Fleet vessels has no waiver authority. As a \nresult, DOD would be precluded from purchasing foreign vessels for the \nfive additional Roll-on/Roll-off ships called for in the mobility \nrequirements study, despite the potential for major savings to the \ntaxpayers. This provision could add over $1 billion to the cost of \nthese ships. The result could be a bonanza for certain domestic \nshipbuilders at taxpayer expense, or--what is more likely--the Navy \nwill decided that the cost is likely to be so high that the Navy might \nforego purchasing enough ships to meet mobility requirements. That \nwould be bad for the taxpayers and bad for national defense.\n\n\n                       unwise personnel policies\n\n  The conferees have approved legislation mandating the discharge of \nHIV-positive servicemembers. Out of the 1.4 million members of the \nArmed Forces on active duty, only 1,150 are HIV positive. That is less \nthan one-tenth of 1 percent. Moreover, these HIV-positive \nservicemembers constitute only 20 percent of the total permanent \nnondeployable personnel in the military. The other 80 percent \nnondeployable for reasons such as cancer, heart disease, asthma, and \ndiabetes. The bill requires discharge only of the HIV-positive \nservicemembers--not any of the other medically nondeployables.\n  This is particularly unfortunate because many of those who are HIV \npositive are not adversely affected in terms of their ability to \nperform useful military service.\n  Mr. President, we need to put a human face on these statistics.\n  There is a sergeant with 16 years of service, with a wife and two \nchildren, who contracted HIV from a blood transfusion. He is performing \nsophisticated personnel management activities in a nondeployable \nstatus. When he heard about our bill, he said to his commander: ``The \nservice is my life. I've given everything I have to it. When this bill \npasses, I'll be out of the service and out of a job. How am I supposed \nto support my family?'' What do we tell that sergeant and his family? \nHow can we justify to the taxpayers the waste of 16 years of military \ntraining and education?\n  There is a female staff sergeant with 8 years of service who is \nassigned to a high level administrative position in one of the military \ndepartments. She contracted HIV from her husband, who subsequently \ndied. She is the mother of a 4-year-old child. Under the bill, she will \nbe out of the service, out of a job, and ineligible to reach \nretirement. She is perfectly capable of continuing her outstanding \nperformance of duty, but now she will be fired.\n  There is an E-6 married for 10 years, who has a child and who is HIV \npositive. His service record includes a Navy Commendation Medal, two \nNavy Achievement Medals, and four sea-service deployment ribbons. His \nNavy Commendation Medal was awarded for automating a warehouse system \nthat saved the Navy an estimated $2 million over a 2 year period. He \nhas 12 years of service and has been HIV positive for 5 years. There is \na reasonable likelihood that he could serve for many more yeas, with \nthe potential to develop systems that will save millions more for the \nNavy. This bill deprives him of his livelihood and deprives and \ntaxpayers of the contributions that he can make to greater efficiency \nand savings.\n  There is a sergeant with 13 years of service who is married, with \nthree children. He is HIV positive, as is his wife and two of the three \nchildren. Under the bill before us, he is the only one of the family \nwho will retain a right to DOD medical care. His family, including his \nHIV-positive wife and two HIV-positive children, will be excluded from \nany DOD health care. As a result of the bill, he will be discharged \nfrom service, lose his employment, lose his retirement potential, and \nlose his family's \n\n[[Page S449]]\nmedical care. This is an individual who is perfectly capable of \nperforming military duties, yet we are going to throw away our \ninvestment in him and place him in dire financial straits. This is \nunacceptable.\n  Mr. President, these are but a few examples of the many productive \nservicemembers who will be discharged at great personal harm to them \nand their families, and at a great personnel investment loss to the \ntaxpayers. This is not a situation where we have a large number of \nnondeployables. The numbers are small--well within the range of the \nnumber of nondeployables who have been retained on active duty under \nlongstanding military manpower policies.\n  In my view, Mr. President, the HIV provision is counter productive \nshould have been stricken from the bill. In an effort to forge a \ncompromise, I proposed that the conferees establish a waiver \nprocedures. My compromise proposal would have permitted a Service Chief \nand Service Secretary to recommend waiver of the mandatory discharge, \non a case-by-case basis, when retention of the individual would be in \nthe ``best interests of the Department of Defense'' or would ``prevent \nan unacceptable hardship for the individual service member and the \nimmediate family.'' The majority conferees, however, refused to \nconsider this approach.\n  It is my hope, Mr. President, that we will come to our senses, take a \nrational look at this policy, and repeal it before it can do any harm.\n  Other flawed personnel provisions include unwarranted restrictions on \naccess of servicemembers and dependents overseas to abortion services \nat private expense and the unnecessary interjection of the judiciary \ninto POW/MIA determination process.\n\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n  Mr. President, I continue to be concerned abut these flawed policies \nas well as the others I discussed in my December 19 statement. In my \njudgment, however, in view of the important provisions contained in the \nconference report and the major changes that were made by the second \nconference, I believe it is time to enact these provisions into law and \nput this year's debate behind us. I will vote for the conference \nreport, but it is my intent to propose amendments during the coming \nyear to address the significant flaws that remain in the bill.\n  As I mentioned, Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator \nThurmond in support of the revised conference report on the National \nDefense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1996. Of course, this bill is \none of the major responsibilities of the Congress each year. Given the \nnumber of people who want to speak, I am going to make my remarks brief \nand summarize what is a very comprehensive bill.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Thurmond for his persistence \nand his tenacity and his dedication. Without that dedication and energy \nand leadership, we would not be here on this bill; certainly it would \nnot have come back after it was vetoed.\n  Mr. President, the revised conference report completely eliminates \nthe objectionable national missile defense language from the previous \nconference report. As I noted on the Senate floor in considerable \ndetail on a number of occasions, the language in the first conference \nreport amounted to an anticipatory breach of the Anti-Ballistic Missile \nTreaty.\n  Mr. President, we did have a compromise proposal that passed the \nSenate. That compromise proposal passed overwhelmingly in the Senate. \nIt was changed in the conference, and that is what prompted the veto \nfrom the President. That Senate language, which is not in the report \nthat has just passed, would still, I believe, be acceptable. Certainly, \nI hope we can work constructively in that regard this next year.\n  Mr. President, this conference report made a number of other \nsignificant changes, some of which were outlined in the veto message by \nthe President. Others were changes that I had urged and that others had \nurged, including the extension of the naval petroleum reserve sale to 2 \nyears, which I think is very important. The original bill, which was \nvetoed, had only 1 year, which could have put a tremendous amount of \npressure and resulted in perhaps billions of dollars of loss in the \ncompetitive bidding process to the taxpayers of America.\n  The new report also eliminates restrictions on U.S. forces that the \nWhite House had objected to. It eliminates the mandatory requirement on \ncontingency funding provisions for supplemental appropriations, \nreplacing it with a sense of Congress. It also eliminates the language \nwhich would have repealed the statutory authority for an independent \nDirector of Operational Test and Evaluation, and makes it clear that \nthe conferees support continued oversight of the special operations \nunder a DOD civilian official who is subject to Senate confirmation.\n  In addition, Mr. President, this conference report has a number of \nimportant legislative provisions, including military pay and allowance, \nincluding basic allowance for quarters for our military forces, \nincluding Secretary Perry's family and troop housing initiative, \nincluding detailed acquisition reform, which is enormously important, \nwhich streamlines the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act, and also \nincluding, I think, an important new provision, a defense modernization \naccount, which I sponsored, which in effect says to each of the \nservices, if you save money on any of your research and development \nprocurement, if you find ways to save money, you can put the money in \nthis specific account; and, subject to further approval of Congress, \nwhich I think would be almost automatic, hopefully, they will be able \nto spend this money on modernization.\n\n  This gives the military a real incentive to save money and put it \ninto much higher priority purposes because we all know we are going to \nbe very short in modernizing our force in the outyears.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona has enumerated a number of \nprovisions which he objects to in this bill. I too have some concerns \nabout this bill. I share his concern about earmarking of specific ships \nin specific shipyards. I think that works against the best interests of \nthe taxpayers. I think it is very poor procurement policy, and I \nbelieve it is a real danger in terms of eroding the kind of support we \nneed for the defense bill from the broad segment of the American people \nconcerned about how much money we spend. This is counterproductive, and \nit really means there is the danger we could go more and more toward \nawarding ship contracts to parochial interests or political interests \nrather than on the merits and based on true competition. That is \nsomething I hope we can correct next year. I raised that question over \nand over again to no avail.\n  Mr. President, this bill also, as the Senator from Arizona pointed \nout, has some buy American provisions in it that will cost us lots and \nlots of money in terms of lost trade because we will basically be \ntaking a trade advantage we have in defense articles and saying we are \nnot going to buy your articles and then we are going to get retaliation \nand we are going to have our own defense contractors and our own \nworkers suffer. So in order to help a few defense contractors, we are \nhurting a much broader segment and we are hurting our overall work \nforce when we do that. I hope we can take corrective steps on those buy \nAmerican provisions which I will not enumerate in the interest of time.\n  One other subject which I think has to be mentioned this evening is \nthe provision in this bill on mandating by law the discharge of HIV \npositive service members. This was not requested by the Department of \nDefense, not requested by any of the military services. Out of 1.4 \nmillion members of the armed services on active duty, 1,150 are HIV \npositive. That is less than one-tenth of 1 percent. Moreover, these HIV \npositive service members constitute only one-fifth or 20 percent of the \ntotal permanent nondeployable personnel in the military. The other 80 \npercent are people who cannot be deployed into combat for reasons such \nas cancer, heart attack or heart disease, asthma and diabetes. The bill \nrequires discharge only of HIV positive service members, not any of the \nother medically nondeployable personnel.\n  This is particularly unfortunate because many of those who are HIV \npositive are really not adversely affected in terms of their ability to \nperform their job in a useful way. If they are adversely affected in \nthat regard, certainly there is every right to discharge under the \ncurrent law. \n\n[[Page S450]]\n\n  Mr. President, we need to put a human face on this matter rather than \ntreating it simply as some abstract political move which it has been \ntreated as so far. Let me just give the Senate three or four real human \nexamples that already have come to my attention that are going to \nsuffer serious consequences as a result of the provision in this bill \nwhich I think is very unwise. There is a sergeant with 16 years of \nservice, with a wife and two children, who contracted HIV from a blood \ntransfusion. He is performing sophisticated personnel management \nactivities in a nondeployable status--16 years of investment we have in \nthis sergeant that has tremendous experience in his area of expertise. \nWhen he heard about our bill, he went to his commander, and he said, \n``The service is my life. I have given everything I have to it. When \nthis bill passes, I'll be out of the service and out of a job. How am I \nsupposed to support my family?'' What do we tell that sergeant and his \nfamily, Mr. President? How can we justify to the taxpayers the waste of \n16 years of military training and education?\n\n  Another example. A female staff sergeant with 8 years of service--\nthese are actual examples--who is assigned to a high-level \nadministrative position in one of the military departments contacted \nHIV from her husband who subsequently died. She is the mother of a 4-\nyear-old child. Under the bill, she will be out of the service, out of \na job, and ineligible to reach retirement even though she already has \nput in 8 years in the military and performs her job very ably every \nday. She is perfectly capable of continuing her outstanding performance \nof duty but now she is going to be fired by law.\n  We do not give discretion to anyone. We just say, Fire them all. Fire \nthem all. They have HIV. Get rid of them.\n  It does not matter how they got it. It does not matter whether it is \ntheir fault--even a blood transfusion, getting it from your wife or \nfrom your husband. We are firing them.\n  Another example. There is an E-6 married for 10 years who has a child \nand is HIV positive. His service record includes a Navy Commendation \nMedal, two Navy Achievement Medals, and four sea-service deployment \nribbons. His Navy Commendation Medal was awarded for automating a \nwarehouse system that saved the Navy an estimated $2 million over a 2-\nyear period. He has 12 years of service, has been HIV positive for 5 \nyears. There is a reasonable likelihood he could serve for many more \nyears with the potential to develop systems that will save millions of \ndollars for the Navy. This bill deprives him of his livelihood, \ndeprives the taxpayers of his contributions that he can make to the \nmilitary service.\n  Another example. A sergeant with 13 years of service, married with \nthree children, is HIV positive as is his wife and two of the three \nchildren.\n  Under the bill before us, he is the only one in the family who will \nretain the right to DOD medical care. His family, including his HIV \npositive wife and two HIV positive children will be excluded from any \nDOD health care as a result of this bill. As a result of this bill, he \nwill be discharged from the service, lose his employment, lose his \nretirement potential, and lose his family's medical care. This is an \nindividual who is perfectly capable of performing military duties, yet \nwe are going to throw away our investment in him, and place him and his \nfamily in dire financial straits.\n  Mr. President, as everyone in this Chamber knows, I led the fight in \nmaking sure that we have a sensible provision in terms of gays and \nlesbians serving in the military service. That is not what we are \ntalking about here. We are talking about punitive action. We are \ntalking about action that does not make any sense from any point of \nview.\n  During the consideration of this bill and in conference, I proposed a \ncompromise. I proposed that the conferees establish a waiver provision. \nMy compromise proposal would have permitted a service Chief and a \nservice Secretary--would require both, both the uniformed military and \nthe civilian to recommend waiver of the mandatory discharge that is in \nthis bill on a case-by-case basis, when retention of the individual \nwould be in the best interests of the Department of Defense or would \npresent an unacceptable hardship for the individual servicemember \nand his immediate family. The majority of conferees, however, did not \nconsider this approach.\n\n  I have given just a few examples where there is going to be \ntremendous harm to families, great personnel investment loss to the \ntaxpayers. The numbers are small but the human tragedy here is going to \nbe very large for no justifiable military reason. We are not talking \nabout unit cohesion now. We are not talking about morale in the \nmilitary. We are talking about people who can do their job and who may \nhave been infected with HIV for no fault whatsoever of their own.\n  I am concerned about these flawed policies. I am also concerned about \nthe overseas abortion services restrictions that are in this bill, and \nI am also concerned about, as Senator McCain said, what I believe to be \nthe unnecessary interjection of the judiciary into the POW/MIA \ntermination process.\n  However, in my judgment, the overall balance is in favor of passage \nof this bill, and it has passed. I believe it is time to enact these \nprovisions into law and put this year's debate behind us. And, of \ncourse, I voted for the conference report because of my overall feeling \nof the necessity of getting this report passed for the benefit of our \nmilitary services and our national security. But we have some badly \nflawed policies in this bill that need protecting, and I will be \nworking with others to try to change those provisions in the coming \nyear.\n\n\n   the revised conference agreement on the fiscal year 1996 national \n                       defense authorization bill\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I regret very much that I come to the \nSenate floor today to speak against the revised conference agreement on \nthe fiscal year 1996 national defense authorization bill. To my dismay, \nthis revised conference agreement is significantly worse than the first \nagreement. It is another example of the inability of Congress to put \naside the wasteful, pork-barrel spending practices of the past.\n\n\n              opposition to original conference agreement\n\n  Mr. President, I voted against the original conference agreement for \nseveral reasons, principally:\n  The inclusion of an additional $493 million for the B-2 bomber \nprogram.\n  Authorization for a third Seawolf submarine.\n  The $700 million for unrequested, low-priority military construction \nprojects.\n  The $777 million for unrequested equipment for the Guard and Reserve, \nwithout regard to the priorities of the Guard and Reserve.\n  Legislation placing unnecessary and counter-productive ``Buy \nAmerica'' restrictions on DOD's procurement decisions, to the detriment \nof our relations with some of our most faithful allies.\n  Legislation directing the noncompetitive allocation of four attack \nsubmarine contracts to Electric Boat and Newport News shipyards.\n  Myriad earmarks for entities and organizations favored by individual \nMembers of this body.\n  And finally the unworkable, unnecessary, and burdensome new \nprovisions dealing with POW/MIA issues.\n  For all of these reasons, which are discussed in more detail in my \nstatement contained in the December 19, 1995, Congressional Record, I \nvoted against the original conference agreement on this bill.\n\n\n  supporting the committee and the authorization/appropriation process\n\n  Now, I know that some of my colleagues were disturbed at my decision \nto cast my vote against the bill, even though the bill did pass the \nSenate. But, Mr. President, let me state very clearly that it was not \nan easy decision for me to make.\n  I have great respect for Chairman Thurmond, and I know that he worked \nvery hard to accomplish the principal task of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee--enactment of the annual defense authorization legislation. \nIt saddens me that, to date, that goal has not been accomplished.\n  Having served for more than 8 years on the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, I also clearly appreciate the Committee's crucial role in \nthe Congress' defense budget review. As I said on the floor last \nDecember, this Committee has been at the forefront of the debate on \nnational security policy and defense programs since the days of John \nTower's chairmanship. The authorization \n\n[[Page S451]]\ncommittee, with its historically unbiased and nonparochial approach to \ndefense issues, is an essential check-and-balance in the congressional \nbudget process. In my view, it would be in the best interests of our \nNation's national security to sustain the relevance and viability of \nthe Armed Services Committee in the defense budget and policy review \nprocess.\n  For these reasons, I voted in committee last summer to report a \ndefense authorization bill to the Senate floor, and I also reluctantly \nsigned the original conference agreement. In both instances, I opposed \nmany of the principal provisions in the bill. In taking these actions, \nI was not supporting the bill itself. I was supporting the Chairman, \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee, and the congressional budget \nreview process.\n  When it came time to cast my vote in the Senate on the original \nconference agreement, I came to the conclusion that the many positive \naspects of the bill were outweighed by its negative provisions \ndiscussed above. I therefore voted against the original conference bill \nlast December.\n\n\n             problems with the revised conference agreement\n\n  When the President vetoed the original conference agreement late in \nDecember, I was hopeful that some of my objections would be addressed \nin a revised conference agreement. To that end, I wrote to Chairman \nThurmond on January 4, 1996, to ask that he revisit some of these \nissues. I made it very clear that I could not support a revised \nconference agreement which does not address my specific concerns with \nthe original, vetoed bill.\n  But my concerns were, unfortunately, ignored.\n\n\n                               veto fixes\n\n  Mr. President, while the conference agreement does address the three \nmajor objections raised by the President, in my view, the conferees \noverreacted by stripping two provisions from the bill and substantially \nmodifying the third.\n  I was disappointed that the conferees chose to eliminate entirely the \npolicy language for national missile defense programs. I fully support \nthe early deployment of effective missile defense at an affordable \ncost, which is what the conferees directed in the original agreement. \nUnfortunately, the conferees chose to strike this entire section from \nthe bill, instead of working to modify it slightly to achieve some \nprogress toward a meaningful effort to protect the people of the United \nStates from accidental or unauthorized attacks.\n\n  The conferees also chose to remove entirely the language restricting \nthe President's ability to place U.S. military forces under the command \nand control of the United Nations. The President did object strongly to \nthe requirement to certify a national security interest before placing \nour troops under U.N. command. However, it seems to me, at a minimum, \nthat it would have been useful to retain some statement of the \nCongress' strong objection to this type of action, as a base upon which \nto proceed with additional legislation during this year.\n  Finally, the conferees caved in to the President's objections to \nlanguage requiring submission of a timely supplemental appropriations \nrequest to pay for contingency and peacekeeping operations. This \nlanguage constituted nothing more than an expansion of the current law \nwhich requires submission of a Federal budget request each year at a \nspecified time. Changing the conference language from a requirement to \na sense of the Congress provision seems to be a very fine distinction \nand an unnecessary change.\n  Certain other changes were made to address the President's objections \nto the bill, most of which I do not oppose. However, I should note that \nvery little was done to address a major concern raised by the \nPresident, namely, the noncompetitive allocation of shipbuilding and \nship repair contracts. Another area that was not resolved to the \nsatisfaction of the administration was the ``Buy America'' language, to \nwhich I also objected. Both of these are provisions to which I also \nobjected.\n\n\n                              buy america\n\n  Mr. President, let me take a moment to discuss the ``Buy America'' \nrestrictions in this bill. The conferees did remove a waiver provision \nwhich would have had the unintended consequence of rewarding nations \nwith a history of retaliatory trade practices. However, the bill adds \n``Buy America'' restrictions for propellers, ball bearings, and many \nother items which, frankly, are counterproductive to our ongoing trade \nrelations with our most important allies.\n  As an example, the British placed orders for approximately $5 billion \nin United States-made defense articles last year; United States orders \nof British-made defense items totaled only about $800 million last \nyear, a ratio of 4-to-1 to our economic advantage. This is a somewhat \nunusual year, in terms of the size of British orders to United States \ncompanies. I am advised that, on average, the British Government \npurchases twice as much defense equipment from the United States as we \ndo from them.\n\n  Yet, even with this obvious economic advantage to the United States \nof doing business with the British Government, the new restrictions in \nthis conference agreement would require the Pentagon to purchase many \nitems from United States manufacturers rather than allowing competition \nfrom British and other foreign manufacturers. The result is that the \nU.S. taxpayer will not necessarily get the best deal on the price of \nthese goods, and our trade relations with our allies will suffer as a \nresult.\n  Let me take a moment to list some of the specific defense items that \nthe British Government has procured from United States contractors.\n  Laser guided bombs from Texas Instruments.\n  C-130J aircraft from Lockheed-Martin.\n  Airborne stand-off radar system from a Loral/Raytheon team.\n  CH-47 helicopters from Boeing.\n  Infra-red countermeasures capability from Northrop Grumman.\n  Torpedo engines from Sundstrand.\n  I should also note that the British Government has announced its \nintention to sign contracts for two major procurements which affect \ncontractors in my State of Arizona, namely, McDonnell-Douglas' Apache \nhelicopters and Hughes' Tomahawk missiles.\n  Let me take a few minutes to talk about some of the specific domestic \nsource restrictions in the bill.\n  The bill establishes in permanent law a requirement to buy the \nfollowing defense items from U.S. suppliers:\n  Welded anchor and mooring chains, which benefits one company in \nPennsylvania and possibly another in Washington State.\n  Air circuit breakers, which benefits two companies in Pennsylvania.\n  Vessel propellers of at least 6 feet in diameter, which benefits \ncompanies in Mississippi and Pennsylvania, and possibly Massachusetts.\n  Enclosed lifeboats, which benefits a company in Florida.\n  Ball and roller bearings, which benefits a company in South Carolina.\n  Gyrocompasses, benefiting a company in Virginia.\n  Electronlic navigation chart systems, benefiting 12 companies in \nMaryland, California, Iowa, Utah, Massachusetts, and Virginia.\n  Steering controls, benefits six companies in Louisiana, California, \nWisconsin, and Georgia.\n  Pumps, benefiting 25 companies scattered throughout the United \nStates.\n  Propulsion and machine controls, benefiting a company in California \nand one in Canada.\n  I find it interesting to note that these restrictions are usually \njustified on the basis of industrial base concerns, but in 6 of these \n10 cases, there are at least 2 U.S. manufacturers of these items, and \nin some cases as many as 25 U.S. suppliers. Where is the threat to our \nindustrial base for these items?\n  Several provisions in the bill have specific relevance to our defense \ntrade with the British. The bill restricts the purchase of ball and \nroller bearings; there is a competent British manufacturer of these \nitems. The bill also restricts procurement of propellers for naval \nvessels; a competent British source exists for these items. British \ncompanies are also capable of producing electrical navigation charts, \npropulsion systems, and a number of the other items that are limited in \nthis bill to American companies.\n  This bill adds a number of new Buy America restrictions, although not \nby any means all of the items the House \n\n[[Page S452]]\nbill would have protected. I can assume that there are still other \nindustries who might want to take advantage of the apparent willingness \nof the Congress to enact this type of protectionist legislation. If \nthat were the case, if even more defense items were added to the \ndomestic sources restrictions for Pentagon procurement, the negative \nimpact on both foreign and U.S. business could be far greater.\n  For example, many British companies have entered into teaming \narrangements with United States companies to compete for contracts for \nsome very important United States military programs. Shorts Bros., \nteamed with Lockheed-Martin, is interested in the Starstreak air-to-air \nmissile system for the Apache helicopter. British Aerospace, teamed \nwith Hughes, is interested in the AIM-9X advanced short-range air-to-\nair missile program. Westlands, teamed with McDonnell-Douglas, is \ninterested in the EH-101 combat support helicopter for the Navy. GEC, \nteamed with Northrop Grumman, is interested in the Army's Infra-red \ncountermeasures program.\n  Judging by the enthusiasm of Congress for legislating Buy America \nrestrictions, some of these British companies could, in the future, be \nprecluded from competing for United States defense business. The \nsecondary impact of additional Buy America restrictions would then be \npreventing their U.S. teaming partners from competing for these \ncontracts. That is an outcome that I suspect many of my colleagues had \nnot considered.\n  Mr. President, some of these restrictions have been in place for many \nyears. The Buy American Act of 1933 implemented the first restrictions \non U.S. Government purchases of foreign-made products. Since this type \nof protectionist trade legislation was initiated, items such as food, \nclothing, fabrics, watches, bolts, and nuts have been required to be \npurchased from American companies. In the defense field, the Pentagon \nmust purchase from American companies such items as buses, machine \ntools, bearings, anchor and mooring chains, and numerous other items.\n  Let me cite one particular instance in this bill. The ball bearing \nindustry in this country has been protected from foreign competition \nfor many years, but the existing Buy America restriction ended last \nOctober. This bill extends the restriction until the year 2000. It \nseems to me that, if an American company cannot position itself to \ncompete in the international marketplace after a period of protection \nfrom competition, perhaps there is more benefit to the American \ntaxpayer in permitting foreign companies to compete for that Government \nbusiness than in propping up a weak American concern.\n  Mr. President, I talked with the British Defense Minister last week. \nThe British Defense Minister made it very clear, very clear, that, if \nthese Buy America provisions prevailed, they will have to reevaluate \ntheir policies of purchasing defense and other products from the United \nStates of America.\n  I cannot understand why the conferees decided to implement these \nadditional protections for U.S. businesses. In my view, they are \nextremely short-sighted, in that they do not take into account the \ndistinct possibility that our trading partners may understandably \ndecide to retaliate against these unfair, protectionists restrictions \nby denying the United States access to their markets, defense or \notherwise.\n  It is a bizarre circumstance, in my view, when the U.S. Congress \nconcocts legislation which operates counter to the best interests of \nthe taxpayer and which threatens our positive defense trade balance \nwith allies like the British. I generally do not favor trade \nrestrictions of any kind. In particular, the defense trade restrictions \ncontained in this bill are not necessary to protect any U.S. defense \nindustrial base. And further, defense trade restrictions negatively \naffect our defense capability by inhibiting the Pentagon's ability to \nbuy the best weapons systems at the cheapest cost from any supplier in \nthe world.\n  I had hoped that the unnecessary restrictions added in this bill \nwould be removed in the second conference, as requested in the \nPresident's veto message, but they were not. I intend to work to remove \nthese counter-productive domestic source restrictions to ensure free \nand open markets for defense goods and services. A true two-way street \narrangement with our loyal allies, such as the British, is the best way \nto ensure the future availability of defense items which are vital to \nthe continued readiness of our Armed Forces and those of our allies.\n\n\n                      new provisions and reversals\n\n  Mr. President, beyond the action of the conferees in addressing some \nof the major veto objections, it is entirely incomprehensible to me \nthat the conferees decided to add entirely new material and to reverse \nprevious good decisions in order to satisfy some Members' parochial \ninterests. These additions and changes were not even mentioned in the \nPresident's veto message.\n  Let me review just a few examples of programs which were added in the \nsecond conference agreement. These earmarks were gratuitously added to \nmatch funding included in the already enacted Defense Appropriations \nAct.\n  Some $10 million was earmarked for Aurora Borealis research, called \nthe HAARP Program, in Alaska.\n  This program is a perennial congressional add-on, and its relevance \nto military requirements is completely inexplicable; 2 years ago, the \nprogram was described as a technology which would allow the United \nStates military to locate tunnels and caverns in North Korea which \ncould hide artillery pieces. Last year, an article in the Washington \nPost, April 17, quotes Pentagon and contractor officials who claim that \nthe program will enhance communications with submarines. Still others \nclaim that the program could seriously disrupt communications around \nthe globe.\n  For a program which has been ongoing for a number of years and which \nis estimated to cost $160 million, it seems that a clear military \npurpose should be identified for it. And it seems that the Pentagon \nshould be requesting funding for this program if it is of any military \nrelevance whatsoever.\n  Some $10 million was earmarked for the Thermionics Program, in \naddition to $12 million in prior year funds which are directed to be \ntransferred to the program. I understand that this earmark was \nmistakenly dropped in the conference agreement. However, in my view, \nthat does not make any less onerous the fact that an earmark has been \nadded in bill language that was not included in either of the Senate or \nHouse versions of the bill, or in the original conference agreement.\n  In addition, the revised conference agreement contains a legislative \nearmark of $4 million for a Counterterror Explosives Research Program, \nwhich was not included in the bill language in either the House or \nSenate version of the bill or in the original conference agreement. \nApparently, this earmark was moved from the report language to the bill \nlanguage, in exchange for the inclusion of the thermionics earmark in \nbill language. An interesting tradeoff.\n  The conferees also reversed several policy decisions contained in the \nfirst conference agreement. For example:\n\n  The decision to shut down the unnecessary National Drug Intelligence \nCenter in Pennsylvania was reversed, and the new conference agreement \nprovides $20 million for its continued operation.\n  Mr. President, let me take just a moment to discuss this issue. The \nfiscal year 1994 Defense Appropriations Act directed DOD to fund the \nstaff and operation of the National Drug Intelligence Center [NDIC], \nlocated in Johnstown, PA, for the Department of Justice. Over the past \n5 years, DOD has spent over $102 million in support of this center.\n  Because of concern over the amount of defense funding being used to \nfund a Department of Justice operation, the Senate adopted a provision \nin its version of the fiscal year 1996 National Defense Authorization \nAct limiting DOD support to providing 36 skilled technicians. What this \nmeans is that the DOD would no longer pay the salaries of the 209 \nDepartment of Justice employees at the center, nor would it pay for the \ntravel and other associated costs of these employees. I believe that \nthis is more than fair. If the Attorney General believes that NDIC \nprovides a valuable service to Justice Department operations, then the \nDepartment of Justice should pay for its operations.\n  The original conference agreement included the Senate's provision. \nUnfortunately, when the bill came back from \n\n[[Page S453]]\nconference the second time, the restrictions had been removed and $20 \nmillion was authorized for operation of the center in fiscal year 1996.\n  Mr. President, there is no defensible reason this issue was reopened \nin conference. It was not mentioned in the President's veto message. \nNobody has been able to justify why the Department of Defense should be \npaying the bill for this Department of Justice operation. Apparently, \nhowever, one powerful Member of Congress had a special interest in this \nproject, and so it was restored.\n  The conferees also reversed a decision of the first conference to \nprohibit the Department of Defense from entering into a long-term lease \nagreement for a financial management educational institution in \nSouthbridge, MA, without benefit of competitive, merit-based selection. \nThis is, of course, unacceptable, Mr. President.\n  Again, let me take a moment to discuss this provision in the revised \nconference agreement. While I understand that the legislation still \nrequires the Department of Defense to choose the site of the Defense \nBusiness Management University by using a merit-based competition, I \nbelieve that the original conference agreement was much clearer in \ndemonstrating the intent of Congress that such a site be chosen on its \nmerits.\n\n  I believe that the administration made an error in judgment when it \ndecided to spend $69 million on a lease for a privately-owned facility \nwhich will have to be substantially renovated to accommodate the \nrequirements of a teaching institution. There is no justification for \nthis when there are suitable facilities, already designed and equipped \nto perform this activity, at many of the military bases that are being \nclosed through the BRAC process.\n  I have always maintained that competition should be used in selecting \nsites to host Federal facilities, and I will be monitoring the \nselection process of this site to ensure that the American taxpayer's \ninterests are protected.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the conferees struck from this revised \nagreement the prohibition on obligating funds for five unauthorized, \nearmarked projects contained in the fiscal year 1995 Defense \nAppropriations Act.\n  Mr. President, since the days of John Tower's chairmanship of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, the Senate Armed Services Committee \nhas faithfully fulfilled its role of authorizing the expenditure of \ndefense funds. While there is some disagreement about the extent to \nwhich the authorizing committee should insist on a say in the \nallocation of funds, the committee has maintained a clear oversight \nrole in this regard. Unfortunately, the decision of the conferees to \nstrip this provision from the bill essentially waives the requirement \nthat appropriations must be authorized on a line-item level.\n  I suspect also that this provision was waived because the five \nspecific programs for which appropriations were provided without \nauthorization are programs which have special interest for certain \nMembers of Congress. The programs for which the original conference \nagreement had prohibited the obligation of unauthorized appropriations \nwere: $2.4 million for the TARTAR support equipment program for the \nNavy; $8 million for natural gas utilization equipment for the Navy; \n$7.5 million for a munitions standardization-plasma furnace technology \nprogram for the Army; $2 million for a cold pasteurization/\nsterilization program for the Army, and $500,000 for an air beam tents \nprogram for the Army.\n\n  By striking the prohibition on spending approximately $20 million for \nthese five programs, this revised conference agreement provides a \nretroactive authorization for these unauthorized appropriations, a \ndecision with which I strongly disagree.\n  Mr. President, again, I find it incomprehensible that the conferees \non this bill decided to reconsider matters which had been resolved by \nthe full conference and which had nothing whatsoever to do with the \nPresident's veto of the original conference agreement.\n\n\n                       original objections remain\n\n  I am also distressed that none of the provisions to which I objected \nin the first conference agreement were satisfactorily addressed in this \nnew agreement. So, like the first conference agreement, nearly $4 \nbillion of the $7 billion in defense spending added by Congress is \nwasted on unnecessary programs like the B-2 bomber, low-priority \nmilitary construction projects, unrequested equipment for the Guard and \nReserve, earmarks for Members' special interest items, and the like.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  Mr. President, for reasons which are not readily apparent to me, not \nall members of the Armed Services Committee were appointed as conferees \nfor the second conference on this bill. I and a number of my other \ncommittee colleagues did not serve as conferees, and therefore, we did \nnot have an opportunity to discuss or vote on any of the changes \nincluded in this new agreement.\n  For many years, I have been dedicated to exposing to the public \ninstances of congressional mismanagement of taxpayer dollars. I have \nspoken out against wasteful spending and earmarks whenever it appears, \nwhether in authorization or appropriation legislation. But the wasteful \nspending that is most offensive to me is that which is included in \ndefense spending bills. Pork-barrel spending of defense dollars diverts \nresources from higher priority military requirements and potentially \nsquanders the support of the American people for an adequate defense \nbudget, and without that support, insufficient resources devoted to \ndefense may potentially endanger the security of our people.\n  The examples I have cited today--which bear little or no relevance to \nmilitary requirements--are the most dangerous kind of pork-barrel \nspending. By approving the earmarks and add-ons in this bill, Congress \nis diverting scarce defense resources from other important defense \nprograms which are necessary to ensure the security of our Nation. No \nother wasteful spending carries with it the potential for such great \ndanger. The American public should be disturbed by this egregious waste \nof their money, and for this reason, I intend to vote against this \nrevised conference agreement.\n  Mr. President, I spoke earlier about my respect for Chairman Thurmond \nand the role of the Senate Armed Services Committee in the \nauthorization and appropriation process. Looking at the magnitude of \nthe wasteful spending in this bill, and the unprecedented degree of \nearmarking of funds for the narrow interests of some Members of \nCongress, my disappointment tempts me to rethink my view of the \ncommittee's role in the process. However, I am convinced that the bill \nbefore the Senate today is an anomaly and not a harbinger of the \nauthorization process in the future. I will certainly do everything in \nmy power to ensure that the committee retains its traditional, \nnonparochial approach to oversight of defense policy and budget issues, \nwith the best interests of our military services and our national \nsecurity as the highest priorities.\n  Mr. President, I want to say again if we continue to do this, if we \ncontinue to add unneeded, unwanted, unnecessary pork barrel spending on \ndefense authorization appropriations bills, the American people will \nlose confidence that their defense dollars earmarked for defense are \nbeing wisely and efficiently spent and we will not get the necessary \nfunds to maintain this Nation's vital national security interests.\n  This has got to stop, Mr. President. I hope that next year we can \nbegin anew and recognize that we cannot do these things because we do \nnot have the money in the defense budget anymore, and it is an \nabrogation of our responsibilities to the American taxpayer. Mr. \nPresident, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support the conference report on the \nDefense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996, S. 1124.\n  I voted against the earlier conference report last December. That \nbill had many serious defects that would have harmed our national \nsecurity, rather than strengthening it. President Clinton vetoed the \nbill, and the veto was sustained by the House of Representatives \nearlier this month.\n  In the conference, the Senate and House have reconsidered many of the \nkey issues cited by those of us who opposed the bill and by the \nPresident in justifying his veto. Both sides have made a genuine effort \nto reach common ground. As a result, the current bill contains many \nnoteworthy improvements.\n\n[[Page S454]]\n\n  I want to commend the Committee Chairman, Senator Thurmond and the \ndistinguished Ranking Member, Senator Nunn, as well as their \ncounterparts in the House, Congressman Spence and Congressman Dellums, \nfor their leadership in guiding this conference. In addition, I commend \nSenator Exon, Senator Warner, Congressman Montgomery and Congressman \nBateman and the other conferees for their constructive roles in \nproducing this much improved bill.\n  First and most important, the provision in the earlier bill calling \nfor deployment of a national missile defense system has been dropped. \nThat provision would have called upon the United States to violate the \nlandmark Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, waste billions of dollars on an \nunnecessary Star Wars system, and would have undermined the START II \nTreaty with Russia. That provision was the worst defect in the earlier \nbill, and I commend the conferees for deleting it.\n  In addition, two other objectionable provisions were dropped. One \nwould have limited the ability of the President to put U.S. Forces \nunder operational or tactical control of the United Nations. Limiting \nthe President's control of U.S. forces in the field restricts his \nconstitutionally-guaranteed powers as commander-in-chief.\n  In addition, the previous bill restricted the President's ability to \ncarry out contingency operations as he sees fit. This too was an \nunwarranted restriction on the President's ability to carry out his \nduties and to deploy troops whenever and wherever U.S. security demands \nit.\n  Despite these key improvements, objectionable provisions in the bill \nremain. One of the worst provisions calls for the mandatory discharge \nof any members of the armed forces found to be HIV-positive. This \nprovision has no legitimate purpose.\n  It singles our for discriminatory treatment a group of loyal American \nservicemen and women who have contracted HIV. These men and women are \nstill able to serve in the armed forces, and they do so under the same \nconditions as troops who suffer from other debilitating diseases, such \nas hepatitis, cancer, diabetes, asthma, or heart disease. Those \nindividuals, however, are not summarily discharged, and neither should \npersons with HIV.\n  The Defense Department opposes this provision. The Department is able \nto meet the needs of force readiness and treating these individuals \nwith respect for the service they provide their nation.\n  Soon, stories will begin to appear of loyal soldiers, sailors, \nmarines, and airmen who have been thrown out into the street, denied \nthe chance to continue serving their country, unable to obtain health \ninsurance for their family members who are also afflicted with this \ncondition.\n  I hope that supporters of this provision will recognize both the \nbigotry and cruelty that underlie it, and will repeal it as soon as \npossible. I believe that a majority of Congress favors its repeal, and \nI will work over the year ahead to achieve such repeal.\n  The conference report also includes a provision that prohibits \nservice women based overseas from obtaining abortions with their own \nprivate funds in U.S. military medical facilities. I opposed this \nprovision when it was included in the Defense Appropriations bill, and \nI oppose it now. We have always provided access for service women \noverseas to obtain the same quality health care available to those on \nduty in the United States, and continue to do so.\n  I am also concerned about several issues related to the shipbuilding \nprovisions in the bill. We have examined these provisions in detail in \nthe Seapower Subcommittee, and I believe they will cause uncertainty, \ninefficiency, and unnecessary expenditures in the Department's \nshipbuilding program.\n  Finally, I oppose the bill's endorsement of $7 billion in spending \nabove the level requested by the Pentagon. This is the level of \nspending provided in the Defense Appropriations bill, previously \nenacted, which I opposed. It is wrong for Congress to force the \nAdministration to accept a level of defense funding above what the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff and the Secretary of Defense have requested.\n  It is especially wrong to do so at a same time when key programs that \nbenefit other Americans are being severely shortchanged by Republican \nbudgets. ``Let the Pentagon eat cake'' is no answer to our budget \nimpasse.\n  Despite these defects, I believe that on balance, the overall bill \ndeserves to be enacted. We need to protect our national defense, and \nthis bill is already long overdue in the fiscal year. The worst defects \nin the earlier bill have been eliminated, and we will continue to seek \nopportunities in other ways to remedy the remaining defects.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the \ndistinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee in supporting \nthe conference report on the DoD authorization bill which is currently \nbefore the Senate. Although this bill is the result of further \ncompromise with the administration and, therefore is not all we hoped \nfor, it is still a good bill.\n  We must keep in mind that there are important items in this \nConference Report that would have been lost if a compromise had not \nbeen reached and the President's veto had been allowed to stand.\n  In addition to a pay raise of 2.4 percent and a 5.2 percent increase \nin basic quarters allowance, there are numerous other provisions in \nthis bill to enhance the quality of life for our military personnel and \ntheir families, including new authorities to improve the quality and \nquantity of military housing; to improve health care and dental care \nfor both active duty personnel and reservists; additional increases in \nspecial pay and allowances; and COLA equity for military retirees.\n  In addition, this bill enacts a plan, which I introduced in the \nSenate, for the construction of nuclear attack submarines that will \nensure adequate and effective competition in the years ahead.\n  All of these things would have been lost if we had not been able to \nreach a compromise.\n  However, we should not lose sight of the important provisions which \nwe were forced to drop in order to get the President's commitment that \nhe would sign the conference report. I would like to join with my \nRepublican colleagues in putting all on notice that the battle for \nenactment of these provisions is far from over.\n  Despite President Clinton's objections, I believe that it is vital \nthat we enact a plan to provide for the deployment of an effective \nballistic missile defense system for our nation. This is a basic \nresponsibility of a government to provide for the security of its \npeople. We have not done enough in this area. I am pleased that the \nprovisions on theater missile defenses which will provide protection \nfor our troops deployed overseas were retained in the final version of \nthis bill, but we must continue to push for a national missile defense \nsystem.\n  As I listened to the President's State of the Union address earlier \nthis week, I was struck by the President's comments that Russian \nmissiles are no longer targeted at America's children. As we all know, \nthose missiles can be retargeted on a moment's notice. The Russian \ncapability to destroy our nation with their intercontinental ballistic \nmissile force remains.\n  Moreover, the capability of Third World countries and rogue nations \nor terrorists to acquire weapons of mass destruction and ballistic \nmissile delivery systems is growing.\n  The way to ensure that our children will be protected is to build a \ndefensive capability to counter such attacks. I would rather rely on a \nUnited States defense system, rather than Russian promises, to protect \nour great land.\n  I am working with my Republican colleagues to draft legislation on \nnational missile defense, which we will introduce in the near future.\n  The second issue I would like to address is U.N. command and control. \nI have grave reservations about placing U.S. troops under U.N. command \nand control. That is why I joined, over a year ago, with Senator Dole \nand others in cosponsoring S. 5 to put conditions and restrictions on \nthe President's ability to place U.S. troops in such command \narrangements. Unfortunately, even the scaled-back version which \nappeared in the original conference report on this issue--which \nessentially amounted only to a reporting requirement--was rejected by \nthe President. Again, this issue will not be forgotten.\n\n[[Page S455]]\n\n  As a final note, I would like to comment on the President's \nobjections to the additional $7 billion contained in this conference \nreport--an amount that was above the President's request for defense. \nAt the time that the President and other administration officials are \ncomplaining about added dollars for defense, they are finding more and \nmore ways to spend those defense dollars.\n  I learned this morning that the Bosnia operation is now estimated to \ncost $2.5 billion. This is up from the original estimates of $1.5-$1.9 \nbillion. And this does not include the roughly $600 million in \nreconstruction aid for Bosnia to which we have committed. I was alarmed \nto learn that the Administration will propose that at least the first \n$200 million in reconstruction aid will be paid for out of the DOD \nbudget. In my opinion, this is but the first step in a raid on the \ndefense budget to find the vast sums that will be needed to rebuild \nBosnia. I will resist this effort and work with my colleagues to find \nalternate, nondefense sources of funds for this portion of the Bosnia \nmission. The Defense Department is doing more than its fair share. It \nis time to look elsewhere for a bill payer.\n  In addition to the Bosnia operation, there are ongoing contingency \noperations in other nations--also not budgeted for--that will result in \na request for approximately $500 million in supplemental funding for \nthe Defense Department in the current fiscal year.\n  Add to that the millions of dollars DOD will pay for the F-16s that \nwe have recently promised to send to Jordan, and you see how our \ndefense dollars are quickly eroding.\n  Mr. President, I strongly believe in maintaining a robust defense \ncapability. This conference report--despite its shortcomings--\ncontributes to that goal.\n\n\n      defense authorization act: no provision for missile defense\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I am deeply troubled that the Defense \nAuthorization Act for fiscal year 1996 contains not a syllable of the \ndecisive language regarding ballistic missile defense so prominent in \nthe original bill. When he vetoed the original authorization, President \nClinton gutted provisions designed to ensure the protection of American \ncitizens against attack by ballistic missiles carrying nuclear, \nchemical, or biological warheads.\n  So, Mr. President, America is being held hostage to an outdated \nconcept of deterrence that is truly MAD. I have come to this floor to \nchallenge the wisdom of the ABM Treaty innumerable times, and I feel \nobliged to do it again. The frenzied, fanatical defense of the ABM \nTreaty by some is rooted in the mentality of the cold war.\n  The truth is, the threat to the United States has changed, and a lot \nof folks have missed the boat. The intent of the ABM Treaty, formulated \nin the midst of the cold war, was to circumvent the possibility of an \nexpensive and potentially dangerous action-reaction spiral whereby the \nUnited States and the Soviet Union sought to overcompensate for one \nanother's ballistic missile defenses by increasing their offensive \narsenals.\n  But, Mr. President, I find all of the evidence pointing to a contrary \nconclusion. The ABM Treaty did not stop the explosion in offensive \narsenals between the two sides. The Soviets increased the number of \ndeliverable nuclear warheads in their arsenal from 2,000 in 1972, to \n12,000 today. Furthermore, it was robust missile defense programs that \nproved conducive to arms control--not arms control itself. Above all \nelse, the Strategic Defense Initiative broke the logjam on offensive \nreductions. SDI forced the Soviets to the table on the Intermediate-\nrange Nuclear Force Treaty, and contributed to START and the treaty on \nconventional armed forces in Europe.\n  But--and I say this emphatically--the administration has forgotten, \nor chosen to ignore, these facts. Today we are being asked to consent \nto ratification of the START II Treaty when this country has suffered a \nmassive blow to its plans to defend its citizens against nuclear \nweapons. This is completely at odds with the intent of START II. I urge \nSenators to recall that the Joint Understanding of June 17, 1992--which \ncreated the framework for the START II Treaty--was concluded \nsimultaneously with a Joint Statement on a Global Protection System \nagainst ballistic missiles signed on the same day. This fact is \nexplicitly referenced in the Preamble to the START II. Yet United \nStates-Russian discussions on cooperation on defenses against ballistic \nmissiles have fallen by the wayside. And today, with both the Defense \nAuthorization Act and START II before us, I see neither hide nor hair \nof any protection against these abhorrent weapons.\n  At the heart of this matter is the perverse logic of the ABM Treaty, \nwhich argues that vulnerability to these weapons is essential to \nstability. There are a number of factors that bring into question the \nvalue of this line of reasoning in the post-cold-war world. Thanks in \nno small part to SDI, we have made major technological advances in the \nlast quarter of a century which make ballistic missile defenses both \nfeasible and affordable.\n  Also, there has been a considerable improvement in relations between \nthe two countries following the dissolution of the soviet Union. At its \nmost basic level, the logic of the ABM Treaty assumes hostility between \nRussia and the United States. Clearly, while there are movements afoot \nin Russia that are exceedingly troublesome, we are no longer grappling \nin a cold war embrace.\n  Most important, the mounting problem of WMD and ballistic missile \nproliferation, the uncertainties of the new security environment which \ncomplicate the role of deterrence, and continuing concerns over the \npotential for turbulence in the former Soviet Union all suggest that--\nin a world of multiple potential nuclear threats--the most likely \nnuclear danger to the United States is not a massive, preemptive \nRussian strike, but the deliberate or accidental launch of a few \nwarheads. Such a danger is unpredictable, undeterrable, and something \nto which the United States--currently without any national missile \ndefense whatsoever--is completely vulnerable.\n  Ironically, though the possibility of an outright nuclear exchange \nbetween Russia and the United States is at an all-time low, the risk of \nmishap has not decreased proportionately to reductions in the Russian \nnuclear arsenal. In fact, the post-START II Russian force will be far \nmore mobile than its predominantly silo-based predecessor. This poses a \npotential problem for command and control of the arsenal in the event \nof internal turmoil in Russia.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the reduction of the U.S. strategic \noffensive arsenal under START and START II can only be conducted in \nconnection with a review of U.S. deterrence doctrine and the value of \nstrategic missile defenses in ensuring U.S. national security. A \nclearly articulated defense strategy and credible national missile \ndefense system possess a deterrent value of their own, and need not \nthreaten the viability of the Russian nuclear deterrent.\n  For this reason I have directed the Committee on Foreign Relations, \nin consultation with the Committee on Armed Services and other \nappropriate committees, to undertake a comprehensive review of the \ncontinuing value of the ABM Treaty. In this regard, I reiterate my \nopposition, as I stated it this past September, to the creation of yet \nanother special Select Committee replete with bureaucratic trappings, \nstaff, and cost to the American taxpayer for the purpose of reviewing \nthis treaty. We already have standing committees with the \nresponsibility for making these determinations and recommendations, and \nwe are not going to add another layer of bureaucracy to this task.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, I support this Defense Authorization \nAct since I shudder to think what this administration might do without \nthe guidance that is contained in this bill. I do not, however, regard \nthe issue of national missile defense to have been resolved, and will \nactively work to see that Americans are protected against attack by \nballistic missiles.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have divided feelings about the \nConference Report on the fiscal year 1996 Department of Defense \nauthorization bill. I am very pleased that the conferees have retained \nmy amendment prohibiting members of the Armed Forces convicted of \nserious crimes from receiving their pay. Also, I am pleased that the \nconferees deleted language mandating the deployment of an antiballistic \nmissile system--a clear violation of the ABM treaty.\n  However, I am compelled to vote against the bill because, among other \n\n\n[[Page S456]]\nobjectionable provisions, it includes a House provision that requires \nthe separation of military personnel who test positive for HIV. This \nprovision is cruel and nonsensical. It has had no rational basis \nwhatsoever. The Department of Defense opposes this policy change.\n  The current policy--developed in the Reagan and Bush administration--\nworks well. Under current policy, military personnel who test positive \nare permitted to keep their jobs, so long as they are physically able. \nHIV-positive personnel are not eligible for most overseas deployments.\n  Currently, HIV-positive personnel are treated in the same manner as \nother soldiers with chronic ailments such as diabetes and heart \ndisease. Only about 20 percent of the roughly 6,000 worldwide \nnondeployable troops are HIV-positive. This provision would unfairly \nsingle out HIV-positive troops for separation.\n  This provision simply makes no sense. Why should the Pentagon fire \nmilitary personnel who perform their duties well and exhibit no signs \nof illness? This would waste millions of tax dollars in unnecessary \nseparation and retraining costs.\n  Backers of this provision argue that HIV-positive personnel degrade \nreadiness because they are not eligible for worldwide deployment. This \nargument is absurd on its face. Can anyone seriously contend that about \n1,000 personnel--less than 0.1 percent of the active force--could have \na meaningful impact on readiness?\n  Assistant Secretary of Defense Fred Pang clearly expressed the \nDepartment's position, writing, ``As long as these members can perform \ntheir required duties, we see no prudent reason to separate and replace \nthem because of their antibody status. However, as with any service \nmember, if their condition affects their performance of duty, then the \nDepartment initiates separation action; the proposed provision would \nnot improve military readiness or the personnel policies of the \nDepartment.''\n  Lt. Gen. Theodore Stroup, Jr., Army Deputy Chief of Staff for \nPersonnel has echoed these sentiments, writing, ``It is my personal \nopinion that HIV-infected soldiers who are physically fit for duty \nshould be allowed to continue on active duty.''\n  Mr. President, this provision is cruel and unnecessary, and its \ninclusion in this final conference report compels me to oppose it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I strongly object to the provision included \nin the DOD conference report that targets service members who are HIV-\npositive for mandatory discharge. The Department of Defense did not \nseek and does not support this change in policy. This is a provision \nbuilt on fear and ignorance and will undermine the strength of our \nmilitary.\n  Under current law, service members become nonworldwide deployable due \nto a number of medical reasons including HIV infection, diabetes, \nasthma, heart disease, cancer, and pregnancy. This policy, developed by \nthe Reagan administration, allows individuals to continue to provide \nvaluable military service to their country until such time as chronic \nillness or disability makes them unfit to perform their duties. \nSingling out the 1,050 service members who are HIV-positive for early \nseparation is discriminatory and highly inappropriate.\n  Beyond the pure and simple discriminatory nature of this provision, \nlet's look at it as a practical matter. The American people have put a \nlot of money and resources into the training and development of these \nservice members. Their discharge based solely on their status as HIV-\npositive throws away the valuable people and taxpayer dollars that have \nbeen invested in them.\n  No one wins with this provision. The service members are unfairly and \ninappropriately treated, the armed services lose valuable leadership \nand resources, and the American people lose a valuable investment.\n  No one can deny that the HIV infection can lead to the deadly AIDS \nvirus. In the same regard, no one can deny that cancer is a deadly \ndisease.\n  HIV-positive service members are still capable of making many \ncontributions to the armed services.\n  Anyone who believes that HIV-positive individuals are no longer \nvaluable, vibrant individuals I suggest that you think back to the 1992 \nOlympic games. Magic Johnson who is HIV-positive led our country to a \ngold medal in basketball.\n  We must utilize all of our resources if we are to remain the \nstrongest, most powerful Nation the world has ever known. We simply \ncannot afford to close the door of service members because of their \nstatus as HIV-positive. This provision will set a dangerous precedent. \nIt is built on fear and ignorance, not facts. I hope that we repeal \nthis misguided provision later this year.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Defense authorization conference report \nbefore us is somewhat different from the earlier conference report the \nPresident vetoed. For instance, it removes the provision that would \nhave created the most immediate security problem.\n  The conferees have removed the extreme provisions mandating \ndeployment of national missile defenses that are not warranted by the \nthreat, would cost tens of billions of dollars, and would violate the \nABM Treaty. We had extensive debate on this issue in this body. The \nSenate-passed Defense authorization bill contained very carefully \ncrafted, bipartisan compromise language setting out parameters for \nnational missile defense [NMD] that would not violate or commit us to \nviolate the ABM Treaty, and would not needlessly provoke Russia into a \nmore aggressive defense posture, nor provide a reason for Russia to \nabandon nuclear weapon reductions. The original conference report \nsubstituted language that was strongly opposed by our top military \nleadership and that President Clinton warned would result in a veto.\n  This new conference report drops the language on national missile \ndefense, although it retains a half-billion dollar increase in NMD \nabove what the Pentagon requested. It leaves in place current law \nregarding the objectives and policies of this country on NMD, which are \ncompliant with the ABM Treaty.\n  The conferees also dropped objectionable restrictions on the \nPresident's authority as Commander in Chief, and a requirement \nregarding how he must pay for so-called contingency operations. They \nalso dropped a provision undermining the independence of operational \ntest and evaluation of the Pentagon's new weapon systems.\n  But, Mr. President, I oppose this conference report for many of the \nsame reasons I voted against the previous version. It provides $7 \nbillion more than the Pentagon requested for defense budget authority. \nIt funds numerous weapons systems not requested by the Pentagon in \nfiscal year 1996, including $493 million for B-2 bombers, $361 million \nfor F-15 fighters, $159 million for F-16 fighters, $2.2 billion for \namphibious assault ships, $30 million for hydronuclear tests and $30 \nmillion for antisatellite weapons that we do not need. This bill also \nboosts other program funding significantly above the Pentagon's \nrequest, adding $915 million for ballistic and cruise missile defense \nabove the President's request and $317 million for helicopter programs \nbeyond what was sought.\n  This level of defense spending is unsustainable and these unrequested \nexpenditures are inconsistent with national priorities. Additional \nmilitary spending beyond what the Department of Defense requested in \nfiscal year 1996, especially for items the Pentagon does not want and \ndoes not need, is reckless and unwise. Defense Secretary Perry said \nthis week that such excess spending will cause a catastrophe for the \nDefense Department.\n  While many Federal programs face enormous cuts, defense spending has \nbeen left off the table. This bill creates a ``bow wave'' of future \nspending requirements for unneeded items, which will swamp our efforts \nto preserve readiness, high morale, targeted modernization, and \ntechnological superiority in the U.S. Armed Forces.\n  I also continue to object to this bill's earmarking of National Guard \nand Reserve equipment, specified procurement of ship building and \nmaintenance contracts at particular shipyards, and mandated \nconstruction of submarine prototypes.\n  In the personnel area, this bill still contains a very unfair \nprovision mandating discharge for service personnel who test positive \nfor the HIV virus. And it treats our servicewomen overseas worse than \nwe treat them at home, by placing a ban on privately \n\n[[Page S457]]\nfunded abortions in overseas military hospitals.\n  So, Mr. President, regrettably I will vote no on this conference \nreport.\n  Mr. DODD, Mr. President, I rise this afternoon in strong opposition \nto the 1996 DOD authorization conference report. I do so with \nconsiderable regret and concern for our national defense budget.\n  The bill before us is essentially identical to the bill first \nproposed in September. And while I respect the efforts of the \ndistinguished chairman and ranking member for bringing a more balanced \nbill to this body, my fundamental reservations regarding the overall \nspending levels contained in this legislation remains unchanged.\n  Let me once again state for the record, this bill contains spending \nincreases that were neither requested by the Pentagon, nor budgeted for \nby the President. In fact, almost $7 billion in excess spending is \nauthorized by this bill. In an era of wholesale budget reductions, \nfiscal freezes on educational grants, and elimination of entire health \nprograms, I cannot in good conscience vote for passage of this bill.\n  In addition to my fiscal reservations, I am absolutely appalled at \nthe codifying language to discharge military members diagnosed to be \nHIV positive. I understand that service members with HIV will be \nafforded some measure of medical care within the DOD system. However, I \nam extremely concerned about the plight of their families and children \nwho will ultimately lose a level of their medical coverage because of \nthis policy. They are the ultimate victims here.\n  Let me also say to my colleagues that I am fully aware that the \nPresident has indicated he will sign this bill when it arrives at the \nWhite House. While I respect his decision, I must also respectfully \ndisagree with that decision.\n  In closing, I am deeply troubled by what is occurring here today. We \nare charting a course for further defense spending that we may \nultimately be unable to sustain in later years. The out year costs for \nsome of the programs that have been added in this bill may very well \nconsume entire future year procurement accounts--effectively strangling \nvital programs that have been legitimately requested and budgeted for \ndevelopment. I raise this issue now, with the full intention of \ncontinuing this debate during review of the 1997 defense budget \nsubmission.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, the 1996 defense authorization conference \nreport before the Senate is by no means a perfect bill. As one who \nvoted against the original version of this bill when it was considered \nlast December, I am aware that numerous flaws remain in the legislation \nthat will trouble many of my colleagues a great deal. While it is true \nthat the majority has yielded to the three top objections raised by the \nPresident in his veto message--those legislative provisions dealing \nwith national missile defense, United Nations command and control, and \ncontingency operations funding--the record must reflect, and the \nAmerican public should understand, that this bill is rife with unsound \npolicy and extravagant spending priorities. I will not recount my \nearlier statements as to the particulars of my concerns except to note \nthat the conference report before the Senate is still chock full of 7 \nbillion dollars' worth of unrequested, unneeded, and unjustified \nspending, much of which is earmarked for pet projects in Member \ndistricts and States. Force-feeding the Pentagon $7 billion it does not \nwant at a time when many worthy domestic programs are slowly being bled \ndry by the majority is indeed difficult for this Senator to accept.\n  However, the conference report is by no means without merit. To the \ncontrary, it contains important and essential statutory authorizations \nand programmatic funding which, in my opinion, will enhance both the \nreadiness and capabilities of our Armed Forces. To deny the Pentagon \nthese positive aspects of the defense authorization bill due to the \nconference report's counterbalancing flaws--many of which have already \nbeen signed into law through the defense appropriations bill--would be \nunwise. In my opinion, passage of the conference report is warranted, \nbut not by much. On balance, I believe the Nation will be better off if \nthis bill is allowed to become law.\n\n  While I will support passage of the conference report, I will put my \ncolleagues on notice that when the Armed Services Committee begins \ndeliberations of the fiscal year 1997 authorization bill later this \nspring, improvements must be made in the markup and conference process \nto make it more bipartisan and less exclusionary. If substantial \nchanges in style and substance are not made, I fear we are destined to \nrelive the mistakes of this year, the effect of which has us still \ndebating a defense authorization bill in late January, 4 months after \nthe fiscal year began.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                      cable tv franchise agreement\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, as chairman of the Subcommittee on \nAcquisition and Technology, I would like to engage the chairman of the \ncommittee in a colloquy regarding the section in the legislation \nentitled ``Treatment of Department of Defense Cable Television \nFranchise Agreements.''\n  It has come to my attention that the Court of Federal Claims may have \nsome concerns about the task we assign it in this section, given that \nit is not equipped to provide advisory opinions unless specific facts \nand parties are involved. Therefore, I wish to make clear that it is \nthe committee's intent that the court allow the executive branch and \nany party with a franchise agreement in the section to part participate \nin the proceeding required by this section by identifying themselves \npromptly to the court within a period of time established by the court. \nThe court may conduct the proceeding required by this section according \nto the pertinent rules of practice of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims \nto the extent feasible, including providing the opportunity for written \nsubmissions and a hearing. In order to ensure timely completion, any \nsubmissions or hearing should conclude no later than 120 days after the \ndate of enactment of this act.\n  I would also like to clarify that the phrase in paragraph (2), \n``required by law'' should be read to include both law and equity.\n  Finally, I would encourage the court to consider the position taken \nby the Senate in section 822 of S. 1026 when addressing this matter.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I agree with the statement of the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. NUNN. As the ranking member of the committee, I also concur with \nthe Senator's statement.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I sincerely regret that I must again rise \nin opposition to this year's defense authorization legislation. This is \na new position for me this year. During my tenure in the Senate, \nspanning more than two decades, I have been a vocal supporter of the \nneed for a strong and adequately funded national defense. My commitment \nto a strong defense is the reason that I sought membership on the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n  As the former chairman of the Subcommittee on Manpower, I continue to \nbe a strong supporter of our military members and their families. And, \nas the former chairman and now ranking member of the Subcommittee on \nReadiness, I support keeping our forces ready--that is keeping them \ntrained and equipped to fight and win today wherever they are called \nupon to fight.\n  I also recognize the equally critical need to invest in our ability \nto protect our freedom and our security in the future by funding the \nkinds of research and modernization programs that have made U.S. \nmilitary forces the most combat capable and consequently the most \nfeared forces in the world throughout the better part of this century. \nI make these background comments, Mr. President, in order to place my \ncontinued opposition to this year's defense authorization legislation \nin the proper context.\n  This is the second time around for this conference report. There were \nmany important and supportable provisions in the original conference \nreport that remain in this bill, like the 2.4-percent military pay \nraise, the 5.2-percent increase in the basic allowance for quarters, \nthe new housing initiative, as well as important acquisition reform \nmeasures.\n  Furthermore, some critical improvements to the conference report are \nworth noting. I am pleased that the conferees eliminated the language \nrequiring the deployment of a national missile defense system by the \nyear 2003. And, I am pleased that the language restricting \nparticipation of U.S. \n\n[[Page S458]]\nforces under U.N. command and control was dropped.\n  Nevertheless, this bill remains too flawed to support. Mr. President, \nfor starters, this bill still adds $7 billion in unrequested funding. \nWith that added $7 billion, this conference report, in my view, spends \nmore and buys less.\n  As we are all painfully aware, we are in the midst of a budget \nstruggle that has twice closed the Government and has called into \nquestion the future existence of virtually every Federal domestic \nprogram. Yet, we are asked in this legislation to approve a $7 billion \nincrease for the Pentagon. Seven billion dollars the Pentagon didn't \nrequest and, with few exceptions, $7 billion in budget authority for \nprograms the Pentagon doesn't need in this year's budget, if at all.\n  I could have supported additional funding for the Pentagon, if I \nbelieved it was funding the Pentagon needed. But the $7 billion in this \nconference report, like its predecessor, still wastes that money. It \nadds $450 million for national missile defense--bringing the total \nfunding to $820 million. The conference report still adds $493 million \nfor the B-2 and, if that half a billion dollar nest egg is used to \nbring production beyond the 20 B-2's already approved, that $493 \nmillion is a mere down payment on billions more for the B-2.\n  The conference, report still buys F-15's, F-16's, F/A-18's, LHD's, \nLPD's, DDG's the Pentagon didn't ask for.\n  The conference report still spends $30 million for nuclear testing.\n  It still earmarks $770 million in unrequested National Guard and \nReserve equipment.\n  Furthermore, the conference report still discriminates against \nservice members and their dependents by prohibiting abortions in \noverseas military medical facilities. The conference report still \ndiscriminates against HIV-infected servicemembers by requiring their \ndischarge.\n  The conference report still disregards the costs savings achievable \nthrough competition by directing the procurement of ships at certain \nshipyards. The bill takes the same approach with respect to ship \nmaintenance and the purchase of naval equipment.\n  I believe these funding and policy decisions are sufficient reason to \nvote against this conference report. Unfortunately, there are more \nreasons to oppose this legislation.\n  The latest conference, which excluded most of the members of Armed \nServices Committee, including myself, revisited several funding \ndecisions which do not appear to have been aimed at making better \nlegislation or enhancing our national security but, instead appear to \nhave been aimed at gaining additional votes for the conference report \nby appealing to home State interests.\n  In a couple of instances, the conferees even funded programs that \nwere beyond the scope of the conference, a practice to which I strongly \nobject. Neither the House bill nor the Senate bill included funding for \nthe HAARP Program, the Thermionics Program or the Counterterror \nExplosives Research Program. Yet, almost $20 million is earmarked in \nthis conference report for these programs. Regardless of the merit or \nrequirement for these programs, I object to their inclusion in the \nconference report because they were beyond the scope of the conference.\n  This approach to drafting defense authorization is a dramatic \ndeparture from the practice of the Armed Services Committee. For at \nleast as long as I have served on Armed Services, the committee has \nmade its funding decisions based on our national security requirements, \nnot based on parochial interests.\n  Mr. President, I hope that this year's defense authorization process \nis only an aberration or false start rather than a glimpse of the Armed \nServices Committee's future. I hope that the committee's next attempt \nto draft legislation that will pass both Houses and be signed by the \nPresident will not represent merely a sufficient number of special \ninterest items to make the bill passable but will mark a return to the \ncommittee's tradition of making a nonpartisan and objective assessment, \nin which all committee members are welcome and expected to participate, \nof what is in the best interest of our national security.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n\nnomination of gen. eugene habiger to be commander in chief of the u.s. \n                           strategic command\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, Adm. Henry Chiles, the Commander in Chief of \nthe U.S. Strategic Command at Offutt Air Force Base, is scheduled to \nretire on March 1, 1996, after a lengthy career of exemplary service to \nhis country. Air Force Gen. Eugene Habiger has been nominated by \nPresident Clinton to replace Admiral Chiles and a change of command \nceremony is scheduled to take place at Offutt Air Force Base on \nFebruary 21. As I understand the majority leader's wishes, once the \nSenate adjourns, perhaps today, we will not be in session again until \nthe last week of February. If such a schedule becomes a reality, the \nSenate will not have a chance to act on the Habiger nomination before \nthe change of command ceremony on February 21 and will have mere days \nto approve Admiral Chile's retirement as well as the retirement of his \ndeputy, Gen. Arlen Jamison.\n  While I understand that the Senate Armed Services Committee was not \nable to consider General Habiger's nomination at this morning's \nnomination hearing because the necessary paperwork could not be \ncompleted in time, I would inquire of the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee and President pro tempore as to what accommodation he will \nmake for the committee and the full Senate to act promptly on this \nimportant nomination.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Let me assure the distinguished Senator from Nebraska \nthat I concur with his views as to the importance in bringing about a \nsmooth and timely change of command at the U.S. Strategic Command. To \nthis end, I will take every step possible, in consultation with Senator \nNunn, the ranking member on the committee, to expedite Armed Services \nCommittee action on the nomination and seek Senate confirmation prior \nto the change of command scheduled in February.\n  Mr. EXON. While I would prefer that the Senate remain in session so \nas to continue its work on the unfinished business of the Nation, \nincluding this and other important executive branch nominations, I do \nappreciate the chairman's willingness to expedite this particular \nmatter. He is a good friend and I thank him for his commitment to see \nthat the Senate act on the Habiger nomination in a timely fashion.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will vote against the conference \nreport on S. 1124, the second fiscal year 1996 National Defense \nAuthorization Act which the Senate has considered.\n  This bill is clearly better than the bill the President vetoed last \nmonth. A truly awful bill has been transformed into a merely bad bill \nby stripping it of a series of provisions that never made any sense. \nThe provision on deployment of national missile defense by 2003 has \nbeen eliminated. The provisions on command and control of U.S. military \nforces and contingency operations have been eliminated or turned into \nsense-of-the-Congress language. The provisions undermining the landmine \nmoratorium and eliminating the director of Operational Test and \nEvaluation have been removed. The sale of the Naval Petroleum Reserve \nat Elk Hills has been extended to 2 years while the safeguards \nprotecting the taxpayers' interest have been maintained. I appreciate \nthose changes and I commend Senator Nunn  in particular for being able \nto bring them about and Senator Thurmond for accepting them.\n  But this remains, in my view, a bad bill with only a handful of good \nprovisions. The bad still outweighs the good for me. The bill still \nspends $7 billion more on defense programs than the Pentagon requested \nat the same time we are cutting critical domestic programs in areas \nsuch as education, the environment, Indian health care, civilian \nresearch, and many, many more.\n  The bill authorizes a whole host of pork-barrel projects from \nmilitary construction to research to procurement that can not be \nsustained in future years. Indeed, new pork was added in the new \nconference.\n  The bill still contains a provision mandating the discharge of \nservice members who are HIV-positive even though they are capable of \ndoing their jobs. This is bad policy which will needlessly and unfairly \ndisrupt the \n\n[[Page S459]]\nlives of service members who have served their Nation proudly and who \ncould continue to serve their Nation for years before being stricken \nwith AIDS. A majority of the Senate Armed Services Committee opposes \nthis provision. I believe a majority of the Senate opposes it as well. \nI hope that it will be repealed later this year.\n  The bill still includes unprecedented Buy-America provisions meant to \nprotect the uncompetitive parts of our industrial base at the expense \nof the competitive industries who will certainly see their exports \nhindered by these provisions. Our protectionism will only beget \nEuropean protectionism to the detriment of our security and to the \ndetriment of taxpayers on both sides of the Atlantic.\n  The bill still includes a provision denying female service members \nand the female dependents of all service members the right to use their \nown money to obtain an abortion in a military hospital overseas.\n  The bill still includes a provision setting up a loan guarantee \nprogram for defense exports that is unneeded and unwise, a program \nunder which up to $15 billion in defense exports will be guaranteed \nsupposedly at no risk to the taxpayers, who should hold their wallets.\n  The bill still prevents the Pentagon from retiring unneeded strategic \nweapons, weapons that do not make sense to retain under any budget-\nconstrained scenario.\n  Unfortunately, I could go on and on concerning provisions in this \nbill which I can not support. There are some good provisions, the \nprovisions on military pay and family housing, for example, and the \nprovisions on acquisition reform, which I cosponsored when the Senate \ndebated this bill last summer. The acquisition reform provisions were \ndealt with on a bipartisan basis in the first defense authorization \nconference last fall. I thanked Senator Cohen and Senator Smith for \ntaking that approach to these important provisions when the Senate \ndebated the first defense authorization conference report in December. \nSenator Cohen, in particular, has much to be proud of in the \nacquisition reform provisions on information technology on which he was \nthe driving force. I hope people will refer to division E of this bill \nas the Cohen act, and perhaps one day we will make such a designation \nofficial.\n  I'd also like to commend Senator Glenn, Senator Levin, Senator Smith, \nand Senator Stevens for their hard work and great contributions to the \nacquisition reform provisions in the bill.\n  Unfortunately, the acquisition reform provisions, the pay provisions \nand the family housing provisions are the exception, not the rule in \nthis bill. There is more in this bill that I can not support than that \nI can. I will vote against it today and work to fix as many of the \nproblems in this authorization bill as I can in the fiscal year 1997 \ndefense authorization process which will soon be upon us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, today we again consider the fiscal year 1996 \nDefense authorization bill. We are voting on this bill again today \nbecause the President vetoed the first bill the Congress sent to him. \nPresident Clinton vetoed the first Defense authorization bill because \nof his insistence that America remain vulnerable to ballistic missiles \ncarrying weapons of mass destruction--and because of his insistence \nthat American soldiers be permitted to serve under the blue flag of the \nUnited Nations. I believe that the White House is wrong on both \naccounts. Defending America should be the No. 1 defense priority. The \nU.N. Secretary General is no substitute for the Commander in Chief. I \nknow that many of my colleagues, including the Republican members of \nthe Armed Services Committee agree with me.\n  Because the annual Defense authorization bill is critical for the \noperations of the Department of Defense and contains many provisions \ncrucial to the well-being of the men and women of our Armed Forces, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator \nThurmond, crafted a bill that would be signed by the President. The \ndistinguished chairman was assisted, in particular, by the \ndistinguished Senator from Mississippi, Senator Lott, in negotiating \nthe compromise on ballistic missile defense provisions.\n  With respect to those provisions that will support our men and women \nin uniform, the bill we sent to the President last month included a \nnumber of quality of life initiatives. The bill authorized a 2.4 \npercent pay raise and a 5.2 percent increase in allowance for quarters. \nIn addition, for the Reserve components, the bill authorized an income \ninsurance program for involuntarily mobilized reservists and \nestablished a dental insurance program. These provisions will enhance \nthe readiness of our Reserve Component Forces--who, like their active \ncounterparts, have deployed to Bosnia.\n  Additionally, the bill contains a new military housing privatization \ninitiative. This initiative will allow the Department of Defense to \nutilize new approaches to reduce the family housing backlog. To further \nenhance the quality of life of our troops, the agreement increases \nmilitary construction funding by $480 million. Apparently, meeting the \nbasic needs of the Americans who have dedicated their lives to \ndefending our Nation, was not sufficient reason for approving the \nDefense authorization bill.\n  In order to ensure the readiness of our forces, the conferees added \nover $1 billion to the operations and maintenance accounts. \nFurthermore, they increased research and development and procurement \nfunding. This is the only way to ensure the long-term readiness of our \nforces.\n  As for the ballistic missile defense provisions in the bill, the \ncomprehensive approach to defending America from ballistic missile \nattack adopted in the original conference report did not survive as a \nwhole. The provision establishing a deployment goal of 2003 for a \nnational missile defense system was dropped in the aftermath of the \nPresident's veto. Furthermore, the provisions regarding demarcation \nbetween strategic and theater missile defense were watered down also in \nface of White House objections--despite the fact that these provisions \nreflected the very proposal originally made by the Clinton \nadministration to the Russians.\n  In short, the Clinton administration has made a conscious decision to \nmake our theater missile defense [TMD] systems less capable and subject \nto a Russian veto.\n  On the other hand, this bill does retain the provisions establishing \na core program in the area of theater missile defense, which includes \nTHAAD and Navy Upper Tier--two of our most capable TMD systems. These \nsystems are also required to be deployed by specific dates--in an \nattempt to ensure against repeated administration attempts to delay \ntheir deployment. Critical to both theater missile defense and national \nmissile defense is the brilliant eyes program. Under this bill, an \ninitial operational capability [IOC] of 2003 for the brilliant eyes \nspace sensor is also established. This will facilitate earlier \ndeployment of national missile defense system.\n\n  It is indeed regrettable that the President was unwilling to join \nwith us in supporting all of our initiatives related to the defense of \nour country, our citizens, and our allies. Once again, President \nClinton has demonstrated his preference for cold-war-era arms control \ntreaties, and multilateral sensibilities. Once again, the President has \nrevealed where our Nation's future security fits on his list of \npriorities.\n  But, let the White House be warned: We have agreed to this bill in \norder to support forces--many of whom are deployed overseas--not to \nsupport ill-conceived and short-sighted administration policies. This \nbill reflects the Republican-led Congress' commitment to equipping and \ntraining our forces to guarantee their overwhelming superiority on the \nbattlefield. We have taken steps so our military--though smaller--will \nmaintain their ability to project power around the world--quickly and \ndecisively. We have not given up on our goal of defending America. We \nwill continue to press forward on a national missile defense system.\n  I understand that the Secretary of Defense has recommended the \nPresident sign this bill and that the President intends to do so. In \nclosing, I again want to commend Senator Thurmond for his hard work on \nthis bill.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \nConference Report to the Department of Defense authorization bill for \nfiscal \n\n[[Page S460]]\nyear 1996. First, I would like to associate myself with the thoughtful \nremarks of the distinguished Ranking Member of the Armed Services \nCommittee, Senator Nunn. I continue to believe that this world is not a \nsafe place. I, along with other leaders, had hoped that after the end \nof the cold war there might be more peace in the world. This has \nunfortunately not been the case. In fact, there is now more \nconflagration and more war. The price of freedom continues to be \neternal vigilance.\n  This legislation provides for the hardware and force structure that \nmake our Armed Forces strong. It looks forward to our future defense \nneeds by funding increased procurement of weapons systems vital to our \nwar fighting capability and maintains the troop levels necessary to \ncomplete our Nation's military missions.\n\n\n                            Weapons Systems\n\n  This bill authorizes funding for more Air Force F-15, and F-16 \nfighters--the backbones of our air attack strategy. It also funds the \nF-22 next generation fighter. This aircraft is the cutting edge of any \nfighter aircraft anywhere in the world. The Hellfire air-to-surface \nmissile, used so effectively in The gulf war, are procured for the \nArmy. The Navy received authorization to purchase additional F-18 \nfighters which are used to protect our aircraft carriers and for \nattack. These systems provide our soldiers in the field with \noverwhelming force, thus protecting their lives as they fight for \nAmerica.\n\n\n                            Force Structure\n\n  The troop strength of our active duty forces and guard and reserve \nforces is maintained in this bill. Our active duty Armed Forces will be \nover 1.4 million men and women strong and our guard and reserve forces \nwill total nearly 940,000 soldiers.\n  The bill enhances our national security by removing the language \nwhich would have lead to a U.S. violation of the ABM Treaty and \ncontinues the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program that \nhelps reduce the risk of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons \nproliferation.\n  It fully funds the research, development, test and evaluation account \nproviding millions in funding to develop a theater missile defense \nsystem which will be able to protect our troops deployed overseas from \nScud and other ballistic missile attacks. Funding in this account will \nalso allow research to develop new alloys and designs for stronger and \nlighter fighter plane wings and studies to enhance the electric battery \nlife in vehicles for use in new mechanized infantry equipment and in \ncommercial vehicles.\n  Finally, the conference report for the DOD authorization bill \nprovides many benefits to our men and women in uniform. A much needed \n2.4 percent pay raise for our service men and women is included in the \nbill, as well as increased funding for the family advocacy and the new \nparents support programs that help military families balance their duty \nto their country with their responsibility to their family.\n  Unfortunately, it is also in the area of military personnel that the \nprovisions in this bill with which I disagree most exist. I would like \nto take this opportunity to talk about just three of these provisions.\n\n\n           Required Discharge of HIV-Positive Service Members\n\n  Most of all, I am saddened and angered by one provision of this bill \nthat is the worst type of fear-mongering imaginable.\n  I never imagined that I would live in a time when Congress would \nblatantly discriminate against a group of people who contract a \ndisease, but that is exactly what this bill does.\n  This conference report contains a provision that blatantly \ndiscriminates against an entire group of military personnel simply \nbecause they are infected with the HIV virus. The Department of Defense \nwill be required to discharge any service member who tests positive for \nHIV. There are now more than 1,000 people serving in our military who \nwould be discharged within the first 6 months. The fact that these HIV-\npositive men and women can still perform their duties as ably as other \nnondeployable military personnel is ignored. There is no other disease \nfor which a member of the Armed Forces can be forced to separate from \nservice.\n  What message is Congress sending to the businesses of America? It is \nessentially saying that if someone contracts the HIV virus, they should \nbe immediately discharged regardless of their ability to work. Is this \nhow we intend to treat people who contract a disease? Is this what our \ncountry is based upon?\n  I pray that this mean-spirited provision does not move this country \nback to the dark ages of discrimination, hate, and fear. It is my \nsincere hope that this provision will be reversed by a future Congress \nthat better respects the plight of those with the HIV virus or that it \nwill be found unconstitutional by the courts.\n\n\n Restricted Access to Privately-Funded Abortions on U.S. Bases Overseas\n\n  The conferees adopted language that prohibits abortions on U.S. \nmilitary facilities overseas, even if a woman pays for the procedure \nherself, except in cases of rape, incest, or life of the mother. This \nprovision is discriminatory and has no place on a defense authorization \nbill.\n\n\nElimination of Authorizations for Troops to Cops and Troops to Teachers\n\n  On the issue of defense conversion, the Senate passed an amendment, \ncosponsored by Senator Pryor and myself, to authorize $10 million for \nthe Troops to Cops Program and $42 million for the Troops to Teachers \nProgram. These programs greatly assist the difficult transition of \nservice personnel to the private sector in two ways. First, Troops to \nCops and Troops to Teachers partially funds the training and hiring \ncosts of local school districts and law enforcement agencies, and \nsecond, these programs provide trained and dedicated recruits. I am \nvery disappointed that this provision was eliminated in conference \ncommittee.\n\n\n             Lack of Competition for Shipbuilding Contracts\n\n  The conference report provides for the construction of destroyers and \nsubmarines at designated shipyards without requiring competition for \nthis workload. Competition among qualified industrial facilities is a \nprocurement contracting fundamental. I am disappointed that this \nprovision remained in the bill.\n  Although I disagree with these provisions, on balance this bill \nenhances our national defense.\n\n\n      Provides for the Purchase of Additional B-2 Stealth Bombers\n\n  I was very pleased to support the authorization for $493 million in \nlong-lead funding for the B-2 stealth bmber. This most technically \nadvanced aircraft in our bomber fleet gives our Air Force the \ncapability of immediate response to a conflict anywhere in the world \nwithout the need for escort aircraft to protect it from anti-aircraft \nfire. Even with this protection, our non-stealthy bombers are unable to \npenetrate enemy airspace, as we saw in the gulf war. The B-2 also has \nthe ability to precisely target mobile units unlike any other bomber in \nthe fleet today. The B-2's stealth, long-range, and precision munition \ncapability make it a good investment for the money.\n\n\n Provides for Improvements to the Base Realignment and Closure Process\n\n  The conference report includes several improvements to the base \nrealignment and closure process. I am particularly proud of the \namendment cosponsored by Senator McCain and myself which improves the \nbase realignment and closure reuse process for local communities. One \nprovision of this amendment changes the Base Closure Community \nRedevelopment and Homeless Assistance Act of 1994, by requiring that \nthe Secretary of Defense consult with the Secretary of Housing and \nUrban Development over the reuse plan that is developed by the local \nredevelopment authority. Homeless assistance providers would still be \nguaranteed a seat at the reuse table, and redevelopment authorities \nwould still be required to accept expressions of interest for base \nproperty by homeless assistance groups and other interested parties. In \naddition, the Secretary of HUD would still review the final reuse plan \nto ascertain if the needs of the homeless have been met. However, \ninstead of the Secretary of HUD approving or disapproving the reuse \nplan, the Secretary of Defense would make the final decision. \nFurthermore, the local redevelopment plan developed by the local \ncommunity and local elected officials would be given substantial \ndeference by the Secretary of Defense. This puts the power of base \nreuse firmly where it should be, in the hands of the local \nredevelopment authority and the community. \n\n[[Page S461]]\n\n\n\n    Provides for Land Conveyances and Military Construction Projects\n\n  Finally, this conference report includes many important land \nconveyances and military construction projects for California and the \nNation. The land conveyance provisions will allow many local \ncommunities to redevelop and expand many underutilized industrial sites \nwhich will enhance economic growth. And the military construction \nprojects will provide many needed housing units and other military \nfacilities that will better enable our men and women in the Armed \nForces to perform their duties.\n  I voted for the conference report to the DOD authorization bill for \nfiscal year 1996, however, perhaps next year, we can concentrate on \ncontinuing to make our Armed Forces the best that they can be and \nrestore the rights denied our men and women in uniform.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

As in executive session, the Senate will now \nconsider the ratification of the START II treaty.\n  The clerk will state the resolution of ratification.\n\n       Resolved, (two-thirds of the Senators present concurring \n     therein), That (a) The Senate advise and consent to the \n     ratification of the Treaty Between the United States of \n     America and the Russian Federation on Further Reduction and \n     Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, signed at Moscow on \n     January 3, 1993, including the following protocols and \n     memorandum of understanding, all such documents being \n     integral parts of and collectively referred to as the ``START \n     II Treaty'' (contained in Treaty Document 103-1), subject to \n     the conditions of subsection (b) and the declarations of \n     subsection (c):\n       (1) The Protocol on Procedures Governing Elimination of \n     Heavy ICBMs and on Procedures Governing Conversion of Silo \n     Launchers of Heavy ICBMs Relating to the Treaty Between the \n     United States of America and the Russian Federation on \n     Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms \n     (also known as the ``Elimination and Conversion Protocol'').\n       (2) The Protocol on Exhibitions and Inspections of Heavy \n     Bombers Relating to the Treaty Between the United States and \n     the Russian Federation Reduction and Limitation of Strategic \n     Offensive Arms (also known as the ``Exhibitions and \n     Inspections Protocol'').\n       (3) The Memorandum of Understanding on Warhead Attribution \n     and Heavy Bomber Data Relating to the Treaty Between the \n     United States of America and the Russian Federation on \n     Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms \n     (also known as the ``Memorandum on Attribution'').\n       (b) Conditions.--The advice and consent of the Senate to \n     the ratification of the START II Treaty is subject to the \n     following conditions, which shall be binding upon the \n     President:\n       (1) Noncompliance.--If the President determines that a \n     party to the Treaty Between the United States of America and \n     the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Reduction and \n     Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, signed at Moscow on \n     July 3, 1991 (in this resolution referred to as the ``START \n     Treaty'') or the START II Treaty is acting in a manner that \n     is inconsistent with the object and purpose of the respective \n     Treaty or is in violation of either the START or START II \n     Treaty so as to threaten the national security interests of \n     the United States, then the President shall--\n       (A) consult with and promptly submit a report to the Senate \n     detailing the effect of such actions on the START Treaties;\n       (B) seek on an urgent basis a meeting at the highest \n     diplomatic level with the noncompliant party with the \n     objective of bringing the noncompliant party into compliance;\n       (C) in the event that a party other than the Russian \n     Federation is determined not to be in compliance--\n       (i) request consultations with the Russian Federation to \n     assess the viability of both START Treaties and to determine \n     if a change in obligations is required in either treaty to \n     accommodate the changed circumstances; and\n       (ii) submit for the Senate's advice and consent to \n     ratification any agreement changing the obligations of the \n     United States; and\n       (D) In the event that noncompliance persists, seek a Senate \n     resolution of support of continued adherence to one or both \n     of the START Treaties, notwithstanding the changed \n     circumstances affecting the object and purpose of one or both \n     of the START Treaties.\n       (2) Treaty obligations.--Ratification by the United States \n     of the START II Treaty--\n       (A) obligates the United States to meet the conditions \n     contained in this resolution of ratification and shall not be \n     interpreted as an obligation by the United States to accept \n     any modification, change in scope, or extension of the Treaty \n     Between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet \n     Socialist Republics on the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic \n     Missile Systems, signed at Moscow on May 26, 1972 (commonly \n     referred to as the ``ABM Treaty''), and\n       (B) changes none of the rights of either party with respect \n     to the provisions of the ABM Treaty, in particular, Articles \n     13, 14, and 15.\n       (3) Financing implementation.--The United States \n     understands that in order to be assured of the Russian \n     commitment to a reduction in arms levels, Russia must \n     maintain a substantial stake in financing the implementation \n     of the START II Treaty. The costs of implementing the START \n     II Treaty should be borne by both parties to the Treaty. The \n     exchange of instruments of ratification of the START II \n     Treaty shall not be contingent upon the United States \n     providing financial guarantees to pay for implementation of \n     commitments by Russia under the START II Treaty.\n       (4) Exchange of letters.--The exchange of letters--\n       (A) between Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger and \n     Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey Kozyrev, dated December \n     29, 1992, regarding SS-18 missiles and launchers now on the \n     territory of Kazakstan,\n       (B) between Secretary of State Eagleburger and Minister of \n     Foreign Affairs Kozyrev, dated December 29, 1992, and \n     December 31, 1992, regarding heavy bombers, and\n       (C) between Minister of Defense Pavel Grachev and Secretary \n     of Defense Richard Cheney, dated December 29, 1992, and \n     January 3, 1993, making assurances on Russian intent \n     regarding the conversion and retention of 90 silo launchers \n     of RS-20 heavy intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) \n     (all having been submitted to the Senate as associated with \n     the START II Treaty),\n\n     are of the same force and effect as the provisions of the \n     START II Treaty. The United States shall regard actions \n     inconsistent with obligations under those exchanges of \n     letters as equivalent under international law to actions \n     inconsistent with the START II Treaty.\n       (5) Space-launch vehicles.--Space-launch vehicles composed \n     of items that are limited by the START Treaty or the START II \n     Treaty shall be subject to the obligations undertaken in the \n     respective treaty.\n     \n[[Page S462]]\n\n       (6) NTM and Cuba.--The obligation of the United States \n     under the START Treaty not to interfere with the national \n     technical means (NTM) of verification of the other party to \n     the Treaty does not preclude the United States from pursuing \n     the question of the removal of the electronic intercept \n     facility operated by the Government of the Russian Federation \n     at Lourdes, Cuba.\n       (7) Implementation Arrangements.--(A) The START II Treaty \n     shall not be binding on the United States until such time as \n     the Duma of the Russian Federation has acted pursuant to its \n     constitutional responsibilities and the START II Treaty \n     enters into force in accordance with Article VI of the \n     Treaty.\n       (B) If the START II Treaty does not enter into force \n     pursuant to subparagraph (A), and if the President plans to \n     implement reductions of United States strategic nuclear \n     forces below those currently planned and consistent with the \n     START Treaty, then the President shall--\n       (i) consult with the Senate regarding the effect of such \n     reductions on the national security of the United States; and\n       (ii) take no action to reduce United States strategic \n     nuclear forces below that currently planned and consistent \n     with the START Treaty until he submits to the Senate his \n     determination that such reductions are in the national \n     security interest of the United States.\n       (8) Presidential Certification and Report on National \n     Technical Means.--Within 90 days after the United States \n     deposits instruments of ratification of the START II Treaty, \n     the President shall certify that United States National \n     Technical Means are sufficient to ensure effective monitoring \n     of Russian compliance with the provisions of the Treaty \n     governing the capabilities of strategic missile systems. This \n     certification shall be accompanied by a report to the Senate \n     of the United States indicating how United States National \n     Technical Means, including collection, processing and \n     analytic resources, will be marshalled to ensure effective \n     monitoring. Such report may be supplemented by a classified \n     annex, which shall be submitted to the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations, the Committee on Appropriations, the Committee on \n     Armed Services and the Select Committee on Intelligence of \n     the Senate.\n       (c) Declarations.--The advice and consent of the Senate to \n     ratification of the START II Treaty is subject to the \n     following declarations, which express the intent of the \n     Senate:\n       (1) Cooperative Threat Reductions.--Pursuant to the Joint \n     Statement on the Transparency and Irreversibility of the \n     Process of Reducing Nuclear Weapons, agreed to in Moscow, May \n     10, 1995, between the President of the United States and the \n     President of the Russian Federation, it is the sense of the \n     Senate that both parties to the START II Treaty should attach \n     high priority to--\n       (A) the exchange of detailed information on aggregate \n     stockpiles of nuclear warheads, on stocks of fissile \n     materials, and on their safety and security;\n       (B) the maintenance at distinct and secure storage \n     facilities, on a reciprocal basis, of fissile materials \n     removed from nuclear warheads and declared to be excess to \n     national security requirements for the purpose of confirming \n     the irreversibility of the process of nuclear weapons \n     reduction; and\n       (C) the adoption of other cooperative measures to enhance \n     confidence in the reciprocal declarations on fissile material \n     stockpiles.\n       (2) Asymmetry in Reductions.--(A) It is the sense of the \n     Senate that, in conducting the reductions mandated by the \n     START or START II Treaty, the President should, within the \n     parameters of the elimination schedules provided for in the \n     START Treaties, regulate reductions in the United States \n     strategic nuclear forces so that the number of accountable \n     warheads under the START and START II Treaties possessed by \n     the Russian Federation in no case exceeds the comparable \n     number of accountable warheads possessed by the United States \n     to an extent that a strategic imbalance endangering the \n     national security interests of the United States results.\n       (B) Recognizing that instability could result from an \n     imbalance in the levels of strategic offensive arms, the \n     Senate calls upon the President to submit a report in \n     unclassified form to the Committees on Foreign Relations and \n     Armed Services of the Senate not later than January 31 of \n     each year beginning with January 31, 1997, and continuing \n     through such time as the reductions called for in the START \n     II Treaty are completed by both parties, which report will \n     provide--\n       (i) details on the progress of each party's reductions in \n     strategic offensive arms during the previous year;\n       (ii) a certification that the Russian Federation is in \n     compliance with the terms of the START II Treaty or specifies \n     any act of noncompliance by the Russian Federation; and\n       (iii) an assessment of whether a strategic imbalance \n     endangering the national security interests of the United \n     States exists.\n       (3) Expanding Strategic Arsenals in Countries Other Than \n     Russia.--It is the sense of the Senate that, if during the \n     time the START II Treaty remains in force or in advance of \n     any further strategic offensive arms reductions the President \n     determines there has been an expansion of the strategic \n     arsenal of any country not party to the START II Treaty so as \n     to jeopardize the supreme interests of the United States, \n     then the president should consult on an urgent basis with the \n     Senate to determine whether adherence to the START II Treaty \n     remains in the national interest of the United States.\n       (4) Substantial Further Reductions.--Cognizant of the \n     obligation of the United States under Article VI of the \n     Treaty on the Non-Proliferation on Nuclear Weapons of July 1, \n     1968 ``to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective \n     measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at \n     any early date and to nuclear disarmament and on a treaty on \n     general and complete disarmament under strict and effective \n     international control'', and in anticipation of the \n     ratification and entry into force of the START II Treaty, the \n     Senate calls upon the President to seek further strategic \n     offensive arms reductions to the extent consistent with \n     United States national security interests and calls upon the \n     other nuclear weapon states to give careful and early \n     consideration to corresponding reductions of their own \n     nuclear arsenals.\n       (5) Missile Technology Control Regime.--The Senate urges \n     the President to insist that the Republic of Belarus, the \n     Republic of Kazakstan, Ukraine, and the Russian Federation \n     abide by the guidelines of the Missile Technology Control \n     Regime [MTCR]. For purposes of this paragraph, the term \n     ``Missile Technology Control Regime'' means the policy \n     statement between the United States, the United Kingdom, \n     the Federal Republic of Germany, France, Italy, Canada, \n     and Japan, announced April 16, 1987, to restrict sensitive \n     missile-relevant transfers based on the MTCR Annex, and \n     any amendments thereto.\n       (6) Further Arms Reduction Obligations.--The Senate \n     declares its intention to consider for approval international \n     agreements that would obligate the United States to reduce or \n     limit the Armed Forces or armaments of the United States in a \n     militarily significant manner only pursuant to the treaty \n     power as set forth in Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the \n     Constitution.\n       (7) Treaty Interpretation.--The Senate affirms the \n     applicability to all treaties of the constitutionally based \n     principles of treaty interpretation set forth in the \n     Condition (1) of the resolution of ratification with respect \n     to the INF Treaty. For purposes of this declaration, the term \n     ``INF Treaty'' refers to the Treaty Between the United States \n     of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the \n     Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Short Range \n     Missiles, together with the related memorandum of \n     understanding and protocols, approved by the Senate on May \n     27, 1988.\n       (8) Compliance.--(A) Concerned by the clear past pattern of \n     Soviet noncompliance with arms control agreements and \n     continued cases of noncompliance by the Russian Federation, \n     the Senate declares that--\n       (i) the START II Treaty is in the interests of the United \n     States only if both the United States and the Russian \n     Federation are in strict compliance with the terms of the \n     Treaty as presented to the Senate for its advice and consent \n     to ratification, such compliance being measured by \n     performance and not by efforts, intentions, or commitments to \n     comply; and\n       (ii) the Senate expects the Russian Federation to be in \n     strict compliance with its obligations under the terms of \n     START II Treaty as presented to the Senate for its advice and \n     consent to ratification;\n       (B) Given its concern about compliance issues, the Senate \n     expects the executive branch of government to offer regular \n     briefings, but not less than four times each year, to the \n     Senate Committees on Foreign Relations and Armed Services on \n     compliance issues related to the START II Treaty. Such \n     briefings shall include a description of all United States \n     efforts in United States/Russian diplomatic channels and \n     bilateral fora to resolve the compliance issues and shall \n     include, but would not necessarily be limited to, a \n     description of the following:\n       (i) Any compliance issues the United States plans to raise \n     with the Russian Federation at the Bilateral Implementation \n     Commission, in advance of such meetings.\n       (ii) Any compliance issues raised at the Bilateral \n     Implementation Commission, within thirty days of such \n     meetings.\n       (iii) Any Presidential determination that the Russian \n     Federation is in noncompliance with or is otherwise acting in \n     a manner inconsistent with the object and purpose of the \n     START II Treaty, within 30 days of such a determination, in \n     which case the President shall also submit a written report, \n     with an unclassified summary, explaining why it is in the \n     national security interests of the United States to continue \n     as a party to the START II Treaty.\n       (9) Submission of Future Agreements as Treaties.--The \n     Senate declares that, following Senate advice and consent to \n     ratification of the START II Treaty, any agreement or \n     understanding which in any material way modifies, amends, or \n     reinterprets United States or Russian obligations under the \n     START II Treaty, including the time frame for \n     implementation of the Treaty, should be submitted to the \n     Senate for its advice and consent to ratification.\n       (10) Nature of Deterrence.--(A) On June 17, 1992, \n     Presidents Bush and Yeltsin issued a Joint Understanding and \n     a Joint Statement at the conclusion of their Washington \n     Summit, the first of which became the foundation for the \n     START II Treaty. The second, the Joint Statement on a Global \n     Protection System, endorsed the cooperative development of a \n     defensive system against ballistic missile attack and \n     demonstrated the belief \n\n[[Page S463]]\n     by the governments of the United States and the Russian Federation that \n     strategic offensive reductions and certain defenses against \n     ballistic missiles are stabilizing compatible, and \n     reinforcing.\n       (B) It is, therefore, the sense of the Senate that:\n       (i) The long-term perpetuation of deterrence based on \n     mutual and severe offensive nuclear threats would be outdated \n     in a strategic environment in which the United States and the \n     Russian Federation are seeking to put aside their past \n     adversarial relationship and instead build a relationship \n     based upon trust rather than fear.\n       (ii) An offense-only form of deterrence cannot address by \n     itself the emerging strategic environment in which, as \n     Secretary of Defense Les Aspin said in January 1994, \n     proliferators acquiring missiles and weapons of mass \n     destruction ``may have acquired such weapons for the express \n     purpose of blackmail or terrorism and thus have a \n     fundamentally different calculus not amenable to deterrence. \n     . . . New deterrent approaches are needed as well as new \n     strategies should deterrence fail.''.\n       (iii) Defenses against ballistic missiles are essential for \n     new deterrent strategies and for new strategies should \n     deterrence fail. Because deterrence may be inadequate to \n     protect United States forces and allies abroad, theater \n     missile defense is necessary, particularly the most capable \n     systems of the United States such as THAAD, Navy Upper Tier, \n     and the Space and Missile Tracking System. Similarly, because \n     deterrence may be inadequate to protect the United States \n     against long-range missile threats, missile defenses are a \n     necessary part of new deterrent strategies. Such defenses \n     also are wholly in consonance with the summit statements from \n     June 1992 of the Presidents of the United States and the \n     Russian Federation and the September 1994 statements by \n     Secretary of Defense William J. Perry, who said, ``We now \n     have the opportunity to create a new relationship, based not \n     on MAD, not on Mutual Assured Destruction, but rather on \n     another acronym, MAS, or Mutual Assured Safety.''.\n       (iv) As the governments of the United States and Russia \n     have built upon the June 17, 1992, Joint Understanding in \n     agreeing to the START II Treaty, so too should these \n     governments promptly undertake discussions based on the Joint \n     Statement to move forward cooperatively in the development \n     and deployment of defenses against ballistic missiles.\n       (11) Report on Use of Foreign Excess Ballistic Missiles for \n     Launch Services.--It is the sense of the Senate that the \n     President should not issue licenses for the use of a foreign \n     excess ballistic missile for launch services without first \n     submitting a report to Congress, on a one-time basis, on the \n     implications of the licensing approval on nonproliferation \n     efforts under the Treaty and on the United States space \n     launch industry.\n       (12) United States Commitments Ensuring the Safety, \n     Reliability, and Performance of Its Nuclear Forces.--The \n     Senate declares that the United States is committed to \n     ensuring the safety, reliability, and performance of its \n     nuclear forces. To this end, the United States undertakes the \n     following additional commitments:\n       (A) The United States is committed to proceeding with a \n     robust stockpile stewardship program, and to maintaining \n     nuclear weapons production capabilities and capacities, that \n     will ensure the safety, reliability, and performance of the \n     United States nuclear arsenal at the START II levels and meet \n     requirements for hedging against possible international \n     developments or technical problems in conformance with United \n     States policies and to underpin deterrence.\n       (B) The United States is committed to reestablishing and \n     maintaining sufficient levels of production to support \n     requirements for the safety, reliability, and performance of \n     United States nuclear weapons and demonstrate and sustain \n     production capabilities and capacities.\n       (C) The United States is committed to maintaining United \n     States nuclear weapons laboratories and protecting the core \n     nuclear weapons competencies therein.\n       (D) As tritium is essential to the performance of modern \n     nuclear weapons, but decays radioactively at a relatively \n     rapid rate, and the United States now has no meaningful \n     tritium production capacity, the United States is committed \n     to ensuring rapid access to a new production source of \n     tritium within the next decade.\n       (E) As warhead design flaws or aging problems may occur \n     that a robust stockpile stewardship program cannot solve, the \n     United States reserves the right, consistent with United \n     States law, to resume underground nuclear testing if that is \n     necessary to maintain confidence in the nuclear weapons \n     stockpile. The United States is committed to maintaining the \n     Nevada Test Site at a level in which the United States will \n     be able to resume testing within one year following a \n     national decision to do so.\n       (F) The United States reserves the right to invoke the \n     supreme national interest of the United States to withdraw \n     from any future arms control agreement to limit underground \n     nuclear testing.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, when I brought the START II Treaty to the \nfloor last month, I did so in my capacity as the manage for the Foreign \nRelations Committee. In my opening statement, I sought to lay out for \nthe body the key provisions of the START II Treaty, the assessment of \nthe treaty of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the force structure \nimplications of the treaty for both the Russian Federation and the \nUnited States, and the reasons why this treaty is, on balance, in the \nnational security interests of the United States.\n  But, Mr. President, I have also approached consideration of the START \nII Treaty from the vantage point of my membership on the Select \nCommittee on Intelligence. I have spent a great deal of time analyzing \nUnited States capabilities to monitor compliance with arms control \ntreaties and the START II Treaty in particular.\n  I want to share with my colleagues my major findings and explain each \nof them briefly.\n  First, no aspects of the START II Treaty text are likely to cause \ncompliance issues because of the manner in which they are worded.\n  I repeat, I have found no aspects of the START II Treaty text that \nare likely to cause compliance issues because of the manner in which \nthey are worded. Indeed, START II, by banning test-flights and \ndeployment of MIRV'd ICBM's after 2003, may lessen the likelihood of \ncompliance issues regarding the number of re-entry vehicles with which \nan ICBM is equipped or tested. It should generally be easier to \ndetermine the presence or absence of MIRV's than the determine--or \nagree upon--whether a numerical limit has been exceeded.\n  Second, U.S. national technical means are generally sufficient to \nmonitor compliance with both START Treaties. United States capabilities \ncould be insufficient, however, if competition for scarce collection \nand analytic resources were intense and if Russian practices were to \nchange in ways designed to impede United States monitoring.\n  As in the case with START I monitoring, the United States will rely \nupon a combination of capabilities--including imagery, signals \nintelligence, human intelligence, open-source information and the \nverification provisions of the START I and START II Treaties--to \nmonitor compliance with the provisions of START II. Despite the \nstrapped resources as well as systems and personnel reductions thus far \nin the post-cold-war era, the intelligence community assesses a high \nprobability of detecting questionable activity that might be contrary \nto the treaty.\n  I agree with the intelligence community that U.S. national technical \nmeans are generally sufficient to monitor compliance with both START \nTreaties. I have concerns, however, that U.S. capabilities could be \ninsufficient if competition for scarce collection and analytic \nresources were to intensify and if Russian practices were to change in \nways designed to impeded U.S. monitoring. I support the recommendation \nthat the President be required to certify the sufficiency of U.S. \nmonitoring capabilities regarding those START II provisions relating to \nICBM and SLBM capabilities and to report to Congress on how such \nsufficiency will be assured. I would also urge the executive branch to \npursue a firm policy regarding Russian actions that may violate the \nterms of START I or START II, including the verification provisions of \nthose treaties.\n  Third, I have recommended that the resolution of ratification be \nconditioned on a requirement that the President certify and, within 90 \ndays of exchanging the instruments of ratification, submit to the \nCongress a plan for ensuring continued, adequate monitoring of Russian \nICBM and SLBM capabilities. This condition has been included in the \nmanager's package of amendments to the resolution of ratification, \naccepted by the Senate last month.\n\n  The intelligence community's monitoring confidences reflect a vastly \nchanged world from that of a decade ago. The end of the cold war has \nbrought a substantial refocusing of United States intelligence from the \nold Soviet Union to a much wider variety of threats to the national \nsecurity. Indicative of this change is the fact that in the fiscal year \n1996 budget process, the Department of Defense opposed funding the \nCOBRA DANE radar. In order to protect that important arms control \nmonitoring system, the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency [ACDA] \nstepped in and took responsibility for its funding. The Congress, \ninstead, restored full funding for the COBRA DANE platform in the \nfiscal \n\n[[Page S464]]\nyear 1996 Intelligence Authorization Act, an action that was sustained \nin the Defense appropriations bill.\n  Some other systems that monitor Russian missile tests face uncertain \nfunding futures or are increasingly diverted to other intelligence \npriorities, like Bosnia and North Korea, or even to nonintelligence \nfunctions. Although intelligence officials remain confident of overall \nU.S. monitoring capabilities, they have acknowledged that these actions \naffect those capabilities.\n  I find it totally unacceptable that coverage by National Technical \nMeans of Russian strategic missiles--still the systems with by far the \ngreatest capability to effect the nuclear destruction of United States \nterritory--should be available only at the expense of other important \nintelligence priorities. That is why I recommend that the resolution of \nadvice and consent to ratification of the START II Treaty be \nconditioned on a requirement that the President certify and, within 90 \ndays of exchanging instruments of ratification, submit to the Congress \na plan for ensuring, continued adequate monitoring of Russian ICBM and \nSLBM capabilities.\n  Fourth, it is imperative that the executive branch exercise its START \nII Treaty right to observe the entire process of pouring concrete into \neach Russian SS-18 silo that is to be converted.\n  The intelligence community judges that it can monitor with virtual \ncertainty the elimination or conversion of declared items and the \nnumber of deployed silo-based ICBM's, SLBM's and heavy bombers that \nremain in the Russian force. Treaty provisions designed to enhance \nverification play important roles in augmenting U.S. National Technical \nMeans in this regard. The 10 annual reentry vehicle inspections \npermitted under START I will help assure, over time, that those silos \nare not being used for MIRV'ed missiles, and the 4 extra reentry \nvehicle inspections at converted SS-18 silos that are provided for in \nSTART II will add assurance regarding heavy ICBM's.\n  One particularly important aspect of START II verification would be \nthe on-site inspection of SS-18 heavy ICBM silo conversions, to guard \nagainst a breakout scenario involving speedy reconversion of SS-18 \nsilos. U.S. inspectors can either physically witness the pouring of the \n5 meters of concrete in the bottom of the silo or measure silo depth \nbefore and after the concrete was poured. In order to guard against \nimproper implementation of the conversion procedures, it is imperative \nthat the executive branch exercise its START II Treaty right to observe \nthe entire process of pouring concrete into each SS-18 silo that is to \nbe converted, and to measure the diameter of the restrictive ring.\n  Fifth, I urge the firmest practicable policy regarding compliance \nwith START I provisions on the transmission and provision of missile \nflight test telemetry and interpretive data.\n  The intelligence community generally expects to be able to monitor \nthe ban on flight-testing of MIRV'd ICBM's after 2003, assuming it \nreceives the good telemetry data mandated by START I. The importance of \nthe START I provisions regarding the transmission and provision of \nmissile flight-test telemetry and interpretative data cannot be \noverestimated, and the executive branch must adopt the firmest \npracticable policy regarding Russian compliance with those provisions.\n  Sixth, monitoring missile production and storage and, consequently, \nthe number of nondeployed missiles is inherently difficult. As the \nDirector of Central Intelligence has stated, it is possible that some \nundeclared missiles have been stored at unidentified facilities. In \nother words, the possible existence of covert, nondeployed mobile \nmissiles must remain an important U.S. intelligence target.\n\n  Monitoring missile production and storage and, consequently, the \nnumber of nondeployed missiles is inherently difficult. At facilities \nwhere the United States conducts continuous perimeter and portal \nmonitoring, the intelligence community's uncertainties are low. \nUncertainties are higher, however, in estimates of missiles production \nat facilities not subject to continuous monitoring or on-site \ninspection.\n  A cheating scenario involving covert production and deployment of \nmobile ICBM's--and especially of MIRV'ed ICBM's--and their launchers \nwould be particularly worrisome. For that reason, the possible \nexistence of covert, nondeployed mobile missiles must remain an \nimportant U.S. intelligence target.\n  Uncertainties in the estimates of numbers of nondeployed missiles \nwill make it difficult for the intelligence community to determine \nwhether all SS-18 airframes have been declared and eliminated as \nrequired by START II. On the other hand, SS-18 missiles and canisters \nare not mobile, are the largest ballistic missile system in the Russian \nforce, and require substantial equipment for handling and transport. \nStoring and maintaining a covert force of any significant size would be \na major undertaking and would increase the risk of detection. As SS-18 \nsilos are destroyed or coverted, moreover, the military utility of any \nundeclared missiles should steadily diminish. The intelligence \ncommunity is quite confident of its ability to monitor the essentially \nirreversible conversion of SS-18 silos.\n  Seventh, it will be difficult to determine whether Russian heavy \nbombers are equipped with more than the number of nuclear weapons they \nare declared to carry. But the Joint Chiefs of Staff believes that \ncheating scenarios that involve heavy bombers and air-launched cruise \nmissiles generally pose little risk of militarily significant \nviolations.\n  Mr. President, because heavy bomber weapon loadings can easily be \nchanged, the intelligence community will find it difficult to determine \nwhether Russian heavy bombers are equipped with more than the number of \nnuclear weapons they are declared to carry. When this matter was \nconsidered in the START I context, the executive branch emphasized that \nheavy bombers are inherently stabilizing, and play a more important \nrole in the U.S. strategic force structure than in the Russian. General \nCurtin of the Joint Staff noted at the time that cheating scenarios \nthat involve heavy bombers and air-launched cruise missiles generally \npose little risk of militarily significant violations. He noted that \nheavy bombers and air-launch cruise missiles are slow flyers which \noffer little potential for a surprise attack.\n  Eighth, the disincentives for Russia to cheat are substantial. I urge \nthe intelligence community, however, to base its collection and \nanalysis priorities upon a cautious appreciation of the record of \nSoviet and Russian compliance with arms control agreements.\n\n  The disincentives for Russia to cheat on START II are substantial. \nMany cheating scenarios, such as the reconversion of converted SS-18 \nsilos, would risk U.S. detection. The most feasible cheating scenarios \nwould yield only small gains. Thus, covertly reMIRVing all the 105 \nsingle-RV SS-19's allowed under START II would increase the number of \nRussian reentry vehicles by only about 15 percent. And such scenarios \nas the covert production of large numbers of ICBM's and their launchers \nwould require a considerable investment of scarce resources.\n  Despite these disincentives, however, I repeat that the intelligence \ncommunity needs to base its collection and analysis priorities upon a \nmore cautious appreciation of the record of Soviet and Russian \ncompliance with arms control agreements.\n  Last, the counterintelligence challenges inherent in START II will be \nno greater than those of past treaties, and U.S. agencies are capable \nof handling these challenges.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  Mr. President, let me close by reaffirming the conclusion I set forth \nlast month when I introduced the START II Treaty on this floor.\n  The START II Treaty is the result of a bipartisan effort, negotiated \nby a Republican administration and submitted by a Democratic one. Three \nSecretaries of State and Defense have supported it. START II represents \na substantial step forward in attempting to codify strategic stability \nat greatly reduced levels of armaments. Final reductions must be \ncompleted by January 1, 2003--namely, to levels of 3,000 to 3,500 total \nwarheads, of which no more than 1,750 can be based on submarines. It \nhas been the view of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that, with the 3,500 \nwarheads allowed under this treaty, the United States would remain \ncapable of holding at risk a broad enough range of high value political \nand military targets to \n\n[[Page S465]]\ndeter any rational adversary from launching a nuclear attack against \nthe United States or against its allies.\n  START II removes the most destabilizing segment of nuclear \ninventories--namely MIRV warheads and heavy ICBM's. Elimination also \nincludes all deployed heavy ICBM silos and all test and training \nlaunchers. The Joint Chiefs of Staff believe that the verification \nprocedures are adequate to ensure that the United States will be able \nto detect any significant violations. Conversely, the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff also believe that the verification provisions are sufficiently \nrestrictive to protect the United States against unnecessary intrusion \nby Russian inspectors.\n  It is my belief that, on balance, the START II Treaty is in the \nnational security interests of the United States, and I would hope that \nthe Senate, having expressed its concerns and advice in the Resolution \nof Ratification, would consent to the treaty by an overwhelming margin.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, this is indeed a fine day for the U.S. \nSenate. The Senate has just given its advice and consent to \nratification of the Treaty Between the United States and the Russian \nFederation on Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive \nArms, known as the START II Treaty.\n  Mr. President, the START II Treaty was considered thoroughly in \nhearings that I chaired in May and June 1993, and that my colleague \nfrom Indiana chaired in January, February, and March 1995. Witnesses \nincluded Secretary of State Warren Christopher; former Secretary of \nState Lawrence Eagleburger; Secretary of Defense William Perry; Gen. \nJohn Shalikashvili, Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff; John Holum, \nDirector of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency; Ambassador Linton \nBrooks, chief negotiator of the treaty; Thomas Graham, Jr., Acting \nDirector of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency; Director of \nCentral Intelligence, Mr. James Woolsey and Douglas MacEachin, Deputy \nDirector for Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency. Nongovernmental \nwitnesses included Steven Hadley, an attorney with Shea and Gardner; \nSven Kraemer, president, Global 2000; Michael Krepon, president, Henry \nL. Stimson Center, and Jack Mendelsohn, deputy director of the Arms \nControl Association.\n  When it is considering treaties such as this, the committee makes a \nparticular point to receive the considered and independent judgment of \nthe Nation's military leaders for whom it is of critical importance \nthat there be no missteps in arms control. General John M. \nShalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was unequivocal \nof his endorsement of the treaty:\n\n       The START Treaty offers a significant contribution to our \n     national security. Under its provisions, we achieve the long-\n     standing goal of finally eliminating both heavy ICBMs and the \n     practice of MIRVing ICBMs, thereby significantly reducing the \n     incentive for a first strike. For decades, we and the \n     Russians have lived with this dangerous instability. With \n     this treaty, we can at long last put it behind us.\n       The Joint Chiefs and I have carefully assessed the adequacy \n     of our strategic forces under START II. With the balanced \n     triad of 3500 warheads that will remain once this Treaty is \n     implemented, the size and mix of our remaining nuclear forces \n     will support our deterrent and targeting requirements against \n     any known adversary and under the worst assumptions. Both \n     American and Russian strategic nuclear forces will be \n     suspended at levels of rough equivalence; a balance with \n     greatly reduced incentive for a first strike. By every \n     military measure, START II is a sound agreement that will \n     make our nation more secure. Under its terms, our forces will \n     remain militarily sufficient, crisis stability will be \n     greatly improved, and we can be confident in our ability to \n     effectively verify its implementation. This Treaty is clearly \n     in the best interests of the United States.\n       On the behalf of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, I recommend \n     that the Senate promptly give its advice and consent to the \n     ratification of the START II Treaty.\n\n  The resolution that the Senate has approved today reflects a careful, \nbipartisan effort within the Committee on Foreign Relations. It also \ndeals with concerns raised by non-committee Members in amendments \napproved on the Senate floor on December 22, 1995.\n  Senate consideration and consent to ratification has taken about 3 \nyears. This is longer than I and others would have wished, but I would \nremind others that the Senate has a long history of moving deliberately \non arms control treaties. The Geneva Protocol of 1925 which prohibits \nthe use of chemical and bacteriological weapons in war, took 5 decades \nfor the Senate to approve.\n  Our action this evening comes at a most propitious moment. The \nRussian Prime Minister, Victor Chernomyrdin, will arrive in Washington \nthis weekend for the first top-level United States meetings since the \nRussian elections in December. Approval of the START II Treaty should \nprove a fortuitous move if it serves to spur comparable action in the \nRussian Duma. There is to be a G-7 summit meeting in Moscow in April. I \nwould hope very much that the newly constituted Duma can act on the \ntreaty by that time, so as to permit exchange of instruments of \nratification and entry into force.\n  Mr. President, the START II Treaty is a major achievement by itself, \nbut it cannot be viewed alone. It must be seen as part of a critically \nimportant continuum that began with SALT I, continued through SALT II \nand led to START I and START II. There have been related agreements \nsuch as the INF Treaty, which required the elimination of the \nintermediate-range nuclear missiles of the United States and the Soviet \nUnion. There are complementary efforts such as the safe and secure \ndismantlement program in Russia and attempts to negotiate a missile \nmaterial production control regime.\n\n  It can truly be said now that arms control has become an integral \npart of our national security. We have learned well that the control \nand reduction of weapons and the maintenance of a sound defense \nstructure are key ingredients of our national security. Our own efforts \nin such ventures as START II serve to demonstrate to the world that we \nare committed to the reduction of nuclear arms and are pursuing a path \nthat could lead to their elimination.\n  In closing, I would point out that the resolution of ratification \nadopted by the Committee in an 18 to 0 vote recalls the obligation \nundertaken by the United States and the other nuclear-weapon states \n``to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating \nto cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear \ndisarmament and on a treaty on general complete disarmament under \nstrict and effective international control'', and states clearly that \n``the Senate calls upon the parties to the START II Treaty to seek \nfurther strategic offensive arms reductions consistent with their \nnational security interests and calls upon the other nuclear weapon \nstates to give careful and early consideration to corresponding \nreductions of their own nuclear arsenals.''\n  Mr. President, we should be well pleased with our action today, but \nwe must not be satisfied. We must be both steadfast and unrelenting in \nour efforts to spare our citizens and the world from the terrible \ncatastrophe of war, particularly war through means of weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the ratification of the \nSTART II Treaty by the Senate. The case for ratification is, I believe, \noverwhelming. Both the START I Treaty, negotiated under President \nReagan, and the START II Treaty, negotiated under President Bush, are \nthe end-products of bipartisan arms control support by both the \nCongress and the American people.\n  Ratification of the START II Treaty is supported by the President, as \nwell as by Secretary of Defense Perry and General Shalikashvili, the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Department of Defense is \nsatisfied that the START II Treaty will be fully verifiable, and that \nratification and entry into force are in our national interest. The \nSTART II Treaty is a continuation of the substantial reductions in \nstrategic weaponry brought about by the signing of the START I Treaty. \nThe signing of the START I Treaty occurred after the fall of the Berlin \nWall, at the end of the cold war, the dissolution of the Soviet Union, \nand the development of democratic movements and free elections in the \ncountries of the former Warsaw Pact. These events have transformed the \nlongstanding bipolar relationship between the United States and the \nnow-vanished Soviet Union.\n  Given these historic changes, ratification of the START II Treaty is \nthe \n\n[[Page S466]]\nnext logical step. Upon entry into full force, the START II Treaty will \nfurther reduce the number of strategic nuclear warheads held in the \nactive inventories of the United States and Russia from about 8,000 \nweapons at START I levels by more than 50 percent. By the time START II \nis fully implemented, the START I and START II Treaties will have led \nto more than a three-fold reduction in the numbers of strategic nuclear \nwarheads on line.\n  Moreover, the entry into force of this treaty will eliminate all of \nthe land-based, multiple-warhead, or MIRV'd, inter-continental \nballistic missiles from the arsenals of both sides. It has long been a \ngoal of U.S. arms control policy, under both Republican and Democratic \nPresidents and Congresses, to eliminate these poised-for-instant-launch \nMIRV'd ICBM's from the inventories of both sides. Elimination of these \nland-based ICBM missiles, a required measure under the START II Treaty, \nwill help both to avoid a return to hair-trigger strategic postures on \nboth sides, and to put an end to any conceivable incentive for a \n``bolt-from-the-blue'' attack.\n  Ratification of the START II Treaty is a highly cost-effective way to \nreduce the threat to U.S. national security interests posed by nuclear \nweapons. It will eliminate some 5,000 warheads from the Russian force \nposture. Our modest verification cost will be dwarfed by the U.S. \ndefense budget savings that will flow from the retirements of our \nexcess strategic nuclear weapons and their delivery systems.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the ratification of \nthe START II Treaty today, and to work to build support and \nunderstanding of the advantages of the START II Treaty among the \nmembers of the Russian Duma, prior to their consideration of the treaty \nlater this year. We need to take every opportunity to explain to the \nnew Duma the advantages that will accrue to Russia from the entry into \nforce of this treaty.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, 3 years ago President George Bush and \nPresident Boris Yeltsin met in Moscow to sign a second Strategic Arms \nReduction Treaty. At that time, the dissolution of the Soviet Union \nmade it possible to achieve additional reductions in our nuclear \narsenals beyond those provided in the START I Treaty, thereby advancing \nUnited States security and further reducing the threat of nuclear \nproliferation. On December 5, 1994, President Clinton and the leaders \nof Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan convened in Budapest to \nfinalize the entry into force of START I, clearing the way for the \nratification of START II.\n  It has thus been a full year since START II has been ready for Senate \nadvice and consent to ratification, and I am pleased that it is finally \nbeing considered by the full Senate. The Foreign Relations Committee \nhas held eight hearings on the treaty, in open and closed session, with \nadministration and private witnesses. On December 12, the treaty was \nreported favorably on a unanimous vote of 18 to 0.\n  Let me elaborate on the substance of this treaty and its benefits to \nU.S. security. Building upon START I, the START II Treaty advances our \ninterests by eliminating the most threatening and destabilizing types \nof weapons in the Russian arsenal. Under the treaty, Russia has agreed \nto destroy all of its heavy intercontinental ballistic missiles \n[ICBM's], including all its SS-18 missiles, which were the centerpiece \nof the former Soviet Union's strategic nuclear force. The treaty also \nends the practice of putting multiple warheads on (or ``MIRVing'') \nICBM's, a practice which had led to exponential increases in the number \nof deployed nuclear warheads and heightened the threat of a first \nnuclear strike. START II requires each side to reduce its deployed \nwarheads from the 6,000 allowed under START I to 3,500 by the year \n2003. This will mean a significant reduction in Russia's deployed \nnuclear warheads, which numbered over 10,000 when the Start Treaty went \ninto force.\n  In addition, START II limits the number of warheads deployed on \nSubmarine Launched Ballistic Missiles [SLBM's], and expands the \nstringent verification regime put into place by START I. New \nverification measures, including on-site inspections of SS-18 silo \nconversions and missile elimination procedures, along with the \ninspection for all heavy bombers, were added to START II to reduce the \nrisk of non-compliance.\n  Taken together, the two START treaties will reduce the deployed \nstrategic offensive arms of the United States and Russia by \napproximately two-thirds by the year 2003. Two out of every three \nweapons that were once aimed against the United States are going to be \ndismantled or destroyed over a period of less than 10 years. The United \nStates will retain a credible nuclear deterrent while increasing our \nability to verify Russian compliance with its treaty obligations.\n  During the Committee proceedings, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, General John Shalikashvili, gave the following testimony in \nsupport of ratification:\n\n       Let me say at the outset that, on the basis of detailed \n     study of our security needs and careful review of the Treaty, \n     it is my judgment, and the unanimous opinion of the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff, that the START II Treaty is in the best \n     interests of the United States. I recommend the Senate \n     provide its advice and consent to START II's ratification.\n\n  President George Bush stated in his January 15, 1993 Letter of \nTransmittal to the Senate--\n\n       The START II Treaty is clearly in the interest of the \n     United States and represents a watershed in our efforts to \n     stabilize the nuclear balance and further reduce strategic \n     offensive arms. I therefore urge the Senate to give prompt \n     and favorable consideration to the Treaty, including its \n     Protocols and Memorandum on Attribution, and to give its \n     advice and consent to ratification.\n\n  Then-Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger concluded in his letter \nof submittal to President Bush--\n\n       This Treaty is truly an historic achievement. By \n     significantly reducing strategic offensive arms, and by \n     eliminating those that pose the greatest threat to stability, \n     the START II Treaty will enhance the national security of the \n     United States. It is in the best interest of the United \n     States of America, the Russian Federation, and, indeed, the \n     entire world that this Treaty enter into force promptly. I \n     strongly recommend its transmission to the Senate for advice \n     and consent to ratification.\n\n  Mr. President, ratification of START II not only will lock in \nreductions that benefit U.S. security directly, it will send an \nimportant signal to other countries that the United States is serious \nabout nuclear non-proliferation. It will encourage other nations to \njoin us in the process of limiting weapons of mass destruction and will \nlay the foundation for future arms control agreements. As Spurgeon \nKeeny, Jr., President of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, \nwarned, ``Failure to complete Senate action promptly could delay for \nyears the entry into force of these agreements with great disadvantage \nto United States security.''\n  I think the risks of inaction are grave indeed, and I urge my \ncolleagues to join in giving prompt advice and consent to ratification.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me start off by saying that there is \nnothing wrong with arms control in principle, but there are a lot of \nreasons to oppose the START II treaty. The treaty does not destroy a \nsingle Russian warhead. It talks about downgrading, reducing, \ndownloading, retiring, converting--all actions that can be reversed. \nThe Russians do not have to destroy the warheads.\n  I wondered also what would happen to those warheads if Russia should \ndecide to comply with the START II treaty--this is a big ``if,'' since \nthey have not complied with other treaties--but if they did, what would \nhappen to those warheads if they were, for example, to download them?\n  We all know the financial needs of the former Soviet Union, Russia in \nparticular. And we also know that there is a market for those warheads \nin hostile areas of the world--in the Middle East, North Korea, China, \nall throughout the world. You have to ask: what would happen to those \nwarheads? We are looking at an agreement that allows Russia to continue \nmodernization, build heavy missiles for 7 more years, and new \nsubmarine-launched missiles, and new land missiles, including a hard-\nto-find mobile missile that even the United States does not have. It \nallows them to conduct aggressive military exercises and to increase \nanti-U.S. intelligence.\n  I feel that no effective verification or enforcement could be put in \nplace with this treaty, even if the Russians should comply with it. But \nlet us look at the \n\n[[Page S467]]\nhistory. People assume they are going to comply with the START II \ntreaty but they did not comply with the START I treaty, they did not \ncomply with the biological weapons convention, with the chemical \nweapons convention, the INF treaty, the ABM Treaty. Just around \nChristmastime Pavel Grachev, who is the Minister of Defense for Russia, \nmade a statement that they did not intend to comply with our \nConventional Forces Europe treaty, the CFE treaty.\n  Their reason for not complying, he said, was that the CFE Treaty was \nnot a treaty made between the United States and Russia, but between the \nUnited States and the USSR. I would ask why, if that is true, are we so \ncompelled to comply with the ABM Treaty, which also was not between the \nUnited States and Russia, but was ratified in 1972 when Russia was \nstill the Soviet Union? So I have to ask the question, why is it so \nimportant, at this particular time, to have the START II treaty?\n  Let us look at what has happened just recently. I know we all \nrejoiced just a few years ago when Boris Yeltsin and the reformers took \ncontrol. But look what happened just in the last election, last \nDecember, of the Duma. The Communists, now, have 157 seats; Boris \nYeltsin and the Reform Party, only 55 seats; the person I think most \npeople here dread more than anyone else, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, his \nparty, the Ultranationalists, took 51 seats. So he is almost even with \nYeltsin's party, and it is just one-third of what the Communists now \nhave. So, it is a totally different environment right now in Russia \nfrom 1993, when the START II treaty was signed by President Bush and \nPresident Yeltsin.\n  I think, when you realize that we are ratifying a flawed agreement \nwith a country that has never lived up to previous agreements, and that \nwe are accepting Russia's demands that we remain naked to missile \nattacks from all over the world, that this is wrong.\n  On December 28 President Clinton vetoed the defense authorization \nbill. His prime objection to this bill was that we were spending money \non a national missile defense system. In his message he declared that \nthis might violate the 1972 ABM Treaty, which prevents the deployment \nof a multiple-site missile defense system in the United States. Clinton \nstated that the missile defense plan ``* * * puts the United States \npolicy on a collision course with the ABM Treaty and puts at risk \ncontinued Russian implementation of the START I treaty and Russian \nratification of the START II treaty.''\n  Our President rejects a national missile defense system. He says that \nU.S. national security in the post-cold-war world rests on two \ntreaties, the ABM Treaty and the START treaty, both negotiated at the \nheight of the cold war. That is the linkage the President is making. We \ncan argue whether or not there is a linkage between the ABM Treaty and \nthe START II treaty, but in fact the President thinks there is. He has \nstated that there is, and he accepts the Russians' linkage between \nthese treaties, which says that we must abide by one, the ABM Treaty, \nto get the other, the START treaty.\n  You might ask yourself the question: why is it that Russia is so \ninterested in those two treaties? First of all, I have serious doubts \nthat they would comply with the START II treaty. Maybe they have doubts \nthat they would, too. But it seems to me they are bent on our agreeing \nto reduce our nuclear capability, which they would do to, and at the \nsame time they are even more interested in the ABM Treaty. I think this \nis something we really have not talked about enough.\n\n  The ABM Treaty was one that was put together in a Republican \nadministration. It was Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger's project. Dr. \nKissinger was the architect of the ABM Treaty of 1972. In 1972 we had \ntwo superpowers in this world. Mr. President, we could identify who the \nenemy was. At that time it seemed to be a good idea. I did not agree \nwith it at the time, but I certainly did not question the wisdom of \nPresident Nixon and of Dr. Kissinger, because it seemed that a policy \nof mutual assured destruction was in the best interests of the United \nStates. Simply put, that is a policy that says: we agree not to defend \nourselves and not to implement a national missile defense system if you \nagree to do the same thing. That way, the risk of complete destruction \nkeeps us from attacking each other.\n  You may believe that this was not a good idea at the time. I did not \nthink it was a good idea. But there is certainly some justification for \nit.\n  That is not the environment that we are in today. In fact, Henry \nKissinger himself has said that it is insane to continue with this type \nof policy in today's environment when you have the proliferation of \nnuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction all throughout the \nworld. It was Kissinger who said, and this is a direct quote: ``It is \nnuts to make a virtue out of our vulnerability.''\n  People have made several references to the fact that President Reagan \nactually started some of the START negotiations. But I would recall the \n1986 Reagan-Gorbachev summit in Iceland. It was really the defining \nmoment in the cold war. Gorbachev proposed to eliminate all nuclear \nweapons and everyone was all excited. But then he established the \ncondition that President Reagan would have to kill the Strategic \nDefense Initiative, a plan for a national missile defense system. In \nother words, he said we will agree to doing away with and destroying \nall nuclear weapons if you agree to make yourself vulnerable to an \nattack.\n  Reagan walked away from the bad agreement in order to save the United \nStates missile defense program. We are faced with the same choice. Our \nPresident currently is embracing that very notion that Reagan rejected, \neven though, since 1986, the missile threat has greatly increased and \nRussia has violated treaty after treaty. We have to ask, what is so \ngood about the tradeoff now?\n  Mr. President, I will make this brief because I have made this \nstatement on the floor so many times before. I have deep concern about \nwhat is happening right now with our attitude toward a national missile \ndefense system. It is kind of interesting--all these people who come in \nand want to talk about how bad a national missile defense system is \nalways use such words as ``Star Wars,'' trying to make it look like \nsomething that is mythical, something that is science fiction. In fact, \nanyone who was watching TV during the Persian Gulf war knows that the \ntechnology of knocking missiles down with missiles is something that is \nalive and well.\n  President Clinton appointed Jim Woolsey to be CIA Director, and he \nwas certainly privileged to more information, or as much as anyone else \nin the world, concerning this Nation's defense. And he said that there \nare between 20 and 25 nations around the world who currently have, or \nare developing, weapons of mass destruction, either nuclear, chemical, \nor biological, and are developing the missile means to deliver those \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  So there is a greater threat. Most people who are watching the \nsecurity scene today believe there is a greater threat facing America \ntoday than there was during the cold war, because now we are not \ntalking about one enemy, we are talking about 25 or so countries that \nare developing this technology.\n  If anyone is comfortable in what is happening right now, I suggest \nthat you read last Wednesday's New York Times. I will not submit this \nfor the Record because I did so yesterday when I first read it. I was \nstill in some degree of shock. The New York Times provides fresh \nevidence of the folly of leaving America vulnerable to ballistic \nmissile attack.\n  In an article entitled--listen to this--``As China threatens Taiwan, \nit makes sure United States listens--'' the Times reports on ominous \ninformation recently passed to National Security Adviser Anthony Lake \nconcerning measures being taken by Beijing to facilitate military \naction against Taiwan, and points to statements intended to detour the \nUnited States from coming to Taipei's assistance. Referring to Charles \nFreeman--he is a former U.S. Ambassador to China, now Assistant \nSecretary of Defense--the article reports that ``A Chinese official \ntold him of the advanced state of military planning and that \npreparations for a missile attack on Taiwan and the target selection to \ncarry it out have been completed and await final decision by the \npolitburo in Beijing.'' Freeman reportedly told Lake that ``A Chinese \nofficial asserted that China could act \n\n[[Page S468]]\nmilitarily against Taiwan without fear of intervention by the United \nStates because American leaders `care more about' ''--listen to this--\n``Los Angeles than they do Taiwan.'' That statement Mr. Freeman \ncharacterized as an indirect threat by China to use nuclear weapons \nagainst the United States.\n  Mr. President, this is the environment we are in today. Today the \nSenate is considering a treaty, START II, that will further endanger \nour country because the President and the Russians link it to the ABM \nTreaty, which precludes our country from defending itself against \nmissile attack.\n  I would like to submit something for the Record. It was in the Wall \nStreet Journal, in an editorial called, ``The ABM Treaty's Threat,'' on \nJanuary 2.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Wall Street Journal, January 2, 1996]\n\n                        The ABM Treaty's Threat\n\n       With his veto of the 1996 defense bill last week, President \n     Clinton just made the world a more dangerous place. If \n     there's a silver lining, it is that it sets down an important \n     political marker for this year's presidential campaign. GOP \n     upstart Steve Forbes also put down a marker last week, \n     castigating Bob Dole and the Senate for their apparent \n     willingness to ratify the Start II treaty--a ``further \n     pretext,'' Mr. Forbes said, for the ``policy of leaving the \n     American people vulnerable to missile attack.\n       Given the current Senate, the President's veto is almost \n     certain to be sustained, hamstringing the effort to build \n     critically needed defenses against ballistic missile attack. \n     Millions of Americans may pay for his decision with their \n     lives, when some future commander-in-chief lacks the means to \n     shoot down a ballistic missile heading on a lethal trajectory \n     for an American city. By vetoing the bill, Mr. Clinton also \n     shows that he has no viable strategy for dealing with the \n     changed nuclear realities of the post-Cold War world--\n     realities that are discussed nearby by former Reagan Defense \n     official Fred C. Ikle.\n       The Administration, to the extent it's thinking at all \n     instead of repeating Democratic Party rote, remains mired in \n     an obsolete mindset that sees Moscow as our main foe and \n     regards arms control and ``mutual assured destruction'' as \n     the centerpiece of policy. Mr. Clinton's principal objection \n     to the GOP defense bill is that by requiring deployment of a \n     missile-defense system by 2003 it would violate the 1972 \n     Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty under which the U.S. and the \n     Soviet Union agreed not to defend themselves against missile \n     attack.\n       The Republican bill is ``on a collision course with the ABM \n     treaty,'' Mr. Clinton said in his veto message. That, as we \n     see it, is precisely the point. The ABM Treaty is a grave \n     danger to national security and the United States ought to \n     exercise its prerogative to withdraw. If any progress toward \n     defense is to be made, every Republican Presidential \n     candidate ought to pledge to give the required notice on his \n     first day in office.\n       We thought back in 1972 that agreeing not to defend against \n     missile attack was a reckless promise, but today any vestige \n     of a rationale has vanished. More than two-dozen nations \n     already possess ballistic missiles and a number will soon \n     have missiles capable of reaching across the Atlantic or the \n     Pacific. It's not hard to imagine that Washington or San \n     Francisco would make tempting targets for a lunatic leader in \n     one of the Iraqs or North Koreas of the world. When that \n     happens, it will be too late to start building a missile \n     defense.\n       The ABM Treaty is just one relic of the Cold War that Mr. \n     Clinton is intent on preserving. He further objects that it \n     would derail his arms-control efforts, keeping the Russian \n     Duma from ratifying Start II, under which Russia would reduce \n     its nuclear arsenal to 3,500 warheads from about 8,000. \n     Whatever the Duma does, it looks likely that the U.S. Senate \n     will ratify Salt II three years after it was signed by \n     Presidents Bush and Yeltsin. Perfunctory debate ended last \n     week and a vote is expected soon. Mr. Forbes, free of the \n     impact of past habit, is one of the few Republican voices \n     urging against ratification.\n       Yet with few exceptions, Republicans do believe that \n     defending America against missile attack ought to be a \n     national priority. Their Congress has put forward a workable \n     and affordable plan toward that goal. On the other hand, we \n     have a President who's decided that it is more important to \n     the security of the United States to reduce the number of \n     Russian nuclear warheads than to have the capability to \n     defend ourselves against missile attack from the madmen of \n     the world.\n       As for Start II, somehow we don't find it very comforting \n     to contemplate a world in which the Russians have 4,500 fewer \n     scary things tucked away in their arsenal but a Saddam \n     Hussein has one that he intends to use on us. Clearly it's \n     time for a new security strategy. It will require more, but \n     missile defense will be a cornerstone. Mr. Ikle argues that \n     to wake the world to this obvious need may well take a \n     nuclear explosion, either accidental or deliberate.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I will quote one sentence, which says:\n\n       As for START II, somehow we don't find it very comforting \n     to contemplate a world in which the Russians have 4,500 fewer \n     scary things tucked away in their arsenal but a Saddam \n     Hussein has one that he intends to use on us.\n\n  So, in conclusion, I say, Mr. President, that passing of this treaty \nright now may be important to the President's agenda. But if this \ntreaty is really important, why are we rushing through it with so \nlittle debate?\n  This morning we had a meeting in my office at 9 o'clock. It was with \nthe 11 freshmen that were elected to this body in 1994. At that time we \ndid not even know this was going to be on the agenda today. This was \nput on 10 hours ago before we had a chance to come out, debate it, get \npeople together to really be concerned and to understand the full \nramifications of this treaty and how it provides a chance of making us \nvulnerable--10 hours. That is all the time we had.\n  What kind of a message will the rogue countries in the world get if \nwe pass, on the same day, a defense bill recently stripped of missile \ndefense and a START II Treaty on Russia's terms? Just to satisfy \nRussia, President Clinton was willing to veto the defense bill that \nattempted to protect Americans from missile attack.\n  Yes, we are getting the Russians down to 3,500 missiles, if they \ncomply. But we are giving Russia a practical veto on our ability to \ndefend ourselves. We have countries out there--China we just talked \nabout, North Korea, Iran, Iraq, Libya--any number of countries that are \na direct threat to this country, and they are not constrained by any of \nthe provisions in the START II agreement or in the ABM Treaty.\n  My simple proposition is this: Missile defense should be our highest \nnational security priority. If the President believes that our highest \npriority must be sacrificed to gain Russia's approval of START II, I \nsay it is too high a price to pay.\n  Mr. President, every time I come out here and we talk about this \ntreaty or we talk about the ABM Treaty or we talk about the missile \ndefense of this country, I remember the days following the April 19 \nbombing in Oklahoma City in my beautiful State of Oklahoma. I had very \nclose friends with daughters and sons and mothers and fathers who were \nin that building, the Murrah Federal Office Building in Oklahoma City, \nhoping day after day and hour after hour that they would find them \nstill to be alive until finally all hope was given up. We lost 169 \nlives in the most brutal terrorist attack in the history of America. I \nsaw those things. My son, an orthopedic surgeon, was practicing with a \ndoctor who went in and amputated the leg of a woman in order to extract \nher from the bomb site.\n  When I think about that, I remember that the bomb which blew up the \nFederal building was rated at 1 ton of TNT, and the smallest nuclear \nwarhead known today is rated at 1 kiloton of TNT, or 1,000 times the \nsize of the bomb that exploded in Oklahoma City.\n  That is why I stated on this floor last week that if the vote is 98 \nto 1, I will be the one to oppose the ratification of the START II \nagreement because, Mr. President, it is the right thing to do for \nAmerica.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote to ratify \nthe START II agreement. By ratifying this treaty, the Senate will be \ntaking a major step toward eliminating the menace of nuclear arms from \nthe face of the Earth.\n  Since the dawn of the nuclear age at the end of World War II, nuclear \narms control has been our highest priority. One of President Kennedy's \nproudest achievements was the Limited Test Ban Treaty of 1963. which \nbanned nuclear tests in the atmosphere, in outer space, and under \nwater. Many of us today continue to attempt to build on that \nachievement by enacting a comprehensive test ban treaty to ban all \nnuclear tests.\n  In recent decades, we have made progress toward reducing covert \nnuclear arsenals. Negotiations on the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty \nbegan in 1982, at one of the most difficult points in our cold war \nrelationship with the Soviet Union. Although the first years of the \nSTART process \n\n[[Page S469]]\nsaw only sporadic progress, our goal of achieving significant, \nverifiable reductions in the superpowers' strategic nuclear arsenals \nnever wavered.\n  When the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, our long-standing efforts \nwere rewarded with the signing of the START I Treaty by President Bush \nin 1991 and its ratification by Congress the following year.\n  Now, nearly 3 years after the signing of START II by President Bush \nin Moscow, we are achieving another milestone in the process by \nratifying this far-reaching agreement.\n  This second Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty lives up to its name--it \nbring about dramatic reductions in the strategic nuclear arsenals of \nthe United States and Russia. The United States and the Soviet Union \nhad arsenals with over 10,000 nuclear warheads when the Berlin Wall \ncame down. START I is bringing the level down to between 6,000 and \n7,000. START II will cut the arsenals in half again--to between 3,000 \nand 3,500 nuclear warheads by the year 2003. It has been more than 40 \nyears since Russia's nuclear threat to the United States has been this \nsmall. We are moving in the direction of eliminating the nuclear menace \nthat threatens our national survival.\n\n  In addition to reducing the size of the United States and Russian \narsenals, the treaty before us will restructure the strategic forces of \nboth nations to create a more stable nuclear relationship.\n  First, the treaty eliminates multiple independently targetable re-\nentry vehicles [MIRV's] from the land-based missile forces of both \nnations. This step achieves a goal that many of us have sought for over \ntwo decades--to eliminate the incentive for either side to strike at \nthe other's multiple-warhead land-based missiles in a time of crisis.\n  Another major accomplishment of the treaty is to eliminate heavy \nICBM's from the arsenals of both countries. The SS-18 missile in the \nRussian arsenal, which caused such concern for the United States for so \nlong, will be scrapped.\n  Another strength of this treaty is in the area of verification. START \nII builds on the ground-breaking verification regime established by the \nSTART I Treaty. This regime includes extensive onsite inspections, \nnotifications, and the use of national technical means of verification, \nour network of intelligence satellites and sensors. In ways like these, \nthe ratification regime gives us a high degree of confidence that we \ncan accurately assess Russian compliance with this treaty.\n  In addition to the verification procedures included in the treaty, \nthe greater openness in current-day Russian society, compared to the \nclosed nature of the Soviet Union, gives much wider information about \nRussian strategic behavior and intentions.\n  START II is also a major part of the effort to prevent the \nproliferation of nuclear weapons to other nations. During review of the \nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty last spring, many of the nations which \nvoted with us for a permanent extension of that treaty conditioned \ntheir vote on progress in United States-Russian arms reduction, \nspecifically the approval of START II.\n  If the United States is to lead a worldwide effort to eliminate the \nthreat of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, we need to take \nsteps to reduce the United States and Russian nuclear arsenals. This \ntreaty represents the single largest step in that direction in history. \nIt earns us the credibility and respect necessary to enable President \nClinton to conclude negotiations in 1996 of the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty, outlawing nuclear explosions around the globe. This \nachievement, which is within our grasp, will be the most important step \ntoward limiting worldwide nuclear proliferation since the NPT was \nnegotiated nearly three decades ago.\n  The end of the cold war has recast the international security \nlandscape. Before the Berlin Wall fell, there was little hope of \ncutting nuclear arsenals this deeply. Now, we have a unique opportunity \nto reduce the nuclear threat to all nations.\n  The NPT, the Comprehensive Test Ban, and the two START treaties are \npillars of an evolving strategy that relies increasingly on cooperation \nand consensus to achieve security from nuclear threats, even as we \ncontinue to maintain the forces necessary for a stable deterrent.\n  One of our greatest challenges is to continue this progress, to \npursue arms control as vigorously as we can, to bring other nations \ninto cooperative security regimes, to do all we can to prevent nuclear \nweapons from reaching the hands of terrorists, and to develop more \neffective means for peaceful resolution of international conflicts. \nThese efforts, if tenaciously pursued, will allow us to reduce, and \nperhaps one day, to eliminate, weapons of mass destruction from the \nface of the Earth. I urge my colleagues to ratify this treaty.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the START II Treaty \nand the conditions and declarations outlined in the resolution of \nratification.\n  Last month's Russian parliamentary elections, in which opponents of \nfree market reform and conciliation with the West made shocking gains, \nand the resignations from President Yeltsin's administration of several \nimportant reformers have created an atmosphere of great uncertainty in \nUnited States-Russian relations, I daresay there is no one in this body \nthat has failed to see the significance in these events. I am sure that \nthey will figure prominently in the foreign policy debates of the \ncoming year.\n  These developments, however, as disturbing as they are, should not \npreclude us from moving forward with arms control agreements. We have \nreached arms control agreements with Russia in days much darker than \nthese. We cannot base an issue of such monumental importance to our \nsecurity as the quantity and quality of weapons possessed by the \nworld's second largest nuclear power on the intricacies and \nimponderables of Russian politics.\n  What is going on inside Russia today, and what we can do to turn it \nto our advantage will be debated for years. We should lock in the \nreductions in START II made possible by the collapse of the Soviet \nUnion while we have the opportunity.\n  I am not going to go into too much detail. My colleagues are all \nfamiliar with the treaty. I do, however, want to point out a number of \nits more salient and compelling provisions. If fully implemented, START \nII will limit the United States and Russia to 3,500 deployed warheads \neach--a reduction by half of our START I limits and an overall \nreduction of two-thirds; it will ban all land-based, multiple warhead \nmissiles; and it will eliminate all of Russia's heaviest missiles.\n  In addition, I believe the Foreign Relations Committee and the \nmanagers of the resolution have added crucial conditions which improve \nupon the treaty. I find two of these conditions most striking: One \nconcerning noncompliance and the other the ABM Treaty.\n  The record of Russian compliance with other treaties, the \nConventional Forces in Europe Treaty and the Biological Weapons \nConvention, are not entirely reassuring. Compounding the problem of \nnoncompliance, the administration's efforts to bring the Russians into \ncompliance have been no more reassuring. In the case of the CFE Treaty, \nthe administration made substantive changes in Russia's obligations, \nwithout Senate consent, in an effort to gain Russian compliance. \nDespite this effort, months later, the administration was forced to \ndeclare Moscow in violation of the very targets designed to accommodate \nit. An article in this week's Washington Post by Thomas Lippman \nillustrates a similar problem related to Russian START I compliance. I \nask that it be printed in the Record.\n\n  The Foreign Relations Committee has wisely seen fit to deal with this \nproblem. According to a condition passed by the Foreign Relations \nCommittee before sending the resolution of ratification to the floor, \nthe President must report to the Senate on noncompliance and submit \nchanges in the obligations of the parties to the Senate. The Senate has \nevery right to review changes in the obligations and trade-offs to \nwhich it agrees. In the case of persistent noncompliance, the President \nmust return to the Senate to seek its consent to continue U.S. \nadherence.\n  The committee is to be commended for taking responsible action on an \nissue so potentially and justifiably damaging to the treaty's \nprospects.\n  With regard to the ABM Treaty, the tortuous process by which \nagreement \n\n[[Page S470]]\nwas finally reached on the DOD authorization bill was a reminder that \nit remains a hotly contested issue not soon to be resolved. The Foreign \nRelations Committee, again commendably, has acted to preclude linking \nthe futures of the START II and ABM Treaties. After all, these treaties \nwere reached in different eras and are separated by 20 years. The \nForeign Relations Committee has included a condition stating that \nRussian ratification of START II should not be contingent on continued \nadherence by the United States to Russian interpretation of the ABM \nTreaty. The managers amendment makes this more explicit by declaring \nthat nothing in the START II Treaty changes the rights of either party \nto the ABM treaty.\n  Like NAFTA, START II is a Republican treaty--inspired by Ronald \nReagan and negotiated by President Bush. Ronald Reagan came to office \npledging ``peace through strength'' and left office having concluded \nthe first strategic weapons reduction treaty in history. START II \nbuilds on these historic reductions. The Senate should follow through \non President Reagan's vision and ratify the START II Treaty.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 21, 1996]\n\n   Russia Balks at Arms Accord; Failure To Implement Clinton-Yeltsin \n                  Agreements Frustrates U.S. Officials\n\n                         (By Thomas W. Lippman)\n\n       Russia has balked at implementing any of the nuclear \n     security and weapons inspection agreements announced by \n     President Clinton and President Boris Yeltsin at their summit \n     meeting last May, throwing up a major roadblock to U.S-\n     Russian cooperation in key security issues, U.S. officials \n     said.\n       After a promising start on discussions aimed at carrying \n     out the agreements, the Russians pulled back and have \n     essentially suspended the talks, according to several \n     officials who said they were perplexed and frustrated by the \n     developments.\n       Officials at the State Department, the White House and the \n     Arms Control and Disarmament Agency said it is unclear why \n     the Russians have backed away and there may be multiple \n     reasons. What is clear, they said, is that the mutual \n     inspections and data exchanges on weapons and nuclear \n     materials--which the presidents said would happen--are not \n     about to happen.\n       The failure to carry through on the agreements does not by \n     itself threaten U.S. security or U.S.-Russian relations, \n     officials said. But in the context of other recent \n     developments in Russia such as the removal of almost all pro-\n     Western reformers from Yeltsin's government and the \n     appointment of a Russian nationalist, Yevgeny Primakov, as \n     foreign minister, it adds to a troubling recent pattern that \n     has clouded Washington's relations which Moscow.\n       ``We hope to implement all the agreements presidents \n     Clinton and Yeltsin arrived at during their Moscow summit,'' \n     State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said. ``Over the \n     past couple of years we have found that some of these arms \n     agreements are very difficult, and it is sometimes necessary \n     to bring in senior officials because the bureaucracy in both \n     countries can only take them so far,'' Burns said. He added \n     that the United States and Russia are cooperating on many \n     other issues, such as the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia.\n       Clinton and Yeltsin on May 10 issued a ``Joint Statement on \n     the Transparency and Irreversibility of the Process of \n     Reducing Nuclear Weapons,'' containing measures by which each \n     country could assure itself that the other was carrying out \n     promised nuclear weapons reductions.\n       They said the two countries would ``exchange on a regular \n     basis'' detailed information on their stockpiles of weapons \n     and nuclear materials. They also said the two countries would \n     undertake ``reciprocal monitoring'' of the facilities where \n     they store nuclear materials removed from dismantled \n     warheads. And they said they would ``seek to conclude in the \n     shortest possible time'' a legal agreement ensuring \n     protection of the exchanged data.\n       None of it has happened. The legal agreement was never \n     negotiated, making it impossible to exchange classified data \n     and develop the ``chain of custody'' agreement sought by the \n     United States. And the United States refused to allow Russian \n     officials to inspect the only U.S. nuclear weapons \n     dismantlement facility, the Pantex plant near Amarillo, Tex., \n     because Russia would not allow U.S. inspectors to visit a \n     comparable plant there.\n       In the same joint declaration, Clinton and Yeltsin ``urged \n     progress'' in carrying out a 1994 agreement by which Russia \n     was to cease producing plutonium, the key building block of \n     nuclear weapons. That has not happened either, officials \n     said, but for different reasons: The United States has been \n     able to come up with the money to replace the electric power \n     and heat generated by the Russian plutonium-producing \n     reactors, so the reactors still are operating.\n       Discussions on this issue are to resume later this month, \n     Energy Department officials said.\n       The failure to implement the agreements contributes to \n     widespread suspicion in Congress about the ability and will \n     of the Russian defense establishment to carry out such \n     accords.\n       That suspicion was manifest when the Senate began \n     consideration of the START II arms reduction treaty on the \n     Friday before Christmas. In that session, which attracted \n     little notice because of the timing, the Senate approved a \n     Resolution of Ratification that directs the president to \n     follow specific procedures in the event of Russian \n     noncompliance.\n       ``In the event that noncompliance persists'' after \n     diplomatic approaches, the resolution says, the president \n     must return to the Senate for a determination of whether the \n     United States will continue to be bound by the treaty.\n       ``Obviously we all hope and require that the Russians fully \n     comply with START II,'' said Sen. John Kyl (R-Ariz.).\n       ``But their record and the record of the former Soviet \n     Union with respect to compliance with arms control agreements \n     is somewhat dubious. I will note just a few of the areas of \n     violation in the past: the Biological Weapons Convention, the \n     Chemical Weapons agreements, the Missile Technology Control \n     Regime, START I and the conventional forces in Europe \n     treaties. All of these agreements have provisions that Russia \n     has in one way or another failed to comply [with],'' Kyl \n     said.\n       The START II treaty, signed in 1991, requires the United \n     States and Russia to make further deep cuts in their nuclear \n     arsenals and delivery systems by 2003. During the pre-\n     Christmas discussion, senators of both parties made clear \n     that they will ratify it by an overwhelming vote, but the \n     resolution they adopted specified that this country will not \n     be bound by its terms until it has been ratified by the \n     Russian Duma, a much more dubious proposition.\n       Russian ratification is not imminent, several analysts \n     said, because of strong opposition in the recently elected \n     Duma, or lower house of parliament, where many members \n     reportedly regard its terms as skewed in favor of the United \n     States.\n       The Senate resolution called on ``both parties to the START \n     II treaty to attach high priority'' to implementation of the \n     May 10 joint declaration so that compliance with START I and \n     START II can be verified, but did not make implementation a \n     condition of START II ratification.\n       U.S. officials involved in the ``transparency and \n     irreversibility'' issue offered several explanations of what \n     might be holding up an agreement on the Russian side.\n       ``The Russians have essentially told us they are doing a \n     reassessment. It probably has to do with the political \n     situation there,'' one said. ``They have a lot of communists \n     and nationalists in the Duma.''\n       The Russians ``have very limited interagency \n     communication,'' another source said. ``Their vertical \n     communication is relatively poor. And there's the fiefdom \n     problem,'' an indirect allusion to the prickly and \n     independent Russian Atomic Energy Minister, Viktor Mikhailov. \n     ``We're talking about letting out information about the crown \n     jewels,'' another U.S. official said. ``Both sides are pretty \n     nervous about it, but especially them.''\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my unqualified \nsupport for ratification of the START II Treaty. I am happy that the \nSenate is finally considering this measure and believe the \nimplementation of this treaty is another step on the road to \neliminating the most destabilizing strategic weapons.\n  In January 1993, President George Bush and President Boris Yeltsin \nsigned the treaty between the United States and the Russian Federation \non further reduction and limitation of strategic arms. Their \ndetermination and cooperation helped build upon the progress that was \nachieved from the START I Treaty. The result of START II will mean \ngreater reductions in strategic nuclear forces.\n  Ratification of this treaty today is critical, as it continues a \nprocess begun by START I. This treaty will help enhance U.S. and \ninternational security and substantially reduce the number of strategic \nwarheads currently deployed by both countries. In early December, I \njoined a number of my Senate colleagues in sending a letter to the \nmajority leader urging that both START II and the Chemicals Weapons \nConvention [CWC] be brought before the Senate for action. Shortly \nthereafter, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted unanimously to \napprove ratification of START II. This issue has bipartisan support. \nToday we have an opportunity to act on that.\n  Mr. President, this treaty has many important provisions. It will \neliminate around 4,000 strategic nuclear weapons from the arsenal of \nthe former Soviet Union. Specifically, it will eliminate all Russian \nheavy intercontinental ballistic missiles [ICBM's], and all multiple-\nwarhead ICBM's. Eliminating \n\n[[Page S471]]\nthese weapons would greatly reduce the threat of first strike in the \nevent of renewed hostilities with the former Soviet Union. By \neliminating this capability, United States-Russian strategic relations \nwill be strengthened.\n  Another important aspect of START II is that it strengthens our \nability to verify information, conduct on-site inspections, and deter \npossible violations of the treaty. This will help ensure compliance and \nallow monitoring of the progress being made to reduce these weapons. \nUnder this treaty, reduction of arms will take place over a 5- to 7-\nyear period. When these reductions are completed, the United States and \nRussia will each be limited to between 3,000 and 3,500 deployed \nstrategic warheads. It is my hope that ratification of this treaty \ntoday will help encourage Russia to complete its own START II \nratification efforts.\n  Mr. President, since the end of the cold war, our world has undergone \na tremendous transformation. There is less fear and worry about nuclear \nwar. We have made substantial efforts to reduce nuclear weapons. \nPresident Clinton has made nonproliferation and arms reduction a major \npriority. But the weapons are still here. Ratification of this treaty \nclearly represents significant progress with regard to reducing nuclear \narms. However, there is still work yet to be done.\n  Last year 187 nations voted to indefinitely extend the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty [NPT] with a commitment to work on a Comprehensive \nTest Ban [CTB] Treaty. I am extremely encouraged by this action and \nbelieve that we must work to reach an agreement on a CTB in the near \nfuture. In addition, the Chemical Weapons Convention [CWC] is also \nawaiting ratification by the United States. The CWC bans the \ndevelopment, production, stockpiling, and use of toxic chemicals as a \nweapon. Clearly, we must eliminate these weapons of mass destruction. \nBy addressing these issues, it is my hope that other countries will be \nmore likely to follow the U.S. example and end their reliance on a \nnuclear deterrent.\n  Mr. President, today we have an opportunity to ratify a treaty that \nis vital to U.S. strategic interests. We have an opportunity to help \nmake the world a safer place to live--a safer place for our children. \nSTART II has strong support from the American public, the national \nsecurity community and many Members of this body. We must continue with \nour efforts to reduce these weapons of mass destruction, and \nratification of START II is a critical step toward this end.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, 3 years after its signing by the United \nStates and the Soviet Union, the second landmark Strategic Arms \nReduction Treaty has finally come to the floor of the Senate for \nconsideration. I want to join the overwhelming majority of my \ncolleagues in strongly supporting the ratification of START II, and \nhope it will move quickly into force. Indeed, this treaty is key to our \nnational and international security, and will help set the tone for \nwhat should be a more peaceful era.\n  Mr. President, the risk of detonation of a nuclear device in Western \nEurope or the United States may have actually increased since the end \nof the Cold War. There are literally tens of thousands of weapons, and \nmass quantities of nuclear materials, in Russia's stockpile, and their \nsafety and security are in question. Just one of those has to get into \nthe hands of a rogue nation or a high-paying terrorist to threaten or \ndestroy Washington, Bonn, London, or any other major metropolis.\n  When START II goes into force, however, 8,000 strategic weapons--\n4,000 from both Russia and the United States--will be tabbed for \ndestruction. This will include the abolition of the core of the Russian \nnuclear arsenal--the deadly SS-18--and the multiple independent re-\nentry vehicles [MIRV's], significantly reducing the likelihood of \neither side launching a nuclear first strike. START II, however, does \nleave intact our defensive, second strike capability.\n  Implementation of START II, moreover--coupled with the Non-\nProliferation Treaty the United States signed earlier this year--would \nreflect monumental reform of our nuclear posture. Not only will these \ntwo treaties help reduce the possibility of an accidental launch or the \nsabotage of nuclear weapons and materials, they will establish a new \napproach toward global non-proliferation. As the United States and \nRussia will downsize their stockpiles, other nuclear countries could \nproceed with reduction of their arsenals. This will bring us several \nsteps closer to successful conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear test \nban treaty.\n  Perhaps the most significant achievements of START II would be the \nconsecration of an international alliance against the scourge of \nnuclear war, rather than continuation of the build-up by nations which \ncould each independently threaten a nuclear explosion.\n  Mr. President, the post-cold war era brings an opportunity to reshape \nU.S. defense posture and policy. No longer will we have to rely on the \nthreat of nuclear weapons nor, I believe, permanently deploy United \nStates combat forces abroad, except in limited and rare occasions, in \norder to protect our interests.\n  While we can all agree on the need--indeed the moral imperative--of \nending the threat of nuclear war, there is an equal need for debate on \nwhere we go from here. For example, the mission and, indeed, the \nnecessity of alliances such as NATO--anchored in nuclear doctrine and \nmassive retaliation--are only now being reconsidered. The Bosnia \noperation is the most recent example of an unfortunate tendency to \naddress, by a rather ad hoc process, questions regarding our role, \nmission and methods in the new era.\n  The Congress, and particularly the Senate, will play a pivotal role \nin that debate, Mr. President. I have made clear my view that it will \nbe incumbent on this body to assert its constitutional prerogative in \nshaping the future of our national security posture.\n  Ratifying the START II treaty will be an important step in accepting \nand asserting our responsibilities. Time is of the essence, Mr. \nPresident. The Russian Duma will not ratify the Treaty until the Senate \ndoes, and, as we saw in last month's parliamentary elections in Russia, \nthe Duma could become more anti-Western and regressive. We must lock in \nthese reductions, and begin implementation of START II as soon as \npossible.\n  The Senate has dallied long enough on issues of paramount importance \nto national security. START II and the equally vital Chemical Weapons \nConvention have unfortunately been held hostage by the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee. This has reflected badly on this Senate, and badly \nserved US interests. Therefore, I am gratified that we are finally here \ntoday, debating START II, and would urge swift ratification of this \ntreaty and the CWC. We must consolidate the gains the new era affords \nus, lest we revert back to the dangers and antiquated thinking of the \ncold war.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to ratify the \nsecond Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty by an overwhelming vote. This \ntreaty will receive bipartisan support because it makes an enormous \ncontribution to our security. That is why I am glad to be part of a \nlarge group of Senators who support this treaty.\n  President Bush and President Yeltsin of Russia signed the START II \nTreaty in January of 1993, in one of the greatest achievements of the \nBush administration. Once President Clinton agreed on the \nimplementation of the first START Treaty with the leaders of Belarus, \nKazakhstan, Russia, and the Ukraine, START I came into force in \nDecember 1994, and the way was cleared for ratification of this START \nII Treaty by the Senate and the Russian Duma.\n  I will not dwell on why it has taken so long for the Senate to take \nup this treaty. I will only note that the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee conducted no business meetings for 4\\1/2\\ months. It took \ncourage for the Senator from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, to block \nother Senate business in order to free the START II Treaty from a \ncommittee that had been shut down. So I want to congratulate him on the \nfact that the Senate is now debating this treaty. He has made a great \ncontribution to our national security and our future by ensuring that \nthis treaty come to the floor. \n\n[[Page S472]]\n\n  Mr. President, the START II Treaty is the single greatest step in the \nhistory of arms control. It aims to eliminate ``first strike'' \ncapability. It is the fear of a nuclear first strike--sometimes called \na bolt out of the blue--that keeps the nuclear powers on hair trigger \nalert and encourages the nuclear arms race. But the START II treaty \nwould enable the United States and the Russian Federation to rest \nassured that neither can knock the other out with a surprise attack.\n  Each would retain enough of a deterrent to inflict punishing \nretaliation after a first strike, which means that a first strike would \nbe a losing strategy. The United States would also retain a hedge \nagainst a breakout from the treaty in the event of a military coup or \nother reversal of democracy in Russia. The remaining U.S. arsenal would \nalso defend us against rogue nations that might conceivably seek to \nthreaten us or our allies with limited weapons of mass destruction.\n  Even as we strive for peace and stability, we must not let our guard \ndown. That is why it is essential that we retain a robust force of \nMinuteman III's, B-52 bombers and submarine-launched ballistic \nmissiles.\n  It is important to note that the START II Treaty would eliminate the \nbackbone of the Russian nuclear deterrent, the massive SS-18 land-based \nmissile. The Russians have 188 of them, with 10 warheads each. If \nratified, START II will require the SS-18's to be destroyed. More than \n2,000 other Russian warheads would also be destroyed.\n  START II embodies the principle that the cold war is over. We built \nup our nuclear capability in order to outweigh the Soviet Union's \nnumerical superiority in conventional weapons, especially in Europe. \nThe Soviet Union is gone; the Berlin Wall is no more; Europe is no \nlonger divided by Communist tyranny. Much of our nuclear arsenal has \nlost its purpose. By ratifying START II, the Senate would recognize \nthat we have entered a new era.\n  Ratification will also demonstrate American leadership. It will show \nthe Russian Duma that the United States Senate is serious about arms \ncontrol. It will lead the way for other nuclear powers to cut their own \nstockpiles of weapons. And it will demonstrate to nonnuclear states \nthat the United States is living up to the commitment made when we \nsigned the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, that we would work for an \nend to the nuclear arms race and for nuclear disarmament.\n  The START II Treaty would reduce the likelihood of an accidental \nlaunch or terrorist attack. Fewer nuclear weapons means better control \nover those weapons by a country's civilian leadership. Better control \nmeans a lesser likelihood that those weapons will fall into the wrong \nhands.\n  Lastly, the START II Treaty is verifiable. The treaty continues the \nstringent START I verification regime of satellites and other \nintelligence, data exchange, notification, exhibition, and onsite \ninspection to detect and deter possible breaches of the treaty. But \nSTART II includes new verification measures, including observation of \nsilo conversion and missile elimination procedures, exhibitions, and \ninspections of all heavy bombers to confirm weapon loads, and \nexhibitions of heavy bombers reoriented to a conventional role to \nconfirm their observable differences.\n  We North Dakotans know about nuclear weapons. After all, with our two \nMinuteman wings and our B-52 bombers, it has been said that North \nDakota is the third strongest nuclear power in the entire world, after \nthe United States and Russia. We have been a cold war arsenal for \ndecades. We remain ready to help ensure peace in a new world.\n  At the same time, North Dakotans are glad to see the nuclear shadow \nlightening. It is time to ratify the START II Treaty. Coupled with a \nstrong defense, it will help build our national security. I urge my \ncolleagues to support START II.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate has had the opportunity to review \nand consider the START II Treaty for almost three years, and it is now \noffering its advice and consent to that treaty. I am pleased to endorse \nthis treaty, which will substantially reduce the nuclear threat that \nhas hovered for so many years like a dark cloud over both the United \nStates and Russia. The START II Treaty builds on twenty years of arms \ncontrol efforts ranging from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty \n(ABM Treaty), through the SALT I, SALT II, and START I treaties.\n  The START II Treaty, signed by Presidents Bush and Yeltsin on January \n3, 1993, commits the United States and Russia to deeper reductions in \nstrategic offensive nuclear weapons, and goes beyond the START I Treaty \nto include warheads on heavy bombers. The START II Treaty also \nestablishes a limit of 3,500 deployed warheads, a ban on all land-\nbased, multiple warhead ballistic missiles, and limitations on the \nnumber of warheads deployed on all submarine launched ballistic \nmissiles. When taken together and fully implemented by January 1, 2003, \nSTART I and START II will have cut the deployed strategic weapons of \nthe United States and Russia by approximately two-thirds.\n  The Arms Control Observer Group, which I co-chair with the \ndistinguished Senator from Alaska, Senator Stevens, has offered a \npackage of nine amendments to the treaty document. These amendments \naddress a number of concerns. Most importantly, one amendment states \nthat nothing in START II changes the rights of either party to the \nAnti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Another states the requirement for \nSenate advice and consent to any possible future amendments to START \nII. I commend Senator Stevens and all of the members of the Arms \nControl Observer Group for their efforts to review this important \ntreaty.\n  The START II Treaty is an important step forward for arms control. \nArms control measures are a more sensible and cost effective means of \naddressing the actual threats to U.S. national security than are some \nof the costly and theoretical ballistic missile defense programs on \nwhich billions of taxpayer dollars have been lavished. I much prefer to \nspend money to destroy actual missiles and missile silos outright, than \nto spend money on exotic technologies of only hypothetical \neffectiveness. Reducing the threat by such concrete measures is the \ncornerstone of effective threat reduction, which also reduces the need \nto spend, spend, spend, on more and more costly and dangerous weapons.\n  Mr. President, the nuclear sword of Damocles has hung by a thread \nover the lives of every U.S. citizen since we entered the nuclear age. \nArms control measures like this START II Treaty do not remove that \nmenacing sword, but each arms control treaty strengthens the thread \nsuspending the sword, weaving it into a sturdy, and safer, cord.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise to offer some personal reflections \non both the substance of this treaty and the process by which the \nSenate is considering it.\n  Frankly, I am troubled by the casual, disengaged manner in which the \nSenate is exercising its advice and consent responsibilities. Clearly, \nthere are numerous issues of importance to the country which demand our \nattention these days. But national security policy is not something \nthat we can set aside and deal with only when it is convenient.\n  Maintaining a strong and effective national security policy requires \nour constant vigilance. It requires that we rise above the kind of \npartisan politics which are so prevalent in Washington today. It \nrequires that we submit prospective arms accords to rigorous \nexamination and analysis to ensure that these treaties are verifiable, \nenforceable, and supportive of our national interests.\n  But where has this scrutiny been? How many of my colleagues have \nactually sat down and reviewed the details of this treaty? How many of \nmy colleagues have examined the verification regime, the intelligence \nassessments, the Russian strategic modernization program, and the \npolitical transition that is ongoing in Russia. With all due respect, \nother than select members of the Foreign Relations, Intelligence, and \nArmed Services Committees, I would say very few. That does not speak \nwell for this institution. It does not speak well for those of us who \nhave been elected to uphold the Constitution.\n  Mr. President, I want to raise a number of issues that trouble me \nabout this \n\n[[Page S473]]\ntreaty. First off, I am concerned by loopholes in the treaty that allow \nthousands of systems and warheads to avoid destruction. The treaty \nestablishes central limits on deployed systems and accountable \nwarheads, but it does not require destruction of many of these systems. \nEither side is permitted to retain a vast stockpile of nondeployed \nmissiles, launchers, and warheads; but with the exception of the SS-18, \nonly deployed systems are accountable. This can hardly be considered \nlegitimate arms reduction.\n  I am also troubled by the intelligence community's lack of confidence \nin its ability to verify Russian compliance. Although the \nadministration has touted the effectiveness of the START verification \nregime, which START II continues, the intelligence community has been \nless convincing. In its report on the START Treaty, the Senate \nIntelligence Committee stated:\n\n       Members of the Senate should understand, however, that U.S. \n     intelligence will have less than high confidence in its \n     monitoring of such areas as nondeployed mobile ICBM's, \n     the number of reentry vehicles actually carried by some \n     ICBM's and SLBM's, and some provisions relating to cruise \n     missiles and the heavy bombers that carry them.\n\n  The Intelligence Committee's report continues, saying ``this \ncommittee remains deeply concerned, moreover, that Russia's former, and \nperhaps continuing, biological weapons program may indicate that the \nRussian military is capable of mounting or continuing a START \nviolation, either in contravention of the wishes of Russia's civilian \nauthorities, or with the knowledge or support of at least part of that \nleadership.''\n  Mr. President, these are very sobering appraisals and they focus on a \nkey point. Without full, unconditional compliance, no arms control \nagreement is worth the paper it is printed on. The former Soviet Union \nconsistently violated every arms control agreement it was a party to. \nIndeed, on an annual basis, successive administrations cited Soviet \nviolations of the SALT I and SALT II Treaties, the CFE Treaty, the INF \nTreaty, the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, the Limited Test Ban Treaty, \nand the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention.\n  But this pattern did not end with the dissolution of the Soviet \nUnion. Today Russia is in violation of the Biological Weapons \nConvention and the CFE Treaty. They are also refusing to implement any \nof the nuclear security and weapons inspection agreements announced by \nPresident Clinton and Boris Yeltsin at their summit meeting last May.\n  I have heard many of the treaty's supporters brush off the \nnoncompliance issue as an effort to revive outdated cold war rhetoric. \nBut how does one explain this continuing pattern of noncompliance in \nthe so called ERA of glasnost? We are not talking about events that \noccurred 10 years ago, we are talking about the Russian's violating the \nCFE Treaty today by failing to destroy tanks, armor and other weapons \nbased east of the Ural mountains. We are talking about Russia's failure \nto honor its commitments made less than a year ago in the joint \nstatement on the transparency and irreversibility of nuclear arms \nreductions.\n  And what about the recent Duma elections in which the nationalists \nand Communists in Russia gained 33 percent of the lower house seats? \nWhat about Boris Yeltsin's removal of virtually all pro-Western \ndemocratic reformers from his government? What about the continuing \nonslaught in Chechnya where innocent civilians are being routinely \nslaughtered in their homes and in the streets?\n  If Russia is engaging in such ruthless behavior, and is continuing to \nviolate its existing treaty obligations, all under the stewardship of \nBoris Yeltsin and the more liberal, pro-democratic forces, how can we \nrealistically expect its behavior to improve with the hardliners now \ntaking power. The truth is there is absolutely no indication that the \nRussian legislature will even ratify START II, let alone comply. In \nfact, according to administration officials, the Russians have \nessentially told us that they are delaying consideration of START II \nindefinitely while they reassess the treaty.\n\n  At the same time, the Russians are trying to manipulate the START II \nratification issue to coerce financial and military concessions from \nthe United States. Specifically, the Russians have stated that unless \nwe suspend NATO expansion, unless we continue to adhere unconditionally \nto the ABM Treaty, and unless we increase financial aid to Russia, they \nwill not ratify START II. Where I come from that is called extortion. \nAnd it is wrong.\n  Yet advocates of the treaty, in both the administration and Congress, \nare going along with these Russian threats, and using them as a \nrationale to slow NATO expansion, prevent the United States from \ndefending itself against ballistic missiles, and increase foreign aid. \nBut what about our sovereignty? What about the security of our Nation? \nWhat about the security of NATO and the newly independent democracies \nin Eastern Europe? How can we possibly bow to such extortion and allow \nRussia to effectively wield a veto over our national defense policies? \nIt is morally, ethically, and strategically misguided.\n  Mr. President, I am particularly troubled by the bogus linkage that \nhas been drawn between the START II Treaty and national missile \ndefense. There is no legitimate linkage between the two issues. The ABM \nTreaty was crafted during the cold war and is premised on the outdated \ndoctrine of mutual assured destruction. But the world is now \nmultipolar. The monolithic Soviet threat has been replaced by numerous \nregional threats. Mutual assured destruction is neither relevant to, or \ncapable of deterring, these threats. The only responsible way to \ncounter ballistic missile threats to our homeland is to develop and \ndeploy national missile defenses.\n  The truth is, missile defenses do not threaten Russia. If Russia and \nthe United States are no longer adversaries, and are no longer \ntargeting nuclear weapons against each other, how could the deployment \nof a limited defense against other potential adversaries threaten \nRussia in any way? How are we provoking Russia or undermining \ncooperation if we defend the American people against the likes of Kim \nJong-Il, Saddam Hussein, or Moammar Khadafi?\n  Those who say that any decision to protect the American people \nagainst ballistic missiles will kill the START II Treaty are engaging \nin pure fear mongering. It is irresponsible and unsupportable.\n  Mr. President, against the current backdrop of political, economic \nand military turmoil in Russia, against the backdrop of continuing \nnoncompliance with existing arms control agreements, and against the \nbackdrop of uncertainty over the verification regime, why are we rubber \nstamping this treaty with very little consideration in the Senate? With \nso many questions unanswered, it seems to me that the most responsible \ncourse of action would be for the Senate to delay action until we have \na better understanding of the military and political situation that is \nunfolding in Russia. We also should demand full compliance with all \nexisting arms control accords before ratifying a new, major treaty. In \nmy view, to ratify START II now, when Russia remains in noncompliance \nwith other accords, would legitimize their behavior and thoroughly \nundermine our national security. We would, in effect, be rewarding \ntheir defiance. That can only encourage more violations, and further \njeopardize our security.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to carefully consider these issues. The \nConstitution clearly calls upon us to safeguard the interests of the \nNation through the advice and consent process. While I support the \ninitiatives recommended by the arms control observer group to help \nstrengthen the resolution of ratification, they alone do not address \nthe plethora of issues that remain outstanding. We do the Constitution \nand the American people a disservice if we fail to more thoroughly \nevaluate these issues prior to ratification. For these reasons I must \noppose ratification.\n  Mr. President, I ask that several articles be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 21, 1996]\n\n   Russia Balks at Arms Accord--Failure To Implement Clinton-Yeltsin \n                  Agreements Frustrates U.S. Officials\n\n                         (By Thomas W. Lippman)\n\n       Russia has balked at implementing any of the nuclear \n     security and weapons inspection \n\n[[Page S474]]\n     agreements announced by President Clinton and President Boris Yeltsin \n     at their summit meeting last May, throwing up a major \n     roadblock to U.S.-Russian cooperation in key security issues, \n     U.S. officials said.\n       After a promising start on discussions aimed at carrying \n     out the agreements, the Russians pulled back and have \n     essentially suspended the talks, according to several \n     officials who said they were perplexed and frustrated by the \n     developments.\n       Officials at the State Department, the White House and the \n     Arms Control and Disarmament Agency said it is unclear why \n     the Russians have backed away and there may be multiple \n     reasons. What is clear, they said, is that the mutual \n     inspections and data exchanges on weapons and nuclear \n     materials--which the presidents said would happen--are not \n     about to happen.\n       The failure to carry through on the agreements does not \n     itself threaten U.S. security or U.S.-Russian relations, \n     officials said. But in the context of other recent \n     developments in Russia, such as the removal of almost all \n     pro-Western reformers from Yeltsin's government and the \n     appointment of a Russian nationalist. Yevgeny Primakov, as \n     foreign minister, it adds to a troubling recent pattern that \n     has clouded Washington's relations with Moscow.\n       ``We hope to implement all the agreements presidents \n     Clinton and Yeltsin arrived at during their Moscow summit.'' \n     State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said. ``Over the \n     past couple of years we have found that some of these arms \n     agreements are very difficult, and it is sometimes necessary \n     to bring in senior officials because the bureaucracy in both \n     countries can only take them so far,'' Burns said. He added \n     that the United States and Russia are cooperating on many \n     other issues, such as the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia.\n       Clinton and Yeltsin on May 10 issued a ``Joint Statement on \n     the Transparency and Irreversibility of the Process of \n     Reducing Nuclear Weapons,'' containing measures by which each \n     country could assure itself that the other was carrying out \n     promised nuclear weapons reductions.\n       They said the two countries would ``exchange on a regular \n     basis'' detailed information on their stockpiles of weapons \n     and nuclear materials. They also said the two countries would \n     undertake ``reciprocal monitoring'' of the facilities where \n     they store nuclear materials removed from dismantled \n     warheads. And they said they would ``seek to conclude in the \n     shortest possible time'' a legal agreement ensuring \n     protection of the exchange data.\n       None of it has happened. The legal agreement was never \n     negotiated, making it impossible to exchange classified data \n     and develop the ``chain of custody'' agreement sought by the \n     United States. And the United States refused to allow Russian \n     officials to inspect the only U.S. nuclear weapons \n     dismantlement facility, the Pantext plant near Amarillo, \n     Tex., because Russia would not allow U.S. inspectors to visit \n     a comparable plan there.\n       In the same joint declaration, Clinton and Yeltsin ``urged \n     progress'' in carrying out a 1994 agreement by which Russia \n     was to cease producing plutonium, the key building block of \n     nuclear weapons. That has not happened either, officials \n     said, but for different reasons: The United States has been \n     unable to come up with the money to replace the electric \n     power and heat generated by the Russian plutonium-producing \n     reactors, so the reactors still are operating.\n       Discussions on this issue are to resume later this month, \n     Energy Department officials said.\n       The failure to implement the agreements contributes to \n     widespread suspicion in Congress about the ability and will \n     of the Russian defense establishment to carry out such \n     accords.\n       That suspicion was manifest when the Senate began \n     consideration of the START II arms reduction treaty on the \n     Friday before Christmas. In that session, which attracted \n     little notice because of the timing, the Senate approved a \n     Resolution of Ratification that directs the president to \n     follow specific procedures in the event of Russian \n     noncompliance.\n       ``In the event that noncompliance persists'' after \n     diplomatic approaches, the resolution says, the president \n     must return to the Senate for a determination of whether the \n     United States will continue to bound by the treaty.\n       ``Obviously we all hope and require that the Russians fully \n     comply with START II,'' said Sen. John Kyl (R-Ariz.).\n       ``But their record and the record of the former Soviet \n     Union with respect to compliance with arms control agreements \n     is somewhat dubious. I will note just a few of the areas of \n     violation in the past: the Biological Weapons Convention, the \n     Chemical Weapons agreements, the Missile Technology Control \n     Regime, START I and the conventional forces in Europe \n     treaties. All of these agreements have provisions that Russia \n     has in one way or another failed to comply [with],'' Kyl \n     said.\n       The START II treaty, signed in 1991, requires the United \n     States and Russia to make further deep cuts in their nuclear \n     arsenals and delivery systems by 2003. During the pre-\n     Christmas discussion, senators of both parties made clear \n     that they will ratify it by an overwhelming vote, but the \n     resolution they adopted specified that this country will not \n     be bound by its terms until it has been ratified by the \n     Russian Duma, a much more dubious proposition.\n       Russian ratification is not imminent, several analysts \n     said, because of strong opposition in the recently elected \n     Duma, or lower house of parliament, where many members \n     reportedly regard its terms as skewed in favor of the United \n     States.\n       The Senate resolution called on ``both parties to the START \n     II treaty to attach high priority'' to implementation of the \n     May 10 joint declaration so that compliance with START I and \n     START II can be verified, but did not make implementation a \n     condition of START II ratification.\n       U.S. officials involved in the ``transparency and \n     irreversibility'' issue offered several explanations of what \n     might be holding up an agreement on the Russian side.\n       ``The Russians have essentially told us they are doing a \n     reassessment. It probably has to do with the political \n     situation there,'' one said. ``They have a lot of communists \n     and nationalists in the Duma.''\n       The Russians ``have very limited interagency \n     communication,'' another source said. ``Their vertical \n     communication is relatively poor. And there's the fiefdom \n     problem,'' an indirect allusion to the prickly and \n     independent Russian Atomic Energy Minister, Viktor Mikhailov. \n     ``We're talking about letting out information about the crown \n     jewels,'' another U.S. official said. ``Both sides are pretty \n     nervous about it, but especially them.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Defense News, Jan. 22-28, 1996]\n\n                 CTBT Talks Hinge on China Test Stance\n\n       The upcoming round of negotiations on a Comprehensive Test \n     Ban Treaty (CTBT), which begins Jan. 22 in Geneva, will be \n     the most crucial in the 38-nation talks, experts said last \n     week.\n       An agreement on a draft text is necessary by the end of the \n     10-week session to meet a September U.N. deadline, John \n     Holum, director of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament \n     Agency, said Jan. 19.\n       China's insistence that a CTBT treaty allow so-called \n     peaceful nuclear explosions is considered a key obstacle in \n     the talks, which are ruled by consensus. The other major \n     nuclear powers have rejected China's stance.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 21, 1996]\n\nJapanese Foreign Minister Delivers Message of Commitment to the United \n                                 States\n\n                         (By Thomas W. Lippman)\n\n       Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda, in office barely \n     a week, raced through high-level Washington in the past few \n     days with a message of friendship, reassurance and commitment \n     to the U.S.-Japan security partnership in Asia.\n       In meetings with President Clinton and his senior foreign \n     policy and national security advisers, Ikeda said the United \n     States and its troops in Japan are ``vital'' to the security \n     of a potentially unstable region.\n       That Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto sent him here on \n     short notice on his first official mission reflects the \n     Japanese government's view that the United States represents \n     ``our most important bilateral relationship,'' Ikeda said \n     yesterday.\n       In the past such views might have been unremarkable. But \n     the alleged abduction and rape of a Japanese schoolgirl by \n     U.S. servicemen on Okinawa last year have led to questions \n     here and in Asia about the desirability of keeping nearly \n     50,000 U.S. troops in Japan.\n       Essays have been streaming out of foreign policy think \n     tanks suggesting that the vigorous, economically strong \n     countries of the region should assume more responsibility for \n     their own security and the U.S. role perhaps should be \n     reduced.\n       Absolutely not, said Ikeda, a former director general of \n     Japan's defense agency. In the absence of a regional \n     security framework such as NATO, he said, the United \n     States and its bilateral security agreements with Japan, \n     South Korea, the Philippines and Taiwan are the ``pivot'' \n     of Asia-Pacific stability.\n       In a statement issued as he took office Jan. 11, Hashimoto \n     said ``the Japan-United States relationship is vital for the \n     peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific region, as well as \n     for the entire world.''\n       Ikeda used similar language yesterday in a meeting with \n     Washington Post editors and reporters. The United States and \n     Japan, he said, will make ``the utmost effort to try to \n     prevent the Okinawa incident from becoming an obstacle to the \n     vital U.S. role in the region.''\n       Clinton is scheduled to make a state visit to Japan in \n     April. On Friday, Ikeda and Secretary of State Warren \n     Christopher agreed to accelerate the work of a joint \n     commission studying the grievances of Okinawans about the \n     U.S. troop presence in the hope of devising a solution by the \n     time Clinton visits, according to State Department spokesman \n     Nicholas Burns.\n       It may well take longer, Ikeda said yesterday. ``A solution \n     is very difficult to find,'' he said. ``The Okinawan people \n     want the troop presence drastically reduced. But the security \n     of Japan has to be considered as well. . . .

This stabilizing \n     role performed by the U.S. presence also helps to reassure \n     countries in Southeast Asia about Japan, and Japan and South \n     Korea about each other.''\n       Ikeda agreed. ``Other nations enjoy indirectly the benefits \n     of the U.S.-Japan security treaty, he said.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n           [From the U.S. News & World Report, Jan. 29, 1996]\n\n     Conversation With the President: The View From the Oval Office\n\n (President Clinton met for an hour in the Oval Office last week with \n  U.S. News White House correspondents Kenneth T.

Earlier this year, \n     the Defense Ministry announced that the new missile was \n     successfully tested and could be deployed within two years.\n       As for bombers, Moscow has decided to buy 19 Tu-160 \n     Blackjacks and 25 Tu-95 Bears from Ukraine, Pyotr Deinekin, \n     Russian Air Force commander, said in a Nov. 28 interview.\n       The Tu-160 bombers are sleek, thin-nosed aircraft that can \n     carry 12 air-to-surface missiles and fly 12,000 kilometers \n     without refueling, while the Tu-95 can carry up to four \n     thermonuclear bombs and fly 8,285 kilometers without \n     refueling.\n       Deinekin said Moscow also is planning to receive more than \n     3,000 cruise missiles from Ukraine, but he refused to provide \n     further details about the potential cruise missile transfer.\n       U.S. and Russian diplomats are gloomy about the chances for \n     ratification of the 1993 START II by the Russian parliament. \n     Neither the Russian Duma nor the U.S. Congress has ratified \n     START II, which would limit Moscow and Washington to between \n     3,000 and 3,500 nuclear warheads each.\n       The START II treaty is languishing in the Duma as Russian \n     lawmakers gear up for scheduled Dec. 17 elections, according \n     to Russian and U.S. diplomats. No Russian lawmaker has \n     anything to gain from pushing the treaty, as nationalist \n     sentiment among the Russian public is running at a \n     fever pitch, these officials said.\n       Sergey Rogov, director of the Institute of USA and Canada \n     in Moscow, said Nov. 16 that hard-line politicians also are \n     linking ratification of START II to key Western policy \n     decisions: no NATO expansion and no U.S. move to deploy \n     theater ballistic missile systems considered by Moscow to \n     violate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty. Rogov spoke \n     at a conference sponsored in Washington by the National \n     Defense University, Fort McNair.\n       In another sign of the faltering U.S.-Russian strategic \n     relationship, Russian officials last week canceled planned \n     negotiations aimed at reaching an agreement to provide mutual \n     access to classified access to information about ongoing \n     nuclear disarmament efforts. The talks, known as the \n     Consultations on Safeguards, Transparency and \n     Irreversibility, were scheduled to take place here Nov. 27-\n     28.\n       While a State Department spokesman said Nov. 30 the talks \n     were canceled due to ``mutual inconvenience,'' other U.S. \n     government officials said last week the talks have been at a \n     complete impasse for some months. Russia's Atomic Energy \n     Ministry officials have been loath to provide access to \n     certain data U.S. nuclear experts consider crucial to \n     verifying dismantlement activities, U.S. experts said.\n       Meanwhile, the acquisition of SS-19 missiles from Ukraine \n     should maintain Russia's nuclear potential through 2009, Col. \n     Gen. Igor Sergeyev, commander in chief of strategic forces, \n     told Interfax news agency on Nov. 24.\n       Russia now has 150 silo-based SS-19 missiles, each with six \n     warheads; while the Ukraine has 90. Kiev inherited 130 of \n     these missiles after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 \n     but has been sending warheads to Russian for dismantling, as \n     required by international disarmament agreements.\n       A Ukrainian Defense Ministry source said all nuclear \n     warheads would be removed from Ukraine by the end of 1998. In \n     a Nov. 28 interview, he noted that Ukraine already has \n     transferred 40 percent of its 1,600 warheads to Russia for \n     dismantling.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n       [From the Worldwide Weekly Defense News; Nov. 20-26, 1995]\n\n              Hard-Line Russians Tout Nukes To Match West\n\n               (By Theresa Hitchens and Anton Zhigulsky)\n\n       Moscow.--A renewed emphasis on nuclear weapons is among the \n     elements of a new, more aggressive strategic posture toward \n     the West by hard-line politicians and military leaders in \n     Russia, who grow increasingly strident as planned \n     parliamentary and presidential elections near, and the health \n     of President Boris Yeltsin reportedly declines.\n       Former Communists and populist party officials here said \n     the development of new strategic missiles is needed to \n     counter alleged Western conventional superiority. Moscow also \n     should reject a number of U.S.-Russian nuclear arms control \n     treaties, according to party leaders.\n       Gen. Boris Gromov, Russian deputy foreign minister and head \n     of one of the most popular parties in the partliamentary race \n     scheduled for Dec. 17, said Nov. 14 that Moscow's strategic \n     policy inevitably will change after the elections.\n       ``The United States remains Russia's main opponent in all \n     regions of the world, and the strategy should be changed \n     considering this fact,'' Gromov told a news conference here.\n       Gromov's views are echoed by another prominent military \n     leader-turned popular politician, Gen. Alexander Lebed. The \n     platform of Lebed's party, Congress of Russian Communities, \n     promises to ``give back to Russia its former greatness.''\n       Many of the new strategic concepts being embraced by hard-\n     liners have been distilled in a new report being circulated \n     within the Russian Defense Ministry as an alternative to \n     current military doctrine. Called ``Conception of \n     counteracting Strategy Against Main Threats to the National \n     Security of Russia,'' the paper was written by Anton Surikov, \n     an analyst at the Moscow-based USA and Canada Institute of \n     the Russian Academy of Sciences.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am pleased to lend my voice to those of \nmy colleagues supporting the passage of the treaty between the United \nStates of America and the Russian Federation on further reductions and \nlimitations of strategic offensive arms, known more commonly as START \nII.\n  The original START Treaty mandated United States and former Soviet \nUnion reductions to 6,000 strategic offensive nuclear weapons \nincorporated in intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched \nballistic missiles, and heavy bombers.\n  START II goes further by limiting each country to 3,500 accountable \nwarheads on strategic offensive nuclear weapons on ballistic missiles, \nand nuclear weapons on bombers in each country.\n  This is a reduction of one-third of the number of deployed nuclear \nweapons each country managed in 1990.\n  START II significantly reduces the United States and Russian nuclear \narsenal. I am satisfied that the treaty provides an inspection regime \nthat will verify compliance with the treaty, and that the United States \nwill continue to have a nuclear response capability appropriate for any \npossible future threat.\n  I recommend the Senators on the Arms Control Observer Group for their \nbipartisan investment in dialogue and compromise that has brought us to \nthis moment. I also recognize the tireless efforts of the Arms Control \nObserver Group staff, and the members and staff of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee in making START II a reality. \n\n[[Page S476]]\nAnd I would be remise if I did not recognize President Bush for his \nforesight in negotiating this Treaty and signing it in January 1993.\n  With the world awash in turmoil, Mr. President, we should all be very \nencouraged by the action of the Senate today in moving this treaty. The \nUnited States is the world's only superpower. And it is appropriate for \nthe rest of us to bring leadership to the rest of the world, \nparticularly with regards to the issue of weapons of mass destruction.\n  I encourage the Senate to move the START II Treaty today with the \nknowledge that the future of mankind is more secure because of it.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today marks a truly historic moment in our \nNation's history. Today we raise our voices in affirmation of peace and \nsecurity not just for our generation, but for generations to come. \nToday we embark on a voyage toward sustained peace and nucelar \nstability.\n  The START II Treaty is the single most comprehensive weapons \nreduction measure in modern history. It will forever end the continued \nproliferation of our nuclear stockpile and limit the level of those \nweapons to a fixed and verifiable number. I can think of no greater \nsolution to the nuclear dilemma than that which is before us today.\n  As a matter of history, let me remind my colleagues that this treaty \nis a product of strong bipartisan effort spanning three \nadministrations, both Republican and Democratic. And as a member of the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee, I am humbled to stand here this day \nand participate in this important event.\n  Finally, we must remember that today's action in no way reduces our \nnational strength or resolve. Our vigilance remains strong, and our \ncommitment to peace even stronger.\n  This is the dawning of a new chapter in American strategic strength \nand peace, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nhistoric measure.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today the Senate will provide its long-\noverdue advice and consent to ratification of the START II Treaty. I \nbelieve that this may be the most significant accomplishment that this \nbody will have in this Congress. That will depend on whether our action \nis followed by similar action in the Russian Duma in the months ahead.\n  I regret that we were not able to take this action months ago. At the \nend of last March Senator Lugar predicted that the treaty would be \nready for Senate debate in May. It should have been, but it wasn't \nthrough no fault of the Senator from Indiana. I hope that the 8 months \ndelay has not hurt the treaty's prospects in the Duma. It clearly is \noverwhelmingly in Russia's interest, as well as our own, that this \ntreaty go into force as soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, this treaty will truly reduce the nuclear danger in \nways unimaginable when I entered this body in 1983. Then we argued \nabout nuclear freezes and nuclear build-downs at levels far above those \nstipulated in START II. Now the United States and Russia are truly \nreducing their nuclear stockpiles under the START I Treaty that went \ninto force in December 1994 and we will reduce far further under START \nII. Land-based multiple warhead missiles, the most destablizing weapon \nof the cold war, will be eliminated. Arsenals in both sides will be \nreduced to 3,500 warheads and bombs. Far more of the strategic nuclear \nthreat will be eliminated by this arms control agreement than anyone \never contemplated countering through missile defenses, even at the \nheight of the exaggerated claims of the SDI program. President Bush was \nright to be proud of this treaty and his role in negotiating it.\n\n  Mr. President, today's action will allow Vice President Gore to press \nPrime Minister Chernomyrdin next week to accelerate the Duma's \nconsideration of the treaty. Newly appointed Foreign Minister Primakov \nhas said that the Duma would await Senate action on the treaty. Now \nthey not need wait any longer. I hope that they will complete their \ndeliberations promptly.\n  As the President pointed out in his State of the Union message the \nother night, this could be the year in which truly significant strides \nare made in arms control and in defining a safer, more stable world. I \nhope that our action today will be followed by a similar overwhelming \nvote by this body on ratifying the Chemical Weapons Convention in the \nspring and by conclusion of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty among the \nnuclear weapon states by summer.\n  If all that is accomplished and then fully implemented, our children \nand grandchildren will remember 1996 as a watershed year in the post-\ncold-war era. And these accomplishments, if they can be achieved, will \nbe remembered far longer, I suspect, than anything that comes out of \nthe endless budget debate in which we have been engaged.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, the Senate is debating whether to give \nits consent to a treaty between the United States and the Russian \nFederation that will significantly reduce the number of strategic \nnuclear weapons on each side. This is a solemn responsibility that our \nConstitution vests in the Senate, and nobody in this body undertakes \nthis task lightly.\n  The Senate has taken nearly 3 years to consider this agreement, which \nwas transmitted to us in the last days of the Bush administration. Both \nthe Foreign Relations Committee and the Armed Services Committee have \nconducted hearings on the treaty and have carefully reviewed its \nprovisions. We have heard from negotiators, foreign policy experts, \nmilitary officers, and many other analysts. We have heard many \nthoughtful arguments pro and con.\n  Based on that record, I believe implementation of the second \nStrategic Arms Reduction Treaty [START II] is strongly in the national \ninterest of the United States. This treaty, if implemented, will \nrepresent, in the words of President Bush, ``a watershed in our efforts \nto stabilize the nuclear balance and further reduce strategic offensive \narms.''\n  Let me be clear that the START II agreement, while important, leaves \nunresolved many difficult aspects of the cold war's nuclear legacy. We \nmust find ways to secure and, ultimately, to destroy the fissile \nmaterial from the dismantled arsenals of the United States and former \nSoviet Union. We must prevent proliferation both of nuclear materials \nand of delivery systems. We must pay the environmental price of \ncleaning up weapons sites.\n  Above all, we must continue to adapt our defense and national \nsecurity strategies to our times and to strengthen the relationship \nbetween ourselves and the Russians: We must ensure that those nuclear \nweapons that do remain on both sides will never be used.\n  All of these difficult tasks lie outside the limited reach of the \nSTART II Treaty. But this treaty will meet one decade-old problem head \non. It will significantly reduce the number of nuclear warheads on the \nEurasian land mass that are capable of striking the United States. For \nthat reason, I support it.\n  The cold war is over, but the task of safely destroying much of the \nbloated nuclear arsenals of the former Soviet Union and the United \nStates has yet to be completed. The START II Treaty, which entered into \nforce 1 year ago in December, takes us in that direction. Already we \nhave begun to see its results. In October, in a ceremony broadcast by \nmany television news programs, Defense Secretary Perry and the Russian \nDefense Minister traveled to Whiteman Air Force Base near Kansas City \nto watch the destruction of United States intercontinental ballistic \nmissile in accordance with START I, and Secretary Perry has attended a \nsimilar ceremony in the former Soviet Union.\n  But START I alone is not enough. START II will carry on the \nunfinished business of dismantling the cold war's legacy of terror and \nstrategic nuclear instability.\n  Several of my colleagues have outlined in detail the treaty's \nrequirements. In sum, I believe it is fair to say that START II serves \nAmerica's national security interests in two basic ways.\n  First, it would cap at 3,500 the number of accountable nuclear \nwarheads that each side may possess. The START I limit is 6,000 \nwarheads on each side, and that agreement is not yet fully implemented. \nIn practical terms, implementing START II means \n\n[[Page S477]]\nthe Russians will have to destroy roughly 4,000 nuclear weapons that \ntoday are in their arsenal.\n  I, for one, believe that even START II will not complete the \nimportant work of nuclear arms control, and I would hope the \nadministration will vigorously explore the option of pursuing a third \nstrategic arms treaty to reduce further the allowable number of \nwarheads and to include not only the United States and Russia but the \nother nuclear powers as well.\n  Second, the START II Treaty would prohibit the use of multiple \nwarheads [MIRV's] on missiles. The United States long has sought this \nimportant goal, which is key to a stable nuclear balance.\n  I commend the majority leader, Senator Dole, for his decision to \nbring this important treaty before the Senate. Of course, the process \nof putting this agreement into force does not stop with the U.S. \nSenate. The treaty also must be approved by both houses of the Russian \nlegislature. Significant political changes are underway in Russia, \nparticularly in light of December's parliamentary elections and the \ncoming Presidential election. It would be unfortunate, indeed, if this \nimportant agreement became entangled in Russia's internal political \ndebates.\n  For that reason, I believe the Senate must send a strong message of \nsupport. We must make clear that the United States is strongly \ncommitted to reducing our nuclear arsenal in the responsible manner \noutlined by START II as long as the Russians will do the same. I urge \nmy colleagues to vote in favor of the resolution of ratification.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the vote that will occur later this \nafternoon on the resolution of ratification for the START II Treaty is \na truly historical event in the course of man's attempt to curtail \nconflict and violence and resolve differences by peaceful means. It is \nan especially historical event in the much briefer but arguably more \nfrightful history of the world's effort to prevent use in anger of the \nterrifying power of nuclear fission and fusion, power that was \ninitially unleashed only five decades ago.\n  When the Senate took up this this treaty on the floor on December 22, \nI spoke at some length concerning the potential benefits of this treaty \nfor the United States, Russia, and, indeed, the entire world. I spoke \nof the great leap forward that this treaty represents as it is added to \nthe foundation of earlier arms control agreements, notably including \nthe original START Treaty signed by the United States and the Russian \nFederation in 1991 that provided for the first real reductions, rather \nthan just limits on further growth, of strategic offensive arms of both \nnations. The leap forward that START II represents will increase the \nstability of the nuclear balance, ban deployment of the most \ndestabilizing type of nuclear weapons system--land-based \nintercontinental ballistic missiles with multiple independently \ntargetable nuclear warheads [or MIRVs], and reduce the number of \nnuclear weapons the United States and Russia each possess to 3,500.\n  The debate on December 22 is a part of the Record, and lays out \nclearly the history of this treaty, its importance to enhancing \nstability and reducing the likelihood of use of nuclear weapons in \nanger, and the specific provisions of the treaty. This information is \ncontained in the remarks of the distinguished Senator from Indiana [Mr. \nLugar] who served with distinction as a former chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, the remarks of the distinguished ranking member of \nthe Committee, Mr. Pell, who also served admirably as a previous \nchairman of the committee, and my remarks and those of the other \nSenators who participated in that debate. It is not necessary to take \nthe time of the Senate today to repeat or embellish those remarks. The \ntreaty's record is clear. Its benefits are clear. It will pass \noverwhelmingly this afternoon.\n  I am gratified that I was able to play a role in bringing us to this \npoint by reaching an agreement with the chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, Mr. Helms to release for Senate floor action the \ntreaty, which he was holding hostage until he could obtain floor action \non the annual reauthorization bill for the State Department and its \nactivities which he chose to use as a vehicle for provisions to \ndramatically reduce the structure of, and funding for, the agencies \nthat implement our Nation's foreign policy and represent the U.S. \ninterests to the rest of the world. The START II Treaty was and is too \nimportant to have been used in such a manner. While it should have been \npossible for the Senate to act on it much earlier than today, I am \nrelieved that at least our action was not delayed beyond today, and am \npleased to have played a role in liberating it so the Senate can give \nit ringing endorsement.\n  Once again, Mr. President, I compliment Senator Lugar, Senator Pell, \nand all other Senators who have labored through the analytical and \nhearing processes to demonstrate conclusively that START II will \nsignificantly benefit the United States. I am fervently hopeful that \nthe Russian Duma will act expeditiously and favorably on the treaty, \nsharing our recognition that it is strongly in the best interests of \nboth nations, and that we do not discover that the delay in Senate \nconsideration, during which Russia has experienced considerable \npolitical flux and has elected a number of new members to the Duma, has \nfatally injured the treaty. The treaty's ability to increase stability \nand reduce the risk of nuclear conflict will be even more important to \nthe extent Russia's political unrest continues or accelerates.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, Although I have reservations concerning \nthe START II Treaty, I intend to support the resolution of ratification \nreported from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Many of my \nconcerns have been addressed in the package of amendments the Senate \nadopted on December 22, 1995, which were drafted by the Arms Control \nObserver Group.\n  In addition to a number of hearings held by the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee conducted two hearings on the \nmilitary and national security implications of ratification of START \nII.\n  The START II Treaty, signed by Presidents Bush and Yeltsin in January \n1993, will hopefully contribute to the positive change in the \nrelationship between the United States and the States of the former \nSoviet Union. If ratified and implemented by the United States and the \nRussian Federation, START II will represent a continuation of the \nunprecedented reduction of the strategic arsenals of both sides. But we \nmust always keep in mind that reductions for the sake of reductions do \nnot necessarily contribute to stability. Unless these reductions \ncontribute to strategic stability, they can actually undermine our \nnational security. If START II is implemented and complied with, I do \nbelieve that it will be stabilizing. If, however, its terms are \nmodified to allow, for example, the retention of heavy, multiple-\nwarhead ICBM's, then this agreement could actually be destabilizing. As \nI stated back in 1992, when the committee considered the military \nimplications of ratifying START I, I believe that stabilizing \nreductions in nuclear weapons are in the best interest of this Nation \nand humanity.\n  Whether START II will contribute to or undermine stability will also \nbe determined by other factors. For example, the United States must \nfully exercise its rights to maintain a survivable and reliable \nstrategic deterrent force. In my view, we must also begin to rethink \nthe basic concepts underlying deterrence. As the sides reduce their \nforces below START I levels, we must be concerned about the long-term \nsurvivability of the force in an offense-only configuration. In my \nview, we must begin to modify our strategic policy to incorporate a \nmore balanced mix of strategic offensive and strategic defensive \nforces. In the long run, as the cold war confrontation fades, we may \neven make a complete change to a defense dominant posture.\n  The long-term value of START II also depends on the sides' complying \nwith its terms. In this regard, there is reason for concern. Russia has \ncontinued, to a very disturbing degree, the Soviet pattern of violating \nor circumventing the terms of various arms control agreements. Russia's \nfailure to implement the agreements reached at last May's summit \nmeeting is yet another reason for concern.\n  If ratified, fully implemented, and complied with, START II will \nachieve three principal objectives: First, the \n\n[[Page S478]]\nreduction of strategic nuclear warheads to a level at or below 3,500--\nmore than a two-third reduction over current levels; second, ban the \ndeployment of multiple-warhead intercontinental ballistic missiles; and \nthird, obligate Russia to destroy all its SS-18 heavy ICBM's and to \ndestroy or convert all its silo launchers for these missiles. If this \nlast objective is not achieved, however, the stabilizing impact of \nSTART II will be seriously eroded.\n  During the Armed Services Committee's consideration of the military \nimplications of ratification of START II, I raised a number of \nconcerns, including concern about whether Russia would ratify the \ntreaty with amendments that would allow them to keep their MIRVd ICBMs, \nin particular the SS-18's. I was also concerned by administration \nefforts to unilaterally implement START II reductions prior to Russian \nratification of START II. To date, Russia has not ratified START II, \nand I am not sure when it will. Until this happens and it is clear that \nSTART II will be implemented by both sides, I do not believe that the \nUnited States should take any irreversible actions to go below START I \nlevels.\n  In September 1994, the administration concluded a review of U.S. \nnuclear policy and its nuclear force posture to determine the \nappropriate strategic nuclear force for the United States in the year \n2003, when START II limits are supposed to be reached. The nuclear \nposture review [NPR] concluded that the United States would continue to \nrely on a ``Triad'' of strategic nuclear forces and a policy of nuclear \ndeterrence to deter any future hostile foreign leadership with access \nto strategic nuclear weapons, and as a hedge against a reversal in \npolitical reforms in Russia, which made START II possible in the first \nplace.\n  In essence, the Nuclear Posture Review recommended that the United \nStates continue to maintain its nuclear triad, that it would maintain \nits mix of land, air and sea-based strategic nuclear delivery systems--\nwhile reducing the number of warheads to bring the U.S. into compliance \nwith START II provisions. However, that recommended level would be \nbelow the level authorized under START II.\n  In addition to 20 B-2 bombers and 450-500 single warhead Minuteman \nIII ICBMs, the NPR recommended that the U.S. triad include 14 Trident \nballistic missile submarines versus 18 permitted under START II, and 66 \nB-52H bombers versus 94 permitted under START II. The NPR also directed \nDoD and DoE to maintain a nuclear weapons capability without \nunderground nuclear testing and without producing fissile material. In \norder to accomplish this requirement, the NPR directed that a number of \nactions take place: development of a stockpile surveillance engineering \nbase; and the maintenance of capabilities that include the ability to \nrefabricate and certify weapons types, design, fabricate and certify \nnew nuclear warheads (if necessary), and maintenance and support of a \nscience and technology base.\n  Mr. President, given budget constraints, I remain concerned about the \nability of the United States to maintain an adequate strategic nuclear \nforce that would enable us to deter a nuclear attack. With regard to \nthe future nuclear stockpile, I am concerned about the ability of DoD \nand DoE to meet its supply responsibilities. Quite frankly, I do not \nsee how they will maintain the stockpile without underground nuclear \ntesting.\n  As directed by the Nuclear Posture Review, the United States will \ncontinue to require and depend on its strategic forces for the \nforeseeable future to deter a broad range of threats. In order to do \nthis, we will have to move away from an offense-only policy of \ndeterrence, which will require the United States to work cooperatively \nwith Russia.\n  As I stated during the Committee's hearing on May 6, we must move \nbeyond the mindset of the ABM Treaty that equates vulnerability with \nstability. If we are to continue reducing our strategic nuclear \nforces--which is already the subject of interagency discussions--we \nmust integrate defense into our deterrence policy and break the linkage \nbetween such reductions and the ABM Treaty.\n  I have been troubled by the Administration's careless linkage of \nSTART II with U.S. missile defense programs and the ABM Treaty. \nAlthough I certainly agree that there is a relationship between \nstrategic offensive forces and strategic defensive forces, I believe \nthat the Administration is dangerously misguided in its \ncharacterization of this relationship. Not only is ballistic missile \ndefense not a threat to deterrence and strategic arms control; it is \ncomplimentary and may even be essential if we proceed with further \nreductions. There is no reason why the United States and Russia cannot \nagree on a stabilizing plan to transition from Mutual Assured \nDestruction, which is fundamentally still our unstated policy, to a \nworld of assured security through defensive deployments.\n  We must come to terms with the fact that the ABM Treaty is outdated \nand must be revised and eventually replaced. By constantly reinforcing \nthe mutual vulnerability logic that underlies the ABM Treaty, this \nAdministration has simultaneously reinforced those in Russia who are \nmost insistent on maintaining their destabilizing strategic offensive \nforces. Rather than trying to hold on to the Cold War relationship, the \nAdministration should attempt to nurture U.S.-Russian cooperation in \nthe area of missile defense and defensive stability.\n  Before closing, I would like to amplify for purpose of this debate, \nmy deep concern about actions taken by the Administration in the \nvarious arms control consultative commissions.\n  The role of the consultative commissions is to enable implementation \nof arms control treaties. The consultative commissions are to provide a \nforum for the parties to make technical and administrative changes to \nthe Treaty so that the provisions of the Treaty can be implemented. Or, \nif there is a disagreement, to provide a forum for the parties to \ndiscuss compliance questions.\n  However, over the past couple of years, the Administration has used \nthe consultative commissions of a number of Treaties, such as the \nIntermediate Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, the Conventional Forces \nin Europe (CFE) Treaty, and START, to make a number of changes that I \nwould define as more than just technical or administrative changes. In \nfact, I view these changes as substantive in nature, modifying the \nTreaties in a way which changes the original understanding under which \nthe Senate provided its advice and consent.\n  The defense budget funds most of the costs of implementing arms \ncontrol treaties, and as a result, to the extent it can, the Armed \nServices Committee has been monitoring these actions. As a result of \nsome of these actions, the Committee has included language in the \nstatement of managers for the defense authorization bills since 1993, \nrequiring the Department of Defense to report to the Congress 30 days \nin advance of any agreement that would result in an increase in the \ncosts of implementing the arms control agreements. DoD and \nadministration efforts to inform the Congress prior to concluding these \nagreements, as well as recommending these changes, have been erratic at \nbest.\n  It is my view that the President should notify the Congress 30 days \nin advance of concluding an agreement in the consultative commission, \nany change to interpretations of provisions, or implementation \nmodifications and obligations that result in increases to \nimplementation costs, or differ from the Senate's understanding when it \nprovided its advice and consent to ratification of the Treaty. As an \nexample of what I am referring to, let me ask unanimous consent that a \ncopies of two September 1994 letters regarding a policy agreement on \nimplementation of inspections under START, from the Secretary of \nDefense be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. President, even though I have concerns about a number of issues, \nas I stated earlier, with the inclusion of the Arms Control Observer \nGroup amendments, I will support START II.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               September 21, 1994.\n     Hon. Sam Nunn,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to inform the Committee \n     concerning an important issue that has arisen as we prepare \n     for the implementation of the 1991 START Treaty in the new, \n     multilateral context that has followed the breakup of the \n     Soviet Union.\n     \n[[Page S479]]\n\n       The START Treaty, like the INF Treaty before it, provides \n     for certain inspection costs to be borne by the inspected \n     Party. This was based on the assumption that the U.S. and the \n     Soviet Union would conduct extensive inspections of each \n     other's territory, whereby one side's inspection costs would \n     be offset by the other party's inspection costs. This was \n     done with the expectation that there would be an essential \n     balance between the START inspections conducted by the two \n     sides.\n       After the breakup of the Soviet Union, however, Belarus, \n     Kazakhstan and Ukraine proposed in the START Treaty's Joint \n     Compliance and Inspection Commission (JCIC) to have these \n     inspection costs shifted to the inspecting Party. Given that \n     they had little, if any, interest in inspecting U.S. \n     facilities, they believed that such a change would be fair \n     and appropriate, whereas the U.S. intended to carry out fully \n     its inspection rights on their territories. They were \n     concerned, therefore, that START cost provisions would impose \n     on them an unbalanced cost burden.\n       In the JCIC, the U.S. side has refused to shift these \n     costs. We have emphasized that we did not want any changes to \n     the Treaty's obligations. Russia likewise has refused this \n     proposal in the JCIC. Since Russia intends to carry out \n     extensive inspections of U.S. facilities, Russia, too, wanted \n     no change in these obligations.\n       The approach that we are developing in the JCIC in order to \n     resolve this issue in the START context is similar to the \n     understanding that was worked out in the Special Verification \n     Commission (SVC) for the INF Treaty, which is the subject of \n     a separate letter to you. Under this approach, which is \n     consistent with the Treaty and the interests of the United \n     States, each inspected Party will be responsible for \n     inspection costs. However, for each six-month period in which \n     Belarus, Kazakhstan or Ukraine chooses not to exercise its \n     right to notify and conduct inspections of U.S. facilities \n     under START, the U.S. will, as a matter of policy, reimburse \n     certain costs for supporting U.S. inspections conducted on \n     that Party's territory during the same period. These costs \n     would be reimbursed using funds appropriated to the \n     Department of Defense for treaty implementation purposes. If, \n     however, one of those Parties notifies and conducts an \n     inspection of a U.S. facility, thereby incurring host nation \n     costs for the United States (aside from one initial multi-\n     party baseline inspection), the U.S. will not provide \n     reimbursement for any of its inspections on that Party's \n     territory during the given six-month period.\n       This understanding will be reflected in an exchange of \n     policy statements between the U.S. and each of these three \n     Parties. We believe this represents an equitable solution \n     that serves the interests of all five START Parties, both \n     those (the U.S. and Russia) planning to make full use of \n     their inspection rights and those (Belarus, Kazakhstan and \n     Ukraine) that do not intend to do so.\n       During the START Treaty's four-month period for baseline \n     inspections following entry into force of the Treaty, \n     seventeen inspections (four in Belarus, four in Kazakhstan, \n     and nine in Ukraine) would be required. Following the \n     baseline period, the United States probably would conduct a \n     total of between nine to thirteen inspections per year in \n     Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine. OSIA estimates that future \n     START Treaty inspections would run at most about $10,000.00 \n     per inspection.\n       I want to emphasize that the exchange of policy statements \n     is strictly a policy understanding. It will not be legally \n     binding and no Treaty provision will be changed. The terms of \n     the START Treaty will have their full force and effect, and \n     each of these three Parties will have to carry out all of its \n     Treaty obligations. This understanding will bring no change \n     in the implementation of the START Treaty, which will be \n     carried out in full accordance with the advice and consent \n     already provided by the Senate. The Administration would not \n     consider this to be a precedent for any other area of START \n     implementation.\n       We attach considerable importance and urgency to the need \n     to conclude this policy understanding with Belarus, \n     Kazakhstan and Ukraine. With the prospect of START entry into \n     force possibly occurring this fall, the priority objective of \n     the United States at the coming session of the JCIC is to \n     reach agreement among the five START Parties on all advance \n     preparations needed to ensure that START enters into force \n     smoothly and is carried out effectively. Reaching this \n     understanding on reimbursements with Belarus, Kazakhstan \n     and Ukraine will be essential to the achievement of this \n     overriding U.S. objective.\n       I want to assure you that we will continue to keep the \n     Committee informed of key developments affecting START \n     implementation.\n           Sincerely,\n     William J. Perry.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                     The Secretary of Defense,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 21, 1994.\n     Hon. Sam Nunn,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to bring the Committee up \n     to date on an important issue that we have encountered in \n     seeking to preserve and implement the 1987 Intermediate \n     Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty in the new, multilateral context \n     that has followed the breakup of the Soviet Union.\n       As you are aware, the INF Treaty provides for certain \n     inspection costs to be borne by the inspected Party. This was \n     based on the assumption that the U.S. and the Soviet Union \n     would conduct extensive inspections of each other's \n     facilities, whereby one side's inspection costs would be \n     offset by the other party's inspection costs. The inspection \n     regime of the START Treaty was also based on this same \n     premise, namely, that there would be an essential balance \n     between the inspections conducted by the two sides.\n       After the breakup of the Soviet Union, the United States \n     took steps to ensure that the twelve states of the former \n     Soviet Union would be bound by the prohibitions of the Treaty \n     and that the INF inspection regime would continue. Moreover, \n     the successor states themselves, meeting at Bishkek on \n     October 9, 1992, also made their own declaration expressing \n     their commitment to the Treaty.\n       Of the four key successor states whose cooperation is \n     required to ensure the continued implementation of the INF \n     inspection regime, three of them, Belarus, Kazakhstan and the \n     Ukraine proposed, in the INF Treaty Special Verification \n     Commission (SVC), the forum for dealing with compliance and \n     implementation issues, to have these inspection costs shifted \n     to the inspecting Party. Given that they had little, if any, \n     interest in inspecting U.S. facilities, they believed that \n     such a change would be fair and appropriate, whereas the U.S. \n     intended to carry out fully its inspection rights on their \n     territories. They were concerned that INF cost provisions \n     impose on them an unbalanced cost burden. Indeed, Belarus, \n     Ukraine and Kazakhstan have not conducted a single inspection \n     of the United States' facilities since the demise of the \n     Soviet Union.\n       The U.S. refused to shift these costs, making it clear that \n     the United States did not want to change the Treaty's \n     obligations. Russia likewise refused this proposal. Since \n     Russia intended to carry out extensive inspections of U.S. \n     facilities, Russia, too, wanted no change in these Treaty \n     obligations.\n       This impasse was one of the factors behind the initial \n     delays in the U.S. being able to carry out its INF Treaty \n     inspection rights in Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine after \n     the breakup of the Soviet Union. To resolve the issue, we \n     have worked out with each of these three Parties in the SVC \n     an understanding consistent with the Treaty and the interests \n     of the United States. Each inspected Party will bear the \n     costs of each inspection. However, for each six-month period \n     in which Belarus, Kazakhstan or Ukraine, as a matter of \n     policy, does not exercise its right to notify and conduct \n     inspections of U.S. facilities, the U.S., as a matter of \n     policy, will reimburse certain costs for supporting U.S. \n     inspections conducted on their territory during that period. \n     These costs would be reimbursed using funds appropriated to \n     the Department of Defense for treaty implementation purposes. \n     If, however, one of those Parties notifies and conducts an \n     inspection of U.S. facilities, thereby incurring costs for \n     the U.S., the U.S. will not provide reimbursement for any of \n     its inspections on that Party's territory during the given \n     six-month period.\n       This INF understanding was reflected in an exchange of \n     policy statements between the U.S. and each of these three \n     Parties intended to cover the remaining period of the INF \n     inspection regime, through May 31, 2001. We believe this \n     represents an equitable solution that serves the interests of \n     all five Parties, both those (the U.S. and Russia) planning \n     to make full use of their inspection rights and those \n     (Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine) that do not intend to do \n     so. I want to emphasize that these policy statements are not \n     legally binding and that no Treaty obligations are being \n     changed. The terms of the Treaty remain in full force and \n     effect, and each of these three Parties must carry out all of \n     its Treaty obligations. There is no change in the \n     implementation of the Treaty regime, which is being carried \n     out in full accordance with the advice and consent provided \n     by the Senate in 1988. The Administration would not consider \n     this to be a precedent for any other area of Treaty \n     implementation.\n       Following the exchange of policy statements, the U.S. was \n     able to resume its conduct of INF inspections on the \n     territories of the three Parties. We recently suspended such \n     inspections in order to consult with key Congressional \n     Committees on this matter.\n       The United States has conducted seven INF inspections in \n     Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine. The costs for these \n     inspections was about $4,000.00 for each inspection. The \n     United States intends, in any given year, to conduct seven \n     total inspections in the combined territories of Belarus, \n     Kazakhstan, and Ukraine. OSIA estimates that future \n     inspections would run at most about $10,000.00 per \n     inspection.\n       We place considerable importance on continuing U.S. INF \n     inspection activity in Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine. Full \n     implementation of U.S. Treaty rights in these three key \n     successor states is essential not only to the preservation of \n     the INF inspection regime, but also in establishing the basis \n     for the effective implementation of the START Treaty with \n     these states.\n       Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine also have proposed, in the \n     START Treaty Joint Compliance and Inspection Commission \n     (JCIC), a similar understanding for the START Treaty, which--\n     as in INF--would not be legally binding and would leave all \n     Treaty \n\n[[Page S480]]\n     obligations fully in force. The U.S. side wishes to exchange such START \n     policy statements in the JCIC so as to be prepared for entry \n     into force of the START Treaty in the near future. We will \n     provide to you a separate letter describing the understanding \n     that is under consideration for START.\n       Let me assure you that we will continue to keep the \n     Committee informed of key developments in both INF and START \n     implementation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 William J. Perry.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, the Senate is about to vote on the START II \nTreaty. START II is an example of the bipartisan way in which foreign \nand defense policy should be conducted. President Bush negotiated it \nand President Clinton is seeking the Senate's advise and consent.\n  In response to those who are now saying that the Senate is rushing \ninto giving its advice and consent to this treaty, I would point out \nthat this treaty came to the floor and is being considered under the \nprovisions of several unanimous consent agreements reached over the \ncourse of the past 2 months.\n  The Senate arms control observer group worked on a package of \nconditions and declarations to the resolution of ratification which \nwere agreed to prior to Christmas. These conditions and declarations \nwill not require any changes to the START II Treaty, however, they are \nthe binding terms under which the Senate gives its advice and consent \nto this treaty.\n  START II has received widespread bipartisan support because, if \nfaithfully implemented by both the United States and Russia, it is in \nthe United States interest. The treaty provides for further reductions \nin United States and Russian missiles and warheads. These reductions \nwill be stabilizing because the treaty also, and most importantly, \nprovides for the de-MIRVing of land-based missiles and the elimination \nof heavy ICBM's such as the Russian SS-18. These were U.S. arms control \nobjectives throughout the Reagan and Bush administrations. \nUnquestionably, de-mirving and eliminating heavy ICBM's are the \nprincipal benefits of START II.\n\n  We must keep in mind, Mr. President, that the Russian Federation must \nstill take a number of actions to make the START II Treaty a reality. \nFirst, the Russian Duma must offer its consent to ratification. The \nprospects for such action are more uncertain after the recent \nelections--since Communists and extreme nationalists now represent more \nthan a third of the Duma. Furthermore, the Russians and the Clinton \nadministration must firmly commit not to backtrack on START II \nprovisions. There is already talk of alleviating some of START II's \nburden on Russia in a follow on agreement. We will need to carefully \nwatch out for the so-called nuclear summit next spring and its possible \nresults.\n  Mr. President, I would like to comment on the conditions \nand declarations to the resolution of ratification unanimously agreed \nto by the Senate on December 22. These address the strategic \nenvironment in which this treaty will operate and which it will help \nshape.\n\n  The fact is that the strategic environment has changed since \nPresident Bush negotiated START II. In particular, the threat of the \nproliferation of ballistic missiles has sharply escalated. When, on \nJune 17, 1992, Presidents Bush and Yeltsin agreed upon the foundations \nfor START II, they also issued a joint statement on a global protection \nsystem endorsing United States-Russian cooperation on missile defenses. \nSince the beginning of the Clinton administration, however, talks on \nthis idea have lapsed and our National Missile Defense Program has \nlanguished.\n  Today, I would urge President Clinton once again to resume these \ndiscussions with Russia on cooperation on defenses. Let us recall that \nit was President Yeltsin who called for such cooperation in his January \n29, 1992 speech to the United Nations. Let us see what might be \npossible, while recognizing that talking does not give Moscow a veto \nover our programs.\n  The Congress provided clear direction and substantial additional \nfunding for missile defense programs. Unfortunately, President Clinton \nvetoed the defense authorization bill the first time around, precisely \nbecause it set out a course toward providing a national missile defense \nsystem.\n\n  In my view--with Russian cooperation or without--it is high time to \nmove forward on a missile defense system which protects America--from \nAlaska to Florida, and Hawaii to Maine. Included in the package of \namendments we have adopted is a declaration which states that missile \ndefenses are necessary and complementary to START II reductions.\n  And so, as we give advice and consent to the START II Treaty we must \nbe crystal clear: our vote in favor of START II is not in any way a \nreaffirmation of the ABM Treaty. Conversely--for those who would argue \nthat the Senate should not give its advice and consent to the START II \nTreaty--withholding our consent to START II does not in any way affect \nthe terms of the ABM Treaty or how the administration applies these \nterms.\n  One of the binding conditions the Senate has approved unequivocally \nstates that nothing we do here in any way alters our rights and \nobligations under the ABM Treaty. In other words, we can propose \nchanges to the ABM Treaty or, if necessary, withdraw from the \nABM Treaty in order to defend America.\n\n  There are a few other pieces of the bigger picture we must keep in \nmind, including political developments in Russia. The amendment I \noffered--which was included in the manager's package--is a condition to \nthe resolution of ratification which stipulates that the United States \nwill not be legally bound by the START II Treaty if the Russian \nFederation does not ratify it. Furthermore, the condition requires the \nPresident to consult with the Senate if he decides to make reductions \nin our strategic forces below those currently planned. In that event he \nmust also certify that such reductions are in the U.S. national \nsecurity interest.\n  With respect to concerns about treaty compliance, it is no secret \nthat Russian generals and politicians are saying openly and privately \nthat they will not implement the START II Treaty if ratified. Let us \nnot forget that the track record of compliance of the former Soviet \nUnion and Russia is seriously marred.\n  The Soviet Union claimed to hold the ABM Treaty sacrosanct, but, \nwantonly violated it. For a long time, we have been worried about \nSoviet and Russian violations of the biological weapons convention. \nAnd, at present, Russia is in violation of the Conventional Forces in \nEurope [CFE] Treaty. One of the declarations to the resolution of \nratification addresses the concern of potential violations to START II \nand requires the administration to brief and report regularly on \nRussian compliance with START II.\n  Finally, we can reduce our missiles and nuclear weapons to START II \nlevels. But we need to preserve the reliability, safety and security of \nthe strategic weapons we retain. The United States needs to develop a \nnew post cold war nuclear doctrine in this era where we are faced with \nmultiple threats from different regimes. It may be time to update our \naging nuclear force with new weapons designs.\n  The Clinton administration is dismantling our nuclear weapons \ninfrastructure and driving us toward a comprehensive test ban. \nMeanwhile, Russia is spending scarce resources on strategic \nmodernization and updating its nuclear doctrine to include potential \nuse against former Soviet States. I am pleased that one of the \ndeclarations included in the resolution of ratification speaks to the \nneed to ensure the safety, reliability, and performance of our nuclear \nforces--which are and will remain, the cornerstone of our deterrent.\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to remind my colleagues that it was the \nBush administration which negotiated START II. And START II, like the \nfirst start treaty, was an outgrowth of the strategic arms reduction \ngoals set by the Reagan administration. But, strategic arms control--\nunder both the Bush and Reagan administrations was part of a smart, \njudicious and comprehensive approach to our national security--not the \ncenterpiece of U.S. national security policy. Since the Clinton \nadministration came to office, there has been an overreliance on \narms control and a penchant for clinging to outdated cold war era \nthinking.\n\n  Mr. President, I am amazed at this administration, as well as some of \nmy colleagues, and Moscow for their willingness to link the START II \nTreaty with the antiquated and hopelessly \n\n[[Page S481]]\noutdated Anti-Ballistic Missile [ABM] Treaty. Missile defense for \nAmerica must be priority one at a time when ballistic and cruise \nmissiles are coming into the possession of more and more countries. \nAccording to the Central Intelligence Agency, the North Koreans are \ncurrently working on a missile that will be able to hit Alaska and \nHawaii. Iran, India, and others are also working on their own programs. \nMissile defense is not a threat to the Russians. It offers protection \nto us--and potentially to the Russians--during a time when the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction is escalating.\n  Mr. President, I support START II. However, the Clinton \nadministration and Moscow must not backtrack on de-MIRVing missiles and \ngetting rid of the heavy SS-18's. The Clinton administration must also \nsupport the restoration of our aging nuclear infrastructure--almost \ntwo-thirds of which dates from before the mid-1970's. The President \nmust also seek the strictest compliance from a Russia which is \nchanging--and given the Duma elections, not for the better. Especially \nin light of the recent Russian elections, we must safeguard at all \ncosts against unilateral U.S. implementation of START II. Furthermore, \nI urge the Clinton administration to join the Senate to reiterate--\nloudly and clearly--the traditional U.S. position: START II and the ABM \nTreaty are in no way linked. START II is a good treaty for us and \nMoscow, but it should not--and must not--be used to keep us from \npursuing a national missile defense system.\n\n  Mr. President, notwithstanding the reservations, I think the Senate \ndid the right thing this evening in overwhelmingly ratifying the START \nII Treaty.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first I just want to compliment Senator \nDole, the majority leader, for his support of START II. As he pointed \nout, this was negotiated and supported by three Presidents, two \nRepublicans and one Democrat. The majority leader's support of this \ntreaty, bringing it forward in the way he has in the great bipartisan \ntradition of the U.S. Senate. I just want to add my thanks to him for \nhis work in this area.\n  Mr. President, the START II Treaty is overwhelming in our national \ninterest. It deserves our full and strong support. It will require the \nreduction of thousands of nuclear weapons that could otherwise pose a \nthreat to our security. It will eliminate the most destabilizing \nweapons. There is a military threat more fearsome than nuclear weapons. \nThey alone have the capability to destroy entire cities and to cause \nunparalleled destruction of anything in their path.\n  The prospects of a nuclear war are so terrifying that they are hard \nto imagine. That is why every President since President Truman has made \nit one of the Nation's highest priorities to control nuclear weapons \nand to prevent nuclear war. We came frighteningly close during the \nCuban Missile Crisis to using nuclear weapons. There have been several \nnuclear crises since.\n  That is why Defense Secretary Bill Perry, in testimony before the \nForeign Relations Committee last March, quoted Andrei Sakharov saying:\n\n       Reducing the risk of annihilating humanity in a nuclear war \n     carries an absolute priority over all other considerations.\n\n  Probably the best way to reduce the likelihood of nuclear war is to \nreduce nuclear weapons below the excessive levels of the cold war, \nparticularly those systems that made the United States and the Soviet \nUnion most insecure. Secretary Perry agreed with Sakharov's assessment \nand noted that the START II Treaty is about reducing the risk of \nnuclear war.\n  The START II Treaty that is before us achieves what no other arms \nagreement has: It will eliminate all multiple warhead land-based \nmissiles, known as MIRV missiles for their multiple independently \ntargetable reentry vehicles. It will eliminate all of the Russian heavy \nSS-18 intercontinental ballistic missiles, the ICBM's that have \nparticularly concerned our defense officials for so long.\n  Those systems, those heavy SS-18 intercontinental ballistic missiles, \nthose MIRV, multiple warhead missiles are considered to be \ndestabilizing and caused deep concern that in a crisis it would create \npressures to use nuclear weapons, and to use them first. Eliminating \nthese weapons is considered the most important single achievement of \nthe treaty.\n\n  Mr. President, I know that this treaty has broad and indeed vast \nsupport in this Senate, but we should not forget the historic nature of \ntoday's vote.\n  This treaty was worked on for long periods of time, by Presidents \nReagan and Bush, and then strongly supported by President Clinton. This \nis a historic day in the ratification of this treaty and should not go \nunnoticed because the Senate was so busily occupied in a whole host of \nother important matters.\n  It not only will reduce and remove the most threatening of the \nmissiles and the most destabilizing of the missiles, it also reduces \nthe overall level of deployed long-range warheads to about two-thirds \nbelow the previous cold war levels. It will require the United States \nand Russia each to reduce to a level of some 3,000 to 3,500 nuclear \nweapons instead of the more than 10,000 long-range warheads at the end \nof 1990. This is a dramatic reduction.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to comment briefly about the \nmilitary's strong support for the ratification of the START II Treaty. \nThe senior defense and military officials in this country are \noverwhelmingly supportive of the START II Treaty and for many months \nhave urged us to act as quickly as possible to provide our advice and \nconsent, to ratify the treaty so it can enter into force as soon as \npossible.\n  The overwhelming, unanimous support in the military includes the \nSecretary of Defense, the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs, all of the Chiefs of Staff and their civilian and military \ncolleagues at the Pentagon.\n  This is what General Shalikashvili said now almost a year ago, March \n1 of last year, before the Foreign Relations Committee. He said:\n\n       On the basis of detailed study of our security needs and \n     careful review of the Treaty, it is my judgment, and the \n     unanimous opinion of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that the \n     START II Treaty is in the best interests of the United \n     States. I recommend the Senate provide its advice and consent \n     to START II's ratification.\n\n  Then at the same hearing General Shalikashvili explained his view of \nthe value of START II, in part, in this way:\n\n       As you well know [he said], START II builds on the progress \n     of START I, but goes beyond it, because it will restructure \n     our nuclear forces to eliminate instabilities that have \n     always been matters of great concern to military planners and \n     to our citizens alike. By this [he said], I'm of \n     course referring to the elimination of all land-based \n     missiles with multiple independently targeted re-reentry \n     vehicles, as well as the last of the land-based heavy \n     ICBM's, the Russian SS-18's.\n       As Secretary Perry mentioned, [he went on,] we have always \n     been convinced that these particular systems are \n     intrinsically the most dangerous and unstable elements of our \n     strategic arsenals. Because they are vulnerable to a first \n     strike from the other side, they could impose a use-or-lose \n     decision that would be a very unstable factor in any crisis. \n     Eliminating these systems makes both of our nuclear forces \n     more stable deterrents.\n\n  Finally, he said:\n\n       More specifically, we concluded that the START II/NPR \n     force--\n\n  The force that is left after the START II Treaty--\n\n     is sufficient to prevent any foreseeable enemy from achieving \n     his war aims against us or our allies, not matter how a \n     nuclear attack against us is designed.\n       In practice, this means that our nuclear forces must be \n     robust enough to sustain the ability to support an \n     appropriate targeting strategy and a suitable range of \n     response options, even in the event of a powerful first \n     strike that attempts to disarm our nuclear forces.\n\n  He said in conclusion:\n\n       Our analysis shows that, even under the worst conditions, \n     the START II force levels provide enough survivable forces, \n     and survivable, sustained command and control to accomplish \n     our targeting objectives.\n\n  No matter what the attack is after START II, no matter how an attack \nis designed, it cannot succeed. That is one of the many accomplishments \nof the treaty.\n  Its ratification today will not be noted in much of the media because \nof the huge number of other issues which are being debated in \nWashington, but for us in the U.S. Senate, looking at the ratification \nof a treaty worked so hard upon by three Presidents, it will be a \nbanner day, not just for us, but, more important, for humanity that \nthere has been such a huge reduction approved and that the most \ndestabilizing nuclear weapons which we have \n\n[[Page S482]]\nfaced, which were the subject of years and years and decades of agony \nby President after President facing these forces so destabilizing to \nthe world, that we have taken a major step today in bringing this to \nthe floor for ratification.\n  Now we must hope that the Duma in Russia will do the same, that they \nalso will consent to the ratification of this treaty so that it can \ntake full force and effect.\n  When the Joint Chiefs of Staff try to imagine the worst possible \nmilitary disaster, the worst possible nuclear attack upon the United \nStates and our nuclear forces, they can come up with some horrible \npossibilities. That's their job, and they are consumate professionals. \nThey have no doubt that the START II Treaty will leave us with more \nthan enough nuclear forces to meet our security needs. That, Mr. \nPresident, is very powerful testimony and should erase any doubt that \nSTART II will permit adequate forces.\n  In conclusion, General Shali had this to say:\n\n       When both the United States and Russian strategic nuclear \n     forces are reduced to the levels established by this treaty, \n     our forces will remain roughly equivalent, but without the \n     unstable pockets that have troubled us for decades. This, \n     beyond even the considerable reductions to our nuclear \n     forces, is the beneficial hallmark of this treaty--a security \n     gain that is as positive for the Russians as it is for the \n     Americans.\n       The other members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and I have \n     no reservations towards this treaty, about the strategic \n     force reductions it entails, or about our ability to properly \n     verify that the Russians are complying with its provisions. \n     I, thus, encourage you to promptly give your advice and \n     consent to the ratification of the START II Treaty.\n\n  Mr. President, this is compelling evidence from our Nation's senior \nofficer that the START II Treaty is a good deal for American security. \nFew, if anybody, know more about the military perspective of our \nsecurity requirements than General Shalikash-vili.\n\n\n                START I implementation and relationship\n\n  The START II Treaty is based on the START I Treaty, which was \nnegotiated between the United States and the Soviet Union. After the \nSoviet Union dissolved, START I was expanded to include Ukraine, \nKazakhstan, and Belarus--in addition to Russia--as the new inheritors \nof the nuclear forces of the former Soviet Union.\n  One crucial aspect of this expanded START I process that people \nshould understand is that when the Soviet Union collapsed, it produced, \novernight, four nuclear weapon nations where there was just one before. \nAnd two of those overnight nuclear weapon powers--Ukraine and \nKazakhstan--had larger nuclear arsenals than Britain, France, and China \ncombined. As part of START I, the three newest nuclear weapon states \nsigned the Non-Proliferation Treaty as nonweapon states and pledged to \neliminate all their nuclear weapons and be totally nuclear-free. That \nis a great nonproliferation success story, and those nations are all \nwell on the way to eliminating their nuclear forces, as I will outline \nbelow.\n  The START II Treaty is built upon the START I Treaty, and uses it as \na foundation. START I provides the basic framework for START II, \nincluding definitions, rules, data exchanges, monitoring and inspection \nprovisions, elimination processes, and so on. START I, which entered \ninto force on December 5, 1994, provides a good example of what we can \nexpect under START II, so it is useful to review START I briefly and \nhow its implementation is proceeding.\n  START I was the first arms reduction treaty, that is, it called for \nactual reductions in nuclear forces. It required overall cuts of about \none third in United States and Soviet arsenals, and also calls for a \n50-percent cut in so-called heavy ICBM's, namely the SS-18. START I \nrequires reductions in accountable weapons, that is, numbers agreed \nupon for purposes of the treaty, whether or not they are the real \nnumbers. START I provided for limits on both the ``strategic nuclear \ndelivery vehicles''--otherwise known as land-based and submarine-\nlaunched ballistic missiles and bombers--and for accountable warheads. \nThe treaty required reductions to 1,600 delivery vehicles and 6,000 \nwarheads by the end of a 7-year period of implementation.\n  The reductions must be made according to a schedule of limits in two \nphases before reaching the final limits: Phase I permits no more than \n2,100 delivery vehicles and 9,150 warheads by December 5, 1997; Phase \nII permits no more than 1,900 delivery vehicles and 7,950 warheads by \nDecember 5, 1999. At the time of the data exchange for START I in \nSeptember 1990, the United States had 2,246 strategic delivery vehicles \nand 10,563 warheads, while the Soviet Union had 2,500 delivery vehicles \nand 10,271 START accountable warheads. That is the baseline against \nwhich to measure implementation.\n  In May 1995, Under Secretary of Defense Walter Slocombe testified \nbefore the Armed Services Committee about START I implementation, just \n5 months after the treaty entered into force:\n\n       U.S. implementation of START I continues to proceed \n     smoothly. We have deactivated all of our forces to be \n     eliminated under START I, by removing over 3,900 warheads \n     from ballistic missiles and retiring heavy bombers to \n     elimination facilities. We have already eliminated over 300 \n     missile launchers and over 240 heavy bombers, putting us \n     below the first START I intermediate ceiling that will not \n     come into effect until December 1997.\n\n  Secretary Slocombe also stated that:\n\n       Our START I Treaty partners in the former Soviet Union are \n     also making great strides. Russia has moved rapidly on \n     launcher eliminations. Like the United States, the former \n     Soviet Union has already met the first intermediate ceiling \n     on launchers, with over 600 missile launchers and heavy \n     bombers eliminated thus far, in fact, it is very close to \n     meeting the second intermediate limit on launchers that will \n     not take effect until December 1999. The implementation of \n     START I and NPT obligations by Belarus, Kazakhstan, and \n     Ukraine continues to proceed, as over 2,700 strategic \n     warheads in these three countries have been deactivated, and \n     over 2,100 have been returned to Russia. Over 1,000 \n     additional warheads have been deactivated in Russia itself. \n     The success of START I implementation thus far leaves us \n     confident that START II's limits can be achieved on schedule.\n\n  More recently, the State Department provided my office with the most \nup to date information available on START I implementation. As of \nSeptember 1, 1995, the United States had 1,727 START accountable \ndeployed nuclear delivery vehicles--ICBM's, SLBM's and heavy bombers--\ncompared to 2,246 in September of 1990. The United States had 8,345 \nSTART accountable warheads, compared to 10,563 5 years earlier. The \nformer Soviet Union [FSU] parties--Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and \nUkraine--collectively had 1,799 strategic nuclear delivery vehicles--of \nwhich 1,513 are Russian--compared to 2,500 5 years before. The FSU \nParties had 8,859 START accountable warheads--of which 6,769 are \nRussian--compared to 10,271 warheads in 1990.\n  Both sets of parties are below the Phase I limits that will not come \ninto effect until December 1997. In addition, both the United States \nand the former Soviet Union are below their Phase II launcher limits \nthat will not come into effect until December 1999. So implementation \nof START I is going very well, and well ahead of schedule. Given the \nclose relationship between START I and START II, there is every reason \nto expect that START II will be an equal success, as the states.\n\n\n                   verification and cheating concerns\n\n  Mr. President, every arms control treaty raises concerns about \nverification and compliance--our ability to check that the other party \nisn't cheating. START II has the most comprehensive and intrusive \nverification provisions of any nuclear arms control treaty ever \nnegotiated, a system that our defense and military leaders are \nconfident will work well.\n  When Defense Secretary Perry was asked in a Senate hearing why he \nfelt confident that cheating would not be a problem in START II, he \ngave the following explanation.\n\n       There are three factors which make cheating, I think, \n     improbable in START II. The first is just the general \n     openness of communication and exchange of personnel which now \n     exist between our two countries. For example, I have myself \n     been to the Russian test range at Baikonur. I have been to \n     the ICBM operational site at Pervomaysk. I've examined the \n     missiles in their control centers in great detail. I have \n     discussed detailed issues about these programs with the \n     scientists in the program and with the operational officers \n     in the strategic rocket force. That kind of communication \n     makes it very difficult to execute successfully a cheating \n     program.\n       Second, there are in START I very comprehensive \n     verification procedures that go well beyond national \n     technical means. They \n\n[[Page S483]]\n     require the sharing of telemetry data. They require various kinds of \n     cooperative measures, displaying the forces. They involve \n     continuous monitoring. They involve on-site inspection. This \n     is an exceedingly comprehensive form of inspection. So that's \n     the second reason that I think cheating is exceedingly \n     improbable.\n\n  The third is that we have added on START II additional on-site \ninspections and exhibitions specifically pointed out verifying the \nconfiguration of the SS-18 silos and the actual bomber loadings. All \nthree of these together, I think, give us a high degree of confidence \nthat we are not going to be subject to cheating.\n  General Shalikashvili reinforced Secretary Perry's answer with the \nfollowing comment:\n\n       Mr. Chairman, as Secretary Perry mentioned, START II \n     verification rests essentially on three pillars--intrusive \n     inspections, data exchanges and national technical means. \n     START II has 14 types of intrusive on-site inspections, 10 \n     from the START I treaty and four new ones. Both treaties \n     require very detailed exchanges of data of strategic systems. \n     And certainly you're familiar with the ability of our \n     national technical means to oversee that.\n       Given these factors, I would say, first of all, that I'm \n     very confident, and so are the joint chiefs, that the treaty \n     is effectively verifiable. Second, we think that it's very \n     difficult to picture a scenario that would give an advantage \n     to the Russians to cheat. They have already under this treaty \n     the ability to successfully accomplish deterrence and \n     accomplish the military task of covering necessary targets. \n     So any cheating would at best give them some ability to \n     increase their reserve. And the cost of being caught at \n     cheating would far outweigh any of that advantage. So \n     therefore, I see very little incentive for them to cheating, \n     but I'm also very confident that should they, we would be \n     in a very good position, through the inspections and \n     verification procedures, to detect that.\n\n  It does not get much clearer than that. The Secretary of Defense and \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff all agree that the START II Treaty is \neffectively verifiable. Furthermore, they can't even imagine a credible \nsituation in which the Russians would have any incentive to cheat; they \nwould not gain any appreciable advantage, and we would detect such a \nviolation and would be able to respond if necessary. This is the first \ntime I have ever heard our military say they cannot imagine a situation \nin which the other party could or would want to cheat on an arms \ncontrol treaty.\n  Before the Armed Services Committee last May, Gen. Wesley Clark, \nDirector of Strategic Plans and Policy of the Joint Staff, testified \nthat: ``Both during and after the Treaty negotiations, we have examined \nmultiple ways that the Russians could conceivably violate the Treaty to \naugment their forces. It is difficult to come up with a militarily \nrelevant cheating scenario.'' The monitoring and verification \nprovisions of the Treaty would prevent either side from violating the \nTreaty without being detected, but the Joint Chiefs cannot see an \nincentive for Russia to cheat because the Treaty will leave Russia with \nmore than enough nuclear forces for its security needs. As General \nClark explained it:\n\n       Even at fewer than 3,500 warheads, Russia will have \n     sufficient warheads to cover their U.S. targets and still \n     maintain a reserve. Because of this, additional warheads \n     generated by cheating would only have marginal effect on \n     damage expectancy or would be used to increase sides' reserve \n     force. Since these additional warheads would have only \n     marginal effect on a Russian attack and would be very \n     embarrassing if detected, we can find little incentive to \n     carry out a military significant violation.\n\n  I cannot think of a better combination of positive factors about a \nnuclear arms reduction treaty than we have in START I: It requires deep \ncuts--two-thirds below the 1990 levels--and eliminates the most \ndestabilizing nuclear systems on both sides. It leaves both sides with \nadequate forces to protect their security. Its monitoring and \nverification provisions assure that START II is effectively verifiable. \nFinally, the treaty provides neither side with an incentive to cheat. \nIt has been endorsed without reservation by the civilian and military \nleaders in the Pentagon, who have all urged numerous times that we \npromptly give our advice and consent to ratification. That makes it \npretty plain that we should vote overwhelmingly for ratification and \nmove the treaty closer to implementation.\n\n\n                       SENATE ACTION ON START II\n\n  Mr. President, the Senate has spoken clearly on its desire to act on \nthe START II Treaty. For example, on February 2, 1993, Senator Dole, \nour current majority leader, cosponsored Senate Resolution 54, \ncommending President Bush on the conclusion of the START II Treaty. \nThat resolution stated that the Senate ``intends to take up the Treaty \nat the earliest possible moment in pursuit of its constitutional duty \nto advise and consent to the ratification of treaties.''\n  On September 5, 1995, the Senate adopted unanimously an amendment to \nthe Defense authorization bill urging prompt ratification of the START \nII Treaty and the Chemical Weapons Convention. This amendment stated:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the United States and \n     all other parties to the START II Treaty and the Chemical \n     Weapons Convention should promptly ratify and fully \n     implement, as negotiated, both treaties.\n\n  This provision was adopted by the conference on the Defense \nauthorization bill, and appears in the conference report, so it will be \npart of the final Defense Authorization Act.\n  Mr. President, on December 5 of last year, 35 of our colleagues \njoined with myself and the senior Senator from Illinois [Mr. Simon] in \na letter to the majority leader urging that the Senate complete action \non the START II Treaty during the first session of the 104th Congress \nin 1995. So it is clear that the Senate is on record in various ways as \nfavoring prompt action on the START II Treaty.\n  The Senate came very close to completing action on START II at the \nend of last year. That was a result of a unanimous-consent agreement \nworked out between the Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. \nHelms, and Senator Kerry of Massachusetts. That agreement called for \nthe treaty to be brought up for Senate consideration before adjournment \nof the 1st session of this Congress. And last month, on December 22, \nthe Senate did take up the treaty, but did not complete action on it.\n  Although we did not vote on the treaty, we did agree on several \nissues. We adopted a manager's package of amendments to the resolution \nof ratification, and agreed that when we return to the treaty there \nwould be no other amendments in order. We also agreed that debate would \nbe limited to 6 hours, with additional time for Senator Thurmond. But \nit was clear that the purpose of our action was to try to complete \nfinal action on the treaty as quickly as possible. That was certainly \nthe spirit of the effort of the Arms Control Observer Group that came \ntogether to work out a package of amendments to the Foreign Relations \nCommittee resolution of ratification.\n  The Arms Control Observer Group, which is composed of members from \nthe various committees of jurisdiction on arms control matters, \ngathered just before the end of last year to consider a series of \namendments proposed by majority members in an effort to reach both a \ntime agreement and secure a vote by Friday, December 22. The members \nacted in good faith, upon exceptionally short notice and, after \nconsiderable effort, reached agreement on the amendments as a means to \ncomplete action on the treaty before we adjourned for the year. \nUnfortunately, we only got a partial time agreement and no date certain \nfor a vote. That was a disappointment. We failed to vote on the treaty \nbefore the end of the 1st Session of 104th Congress, and before the end \nof 1995, as had been the stated goal of the Senate.\n  Now we have the opportunity, at long last, to vote in favor of the \nresolution of ratification and move this treaty toward entry into force \nand implementation. I believe that the Russian Government, and \nespecially its Parliament, will have the wisdom to ratify this treaty \nbecause it is also so strongly in their security interest to do so.\n\n\n                     Next steps in Arms Reductions\n\n  Mr. President, the START II Treaty is an extremely important step to \nimprove our security and reduce the danger of nuclear weapons and \nnuclear war. It will result in reductions of some two-thirds of the \ndeployed long-range nuclear weapons of the cold war superpowers, and \nwill restructure the remaining arsenals into more stable \nconfigurations. These are the most ambitious nuclear weapon reductions \nundertaken by the United States and the former Soviet Union. But they \nare not sufficient. There will remain after all the required START II \nreductions, as many as 3,500 long range warheads deployed by each side, \nand even more \n\n[[Page S484]]\nwarheads not deployed. That is far more than we need for our security, \nand poses more of a danger than we should accept. We need to continue \nthe reductions begun by the START process, and reduce to the lowest \nlevel possible, including the other nuclear weapon states in the \nprocess at the appropriate time.\n  At the hearing before the Foreign Relations Committee, Secretary \nPerry was asked about further reductions in nuclear forces. He stated \nthat further reductions are desirable and planned: ``I have always \nbelieved that we should reduce to the maximum extent we can, compatible \nwith the threats and the potential threats from other countries. I \nthink we can make dramatic reductions, though, beyond where we are \ntoday, if we have favorable political developments continu[ing] as they \nhave been in the last 5 years or more.''\n  Secretary Perry was then asked when he envisioned the nuclear weapon \nreduction process, which has been bilateral so far, involving the other \nacknowledged nuclear weapon countries to conclude further reductions. \nSecretary Perry gave the following reply:\n\n       At the time when we start getting down to levels of nuclear \n     arms which are on the same order of magnitude of the levels \n     of the other nations. So far, even at the level of 3,000, we \n     have many, many more nuclear weapons than any--we and \n     Russia--than any other country. But we certainly envision \n     deeper cuts beyond the level of 3,000 to 3,500. And as we \n     start going down in the hundreds instead of in the thousands \n     of nuclear weapons, then I think it's not only appropriate; \n     it would be necessary to bring in the other countries who \n     have nuclear weapons.\n\n  When asked what specific steps he envisioned to get to further \nnuclear weapon reductions, he stated the following:\n\n       The sequence of events which I see is, first, we need to \n     get START II ratified in the Senate and the Duma. Secondly, \n     we need to get an agreement on implementation--on \n     accelerating the implementation between ourselves and the \n     Russians. Third, we need to mutually phase together the \n     accelerated draw-down. Fourth, we begin a discussion of START \n     III, which has enabled us to make further deep reductions. \n     We've already looked at those deep reductions, have pretty \n     good feelings about how far we can go. We believe they ought \n     to be bilateral. I think it is appropriate, at that stage, \n     though, to begin discussions with other countries, because if \n     the START III reductions are deep enough we're going to get \n     down to levels where we need to be talking with other \n     countries about this.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  Mr. President, the evidence is both compelling and overwhelming: The \nSTART II Treaty is unquestionably in our security interest. It is long \noverdue for Senate action, and I welcome the opportunity for this body \nfinally to ratify this treaty. I know the outcome will be very strong \nsupport for the treaty, and I hope the Russian Duma can take it up soon \nand then we can begin implementing the treaty soon.\n  I would like to close by quoting the conclusion of General \nShalikashvili's testimony before the Foreign Relations Committee on \nMarch 1, 1995:\n\n       The START II Treaty offers a significant contribution to \n     our national security. Under its provisions, we achieve the \n     long-standing goal of finally eliminating both heavy ICBM's \n     and the practice of MIRVing ICBM's, thereby significantly \n     reducing the incentive for a first strike. For decades, we \n     and the Russians have lived with this dangerous instability. \n     With this treaty, we can at last put it behind us.\n       The Joint Chiefs and I have carefully assessed the adequacy \n     of our strategic forces under START II. With the balanced \n     triad of 3,500 warheads that will remain once this treaty is \n     implemented, the size and mix of our remaining nuclear forces \n     will support our deterrent and targeting requirements against \n     any known adversary and under the worst assumptions. Both \n     American and Russian strategic nuclear forces will be \n     suspended at levels of rough equivalence; a balance with \n     greatly reduced incentive for a first strike. By every \n     military measure, START II is a sound agreement that will \n     make our Nation more secure. Under its terms, our forces will \n     remain militarily sufficient, crisis stability will be \n     greatly improved, and we can be confident in our ability to \n     effectively verify its implementation. This treaty is clearly \n     in the best interests of the United States.\n       On behalf of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, I recommend that \n     the Senate promptly give its advice and consent to the \n     ratification of the START II Treaty.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I make a request that I understand may be \nobjected to. I was going to ask, as in executive session, that the yeas \nand nays on the resolution of ratification accompany START II be \nvitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object----\n  Mr. NUNN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard. There is 1 minute for \ndebate.\n  Mr. DOLE. I yield the time back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. The question is on \nagreeing to the resolution of ratification. The yeas and nays have been \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, the hour is late, and I will simply take 1 \nminute on an issue many of us are concerned about on both sides of the \naisle. I have previously offered unanimous-consent requests to extend \nthe current farm program for a year, provide planting flexibility, and \nforgive advanced deficiency payments in the process of doing that. I am \nvery concerned that the Congress provide an answer to farmers about \nwhat the farm program will be.\n  I want to work with Members on both sides of the aisle here in \nCongress to get that done. Maybe we could hear a bit from the majority \nleader. I think there are some plans, perhaps next week, to address \nthis, which I think will be a real step forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/26/senate-section/article/S484-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S484-S485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--S. 1523\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I know he is constrained to object \ntonight, but let me ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of S. 1523, the bill be read a third time and \npassed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  Mr. President, S. 1523 is the bill I just mentioned with respect to \nthe extension of the farm program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, let me \nindicate I \n\n[[Page S485]]\nhave discussed this with the Senator from North Dakota. We are in the \nprocess--the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Lugar, \nMembers on both sides of the aisle, Senator Grassley from Iowa, Senator \nPressler from South Dakota, the Democratic leader and others on both \nsides--to see if we cannot come to some agreement by Thursday of next \nweek.\n  It is my hope we can lay out some process where, first of all, we \nwould try to bring up or at least proceed to the bill we passed one \nother time. We would have to obtain cloture. That would probably not be \ninvoked.\n  Then perhaps the Senator from North Dakota could lay down his 1-year \nextension, and if at that time we should have a bipartisan compromise, \nwe would offer that as a substitute. That is what we have been \ndiscussing. I have talked to the Democratic leader two or three times \ntoday. I know the farmers are anxious in all parts of the country. We \nhope we can work it out. It may not be possible to do it that quickly, \nbut we are working on it. Our staffs will continue to work in a \nbipartisan way, and we hope we can have it done by next Thursday.\n  Therefore, I feel compelled to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard to the request of the \nSenator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield for one moment, I understand \nthat, and I hope we can reach a bipartisan compromise on this. I think, \nto the extent we will move to it and address it next week, that is real \nprogress. I think farmers and others in rural America will be pleased \nby that, and I hope we can make some significant progress next week on \nthis issue.\n  I thank the Senator from Kansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/26/senate-section/article/S484-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, on another matter, very briefly--and I will \nnot tie up the Senate, it will take me 3 or 4 minutes--I want to talk \nbriefly about what I was surprised to see, which I term ``Tough Talk on \nthe Farm Bill Is Doubletalk.'' \n\n[[Page S486]]\n\n  Mr. President, in the Friday edition of the Omaha World Herald there \nwas a curious story. In it, Dean Kleckner of the American Farm Bureau \ntakes to task several farm State Senators and seems to blame us for the \nimpasse on the farm bill. He goes so far as to say, and I quote: ``I \nhave heard some Members of Congress say that the (Freedom to Farm) bill \nwill pass over their dead bodies. If there is no farm bill, there will \nbe a lot of dead bodies.''\n\n  Mr. President, this is, indeed, curious and offensive hyperbole. Some \nof us have been encouraging a farm bill to be brought up for debate and \nto be acted on for a long time. But where was the Farm Bureau? They \ncertainly were not taking that line on December 13.\n  On that day, I received a letter from Mr. Kleckner which took just \nthe opposite position. The Farm Bureau wanted a farm bill only, quoting \nfrom that letter, ``provided it is part of the budget reconciliation \npackage.''\n  This bit of now you see it and now you don't from the Farm Bureau \nshould come as no surprise, however. On November 6, I received a letter \nfrom Mr. Kleckner which said in part, ``Particularly troubling \nthroughout this debate has been the inability of the budget process to \nencourage programs which provide higher income supports when market \nprices are low and lower supports when prices are high.''\n  And he added at that time in that message, ``Continued linkage of \nmarket prices and producer payments is very necessary.''\n  In essence, the Farm Bureau staked out a position that is absolutely \ncontrary to the Freedom to Farm bill that it now endorses. That is a \n180-degree change. Now they support a farm welfare bill that, I \nbelieve, will fail our farmers who do not want welfare payments to do \nnothing. It cannot withstand the light of day, and I predict that it \nwill not. I am at a loss to explain the schizophrenic behavior of the \nFarm Bureau. Perhaps they want to hurry up and clear the tracks so they \ncan campaign in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary. I, for \none, however, would prefer that Congress stay in session to work out a \nfarm policy that makes sense, and maybe what was decided tonight is \ngoing to allow us to do that.\n  Certainly, if we do that, it will give us the time for the Farm \nBureau to change their minds once again.\n  I ask unanimous consent that communications of different views from \nthe Farm Bureau of November 6, 1995, December 13, 1995, January 26, \n1996, and the Omaha World Herald story of January 26, 1996 be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              American Farm Bureau Federation,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 13, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: Farm Bureau members are concerned about \n     reduced farm program spending levels but support the \n     framework of the Congressional farm program compromise \n     provided it is part of the budget reconciliation package.\n       It is urgent that a budget agreement be reached before the \n     end of 1995. The situation is especially critical for \n     America's farmers and ranchers who need to make planting \n     decisions for the 1996 crop year now.\n       The American Farm Bureau Federation supports the overall \n     reconciliation package as developed by Congress which \n     includes tax relief, spending restraint and a balanced budget \n     within seven years.\n       The people have spoken in support of significant government \n     reform and reduced federal spending to balance the budget in \n     seven years. The 4.5 million Farm Bureau families across the \n     nation urge swift and responsible action to resolve the \n     budget impasse.\n                                                 Dean R. Kleckner,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                              American Farm Bureau Federation,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 6, 1995.\n     Hon. James J. Exon,\n     528 Senate Hart,\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Exon: The agriculture components of both the \n     House and Senate Budget Reconciliation packages propose \n     substantial changes in farm policy. Both proposals \n     significantly restructure the income safety net for farmers \n     and drastically reduce the dollar amount of that support over \n     the seven-year period. This leaves farm program crop \n     producers more exposed to the production and price risk \n     inherent in farming. The level of spending reductions \n     currently under consideration represents far more than a fair \n     share for agriculture. Even at reduced levels of spending \n     reductions, agriculture would still provide a significant \n     contribution to deficit reduction.\n       Neither the Senate nor House proposal contains all the \n     answers. In fact both, to a great extent, are too directly \n     driven by the vagueness of budget scoring rather than \n     effective long-term agricultural policy.\n       Within the Senate and House proposals there are several key \n     elements of an income safety net which should become part of \n     the final reconciliation package.\n       These elements include:\n       1. Increased planting flexibility;\n       2. Minimal use of supply management tools;\n       3. Increased non-paid flex acres to meet budget \n     requirements;\n       4. Continued linkage of market prices and producer \n     payments;\n       5. Protections for non-program crop producers; and\n       6. Utilization of all budgeted outlays for mandatory \n     program spending.\n       Particularly troubling throughout this debate has been the \n     inability of the budget process to encourage programs which \n     provide higher income supports when market prices are low, \n     and lower supports when prices rise, while utilizing \n     available budget outlays. In order to provide a long-term \n     safety net the conference committee should develop a program \n     which maintains a price-payment linkage and allows budgeted \n     funds not expended in years of high prices to be available in \n     years in which farm income is low. Failure to resolve this \n     issue will render farm programs either an ineffective income \n     support mechanism or subject them to being an irresistible \n     political target. Unless good policy prevails over budget \n     rules and scoring limitations, American farmers will lose.\n       The American Farm Bureau supports the Senate language with \n     regard to the dairy provisions. We do not believe that \n     complete deregulation of the dairy industry is in the best \n     interest of our producers across the United States. Full \n     funding for the Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP) to the \n     maximum extent allowed by the Uruguay Round of GATT should be \n     included in the conference agreement.\n       Likewise, we ask conferees to build on the growing \n     opportunities for agricultural exports made possible by the \n     passage of GATT and NAFTA. U.S. agricultural exports are \n     expected to reach $53 billion in 1995. The continuation of \n     effective trade policy is paramount to maintaining market \n     share in the world agricultural economy. Cuts in trade \n     programs would jeopardize the hard fought battle to combat \n     unfair foreign subsidies and regain world market share. We \n     strongly urge you to restore funding for agricultural export \n     promotion and development programs to GATT-permissible \n     levels. We would support increases in unpaid flex to \n     accomplish this goal.\n       We support the EQUIP, livestock cost-share program, and the \n     elimination of the authority for permanent easements within \n     the Wetlands Reserve Program and on properties acquired by \n     the Farmers Home Administration. We believe these ideas \n     promote sensible agricultural policy that can also generate \n     needed budget savings.\n       Establishing long-term priorities for agricultural policy \n     should be a part of the new farm bill. As the income safety \n     net is reduced, discussions should be focused on research \n     needs, trade opportunities, credit requirements and risk \n     management alternatives for U.S. farmers. We support the \n     establishment of a national farm policy impact review \n     process.\n       We appreciate your interest in our views on farm policy. We \n     look forward to working with you to ensure that a farmer-\n     friendly farm policy becomes law.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Dean R. Kleckner,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n        AFBF Calls for Immediate Action on Seven-Year Farm Bill\n\n       Park Ridge, IL,--January 25, 1996.--With the absence of \n     progress on federal budget reform, the American Farm Bureau \n     Federation said a farm bill like the one formerly linked to \n     the congressional budget reconciliation proposal is needed \n     immediately.\n       The AFBF Board of Directors today said the organization \n     would support a seven-year farm bill now being proposed by \n     House Agriculture Chairman Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), as a stand-\n     alone measure or attached to other legislation. The Roberts \n     proposal includes greater planting flexibility so farmers can \n     better respond to the marketplace and financial support in \n     the form of ``market transition payments.''\n       The reasons for this move are numerous, according to AFBF \n     President Dean Kleckner. The two alternatives--an extension \n     of the 1990 farm bill, or reverting to the 1949 farm act--are \n     unacceptable to America's farmers.\n       Kleckner said the 1949 act is incompatible with U.S. \n     farmers selling their commodities in the world market, and an \n     extension of the 1990 act would fail to provide farmers \n     needed planting flexibility and would invite deeper cuts in \n     agriculture spending during future budget reconciliation \n     efforts.\n       ``Spring planting season in many southern states is just \n     around the corner,'' Kleckner said. ``Farmers must be able to \n     make their planting decisions and secure financing from \n     lenders with full knowledge of the farm program. A stand-\n     alone farm bill, like the framework proposed by Chairman \n     Roberts is essential to the viability of American agriculture \n     over the next seven years.''\n       According to Kleckner, immediate action is required because \n     the longer it takes to approve a farm bill, the lower \n     agriculture's funding baseline will be. He also said a delay \n\n[[Page S487]]\n     would increase the budget pressures on agriculture in any future budget \n     reconciliation efforts.\n       ``Farmers will continue to push for the tax reform measures \n     included in the stalled budget reconciliation measure,'' \n     Kleckner said. ``Securing an increase in the estate tax \n     exemption and a decrease in the capital gains tax rate are as \n     important to the agriculture economy as nailing down a \n     sensible farm bill. We will continue to highlight the \n     importance of those tax measures as the budget debate \n     continues, but America's farmers need a farm bill now. AFBF \n     and state Farm Bureaus will be making a concerted push in \n     Washington, D.C. and at home in the coming weeks, during \n     Congress' ill-timed February recess.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              [From the Omaha World Herald, Jan. 26, 1996]\n\n               Farm Bureau Tries to Free Mired Farm Bill\n\n                          (By David C. Beeder)\n\n       Washington.--Members of the American Farm Bureau Federation \n     are seeking immediate action on farm legislation that has \n     been stalled along with the balanced-budget bill. Farm Bureau \n     President Dean Kleckner said Thursday.\n       Kleckner said the 4.5 million-member Farm Bureau, the \n     country's largest agricultural organization, has started \n     working in every congressional district to urge House and \n     Senate members to separate farm legislation from the long-\n     delayed budget bill.\n       ``Our intention now is to lead the charge in getting a farm \n     bill passed as soon as possible,'' said Kleckner, a farmer \n     from Rudd, Iowa. ``Spring planting season in many Southern \n     states is just around the corner.''\n       Without farm legislation, some farmers are finding it \n     difficult to borrow money, Kleckner said.\n       A stand-alone farm bill introduced by Rep. Pat Roberts, a \n     Republican from Kansas who heads the House Agriculture \n     Committee, would allocate $44 billion over seven years to \n     make declining annual payments to farmers based on subsidies \n     they received in the past.\n       The Roberts bill, co-sponsored by Rep. Bill Barrett, R-\n     Neb., would eliminate acreage restrictions and a requirement \n     that farmers grow the same crop year after year to qualify \n     for payments. Farmers could plant any crop, or no crop, under \n     the bill.\n       Kleckner said everyone involved in U.S. agriculture \n     recognizes that ``declining payments are a fact of life we \n     will have to live with.''\n       However, he said, ``My gut feeling is there will always be \n     payments made on agriculture. They may not be related to crop \n     production. They may be made for environmental reasons.\n       The Roberts-Barrett bill has run into opposition in the \n     Senate.\n       Opponents include Sens. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., the minority \n     leader, Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., J.J. Exon, \n     D-Neb., and Tom Harkin, D-Iowa.\n       ``I have heard some members of Congress say the bill would \n     pass over their dead bodies.'' Kleckner said, ``If there is \n     no farm bill, there will be a lot of dead bodies.''\n\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/26/senate-section/article/S485-7", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              AGRICULTURE\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have another matter on which I wish to \nspeak, but I want to thank the Senator from Nebraska for bringing this \nissue to the floor. For the life of me, I cannot understand why we do \nnot have a farm bill this year. We passed a farm bill out of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee. It was not what I wanted. But we had our votes, \nwe debated it. Yet, we never brought it on the Senate floor to debate \nand vote on it. Never. Here it is, almost February 1996, and farmers in \nour area do not know what to do, how much credit to apply for, or what \nseed to buy, or what kind of program we are going to have this year. \nThen listening to the Senator from Nebraska repeat the rapid changes in \nthe national president, or chairman, whatever his position is, of the \nFarm Bureau, is disconcerting at best.\n  The Senator from Nebraska, if I understand this right, said that as \nrecently as a month ago, the leader of the Farm Bureau was saying in a \nletter that was written publicly, I guess, that the Farm Bureau was in \nfavor of a farm program that would have some connection between \ncommodity programs and support prices, and that they were in favor of a \nprogram that would support farmers in years when prices were low, but \nnot necessarily when prices are high. Was that just a month ago, I ask \nthe Senator?\n  Mr. EXON. I believe the date was November 6, maybe 60 days ago. The \ntimeframe may be a little over a month. But the Senator is absolutely \ncorrect, regardless of the date, there was a dramatic change overnight, \nwithout any explanation from the Farm Bureau of being against the \nprogram they are now for, and that boggles my mind.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I add, on the Agriculture Committee last summer--and I \nforget the exact date--the same individual, the president of the \nAmerican Farm Bureau, was before our committee. Then we were talking \nabout the budget, of which the distinguished Senator from Nebraska \nknows a lot, since he is a ranking member on our Budget Committee. I \nwas asking him about the budget. I said that the Clinton budget cuts \nabout--I think at that time it was around $4 billion, over a period, \nfrom agriculture, and I think the House budget cut something like $13 \nbillion or $14 billion from agriculture. I asked him, ``Given those two \noptions, which would you prefer? Which would the Farm Bureau be for?'' \nHe said they would prefer the Clinton budget.\n  Now it seems like there is another big turnaround where they want \nthis so-called freedom to farm bill, which, as the Senator said, is \nreally the farm welfare bill. I do not know how anyone could ask us to \npass a bill that would give a Government check to a farmer when prices \nwere extremely high in the marketplace. But that is what they are \nasking for. It is a siren song for farmers. If they buy into that, in a \nfew years there will not be any farm program or any farm bill at all to \nprotect them when prices are low. I thank the Senator for bringing this \nup.\n\n  Mr. EXON. If the Senator will yield for a minute----\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes. I yield.\n  Mr. EXON. My friend has been at the forefront of workable farm \nprograms for a long time. I am as mystified as he is. To build upon \nwhat the Senator just said, I placed in the Record the other day the \nfarm welfare program, the so-called Freedom to Farm Act. It would \nprovide a massive amount, thousands of dollars a year, to a farmer \nwhether or not the farmer even planted, on one hand, and he would get \nthe same amount of thousands of dollars--I figured out that a typical \nfarm of 500 acres, a corn farmer, at $3.10 a bushel, under the Freedom \nto Farm Act, even though that farmer at 500 acres, 120 bushels return, \nwhich is somewhere near normal----\n  Mr. HARKIN. We get more than that in Iowa.\n  Mr. EXON. It would be $186,000 gross income the farmer would make. \nThat is gross, not net. But on top of that $186,000, that particular \nfarmer would receive a check of about $16,000. Or, I might add, if the \nprice of corn went up to $4 a bushel, he would still get the $26,000, \nor at $5 a bushel, the farmer would get the $26,000; or if the farmer \ndid not want to do anything and just sit home and watch television and \nsurf the channels and not even go out and plant, he still gets $26,000 \nfrom the Federal Government.\n  If that is not a form of welfare--as I said in my remarks, once the \nSun shines in on that, once the members of the Farm Bureau realize and \nrecognize that their leadership is trying to convert a farm program \nbased on production that supports them when prices are low but does not \nsupport them when they are getting $3.10 a bushel, there is going to be \na revolution in the Farm Bureau. There is also going to be, what is \nmore serious, a revolution that the Senator from Iowa commented on when \nthe people of the United States and the Members of the House of \nRepresentatives and U.S. Senate recognize that you are throwing that \nkind of money away, regardless of what the price of corn is, even at $5 \na bushel, you get it whether or not you earn it, and that is welfare.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from Nebraska. I compliment him. He \nhas been a great leader in agriculture. I am going to miss his \nleadership in the years to come on the Senate floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/26/senate-section/article/S487-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S487-S490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REDUCING NUCLEAR TENSIONS IN THE WORLD\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise on a matter of great concern to me \nand all those who are concerned about reducing nuclear tensions in the \nworld, who are concerned about nonproliferation, and who are in favor \nof and concerned about a comprehensive test ban treaty. I might point \nout that in the State of the Union Message last Tuesday, President \nClinton said that one of the things he wanted to accomplish was a \ncomprehensive nuclear test ban treaty.\n  Most experts agree that nowhere on Earth is the potential for a \nnuclear \n\n[[Page S488]]\nconfrontation more real today than on the Indian subcontinent. Recent \nnews has only served to heighten those concerns.\n  According to an article in the December 15, 1995, issue of the New \nYork Times, ``U.S. intelligence experts suspect that India may be \npreparing for its first nuclear test since 1974.'' Needless to say, Mr. \nPresident, this is alarming news and it cannot be taken lightly.\n\n  Mr. President, this is the article from the New York Times, Friday, \nDecember 15: ``U.S. Suspects India Prepares To Conduct Nuclear Test.''\n  The day after that, on December 16--I might add in this article of \nDecember 15, the Indian spokesman said that that is not what it was. He \nsaid that these were army exercises whose ``movements have been \nabsurdly misinterpreted.'' That was on December 15.\n  On December 16, the next day, a story in the New York Times: ``India \nDenies Atom-Test Plan But Then Turns Ambiguous.''\n  It went on to say that the Indian Government denied it was planning \nits first nuclear test, and a few hours later recast its position to \ndescribe as ``highly speculative'' a report in the New York Times that \nquoted American intelligence experts as saying they suspected an Indian \ntest was being prepared.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these two articles be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Dec. 15, 1995]\n\n          U.S. Suspects India Prepares To Conduct Nuclear Test\n\n                            (By Tim Weiner)\n\n       Washington, December 14.--American intelligence experts \n     suspect India is preparing for its first nuclear test since \n     1974, Government officials said today.\n       The United States is working to discourage it, fearing a \n     political chain reaction among nuclear nations.\n       In recent weeks, spy satellites have recorded scientific \n     and technical activity at the Pokaran test site in the \n     Rajasthan desert in India. But intelligence experts said they \n     could not tell whether the activity involved preparations for \n     exploding a nuclear bomb or some other experiment to increase \n     India's expertise in making nuclear weapons.\n       ``We're not sure what they're up to,'' a Government \n     official said. ``The big question is what their motive is. If \n     their motive is to get scientific knowledge, it might be \n     months or years before they do the test. If it's for purely \n     political reasons, it could be this weekend. We don't know \n     the answer to those questions.''\n       Shive Mukherjee, Press Minister of the Indian Embassy here, \n     said today that the activities at the nuclear test site were \n     army exercises whose ``movements have been absurdly \n     misinterpreted.''\n       The Congress Party of India, which has governed the country \n     most of the years since independence in 1947, is facing a \n     serious challenge from a right-wing Hindu nationalist party. \n     United States Government officials say a nuclear weapons test \n     could be used by the Congress Party as a symbol of its \n     political potency.\n       Despite efforts to persuade the world's nuclear powers to \n     sign a comprehensive test ban treaty, China and France have \n     tested nuclear weapons in recent months. If India follows \n     suit, its neighbor, Pakistan, with which it has tense \n     relations, may also test a nuclear weapon, Government and \n     civilian experts said. Neither country has signed the Nuclear \n     Nonproliferation Treaty.\n       ``It's going to have a nuclear snowball effect,'' said Gary \n     Milhollin, director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms \n     Control in Washington and a leader civilian expert on the \n     spread of nuclear weapons. ``It also jeopardizes the \n     possibility that the world will sign a comprehensive test ban \n     treaty next year.''\n       A State Department official who spoke on condition of \n     anonymity said that if India exploded a nuclear bomb, it \n     ``would be a matter of great concern and a serious setback to \n     nonproliferation efforts.''\n       ``The United States is committed to the early completion of \n     a comprehensive test ban,'' the official said. ``We are \n     observing a moratorium on nuclear testing and we have called \n     upon all nations to demonstrate similar restraint.''\n       But not all nations have heard the call.\n       India says publicly that it wants the complete elimination \n     of nuclear weapons. But its nuclear hawks argue that the \n     United States and Russia will never live up to that ideal and \n     that a comprehensive test ban that is not linked to drastic \n     reductions in the world's nuclear arsenals could leave India \n     a second-rate or third-rate nuclear power.\n       Mr. Milhollin said India did not have a great archive of \n     test data for nuclear weapons that could be mounted on a \n     warhead and placed on a missile. ``Once the test ban treaty \n     comes in, they will be data-poor,'' he said ``A test now \n     would supply them data, it would be a tremendous plus for the \n     Congress Party, it would give them a big boost in the \n     elections.''\n       Political pressure for a nuclear test is building among \n     India's right wing. ``They are saying: `What are we sitting \n     around for? Why should we sign a test ban treaty not linked \n     to the reduction of nuclear weapons?' '' said Selig S. \n     Harrison, an expert on South Asia at the Carnegie Endowment \n     for International Peace.\n       In 1974 India exploded what was believed to be a Hiroshima-\n     sized bomb equal to 12,000 tons of TNT, which it called a \n     ``peaceful nuclear explosion.'' It renewed its program some \n     years later, and in 1989 the Director of Central \n     Intelligence, William H. Webster, testified that India had \n     resumed research on thermonuclear weapons.\n       While India has sought to limit the nuclear abilities of \n     China, it is most concerned about the nuclear-weapons program \n     of Pakistan, although Pakistan has not acknowledged it has \n     one. The two countries have had three wars, unending \n     political tensions and constant border disputes since they \n     were formed by the partition of India in 1947 after its \n     independence from Britain.\n       A subnuclear experiment, which would not involve a nuclear \n     explosion, might not have the political effect of a full-\n     fledged detonation. But Administration officials said they \n     feared that any test would create pressure on Pakistan to \n     follow suit.\n       ``We look at this in a balance with Pakistan,'' a White \n     house official said.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Dec. 16, 1995]\n\n          India Denies Atom-Test Plan But Then Turns Ambiguous\n\n                           (By John F. Burns)\n\n       New Delhi, Dec. 15.--The Indian Government denied today \n     that it was planning its first nuclear test since 1974, then \n     recast its position a few hours later to describe as ``highly \n     speculative'' a report in the New York Times today that \n     quoted American intelligence experts as saying they suspected \n     an Indian test was being prepared.\n       The Government offered no explanation for the change in its \n     statements. But the effect was to leave open the possibility \n     that an underground test is being prepared or that the \n     Government wants to keep alive the impression that it has the \n     option to conduct a test.\n       Senior political, military and scientific officials in \n     India gathered to discuss the response to the Times report, \n     which said United States spy satellites had detected \n     preparations at the Pokaran test site in Rajasthan, 340 miles \n     west of New Delhi.\n       Western intelligence agencies say India has been pursuing a \n     secret nuclear weapons program intensively for years.\n       Someone faxed a copy of the Times article to the Foreign \n     Ministry shortly after the first edition of the newspaper \n     went on sale in New York on Thursday night. Within an hour, \n     Arif Khan, Foreign Ministry spokesman, telephoned the Times \n     bureau in New Delhi with a denial. ``There is no truth in \n     this,'' he said. ``There is no question of any test being \n     conducted.''\n       Mr. Khan said the technical activity detected could have \n     been related to ``routine military exercises,'' including a \n     recent air force training operation in the area, which is \n     near the Pakistan border.\n       After the high-level officials had met to discuss the \n     issue, Mr. Khan held a briefing for reporters, and was \n     cautious in his responses, avoiding outright denial. ``It is \n     a totally speculative kind of report,'' he said. When a \n     reporter asked if the speculation was true or false, he \n     replied: ``There is no such thing as true speculation. \n     Speculation is speculation.''\n       By encouraging uncertainty about its plans the Government \n     appeared to be following the ambiguous policy it has laid \n     down since the test at Pokaran on May 18, 1974. That test \n     stunned Western governments that had hoped that India would \n     turn its back on nuclear weapons. At the time, India \n     described the test of a Hiroshima-sized bomb equal to about \n     12,000 tons of TNT, as ``a peaceful nuclear explosion,'' a \n     description Mr. Khan repeated today.\n       India's program to perfect nuclear warheads has been \n     presented as a contingency plan, not as a program aimed at \n     building or deploying nuclear weapons. Mr. Khan re-affirmed \n     this position today, saying, ``While we have the capability, \n     we have not utilized it, because we believe in the peaceful \n     uses of nuclear energy and not for weapons purposes.''\n       But behind this public stance, Indian experts said, \n     pressures have been building for new tests. The experts said \n     the tests would measure the effectiveness of development \n     since 1974, allowing scientists to measure the efficiency of \n     new approaches to bomb-making, including miniaturization of \n     warheads and new triggering mechanisms.\n       But others said the main pressure has been political. While \n     the nuclear debate here has focused on Pakistan, which has \n     been identified by United States intelligence officials as \n     having its own secret nuclear weapons program, officials say \n     India's long-range concerns focus more on China, which has at \n     least 450 nuclear-armed ballistic missiles capable of \n     striking targets in India.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. India has denied but Indian officials have failed to \nstate clearly and categorically that India will refrain from testing. I \nfear, and many others fear, if India proceeds with its testing program \nthen Pakistan will feel obligated for their own security reasons to \nfollow suit. This deadly game of \n\n[[Page S489]]\nchicken would almost certainly escalate.\n  To make matters even more troubling, reports today indicate that \ninternational negotiations in Geneva on a comprehensive nuclear test \nban treaty are being severely complicated, perhaps even undermined, by \nIndia's insistence to link a test ban with total nuclear disarmament.\n  Mr. President, India must be reminded that a nuclear test will \ntrigger severe economic sanctions. U.S. military and economic aid, U.S. \nsupport for loans by the World Bank and other multilateral \ninstitutions, and export licenses, would all be suspended.\n  Mr. President, it is time for both India and Pakistan to pull back \nfrom a nuclear collision course. It is time to end the nuclear saber-\nrattling and begin real talks at the negotiating table. To that end, \nMr. President, I commend the recent statement by Pakistan Prime \nMinister Benazir Bhutto expressing Pakistan's willingness to meet with \nIndia anywhere in the world at any time to ensure that what happened in \nHiroshima and Nagasaki does not happen in Pakistan or India. I hope \nIndian officials take up her offer. It is the right thing to do.\n  The fact is that in the two decades since India's first nuclear \nweapons test, Pakistan has initiated at least eight proposals to reduce \nor eliminate the threat of nuclear weapons in that region. Most \nrecently, it proposed the creation of a missile-free zone in all of \nSouth Asia. Each time, India has resisted these proposals.\n  Mr. President, I had a chart prepared which is the Pakistani \nproposals that they have provided, that they have produced over the \nyears, trying to seek an accommodation, trying to keep nuclear weapons \nfrom being produced in their area. I might just briefly go through \nthose.\n  First, to establish a nuclear weapons free-zone in South Asia, \nproposed in 1974; second, to issue a joint Indo-Pakistan declaration \nrenouncing the acquisition and manufacture of nuclear weapons, proposed \nin 1978; to have mutual inspections by India and Pakistan of nuclear \nfacilities, proposed in 1979; for simultaneous adherence to NPT by \nIndia and Pakistan, proposed in 1979; to endorse a simultaneous \nacceptance of full-scope international atomic energy agency safeguards, \nproposed in 1979; for agreement on a bilateral or regional nuclear test \nban treaty, proposed in 1987; to commence a multilateral conference on \nthe question of nuclear proliferation in South Asia, proposed in 1991; \nand to create a missile-free zone in all of South Asia, proposed in \n1993.\n  These are the steps that Pakistan has proposed over the years to \nreduce the level of tensions, to stop the production of nuclear weapons \nin that area. Each time that they have proposed this, India has \nresisted these proposals.\n  Mr. President, since the end of the cold war, solving nuclear \ntensions in the Indian subcontinent has been a leading nonproliferation \ngoal of the United States. At best, this senseless arms race would \nsquander billions of dollars and decrease security in the region and \nbeyond. For this reason I call on my colleagues to join me in urging \nIndia to clearly state that it will refrain from nuclear testing. \nFurthermore, I call on the administration to support efforts to bring \nboth India and Pakistan together for negotiations to eliminate the \nthreat of nuclear proliferation in that region once and for all.\n  Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord an editorial that appears in the Chicago Tribune, Sunday, \nJanuary 7, 1996, entitled ``The Nuclear Danger In South Asia.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Chicago Tribune, Jan. 7, 1996]\n\n                    The Nuclear Danger in South Asia\n\n       Here's question certain to unsettle those who still delude \n     themselves that the end of the Cold War eliminated the menace \n     of potential nuclear war on planet Earth: Is there an \n     international rivalry today, one so unstable and hostile, \n     that nuclear weapons might be launched in anger?\n       According to those in the government charged with keeping \n     an American eagle on this problem, the answer, sadly, is yes. \n     Not so very likely between the U.S. and Russia, they say--\n     thank goodness!--nor between the U.S. and China. And while \n     the two Koreas remain locked in a standoff of highly hostile \n     intent, the South has no nuclear capability.\n       A nuclear war between India and Pakistan is the most likely \n     scenario. Partitioned from former British colonial territory, \n     the two nations are divided by religion and already have \n     fought three wars over territory.\n       The Bush administration went so far as to say in private \n     that it believed the 1990 Indo-Pakistani dispute over the \n     province of Kashmir might have gone nuclear had shooting \n     started in that crisis.\n       That's why reports from the U.S. intelligence community \n     that India is preparing for another nuclear test, its first \n     in 21 years, are worrisome. Why would India want to throw a \n     match into this tinderbox?\n       The government of India denies American accusations, that \n     it is about to conduct a nuclear operation at its Pokaran \n     test site in the Rajasthan desert. But American experts say \n     that two motivations may be driving India to a new round of \n     testing.\n       First, the sitting government has been stung by weak \n     electoral showings and can read public opinion that favors a \n     strong defense, including nuclear arms.\n       And second, India wants to publicly defy the will of the \n     major nuclear powers, which are urging treaties that would \n     forever bar new states from seeking nuclear defenses. India \n     derides such a system of dividing the world into ``bomb \n     haves'' and ``bomb have-nots'' as ``nuclear apartheid.''\n       Why should the world care if India and Pakistan continue to \n     go nuclear? There are reasons of the heart and of the mind.\n       Between them, India and Pakistan are home to a full one-\n     fifth of the world's population, and even a nuclear exchange \n     ``limited'' to a few warheads would present a humanitarian \n     and ecological disaster of near-biblical proportions.\n       And to be coldly realistic, nobody knows what would happen \n     once the nuclear tobaoo was broken, but the liberating \n     effects--and on possible enemies of the United States--cannot \n     be dismissed. The nuclear genie must remain locked in the \n     bottle.\n       Thus, India must be dissuaded in every way possible from \n     conducting a nuclear test. And it should join in \n     understanding that the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty and \n     the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty will make the whole planet \n     safer for all by limiting the spread of nuclear weapons and \n     know-how.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have several articles from newspapers \naround the country talking about the problem of nuclear proliferation \nin that part of the world, talking about the indications that India may \nbe ready to conduct a nuclear test. I ask unanimous consent that the \nvarious articles be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Dec. 15, 1995]\n\n                        Arrest in Pakistan Blast\n\n       Islamabad, Pakistan,--December 14.--Pakistan is holding a \n     Canadian relief worker of Egyptian origin, apparently in \n     connection with the suicide bombing of the Egyptian Embassy \n     in Islamabad on Nov. 19, his wife said today.\n       Maha Elsamna, 38, said that the police detained her \n     husband, Ahmed Saeed Khadr, regional director of the \n     Canadian-based aid agency Human Concern International, in \n     Peshawar in northwestern Pakistan on Dec. 3.\n       Ms. Elsamna said her husband was detained by the police a \n     day after returning from Afghanistan.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n            [From the Philadelphia Inquirer, Dec. 14, 1995]\n\n  World in Brief--Pakistan Accuses the United States of Meddling Over \n                                Killings\n\n       Islamabad, Pakistan.--Pakistan accused the U.S. government \n     yesterday of meddling in its affairs after Washington \n     expressed concern over a sharp rise in killings of people \n     detained by security forces.\n       State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said Monday that \n     the Clinton administration ``deplores the senseless murder of \n     family members of government and political leaders'' in \n     Karachi, Pakistan's violence-plagued largest city. His \n     comments followed the shooting deaths of Nasir Hussain, 62, \n     and Arif Hussain, 28, the brother and nephew of Altaf \n     Hussain, the opposition leader blamed for leading an ethnic \n     war against the Karachi authorities.\n       A Pakistani human-rights official, Iqbal Haider, sharply \n     criticized the State Department yesterday, saying its \n     statement was ``uncalled for and a clear interference in \n     Pakistan's internal affairs.'' He accused Washington of \n     ignoring the deaths of law-enforcement officers, nearly 200 \n     of whom have been killed in Karachi in the last six months as \n     a result of the ethnic violence.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, Mr. President, it is time to reduce the tensions \nin that area. The best way to do that is to use our good offices, the \nadministration, and also to let our voices be heard so that our friends \nin India--and I say that forthrightly; India is not an enemy of ours. \nThey are a friend of ours. We have relations with India. But they have \nto understand the gravity of this situation. They have to understand \nthat if they would clearly state that they will not conduct nuclear \ntesting, how much further that would advance the cause of peace and \nreduce the tensions in that area. \n\n[[Page S490]]\n\n  Perhaps then we can get about bringing both India and Pakistan \ntogether, to stall the problems that we have in Kashmir, where \nthousands of innocent people are losing their lives. It need not be \nthat way. We can solve these problems. But India must first renounce \nthe use of nuclear weapons and must first state very clearly that they \nare not going to conduct nuclear testing.\n  With that out of the road, and I believe the pathway would be clear \nfor this administration and for other governments to get India and \nPakistan together to solve the outstanding problems that continue to \nengulf the entire area.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/26/senate-section/article/S487-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

The sale of this national resource is a \nwindfall for American taxpayers. Many thought it would only bring in \n$20 million to $100 million. But the experts were wrong. It brought in \na whopping $682.5 million. Senator McCain and Senator Brown deserve \nrecognition, and our thanks, for pushing through the legislation that \nmade this auction possible.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 26, 1995]\n\n                 News Corp. and MCI Win Satellite Slot\n\n\n                Bid of $682 Million to Beam TV to Homes\n\n                         (By Edmund L. Andrews)\n\n       Washington, January 25.--After a brief but spirited bidding \n     war, MIC Communications and Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation \n     agreed today to pay the Federal Government $682 million for \n     the last unclaimed orbital slot for a satellite that can beam \n     television straight to individual homes across the United \n     States.\n       The two companies, which have formed a joint venture to \n     build and operate the system, said they planned to invest \n     another $1 billion and hoped to begin offering both \n     television and a broad range of business communication \n     services within two years.\n       ``We are talking about much, much more than higher quality \n     television,'' said Bert C. Roberts, the chairman and chief \n     executive of MCI, in a satellite-linked news conference with \n     Mr. Murdoch.\n       But some analysts remain skeptical about the idea. MCI and \n     the News Corporation paid top dollar for the license, more \n     than twice that Tele-Communications Inc. of Denver was \n     willing to pay when it dropped out of the Federal \n     Communications Commission's auction on Wednesday.\n       The two companies will also be years behind several rivals, \n     all of which either can or will beam more than 150 channels \n     of television to relatively small antennas.\n       ``I'm scratching my head, trying to figure out where they \n     are going,'' said Daniel P. Reingold, a telecommunications \n     analyst with Merrill Lynch.\n       DirectTV, a subsidiary of General Motors' Hughes \n     Electronics, has signed up 1.2 million subscribers who \n     receive service over antennas about 18 inches in diameter. \n     And its pace is likely to speed up because the AT \n     Corporation bought a small stake in the company this week and \n     plans to start marketing its service through the AT sales \n     force.\n       Echostar Communications of Englewood, Colo., which lost out \n     to MCI in today's auction, already owns another direct-\n     broadcast license and has launched its first satellite. It \n     hopes to beam about 75 channels of television in March and to \n     double that capacity with a second satellite by the end of \n     the year.\n       And Primestar Partners, a consortium owned by several of \n     the country's biggest cable television companies, is \n     marketing a similar service that customers receive on bulkier \n     three-foot-wide satellite dishes.\n       Today, however, Mr. Roberts and Mr. Murdoch radiated \n     confidence and said they had much more in mind than simply \n     emulating traditional cable television. Mr. Roberts described \n     beaming things like medical images between hospitals, video \n     training materials for corporations and high-speed data links \n     to connect far-flung offices of a company.\n       Winning this license will allow MCI and the News \n     Corporation to embark on the first tangible project of the \n     alliance they formed nearly a year ago, in which MCI paid $2 \n     billion for a 13.5 percent stake in News Corporation.\n       As the nation's second-largest long-distance carrier, MCI \n     has been struggling to move beyond its traditional business \n     and match moves made by both AT and the Sprint Corporation.\n       Sprint, meanwhile, has teamed up with four of the country's \n     biggest cable companies in a bid to offer a full range of \n     telephone, cable television and wireless communication \n     services.\n       The new satellite license will allow the two companies to \n     beam more than 200 channels of television programming over \n     direct-broadcast satellites, high-powered satellites whose \n     signals can be received by pizza-sized 18-inch dishes in \n     individual homes.\n       Under the new joint venture, MCI said it would take lead \n     responsibility for developing business communication services \n     and the News Corporation would take the lead on consumer \n     services. Mr. Murdoch said the consumer business would focus \n     primarily on competing with traditional cable television \n     operators.\n       Mr. Murdoch has already been both shrewd and highly \n     successful in the satellite television business overseas. In \n     Europe, the News Corporation owns a 40 percent in B Sky B, a \n     service that now has five million subscribers. And in Asia, \n     the News Corporation owns Star TV, which beams television and \n     radio over Japan, Korea, China and India.\n       MCI, despite its difficulties in branching beyond the long-\n     distance market, has nevertheless repeatedly shown itself a \n     master of marketing prowess that has generally outpaced both \n     AT and Sprint in the long-distance arena.\n       David Roddy, a communications analysts with Deloitte & \n     Touche Consulting Group, said MCI had particular need for \n     obtaining the last unclaimed satellite spot for direct-\n     broadcast television because it had no other way of \n     distributing entertainment and other forms of media.\n       ``A lot of people are asking whether MCI can afford to do \n     this, but my answer is, can they afford not to do it?'' Mr. \n     Roddy said.\n\n\n                  Medicare Reimbursement for Tamoxifen\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, each year in this country approximately \n180,000 women are diagnosed as having breast cancer, a terrible disease \nthat will claim nearly 50,000 lives. But, nearly 2.6 million women are \nbreast cancer survivors, in part because of the availability of \nTamoxifen citrate, a widely used post-operative drug for this disease.\n  My colleagues may not be aware that a low-cost version of Tamoxifen \nis available on the market today. As a result, the estimated 800,000 \nwomen who take two tablets per day of this lower cost medicine are \nsaving a total of $81 million a year.\n  It has not been widely publicized, but during consideration of the \nBalanced Budget Act, a provision was included in the now-vetoed \nconference report to amend the Medicare Program to include \nreimbursement for Tamoxifen. In an effort to lessen the cost of this \nexpansion of Medicare reimbursement, a rebate was included to reduce \nthe cost of the drug to the Federal Government when covered as part of \nMedicare.\n  Unfortunately, I believe my colleagues were unaware of the negative \neffects of this rebate provision when it was passed as part of the \nbudget bill. One notable drawback is that the provision would have set \nthe very undesirable precedent of establishing a Medicare rebate. Such \na rebate would be unwise policy for a number of reasons, but that is \nnot the focus of my remarks here today.\n  More importantly, as a result of this new and unprecedented Medicare \nrebate, the provider of the low-cost alternative of Tamoxifen would no \nlonger be able to make this product available in the domestic market. \nThat is because the rebate, combined with the terms of a contract \nnegotiated between the lower cost provider and the drug innovator, \nwould cause the lower cost provider to lose money on each bottle of \nTamoxifen sold.\n  Ironically, for Medicare beneficiaries and other consumers, the \nresult of what I believe was a well-intentioned amendment could only be \nhigher prices for this life-saving breast cancer therapy. Such a result \nwould indeed be tragic, and I hope that my colleagues will give this a \nsecond thought as future Medicare bills are developed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/26/senate-section/article/S490-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S490-S491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees. \n\n[[Page S491]]\n\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/26/senate-section/article/S490-3", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:02 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2880.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with my \ndistinguished colleague from Ohio, Senator John Glenn, legislation that \nwill get U.S. taxpayers out of the business of subsidizing NFL \nfranchise moves.\n  It is clear by now that these franchise moves have a very substantial \nimpact not only on communities, on the economy, but also, frankly, on \nthe future of professional sports.\n  Mr. President, I have already on this floor in days past addressed at \nlength the question of the proposed move of the Cleveland Browns to \nBaltimore. I believe, as do many Ohioans--indeed, as do many \nAmericans--that this move is simply wrong. I have discussed on this \nfloor the great tradition of the Browns, the love the people of \nCleveland and the people of Ohio have for the Browns.\n  Candidly, whether you care about the Browns or do not, whether you \nare a sports fan or not a sports fan, you and every taxpayer are paying \nfor this move--every taxpayer in the entire country. Whether you live \nin Cleveland, OH, or Los Angeles, CA, the Federal Government is \nreaching into your pocket to pay for this move. I believe the taxpayers \nwill be shocked to know this, and they should be. The sports fan who \nhave followed all the back and forth of this move, very few of them are \naware today as I speak from the Senate floor that the Federal \nGovernment, is subsidizing this purported move by $36 million--$36 \nmillion of taxpayers' money.\n  That provides the occasion and the rational and the public policy \nreason for the legislation Senator Glenn and I are introducing today. \nQuite frankly, I can see no moral justification for taxpayers, for the \npeople of Cleveland or anywhere else to reward a sports team with \npublic money to assist that team in breaking its word and deserting the \ncommunity. I believe that to do this is unconscionable and is simply \nwrong.\n  Let me put it in real terms. To force a family in Parma, OH, or \nEuclid, or in Cleveland, or in Columbus, OH, to take there tax dollars, \nto send them to Washington and to have Washington turn around and \nsubsidize Baltimore, MD, to steal the team from the Browns and to do it \nwith $36 million in Federal taxpayers' money makes absolutely no sense. \nI believe that we must stop the insanity. We must act to get the \nGovernment out of this subsidy business.\n  Mr. President, today, more and more public money is being used to \nsupport professional football franchises. Communities are making \nsignificant public investments to lure and keep NFL teams in there \narea. In each one of these cases, in return for the public investment, \nteams are agreeing to stay in the community for a specifically defined \nperiod of time. There is a deal made. The local community will offer \nfinancial incentives, will support the team, and in return the owner \nagrees to stay in that community during the term of the lease. It is \nfairly simple. Unfortunately, however, some franchises are breaking \ntheir part of the deal by seeking to relocate before the term of the \ndeal has expired, before the lease is over.\n  That is why I am introducing legislation that will get the Federal \ntaxpayer out of the business of subsidizing this particular kind of \nrelocation. The enactment of this bill will result, frankly, in less \nGovernment involvement in professional sports, not more. Under the \ncurrent system, when a city or State wants to raise funds to build a \nstadium and thereby secure a professional team, it authorizes a \ngovernmental entity such as a stadium authority to issue bonds. In \nother words, to sell the debt to anyone who wants to buy the debt. The \nstadium authority can then use the proceeds to build the stadium and \nthe people who have invested pay no tax on the interest they earn--tax-\nfree bonds. The tax exemption allows the stadium authority to pay lower \ninterest rates and thus keep more money for itself. They can build the \nstadium at less of a cost--in this particular case in Baltimore it is \n$36 million less cost. That is the difference between issuing the \nbonds, building the stadium with taxable bonds versus building that \nstadium with nontaxable bonds.\n\n  Mr. President, because the bondholder does not pay Federal tax on \ninterest, the interest amounts to a Federal subsidy for stadium \nauthority bondholders. For example, in the case of the Browns move, \nthis subsidy is worth, as I have stated, $36 million to the Browns.\n  The legislation that Senator Glenn and I are introducing today will \nprohibit the use of these Federal subsidies in bond deals associated \nwith the relocation of an NFL team, when that team breaks an existing \ndeal with the community that has supported the team. In short, new \nFederal subsidies under this bill cannot be used to help a team violate \nan existing commitment where that commitment includes public money.\n  The bill's criteria are straightforward. There are five separate \ncriteria and each one of these has to be met before our bill applies: \nFirst, if the franchise is currently in a public facility; second, if \nthe proposed relocation will be to a new public facility; third, if fan \nsupport in the current location, the current team's local area--in this \ncase, Cleveland--has been at least 75 percent of stadium capacity in \nthe preceding season; fourth, if the current lease with the public \nentity has not expired--in other words, they are breaking the lease; \nand fifth, if asked, voters in the current jurisdiction have approved \nthe use of further tax dollars to improve the current facility or to \nbuild a new one.\n  If all five of these criteria apply, then our bill provides as \nfollows: No expenditure of Federal funds including grants, awards, \nloans, guarantees, tax credits, exemptions, allowances or any use of \nFederal tax-exempt financing may be used to benefit the franchise \nseeking to relocate.\n  In short, Mr. President, if you own a football team and you want to \nbreak your lease and the local community has done everything it can to \nsupport the team, you can do it; Congress will not stop you, not under \nthis bill, but--but--the Federal taxpayers will not help you do it. \nThey will not encourage you with a subsidy to do it. The Federal \ntaxpayers will not subsidize your breach of faith. That is the message \nthat the bill will send to NFL owners. If you want to go build your own \nstadium, you can do that, too, but the Federal taxpayers will not help \nyou do it. If you want to rely only on State, local dollars, not \nFederal dollars, you can do that, too, but Federal taxpayers simply \nwill not help you do it. If you want to break a deal in the community \nand the community you are leaving has done everything it can to keep \nits part of the bargain, then the Federal taxpayer will not get \ninvolved.\n  Mr. President, it is important to discuss this issue in the context \nof everything else that is occurring today and this past year in \nWashington. In the Senate, we have been consumed with decisions on \nFederal spending. How can we slow the rate of growth of spending? What \nFederal budget should we pass? How can we balance the Federal budget? \nWe are making very tough decisions on health care for poor people, \nwelfare reform, Medicare, Medicaid, the education of our youth.\n  I do not need to tell anyone in this Chamber that these are very \ndifficult decisions, but here is an easy decision. As I stated earlier, \nin just this case, the case of the Browns purported move to Baltimore, \nit is estimated that the Federal tax subsidy is $36 million. That is \nover and above any local taxpayer subsidy--$36 million of Federal tax \nmoney, $36 million that will benefit one professional sports franchise.\n  The American people want to know what we mean by corporate welfare. \nThis, Mr. President, is corporate welfare. This is what we mean. Paying \nthe Browns $36 million of Federal money is, simply, morally wrong.\n  For me, the question is, under our serious budget constraints, what \nin the world justifies taking $36 million from taxpayers, including the \nones in Cleveland whose trust with the Browns has been broken, to pay \nfor this move? Absolutely nothing justifies it.\n  Mr. President, I have spoken at length regarding the impact of sports \nfranchise relocation on the communities that love their teams. I have \nmentioned the pride that the people of Cleveland, the people of all of \nOhio have in the Browns. I have discussed the unbroken bonds of \naffection that stretch from the days after the Second \n\n[[Page S494]]\nWorld War, when the Browns started playing in Cleveland, to today's \nfans who, frankly, still cannot believe that the Browns are trying to \nleave town. I will not replow that field here except to say simply \nthis: Loyalty counts. Loyalty is not transferable.\n  The Cleveland story is very important precisely because the Browns \nare the heart and soul of Cleveland and because the people of Cleveland \nhave done all they can to save the Browns. The Cleveland situation is, \nMr. President, the worst-case scenario. If the Browns can leave \nCleveland, any team can leave any town any time.\n  This was an ad that was paid for by Browns fans that appeared in USA \nToday. I think it pretty much summarizes the situation. If this can \nhappen in Cleveland, Mr. President, this can happen to any team, to any \nsports fans in the country.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, in the last several weeks we have seen \nmuch activity surrounding the Browns' move to Baltimore. The State of \nMaryland has filed an antitrust lawsuit against the NFL. The city of \nCleveland sued the Browns. The city of Cleveland also sued the city of \nBaltimore. Who knows, there may be more lawsuits coming.\n  My bill does one very important thing: It gets the American taxpayer \nout of the middle of all this. Whatever the economic factors that cause \nteams to go and to come, whatever the circumstances that lead city to \nsue city, teams to sue teams, and the league to sue teams and \nindividuals, the American taxpayer should be left out of it. The \ntaxpayers' burden is high enough. It is wrong to make the taxpayers \npay.\n  My bill does not seek to manage the NFL team relocation process. It \ndoes not intend to have more regulation of the NFL. But it does say \nthat the Federal Government will not help them leave and that the \nFederal taxpayers will not subsidize these moves.\n  Mr. President, I considered naming my bill after our beloved \n``Dawgs'' and the hard-core Browns fans who are represented in this \nparticular ad. You see in the ad the ``Big Dawg,'' who is certainly \nfamous in Cleveland, around the country, a great fan looking at this \nempty stadium after the last home game. I considered naming my bill \nafter the Dawgs, and the Dawgs, of course, is, in this case, spelled d-\na-w-g-s. In this case, the Dawgs would stand for ``don't allow welfare \nfor greedy sports owners.''\n  While that title would express very accurately the deepest feelings \nof the people of Ohio, I have decided on a title that would tell all \nAmericans why they should support this particular bill. I have called \nthe bill the Team Relocation Taxpayer Protection Act. The bill is \ncalled the Team Relocation Taxpayer Protection Act.\n  If you are a taxpayer and you think we have better things to spend \nFederal money on than corporate greed, you should support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this \nbill, the Dawgs bill, the Team Relocation Taxpayer Protection Act, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, before proceeding to the purpose for \nwhich I have sought recognition, I would like to express my support for \nthe proposition outlined by the distinguished Senator from Ohio. I \nbelieve that Baltimore ought to have a football team, and that is the \nColts. I think that Indianapolis is entitled to an expansion team.\n  I believe that Senator DeWine has articulated the issue cogently and \nforcefully on a travesty which is being perpetrated on many American \ncities and on many American taxpayers. There is really a situation \nwhere sports teams are entrusted with a public interest.\n  The movement of the Dodgers from Brooklyn to Los Angeles was the \nstart of pirating in America of sports franchises and should never have \nbeen allowed, accompanied by the movement of the Giants from New York \nto San Francisco.\n  We have seen that matter proliferate. It is hard to understand why \nthe taxpayers of Maryland and Baltimore have to be in a bidding \ncontest, which, as I understand it, approximates some $200 billion to \nbring a football team to Baltimore. Certainly Baltimore ought to have a \nfootball team, and it ought to be the Colts, which moved out of \nBaltimore in the middle of the night to go to Indianapolis.\n  American has a love affair with sports. I just came from a brief \nsporting event in the office of Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, where she \nand Senator Santorum and I articulated a bet on the Super Bowl game. If \nyou cannot see this on C-SPAN 2, this is an unusual tie for me to wear. \nIt is a Steelers tie.\n  I am going to be going to the Super Bowl, weather permitting and \nSenate schedule permitting. Who knows, we may be in session Sunday the \nway things are going. But I have participated in America's love affair \nwith sports since I was a youngster in Wichita, KS, reading the box \nscores from the Wichita Eagle every morning because of my love and \npassion for baseball.\n  I have been attending the Phillies games and the Eagles games, and \nwhen I can, in Pittsburgh, the Pirates games and the Steeler games \nbecause of my love of the sport. It is tremendously exciting.\n  Just basically, it is unfair for the Browns--I was about to say the \nIndians--for the Browns to be taken out of Cleveland. I hope we can do \nsomething about it. I hope that with the complications of free agency \nand franchise removal, salary caps and revenue sharing, that we will be \nable to address this matter in a sane way in the Congress.\n  Baseball enjoys an antitrust exemption. Football enjoys a limited \nantitrust exemption from revenue sharing for television. I believe \nthose sports are under an obligation to work out the rules so that the \nteams do not get themselves pirated from one city to another.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1529\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nlegislation being offered by my colleague from Ohio. We have worked \ntogether very closely on the whole issue of professional sports team \nrelocation. It should come as no surprise this is an issue that hits \nhome for the people of our States.\n  Organized, professional sports have always played a prominent role in \nAmerican life. Individuals, cities, States, and even the entire nation \nhave come together and rallied around sports teams. And professional \nsports teams have helped local economies rally and revitalized our \ninner cities, creating whole new sectors of economic opportunity.\n  This week, many Americans' eyes are on Tempe, AR, where the Dallas \nCowboys will take on the Pittsburgh Steelers to determine who will win \na fifth NFL championship. Think of some of the other major sports \nevents that have riveted the nation's attention over the past months.\n  How about those Cleveland Indians and their amazing season which \nculminated in a World Series appearance?\n  Who hasn't heard all the talk this winter about the return of Michael \nJordan and the Chicago Bulls' dominance of the NBA.\n  And who can forget the elation we all felt watching Cal Ripken, Jr., \ntake his historic lap around Camden Yards?\n  What can be more American, or says more about our country, than \nstories such as these? Or how we bask in a team's victories, \ncommiserate over the losses, and cheer exciting and dramatic exploits \non the field or on the court?\n  But there is a story that overshadows these and threatens this \nspirit, that is community pride. Of course, I am speaking of team \nrelocation. And the relocation which has shocked the nation involves \nthe Cleveland Browns. Let me tell you a little about Cleveland and the \nBrowns.\n  The Cleveland Browns have been a symbol of undying and unwavering fan \nsupport. Week after week, 70,000 people cram into Lakefront Memorial \nStadium to root on the Browns. The ``Dawg Pound'' is a national symbol \nof fan support. Through 3-13 seasons, 13-3 season, exciting play-off \nvictories, demoralizing play-off defeats, Browns fans have been through \nit all and still support their team.\n  There's no talk of getting on or off a bandwagon in Cleveland--every \nfan is there, through thick and thin.\n  That's what makes the announcement that the Browns intend to desert \ntheir home of 50 years the toughest to take. The Browns have enjoyed \nbacking from generations of fans, only to be told that it doesn't \nmatter.\n  Well, it does matter. It matters to the season ticket holder who has \nbeen going to games for 30 years. It matters to the worker who sells \nhot dogs at the stadium. It matters to businesses selling Browns t-\nshirts, hats, and other paraphernalia. It matters to restaurants and \nhotels that cater to fans and players. It matters to those raised as \nBrowns fans looking forward to passing along that tradition.\n  It should matter to every football, baseball, hockey, and basketball \nfan across the country, because if it can happen to Cleveland, it can \nhappen to you.\n  And it should matter to every single taxpayer in America who are \ngoing to end up footing part of the bill for the Browns' move and \nothers as relocation fever sweeps the country. It's shocking, but \nFederal tax subsidies are going to help ease the cost of the Cleveland \nBrowns' relocation. It absolutely makes no sense that we should allow \ntaxpayer dollars to back up this kind of deal.\n  Why should taxpayers in Cleveland, or any American city, help foot \nthe tab for their local team to pull stakes and move to another city? \nTalk about adding insult to injury. That's why I am pleased to join my \ncolleague from Ohio today in introducing this legislation.\n  Let me stress that this legislation does not put an all-out ban on \nthe use of public money in such situations. In fact, it is a very \nnarrowly tailored bill which says: if a team already took advantage of \ntax dollars to build its existing stadium; and there has been \ntremendous fan loyalty and support; and voters in the current \njurisdiction have approved of the means to improve the team's current \nfacility or build a new one; and the team's current lease has not \nexpired; then, we're not going to allow Federal tax dollars to \nsubsidize the move.\n  I think that's pretty reasonable. We shouldn't be in the business of \ngiving Federal tax subsidies to a team that already received the \nbenefit of public money to build their existing stadium, that intends \nto turn its back on loyal fans and a community commitment to build or \nimprove their stadium, and a team that has broken its lease--that team \nshould not receive a Federal tax subsidy.\n  Right now, Washington is embroiled in a very nasty and partisan \ndebate about how our Government can reach a balanced budget. One of the \nkey issues in this debate centers on tax cuts--who should get them, who \nshouldn't benefit.\n  Well, I put to my colleagues the question: should tax breaks go to \nprofessional sports teams when they turn their back on an ironclad \ncommitment that is already backed by a Federal subsidy? I'm sure my \ncolleagues and all Americans know the answer to that question.\n  The Senate has a unique opportunity to start putting an end to the \nchaos in professional sports. The bill we are introducing today is the \nsecond step in that effort. I intend to continue pushing our Fans \nRights Act through Congress. We still need to grant leagues a limited \nanti-trust exemption related to team transfers. I am pleased that many \nof the witnesses at a Judiciary Committee yesterday agreed with this \n\n[[Page S496]]\npoint. I hope there is Senate action on that bill, and the one we are \nintroducing today, early this season.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to have worked with my colleague from \nOhio on this important legislation. It will provide a solution to a \nserious, yet limited, problem. I urge all Senators to support this \nbill.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BUMPERS:\n  S. 1530. A bill to create a government corporation to own and operate \nthe naval petroleum reserves and naval oil shale reserves, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n       the naval petroleum reserves and naval oil shale reserves \n                      corporatization act of 1996\n\n Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I introduce the Naval Petroleum \nReserves and Naval Oil Shale Reserves Corporatization Act of 1996. This \nbill would: First, create a government corporation to own and operate \nthe naval petroleum reserves and naval oil shale reserves; and second, \nauthorize the privatization of the corporation within 5 years if the \ntaxpayers receive a fair return.\n  The naval petroleum reserves consist of three fields: Elk Hills in \nCalifornia; Buena Vista Hills in California and Teapot Dome in Wyoming. \nThe Federal Government owns 100 percent of both Buena Vista Hills and \nTeapot Dome. However, the Government owns only 78 percent of Elk Hills. \nThe remaining 22 percent is owned by Chevron. Elk Hills is by far the \nmost significant area, making it one of the largest fields in the \nUnited States. In fact, Elk Hills produces approximately $400 million \nper year in revenues for the Federal Treasury.\n  Similarly, there are three naval oil shale reserves. Naval oil shale \nreserves 1 and 3 are located in northwest Colorado. Naval oil shale \nreserve 2 is located in eastern Utah. Unlike the Naval Petroleum \nreserves, there is no production from the oil shale reserves because \ndevelopment of oil shale is not currently economical. However, there is \nalso recoverable natural gas.\n  Both the administration and the majority party in Congress have, at \nvarious times, proposed that the naval petroleum reserves be sold and \nthe administration has also proposed that two of the three oil shale \nreserves be privatized as well. While I am not necessarily opposed to \nthe notion of removing the Government from the oil production business, \nI am troubled that the various proposals do not put the taxpayers' \ninterests first. The Congressional Budget Office [CBO] has estimated \nthat the sale of the naval petroleum reserves as originally proposed \nwould produce $1.55 billion in receipts. CBO also determined that the \nsale would actually cost the Government $992 million over 7 years \nbecause the reserves would produce approximately $2.5 billion in \nrevenues in the Government retains the assets during that same time \nperiod. While the CBO estimate does not take into account the \nappropriated expenditures made annually for operation and maintenance \nof the petroleum reserves, the sale of the assets would eliminate \npossibly billions of dollars worth of additional revenue that would be \nderived from the continued operation of the naval petroleum reserves \nover the life of the assets.\n  From 1987 until this year, Congress prohibited revenue derived from \nthe sale of Government assets from being scored for budget purposes. I \nstrongly opposed the change made to the asset sale scoring rule in this \nyear's budget resolution for exactly the reasons exemplified by the \nproposed sale of the naval petroleum reserves. It makes no sense to \nsell an asset for some quick cash when, in the long run, the loss of \nrevenues from the sold Government asset outweighs the funds derived \nfrom the sale. However, that is exactly what the budget rules now \npermit and, in fact, promote.\n\n  Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier, I am not necessarily opposed \nto the privatization of the naval petroleum reserves and the naval oil \nshale reserves. However, I am opposed to selling these assets for far \nless than they are worth to their current owners--the Americans \ntaxpayers.\n  The bill I am introducing today is designed to ensure that the value \nof these assets are maximized. First, by creating a Government \ncorporation, the naval petroleum reserves can be operated in a more \nefficient manner in the absence of burdensome restrictions placed on \nGovernment agencies. Second, the corporation will have the time to \nadequately evaluate the worth of the naval petroleum reserves and naval \noil shale reserves to make sure that if they are sold, the taxpayers \nreceive an adequate return. Finally, my bill authorizes the corporation \nto privatize, but only if the price paid by private investors is at \nleast equal to the net present value if the corporation remained in \nGovernment hands.\n  Government corporatization is not a new idea. In fact, the Department \nof Energy [DOE] proposed creating a Government corporation to own and \noperate the naval petroleum reserves in 1993. An internal DOE analysis \ndetermined that a Government corporation is the option that would \nproduce the greatest net present value associated with the naval \npetroleum reserves through 2040. In addition, in 1994 the National \nAcademy of Public Administration [NAPA] recommended that the naval \npetroleum and oil shale reserves be owned and operated by a Government \ncorporation. In fact, the Academy estimated that the net present value \nof the naval petroleum reserves, if they were owned by a Government \ncorporation, would be $4.1 billion. This is far greater than the $1.55 \nbillion which CBO estimates the sale of the petroleum reserves would \nproduce.\n  Mr. President, our constituents have sent us to Washington, in part, \nto act as their guardians by ensuring that their interests, as \ntaxpayers, are protected. Our obligations are not limited to making \nsure that the funds provided by their taxes are spent wisely. It is \nalso the duty of everyone in this body to require that when taxpayer-\nowned assets are disposed of, that the taxpayers receive a fair return. \nIt is beyond belief that anyone could argue that selling the naval \npetroleum reserves for $1.55 billion is a better choice than creating a \nGovernment corporation to own and operate the reserves which will \nprovide more than $4 billion adjusted for net present value.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me by cosponsoring the \nNaval Petroleum Reserves and Naval Oil Shale Reserves Corporatization \nAct of 1996. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nappear in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1530\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reimburse States and their political subdivisions \nfor emergency medical assistance provided to illegal aliens under their \ncustody as a result of Federal action; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n           immigration and naturalization service legislation\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this legislation would require the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service to reimburse States and \nlocalities for the cost of emergency ambulance services provided to \nillegal aliens injured while crossing the border. Currently, border \ncommunities pay the high cost associated with providing emergency \nambulance services to illegal aliens. Although Federal authorities \nconsistently have placed illegal aliens injured crossing the border in \nState and local custody in order to obtain medical services, the \nFederal authorities have failed to reimburse local Governors for the \nemergency ambulance services provided. As a result, Federal authorities \nhave left border States and localities to pick up the tab for a Federal \nresponsibility. This cannot continue.\n  In my home State of Arizona, the border city of Nogales has been \nparticularly impacted by the failure of Federal authorities to \nreimburse the city for the costs of transporting aliens injured while \ncrossing the border. Between April 22 and July 31, 1995, 44 calls were \nmade by the Border Patrol to the city requesting ambulance service for \nillegal aliens injured while crossing the border. Because these \npatients rarely pay their own ambulance transport bill, the financial \nburden on the city has become very heavy. The city has paid almost \n$200,000 in ambulance costs in the past 6 years. This cost is \nsignificant to Nogales, a border community which has only 20,000 \ninhabitants, a low tax base, and recently reported a $100,000 deficit. \nThe devaluation of the peso has left many Southwestern border \ncommunities in a similarly depressed financial position. Illegal \nimmigration is a Federal matter and our Nation's border communities \ncannot afford and should not be forced to pay for emergency ambulance \nservices provided at the request of Federal authorities. Again, that is \na Federal responsibility.\n  I recognize that a separate and much broader debate is being waged \nacross the Nation concerning a State's obligation to provide health \ncare and other social services to illegal aliens residing within its \nborders. That issue is much larger and remains to be resolved. Today, \nhowever, I believe we can all agree that Federal authorities who call \nupon local emergency ambulance services for injured illegal aliens \nshould be required to pay for those ambulance services. Our border \nStates and communities should not be saddled with this additional \nfinancial burden.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SIMON:\n  S. 1532. A bill to provide for the continuing operation of the Office \nof Federal Investigations of the Office of Personnel Management, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n     THE OFFICE OF FEDERAL INVESTIGATIONS PRIVATIZATION ACT OF 1996\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, 1 year ago, as part of the National \nPerformance Review, the administration announced that the Office of \nPersonnel Management [OPM] would privatize its investigative branch, \nthe Office of Federal Investigations [OFI]. The Treasury and Postal \nService conference report directs OPM not to implement a reduction in \nforce before March 31, 1996, in order to allow the GAO to conduct a \ncost-benefit analysis. OPM is prepared to initiate an employee stock \nownership plan [ESOP], which would have a sole source contract with OPM \nfor the first 2 to 3 years, after which contracts would be offered to \nprivate firms. I am very concerned that privatization is \n\n[[Page S499]]\nnot the best approach in this important area.\n  Today I offer legislation that would prevent immediate privatization \nof this extremely important Government function. For over 40 years, the \nOFI has been responsible for conducting background investigations for \npotential employees of various agencies within the Federal Government, \nincluding the Department of Energy, the Department of Justice, and the \nTreasury Department. Overall, OFI conducts about 40 percent of all \nFederal background investigations for positions ranging from \nbureaucratic responsibilities to high-ranking positions requiring \nsubstantial security clearances. In my view, shifting this \nresponsibility to the private sector raises a host of extremely \nimportant questions which must be addressed before the decision to \nprivatize is made.\n  First, we must ensure that our national security is not in any way \njeopardized by a move to privatization. Currently, OFI does background \nchecks on individuals that will ultimately have access to top secret \ninformation, including weapons systems and nuclear energy data. We need \nto ask ourselves if this is the type of information that we want a \nprivate investigator to have access to. If the answer is ``yes,'' \ncertainly we need to carefully review the safeguards needed to ensure \nthat our national interests remain secure.\n  The ability of private firms to maintain the privacy of sensitive \nrecords is another area that needs to be looked at closely. A private \ncontractor would potentially have the ability to amass large quantities \nof information on Government employees. Although OPM has suggested that \nthey would have the ability to keep records private, I have not heard \nspecific measures that could be taken to guarantee this. Serious study \nmust be given to what measures can and should be taken to protect \nprivacy.\n  We must also ensure that quality investigations will continue to be \nconducted. The Federal Government currently uses private investigators \nfor a very small fraction of background checks. The only experience \nwith private investigators on a large scale produced numerous \ninvestigations that were not up to standard, or, even in a fraction of \ncases, were falsified. This must not happen again. What safeguards can \nand should OPM put in place to ensure that quality is maintained? We \nmust be certain that quality can be maintained before we make the \ndecision to privatize.\n  It is also important to ask ourselves if private investigators will \nbe able to provide the best available information to Government \nagencies. Will they have difficulty obtaining vital information from \nlaw enforcement officials? In a preliminary study, the General \nAccounting Office [GAO] determined that law enforcement officials may \nbe reluctant to give out sensitive information to private \ninvestigators. This issue deserves further study.\n  I have asked the GAO, as part of their ongoing cost-benefit analysis, \nto address my concerns and report their findings to me before the end \nof January, 1996. In addition, I sent a letter to a number of Federal \nagencies asking for their input on the effect of privatization. In \nresponse to my inquiry, I was told that privatization could cause \ndisruptions to operations and that the quality of investigations could \nsuffer. I urge my colleagues to think carefully about the negative \nimpact that may be created by privatization.\n  My comments are not meant to imply that private contractors cannot \nperform top quality investigations while also ensuring privacy and \nprotecting our national security. It is certainly conceivable that they \ncould. However, before this decision is made, we must be sure that \nadequate study of the potential impact has been conducted.\n  The legislation I offer today would prevent privatization from \noccurring for 2 years, during which time OFI would be prohibited from \nreducing its number of full-time employees. In addition, the bill would \nrequire OPM and the GAO to issue a comprehensive report detailing the \nlikely effect of privatization on all of the issues that I have \naddressed.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. While I certainly \nsupport the goals of the Clinton administration's National Performance \nReview, and applaud efforts to eliminate Government waste, Federal \ninvestigators employed by the government have served all of us \nextremely well, and we should proceed with great caution before \nchanging this role.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 1533. A bill to provide an opportunity for community renewal and \neconomic growth in empowerment zones and enterprise communities, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n       the community renewal and economic opportunity act of 1996\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to introduce \nthe Community Renewal and Economic Opportunity Act of 1996.\n  The bill contains 10 major initiatives to revive communities \nafflicted by joblessness and crime and to help the neediest Americans \nbetter provide for themselves and their families.\n  Included in the bill are measures to foster new job opportunities and \neconomic development in America's poorest communities through targeted \ntax incentives; to improve public infrastructure in blighted areas by \nchanneling a greater percentage of Federal grant monies to the neediest \ncommunities and by lowering the cost of project construction; to \ninvigorate the fight against violent crime which most seriously affects \nlow-income neighborhoods by allowing local law enforcement agencies to \nkeep a greater amount of forfeited criminal assets and by requiring \nfamily opportunities for needy innocent victims; to increase family \nopportunities for needy children by banning racial discrimination in \nadoption; and to promote voluntarism by protecting volunteers against \nliability.\n  All Americans, no matter who they are, where they live, or the color \nof their skin, deserve the opportunity to provide for their families, \nto pursue their aspirations and to share fully in the American dream.\n  History teaches us that there's no panacea for poverty and crime, \nbut, no matter how intractable the problem, it is the essence of the \nAmerican character to constantly advance our society so that the social \nand economic progress of each generation exceeds that of its \npredecessor. No American is unimportant. As a nation, we have a solemn \nobligation to help those in need to help themselves. Our success in \nthat endeavor is bound only by the limits of our energy and \nimagination.\n  It is painfully clear that the traditional welfare state response to \npoverty and community decay has been a miserable failure. Over the past \n30 years, we have spent over $5 trillion on poverty programs, yet \nmillions of Americans remain ensnared in the grinding cycle of \ndependence and need. The time is now for new ideas and approaches to \nrestore hope and increase economic opportunity for all Americans.\n  The most effective way to revive American communities mired in \npoverty and to improve the quality of life is to provide job \nopportunities and sustainable economic development. A job and a \npaycheck are the most effective welfare programs. And, as any mayor or \ncity council member in our country can attest, a healthy tax base \nproduced by an employed population is the most potent prescription for \ncommunity renewal.\n  Accordingly, the first title of the bill authorizes a battery of new \nand expanded tax incentives to attract businesses to blighted areas and \nto hire economically disadvantaged residents.\n  Four years ago, Congress designated 9 of the poorest communities in \nAmerica as enterprise zones and 90 others as enterprise communities. \nThe designation made these communities eligible for a host of tax \nincentives and other community renewal programs. This was an excellent \nstep but inadequate in scope.\n  Currently, the law provides special tax benefits only to enterprise \nzone businesses which hire at least 35 percent of their employees from \nthe local community. The bill I'm introducing would enhance the tax \nincentive by allowing firms to take an additional ten percent tax \ncredit if they increase their local hiring rate to 50 percent.\n  Furthermore, the bill extends eligibility for the credit beyond \nenterprise zones to include qualified businesses within the 90 \nenterprise communities, as well as 90 additional poverty stricken \neconomic recovery areas--areas \n\n[[Page S500]]\nwhich will be designated by the Secretary of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment.\n  Many communities are suffering economic distress as deeply as the \nareas we have officially designated as enterprise zones, and they \ndeserve the opportunity to attract the jobs and economic development \nthey so desperately need.\n  Mr. President, the 10-percent tax credit will serve as a strong \nincentive for businesses to form within economically depressed areas \nand to increase the hiring of local residents. However, the bill I'm \nintroducing today would also authorize what I believe might be an even \nmore powerful alternative inducement--a low 10-percent flat tax.\n  The bill would allow businesses within federally designated \nenterprise zones, enterprise communities, and economic renewal areas \nwhich hire at least half of their employees from the local community to \npay a simple 10-percent flat tax. Simplifying taxes and offering a low \nincentive rate as an alternative to today's excessive and byzantine tax \nrules, might prove to be the most potent inducement for businesses to \ninvest in places and in people that need the helping hand.\n  I look forward to hearing from employers on the relative merits of \nthe flat tax and the credit option.\n  No matter which option an employer might choose, it's clear that once \na company has opted to locate within a blighted area and to assume the \nassociated risk, one of the biggest challenges will be to attract the \ncapital and investment necessary for the enterprise to survive and \ngrow.\n  To address this need, the bill once again would use our tax system to \nstimulate the necessary investment. Specifically, the bill would make \nstock dividends from qualified enterprise zone and enterprise community \nbusinesses nontaxable, and it would eliminate the capital gains tax for \ninvestments held at least 5 years within designated enterprise zones, \nenterprise communities and economic recovery areas. Exempting dividends \nand capital gains within our poorest areas from taxes should attract a \nhealthy flow of job-producing capital investment.\n  So, Mr. President, this bill provides substantial new tax-based \nincentives for companies to assume the risk of locating within blighted \nareas and to invest in their human resources. However, we must \nrecognize that poverty and economic disadvantage do not confine \nthemselves within certain municipal boundaries. Economically \ndisadvantaged people reside in practically every community and we have \nan obligation to help these Americans even if they do not happen to \nlive within areas of the most severe poverty.\n  Accordingly, the bill would expand the work opportunity tax credit \npassed by Congress last year. The bill would raise the credit from 35 \npercent for the first $6,000 in wages for a targeted economically \ndisadvantaged employee to 35 percent for the first $12,000 in wages.\n  Expanding the credit will provide a greater incentive for businesses, \nno matter where they are located, to hire economically disadvantaged \nindividuals; and will discourage the practice of rapidly turning over \nemployees in order to maximize the tax credit.\n  Most importantly, the bill expands the list of individuals who \nqualify for the work opportunity tax credit. As currently conceived, \nthe credit would be available only to residents of enterprise zones and \nenterprise communities; recipients of AFDC; vocational rehabilitation \nrecipients and Summer Youth. The bill extends the credit to individuals \nwho have been chronically unemployed, have few assets, and have been \nliving for a significant period of time under the poverty level.\n  A flexible, transportable, and more widely applied credit will help \nneedy individuals no matter where they reside or by whom they are \nemployed.\n  Mr. President, we all recognize that it's one thing to attract \nbusinesses to the poorest communities and encourage them to hire the \nmost economically disadvantaged Americans by sweetening the tax \nincentives, but ensuring that such firms are sustainable and can \novercome the many risks they assume to succeed in quite another.\n  Accordingly, the second major thrust of the bill's first title is to \nuse the purchasing power of the Federal Government to assist risk-\ntaking entrepreneurs and corporations who are willing to help poor \nAmericans.\n  The bill would accomplish that goal by reforming the Small Business \nAdministration's (8)(a) set-aside program. The current program provides \nFederal contract set-asides to businesses based on the race or \nethnicity of the business owner. The bill would reorient the program by \nmaking the set-asides available to businesses that hire economically \ndisadvantaged Americans regardless of their race, creed, or color.\n  As my colleagues are aware, the current (8)(a)program has been rife \nwith fraud and abuse. The record is replete with unsavory examples of \nunscrupulous individuals establishing shell corporations to obtain set-\naside benefits and cases in which very wealthy and successful \nenterprises remain in the program when they can and should compete \nquite nicely through the normal competitive contracting process.\n  Mr. President, America is based on the concept of equality among all \npeople. As a society that aspires full equality and color blindness, \nthe time for special programs that focus on the race and ethnicity of \nparticular Americans rather than their economic status is past. A needy \nAmerican is a needy American no matter their race, creed, color, or \ngender. Certainly, the Supreme Court's decision in the Adarand case \nemphasized that reality that, by and large, race-based set-asides do \nnot comport with the fundamental tenets of equality and equal \nprotection.\n  The original purpose of the 8(a) program was to assist economically \ndisadvantaged Americans without regard to race or gender. I believe we \ncan return the program to its original intent, and assist far more \nneedy people than today's ownership-based program by providing set-\nasides to businesses located within enterprise zones and communities as \nwell as to other firms which train and employ a significant percentage \nof economically disadvantaged individuals.\n  Exactly how do we determine who is an ``economically disadvantaged \nindividual''? For purposes of this bill, EDI's are defined as: (1) \nindividuals who live within EZ's or EC's; (2) individuals who have \nassets no greater than the ceiling allowed for AFDC eligibility; who \nwere not claimed as a dependent for 4 years preceding the date of their \nhiring; and whose income did not exceed the poverty level in either the \nyear before their hiring nor in 3 of the 4 years before their hiring; \nor (3) individuals with a dependent; who have assets no greater than \nthe ceiling allowed for AFDC eligibility; who were not claimed as a \ndependent for 4 years preceding the date of their hiring; and whose \nincome did not exceed the poverty level during the year prior to their \nhiring.\n  Once designated as an EDI an individual would retain the designation \nfor 5 years, which should be ample time for the employee to receive \ntraining and to establish a work history. Reorienting the 8(a) program \nas provided by this bill will help us to achieve the goals of assisting \neconomically disadvantaged individuals more fairly and effectively.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the first title of the bill recognizes the \nimportant role private entrepreneurship can and should play in serving \nthe needs of our poorest communities and that we must do a better job \nof promoting start-up enterprises. Toward that end, the bill would \nestablish a business mentor program under the auspices of the Small \nBusiness Administration. The program would pair businesses owned by \neconomically disadvantaged individuals with mentor businesses and \nlending institutions.\n  Pairing start-up enterprises owned by individuals who live within \npoverty stricken areas with established mentor businesses will enhance \nthe success of first-time business owners creating additional jobs and \neconomic opportunity.\n  Mr. President, again, I want to stress a bill cannot be written that \nwill solve the problem of joblessness and poverty. But, I believe we \ncan make significant gains by employing the kinds of incentives \nproposed by the bill I've introduced today. The incentives are not \nperfect and I look forward to a detailed debate on the initiatives to \nensure that we craft incentives that will be as appropriate and cost-\neffective as possible.\n  Mr. President, the second major title of this bill is designed to \nassist depressed communities in improving their infrastructure. Strong \ninfrastructure and dependable public works such \n\n[[Page S501]]\nas roads, utilities, schools, and other public accommodations, are \ncritical to improving the quality of life and to fostering sustainable \ncommunity development. This bill would lower the cost of constructing \nand operating public facilities by repealing the the Davis-Bacon Act \nwithin enterprise zones and enterprise communities.\n  The Davis-Bacon Act requires that the prevailing union wages be paid \non all contracts and subcontracts for construction projects that \nutilize Federal monies. This costly Federal mandate inflates the price \nof infrastructure and disproportionately impacts poorer communities. \nMoreover it makes it more difficult for entry level job seekers to \nobtain training and work.\n  In addition, the bill would channel a greater share of Federal \nCommunity Development Block Grant moneys to the neediest counties and \ncities.\n  The Federal CDBG program was created to promote local economic and \ncommunity development. Current law requires that 70 percent of these \ngrant monies be channeled to disadvantaged communities. The bill \nincreases the amount to 75 percent and cuts the percentage allowed for \nadministrative overhead from 20 percent to 10 percent so that more \ndollars can flow to bricks and mortar projects in needy areas.\n  Furthermore, the bill would require wealthier communities to cost-\nshare any CDBG grants they may receive. Greenwich, CT and Beverly \nHills, CA are fine communities, but we should not be spending scarce \nFederal economic development aid in communities that can well afford to \nmeet their own needs, at the expense of much needier areas.\n  The third title of the bill seeks to improve educational \nopportunities in the poorest communities. Quality education is the key \nto improving the lives of our youth and helping to break the cycle of \npoverty.\n  The bill authorizes a Federal school voucher system within enterprise \nzones and enterprise communities. Empowering parents to send their \nchildren to the schools that best meet their needs will increase the \nquality of educational opportunity. The program would in no way require \nthe affected local school districts to diminish or reallocate their own \nfunding. The Federal monies would be additional to the local funds \ncurrently used to run the affected school districts.\n  The fourth title of the bill seeks to make our streets safer. The \ngravest threat to quality of life and community redevelopment within \nblighted areas is violent crime. The streets must be made safer and \nvictims must be treated compassionately and justly.\n  The bill allows counties and cities which have a high rate of violent \ncrime to retain a higher share of Federal asset forfeiture proceeds \nunder the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organization (RICO) statutes.\n  Current law allows local law enforcement agencies which participate \nin a Federal RICO operation to have a share of the proceeds from asset \nforfeiture. The bill would authorize an additional 25 percent share for \ncommunities that suffer from inordinately high rates of violent crime. \nThe additional resources would be used for violent crime control \nprograms.\n  In addition, the safe streets title authorizes mandatory restitution \nfor certain violent crimes, and increases victim assistance resources \nby boosting fines against Federal felons. This title mirrors \nlegislation that I had the privilege to work on with Senator Hatch, \nSenator Nickles, Senator Biden, and other Members last year.\n  The bill's fifth title seeks to promote family opportunities for poor \nchildren. The family unit is the foundation of our society. A loving \nand supportive family is the key to a child's development into a \nhealthy and productive member of the community.\n  The bill prohibits racial discrimination in adoption. Many adoption \nagencies make adoption decisions based on inappropriate racial \nconsiderations. Consequently, countless children, many of them \nminorities from the inner city remain in foster care, denied the \nopportunity for a loving family.\n  Finally, the bill seeks to promote voluntarism. America has a proud \ntradition of neighbor helping neighbor which must be nurtured and \nsustained if we are to revitalize America's communities, particularly \nthose poverty stricken areas most needful of help.\n  The bill encourages states to pass laws protecting volunteers against \nlawsuits. The provision is modeled after legislation introduced by \nCongressman John Porter of Illinois. It's fundamentally unfair that we \ncontinue to subject volunteers to the threat of liability when they \nshare their time, resources and expertise to help the community. \nIncreasing exposure to liability in our ever litigious society will \nchill voluntarism to the detriment of all communities.\n  Mr. President, as I said, I do not pretend this bill is the answer to \nall our inner city problems. Far from it. But, I believe it provides \nsome excellent initiatives which will help us make a real difference in \nimproving lives and communities of areas that need and deserve the help \nof a caring nation.\n  Moreover, I am convinced we can enact these or very similar \ninitiatives without worsening the deficit. The programs that require \noutlays or offsets, such as the package of tax credits, can be paid for \nby reductions in non-essential programs that are of a lower priority \nincluding, I might add, corporate pork.\n  This bill is by no means perfect or complete. I believe it is a \nstarting point for more vigorous debate and action to meet the \nchallenges of the poorest Americans and the neediest communities. I \nlook forward to a dialogue on the bill and the issues it raises, and to \nhearing the many other suggestions about how most effectively to end \nthe cycle of poverty and dependence.\n  One suggestion I would make is that the appropriate committees hold \nfield hearings and engage the Americans who live in the poorest \ncommunities in the debate over how best we can help them to meet the \nneeds of their families and their neighborhoods.\n  Too often politicians cloak themselves within the insulated, and many \ntimes, out of touch environs of the Capitol as we devise the policies \nthat affect millions of lives. Perhaps it's time we more diligently \nconsult and work with real people and address their realities as we \nendeavor to meet our oath of office and the needs of our great Nation.\n  I am pleased to note that his bill is strongly supported by Secretary \nJack Kemp of Empower America. Such an endorsement is germane and is as \nfitting as it is welcome, because personal and community empowerment is \nwhat this bill is about. It's about new alternatives to the failed \nprescriptions of the past. It's about recognizing that every American \ncounts and that a leg up to self-sufficiency is more lasting, \nmeaningful, and compassionate than a handout; and that a caring nation \ncan and must help all of those who truly need assistance to participate \nin the social, economic and political freedom that is the essence of \nthe American dream.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Community Renewal and Economic Opportunity Act of 1996\n\n\n                 title i--jobs, paychecks, and tax base\n\n       The most effective way to revive America's poverty stricken \n     communities and to improve the quality of life for \n     economically disadvantaged residents is to stimulate job \n     creation and sustainable economic development--jobs, \n     paychecks and tax base. This title provides a battery of new \n     and expanded incentives for businesses to form and capitalize \n     within blighted areas and to hire local residents.\n     I. Tax credits and businesses that hire economically \n         disadvantaged individuals within blighted areas\n       Enables each qualified business located within a federally \n     designated Enterprise Zone and Enterprise Community to deduct \n     ten percent of its tax liability if 50 percent of its \n     employees are residents of the zone.\n       Current law provides special tax incentives to businesses \n     within the 9 designated Enterprise Zones if 35 percent of \n     their employees are residents of the area. Increasing the \n     incentive and expanding it to the 90 enterprise communities \n     and beyond (see below) will increase employment opportunities \n     for residents of blighted areas.\n       Authorizes the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development \n     to designate an additional 90 poverty stricken communities in \n     which businesses would be eligible for the 10 percent \n     negative surtax.\n       Many communities are suffering the same economic distress \n     as areas designated to be Enterprise Zones and Communities. \n     Extending the credit to other economically distressed areas \n     will stimulate job creation and tax base.\n     \n[[Page S502]]\n\n       Authorizes zero capital gains tax for investments held for \n     at least five years within Enterprise Zones and Economic \n     Communities.\n       A zero capital gains tax will spur investment and economic \n     activity within economically depressed areas.\n     II. Tax incentives for hiring economically disadvantaged \n         individuals regardless of business location or employee \n         residence\n       Expands the Work opportunity Tax Credit from 35 percent for \n     the first $6,000 in wages for a targeted economically \n     disadvantaged employee to, 35 percent for the first $12,000 \n     in wages.\n       Expanding the credit will provide a greater incentive for \n     businesses, no matter where they are located, to hire \n     economically disadvantaged individuals; and will reduce the \n     rapid turnover of economically disadvantaged employees in \n     order for businesses to take maximum advantage of the credit.\n       Expands the list of individuals who qualify for the Work \n     Opportunity Tax Credit to include individuals who have been \n     chronically unemployable.\n       The current Work Opportunity Tax Credit is available to \n     residents within Economic Zones and Enterprise Communities; \n     Recipients of AFDC; Vocational Rehabilitation recipients; and \n     Summer Youth. The bill expands the list to include \n     individuals who have been chronically unemployed, have few \n     assets and have been living for a period of time under the \n     poverty level.\n     III. Alternative flat tax for firms located in blighted areas \n         which hire local residents\n       Authorizes businesses within enterprise Zones ad Enterprise \n     Communities to replace their current tax liability with a 10-\n     percent flat tax option if 50 percent of their employees \n     reside within the zone.\n       A low flat tax can be a powerful incentive for businesses \n     to locate within economically distressed areas, and to hire \n     residents of those communities.\n     IV. Investor incentives to attract capital for firms located \n         in blighted areas\n       Makes stock dividends from businesses within Enterprise \n     Zones and Economic Communities non-taxable.\n       Tax free dividends will spur capital formation for \n     businesses which locate in economically distressed \n     communities and employ residents of high unemployment areas.\n     V. Contracting set-asides for business who hire and train \n         economically disadvantaged individuals\n       Transforms the SBA (8)(a) set-aside program from one that \n     provides federal contracting set-asides to businesses based \n     on the race or ethnicity of the owner, to one based on the \n     economic disadvantage of the business' employees.\n       Providing set-aside contracts to businesses located within \n     EZ and EC's or which hire economically disadvantaged people \n     will enable the federal government to utilize its purchasing \n     power to help a greater number of needy people in a more fair \n     and racially blind manner.\n       EDI's are defined as: (1) individuals who live within EZ's \n     or EC's, or (2) Individuals who have assets no greater than \n     the ceiling allowed for AFDC eligibility; who were not \n     claimed as a dependent for four years preceding the date of \n     their hiring; and whose income did not exceed the poverty \n     level in the year before their hiring nor in three of the \n     four years before their hiring, or (3) Individuals with a \n     dependent; who have assets no greater than the ceiling \n     allowed for AFDC eligibility; who were not claimed as a \n     dependent for four years preceding the date of their hiring; \n     and whose income did not exceed the poverty level during the \n     year prior to their hiring. Once designated as an EDI for \n     purposes of this program an individual retains the EDI \n     designation for a period of five years.\n     VI. Business ownership mentor program\n       Establishes a mentor program under the SBA to pair \n     businesses owned by economically disadvantaged individuals \n     with mentor businesses and lending institutions.\n       Pairing start-up enterprises owned by individuals who live \n     within poverty stricken areas with mentor businesses will \n     enhance the success of first time business owners.\n\n\n            title ii--utilities, schools and infrastructure\n\n       Successful and sustainable community development depends \n     upon healthy infrastructure and public works including \n     transportation, utilities, schools and other public \n     accommodations. Lowering the cost of constructing and \n     operating public facilities and providing additional \n     resources to poverty stricken communities is vital to \n     improving the quality of life within these areas.\n       Repeals Davis-Bacon within Enterprise Zones and Enterprise \n     Communities.\n       The Davis-Bacon Act requires the payment of prevailing \n     union wages for any contract or subcontract which utilizes \n     federal funding. The rule inflates the cost of public \n     facilities and disproportionately impacts poverty stricken \n     communities which have fewer resources.\n       Channels a greater share of federal Community Development \n     Block Grant monies to the neediest counties and cities.\n       The federal CDBG program was created to assist communities \n     with economic and community development project. Currently, \n     70 percent of these grant monies are to be channeled to \n     disadvantaged communities. The bill increases the amount to \n     75 percent and cuts the percentage allowed for administrative \n     overhead from 20 to 10 percent and calls on wealthier \n     communities to cost share CDBG grants so that more dollars \n     can flow to bricks and mortar projects in needy areas.\n\n\n                     title iii--educational choice\n\n       Quality education is the key to improving the lives of our \n     youth and helping to break the cycle of poverty.\n       Authorizes a federal school voucher program within \n     enterprise zones and enterprise communities.\n       Empowering parents to send their children to the schools \n     that best meet their needs will increase and improve the \n     educational opportunity of Americans who reside within \n     blighted communities. Educational quality will dramatically \n     improve with competition. The bill would authorize voucher \n     payments to families within EZ and EC and would not redirect \n     or diminish the local funding of area schools.\n\n\n                         title iv--safe streets\n\n       The gravest threat to quality of life and community \n     redevelopment within blighted areas is violent crime. The \n     streets must be made safer and victims must be treated \n     compassionately and justly.\n       Allows counties and cities which have a high rate of \n     violent crime to retain a higher share of federal asset \n     forfeiture proceeds under the Racketeer Influence Corrupt \n     Organization (RICO) statutes.\n       Current law allows local law enforcement agencies which \n     participate in a federal asset seizure to a percentage of the \n     asset proceeds. The percentage reflects the level of \n     participation by the local agency. The bill allows an \n     additional 20 percent of the asset proceed to go to \n     communities that are disproportionately affected by violent \n     crime.\n       Authorizes mandatory restitution for certain violent \n     crimes, and increases the federal Crime Victim Fund by \n     increasing fines against federal felons.\n       Current law does not mandate that violent criminal \n     compensate their victims.\n\n\n                      title vi--family opportunity\n\n       The family unit is the foundation of our society. A loving \n     and supportive family is the key to a child's development \n     into a healthy and productive member of the community.\n       Prohibits racial discrimination in adoption which deprives \n     millions of children from the opportunity to have a family.\n       Many adoption agencies make adoption decisions based on \n     racial consideration. Consequently countless children, many \n     of them minorities from the inner city remain in foster care, \n     denied the opportunity for permanent family placement.\n\n\n                         title vii--voluntarism\n\n       America has a proud tradition of neighbor helping neighbor \n     which must be nurtured and sustained if we are to revitalize \n     America's communities, particularly those poverty stricken \n     areas most in need of a helping hand.\n       Encourages states to pass laws protecting volunteers \n     against lawsuits.\n       It's fundamentally unfair that we continue to subject \n     volunteers to the threat of liability when they share their \n     time, resources and expertise to help the community. The \n     exposure to liability in our increasingly litigious society \n     will chill voluntarism to the detriment of all \n     communities.\n                                 ______\n\n\n             By Mr. HATFIELD (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n\n  S. 1534. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide \nadditional support for and to expand clinical research programs, and \nfor other purposes; to the Commission on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n             THE CLINICAL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 1996\n\n Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, the proud tradition of American \nleadership in science and health care has been an important factor in \nour international stature and our domestic quality of life. This \ntradition is however vulnerable and may wither if not nurtured. The CBO \npredicts that national expenditures for health will reach the \nastonishing sum of $1,613 billion by the year 2000. This an \nastronomical sum for a nation who seemingly can meet its health care \nneeds. Investments in biomedical research offer the only reasonable \nhope of reducing not only monetary costs, but, more importantly, human \nsuffering.\n  Biomedical research is commonly thought of as existing in two \nspheres. The first is ``basic'' research in which fundamental \nbiological principles are studied primarily in laboratories using \nmolecules, cells or animals. The second is ``clinical'' or patient \noriented research [POR], in which the scientific principles discovered \nin the lab are applied to patients with disease. To determine which of \nseveral medicines is most effective in curing a cancer, careful \ncomparison of these drugs is necessary in large groups of real people. \nTo understand which of several different types of treatment: medical, \nsurgical, or nutritional is best in helping patients not merely for the \nshort run but over time, the various treatment \n\n[[Page S503]]\noptions must be tried systematically on real people. The emphasis is on \npeople. We must use the knowledge gained by biomedical research to help \npeople get better.\n  Both aspects of biomedical research are essential because they depend \nupon each other--without the foundation of basic research, clinical \nresearch would be impossible. For example the current successful \ntreatment of sickle cell Anemia which so cruelly strikes young people, \nhad its origins in basic research from the development of chicken \nembryos. Medications which modified chicken embryonic cells were found \nto also enable monkeys to manufacture certain types of hemoglobin, \nhemoglobin a component of blood cells necessary to combat thalassemia \nand sickle cell disease. The studies moved from basic research in \nchickens to monkeys and finally to clinical research in humans leading \nto a successful therapy for a previously terrible disorder.\n  Yet despite their mutual importance clinical research has failed to \nreceive the support necessary to permit us to fully benefit from the \nadvances of basic research. The proposal for a national fund for health \nresearch which Senator Harkin and I have introduced goes a long way to \nprevent the possibility of robbing funds from Peter to pay Paul. We \nneed more money in the system, but we also will have a better balance \nbetween basic and clinical research.\n  The Institute of Medicine has recently published an exhaustive report \nwhich concludes that clinical research is in a state of crisis. A state \nwhich if not addressed will result in: a serious deficiency of clinical \nexpertise; a paucity of effective clinical interventions; an increase \nin human suffering and disability; and ultimately an increase in the \ncost of medical care.\n  Historically clinical research has resulted in marked improvements in \ncare and costs. A $1.2 million investment in neonatal screening for \nsubnormal thyroid has saved $206 million in treatment costs annually. A \n$679,000 investment in developing a treatment for recurring renal \nstones has resulted in an estimated savings of $300 million annually. A \nmulticenter clinical trial of interventions in stroke prevention cost \napproximately $4.6 million. Its results could prevent 20 to 30,000 \nstrokes per year with an annual savings of $200 million. All of these \nand many other achievements have occurred because of the ability of \nclinical research to take knowledge derived from basic research to the \nbedside, bridging the gap between the laboratory and the patient.\n  Yet despite its clear societal and economic benefits, clinical \nresearch is in crisis. The amount and proportion of personnel and \nfiscal resources devoted to clinical research, particularly at the NIH \nhas fallen to levels which place our Nation at a severe disadvantage. \nUnable to capitalize on new discoveries, the quality of life of our \npatients slowly falls as ironically our costs continue to rise. The \nnature of this crisis is threefold a relative lack of: people involved \nin clinical research; an infrastructure to adequately select and \nsupport the best clinical research; and declining fiscal investment in \nbiomedical research overall.\n\n\n                                 PEOPLE\n\n  While the United States continues to train large numbers of excellent \nyoung physicians the proportion of those choosing careers in clinical \nresearch becomes ever smaller. The Association of American Medical \nColleges [AAMC] survey of 1994 medical graduates found that only 10 \npercent of these young physicians intended to enter research careers. \nStudents enrolled in public medical schools were much less likely to \nchoose research careers than those attending private institutions.\n  America's teaching hospitals have of necessity increased the \nproportion of their income derived from service from 12.2 percent \n1971-- to 38.5 percent--1988. As a result the proportion of physicians \nin those institutions who are active in research has fallen from 40 to \n25 percent. This leaves fewer clinicians available for instruction of \nstudents and fewer investigators for clinical research.\n\n\n                              INSTITUTIONS\n\n  Our medical schools need to increase their focus on the training of \nstudents for clinical research careers. Fully 58 percent of 1994 \ngraduates reported inadequate instruction in research techniques. \nUnlike the situation in Ph.D. programs for basic research, there is no \nclear academic pathway into a clinical research career. Only 11 percent \nof physicians in clinical departments are principle investigators of \nNIH grants. This compares unfavorably to 27 percent rate for Ph.D.'s. \nAs a result there are relatively fewer role models for young clinical \nresearchers.\n  Our ability to fund new research ideas has not been able to keep pace \nwith the development of new initiatives. It is extremely difficult for \nyoung clinical investigators to even obtain research funding. Only 55 \npercent of all applicants for NIH grants are ever funded. The overall \nnumber of research grant applications has increased by 42 percent from \n14,142 in 1980 to 20,154 in 1990. The number of new grant applications \nfunded has actually fallen by 15 percent from 5,400 in 1989 to 4,600 in \n1990. This is complicated by the fact that the greatest proportion of \nresearch grants goes to continue funding previously granted awards, 70 \npercent. So that ever increasing number of new projects compete with an \never smaller pool of resources.\n  The emphasis is so heavily weighted toward basic research that the \nNIH has difficulty determining just what proportion of funded studies \nare directed at patients. The Institute of Medicine estimates that only \n10.4 percent of all NIH funded research is clinical research. Only 20 \npercent of grant reviewers are physicians, therefore the expertise \nnecessary to critically review clinical research applications is \nconsiderably less than that for basic research. With the proportion of \nfunded proposals falling to approximately 25 percent of submissions the \nodds of gaining grant funding are now low enough that young \ninvestigators are turning away from clinical research careers. The NIH \nhas recognized these deficiencies and has made recommendations to \nreverse this trend. Implementation however requires more resources.\n  Implementation also requires cooperation from the community of health \ncare providers. Many insurance companies and managed care plans \ndiscourage or prevent persons from participating in clinical studies. \nThis limits access to potentially helpful therapies for patients, and \ninhibits the ability of researchers to find patients to work with and \nhence make new discoveries. Insurers who eventually benefit from new \ntreatments which by alleviating illness lowers costs, must contribute \nto the process by encouraging rather than discouraging patient \nparticipation.\n\n\n                                FUNDING\n\n  The level of support for biomedical research, particularly for the 75 \ngeneral clinical research centers, has been relatively flat over the \npast 5 years, just barely keeping up with inflation.\n  The resulting increased competition by more investigators for a piece \nof an ever smaller pie results in a stagnation and atmosphere where \ninnovation and clinical research is sublimated for short term \nlaboratory based projects which produce publishable results quickly.\n  The legislation I and my colleague Senator Kennedy are introducing \ntoday, the Clinical Research Enhancement Act, will rectify these \nproblems by: First, establishing a President's Research Advisory Panel \nwithin the Office of Science and Technology Policy, [OSTP]. This panel \nwill regularly evaluate the status of clinical research in the United \nStates so that we are continually aware of our progress. It will make \nrecommendations for any necessary improvements in clinical research and \nmonitor them to ensure that we reach our goals.\n  Second, we will increase the involvement of the NIH in clinical \nresearch. The Director of NIH will establish intramural clinical \nresearch fellowship programs to train clinical researchers. There will \nbe increases in the number of FIRST Grants for young investigators, and \nby implementing the recommendations of the NIH's own Clinical Research \nStudy Group improve the merit review process for evaluating \napplications.\n  Third, we will stabilize the funding of general clinical research \ncenters. It is within these centers that much of the training of young \ninvestigators as well as actual clinical research is done.\n  Fourth, we will create new opportunities for career development in \nclinical research. This through the development of clinical research \ncareer enhancement awards, and expansion of \n\n[[Page S504]]\nthe Loan Repayment Program for Clinical Researchers.\n  Fifth, we will establish innovative medial service awards to \nstimulate the development of new and creative clinical research \nproposals.\n  Rectifying the disparagement between support of basic and clinical \nresearch will serve to more effectively promote the types of \ndiscoveries that we have all come to expect. It is my hope that this \nproposal for clinical research enhancement is not seen as simply \nanother cost of health care, but as a way, really the only way to \neventually reduce costs both in terms of dollars and human life.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting legislation to enhance \nthe pipeline for clinical researchers.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   The Clinical Research Enhancement Act of 1996--Section-by-Section \n                                Summary\n\n       Section 1--Short Title: The Clinical Research Enhancement \n     Act of 1996\n       Section 2--Findings and Purposes: Clinical research, \n     patient-oriented research requiring the participation of a \n     human subject, is in decline. Independent studies at the \n     National Research Council, the National Institute of Medicare \n     and the National Academy of Sciences have all addressed the \n     current problems in clinical research. The decline in young \n     clinical investigators is attributed to a heavy debt burden, \n     lack of a federal support system, and lack of a formal \n     training regime. It is the purpose of this Act to provide for \n     a mechanism to address these problems and a stimulus for \n     physicians to enter clinical research.\n       Section 3--President's Clinical Research Panel: The \n     President shall establish within the Office of Science and \n     Technology Policy, a panel, to evaluate the status of the \n     national clinical research environment, and prepare periodic \n     progress reports to the President. It will be composed of \n     representatives from clinical research, insurance and \n     pharmaceutical companies, health maintenance organizations, \n     accreditation and certification organizations, academic \n     research administrators and patients. Its members will be \n     nominated by the President of the Institute of Medicine.\n       Section 4--NIH Director's Advisory Committee on Clinical \n     Research: The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall \n     designate the advisory committee established by the Director \n     of NIH.

Mark Hatfield,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatfield: On behalf of the American Federation \n     for Clinical Research, I write in strong support of the \n     ``Clinical Research Enhancement Act.'' The legislation you \n     are introducing today addresses critical problems facing our \n     country: the loss of a generation of young physician \n     scientists because of medical school tuition debts and \n     limited funding opportunities, the loss of our international \n     competitiveness in medicine as scientists in other nations \n     move ahead to capitalize on basic science discoveries with \n     new therapies and products, and the increasing difficulties \n     confronting patients who wish to participate in clinical \n     research but are limited by the unwillingness of insurance \n     companies to cover any investigational therapies.\n       The Clinical Research Enhancement Act addresses these \n     problems through the creation of new career development and \n     research programs, the expansion of existing \n\n[[Page S505]]\n     NIH loan repayment opportunities for physician scientist, and mandates \n     on insurance companies to expand coverage of investigational \n     treatments. Further, the creation of a Presidential \n     commission on clinical research will bring to the attention \n     of our nation's leaders critical obstacles to the advancement \n     of medical science.\n       The 11,000 members of the American Federation for Clinical \n     Research are in strong support of this legislation and call \n     on the Congress to pass the Clinical Research Enhancement Act \n     before adjourning in the fall. America has led the world in \n     medical science. The bill you introduce today will help to \n     assure that we maintain that leadership.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Veronica Catanese, M.D.,\n\n                                                President.\n\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. ABRAHAM:\n  S. 1535. A bill to strengthen enforcement of the immigration laws of \nthe United States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n      the illegal immigration control and enforcement act of 1996\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I introduce the Illegal \nImmigration Control and Enforcement Act of 1996. This bill would crack \ndown on the problem of illegal immigration without retreating from our \nhistoric commitment to legal immigration.\n  There is a broad consensus that illegal immigration is a significant \nproblem that demands immediate attention. But in addressing that \nproblem, we must not blur the distinction between illegal and legal \nimmigrants. The overwhelming majority of legal immigrants are law-\nabiding, hard-working people who make a positive contribution to our \neconomy and our society.\n  An omnibus immigration bill recently reported out of the Judiciary \nSubcommittee for Immigration overlooks this distinction. Rather than \nfocus on illegal immigration, the omnibus bill would reduce the quotas \nfor certain categories of legal immigration, eliminate other categories \naltogether, and impose stifling new taxes and red tape on American \nbusinesses that employ talented immigrants. The omnibus bill would also \nburden every American worker and business with a new national-\nidentification system that would vastly expand the power of the Federal \nGovernment in the workplace.\n  The bill I introduce today has a more targeted approach. First, the \nbill aims to take back control of our borders. It would nearly double \nthe number of border patrol agents, adding 900 such agents for each of \nthe next 5 fiscal years. It would provide new equipment and support \npersonnel for these agents. And it would significantly increase the \ncriminal penalties for the practice of smuggling aliens across our \nborder.\n  Second, the bill would for the first time address the problem caused \nby persons who overstay their visas. According to the INS, roughly half \nof all illegal aliens enter the United States with legal, nonimmigrant \nvisas and then remain here after their visas expire. Yet, incredibly, \nunder current law there is no penalty for overstaying one's visa. \nMoreover, visa overstayers are virtually never caught by the INS, so \noverstaying is for many aliens a risk-free choice. But the Illegal \nImmigration Control and Enforcement Act would change all this. Persons \nwho overstay a visa would be ineligible for additional visas for at \nleast 3 to 5 years. Since many visa overstayers hope to reside here \nlegally one day, this penalty would have a significant deterrent \neffect. To help catch those persons who nevertheless stay here after \ntheir visas expire, the bill would authorize the addition of 300 new \nINS investigators in each of the next 3 fiscal years, who would focus \nexclusively on visa overstayers. The upshot should be a significant \nreduction in the numbers of these illegal aliens.\n  Third, the bill would streamline the deportation of criminal aliens. \nAlthough, under current law, aliens convicted of felonies after entry \nare deportable, they are, in fact, rarely deported because of their \nability to seek repeated judicial review of their deportation order. \nThat would change under the provisions in my bill, which are stronger \nthan those in the omnibus immigration bill. Under my bill, aliens who \nare convicted of serious crimes would simply be deported upon \ncompletion of their sentences without any further judicial review of \ntheir deportation order. These provisions would apply to nearly half a \nmillion alien felons currently residing in this country.\n  Fourth, my bill would also respond to the pleas of businesses, \nparticularly small businesses, who wish to follow the law but whose \nefforts to do so are thwarted by the bewildering array of documents \nthat, under current law, are acceptable for employment verification. To \nhelp these employers, the bill would reduce the number of acceptable \nemployment verification to a relative handful of documents familiar to \nall employers.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the bill I introduce today also includes \nimportant welfare reforms similar to those in H.R. 4, the bill that was \nsent to the President and vetoed. Like H.R. 4, my bill would deny \nFederal means-tested benefits like welfare, food stamps, and SSI to \nillegal aliens and sharply restrict the eligibility of legal aliens to \nreceive these benefits. Unlike the omnibus bill reported out of the \nJudiciary Subcommittee for Immigration, however, my bill would not \ncontinue to apply these provisions to immigrants who become citizens of \nthe United States. In my view, we should not create classes of American \ncitizens for this purpose.\n  In summary, Mr. President, we need to focus our efforts on those \nareas where the real problem lies. By doing so, my bill would address \nour legitimate concerns about illegal immigration and welfare abuse \nwithout abandoning our commitment to family reunification, imposing new \ntaxes and fees on American employers, or handing the Federal Government \nsweeping new powers in the workplace.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. THOMPSON:\n  S. 1536. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to permit \nFederal firearms licenses to conduct firearms business with other such \nlicensees at out-of-State gun shows; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n           THE FIREARMS DEALERS REGULATORY RELIEF ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwill serve to correct and clarify section 923 of title 18 of the United \nStates Code affecting licensed firearms dealers. The bill amends the \nUnited States Code to permit the 200,000 Federal firearms licensees to \nconduct firearms business with other licensees at out-of-State gun \nshows.\n  This legislation is needed to address the problem that federally \nlicensed gun dealers have when they buy, sell, or trade high-end \ncollector's arms at out-of-State gun shows. Most of these firearms are \nin the $2,000 to $10,000 range and are not the target of illegal arms \ntraffickers. Under current law, when licensed dealers meet at an out-\nof-State gun show and conduct business, they must return home and ship \nthe firearms via common carrier from their respective States of \nresidence. In doing so, the dealers take great risk of loss, theft, or \ndamage and great expense of shipping and insurance of what may be one-\nof-a-kind items.\n  The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, [BATF], has indicated \nthat they would be willing to work with us ``to enact legislation which \nwill reduce the regulatory burden on the legitimate firearms industry \nwhile maintaining adequate controls to combat the criminal misuse of \nfirearms.'' They said they would have changed the regulations to allow \nthese types of commerce if not for the prohibitions that they interpret \nto be in the law. I welcome this spirit of cooperation.\n  This bill would make Congress' intent clear to the BATF that Federal \nfirearms license holders are not the source of illegal gun trafficking. \nFederal firearms license [FFL] holders are already closely regulated by \nthe Bureau as legitimate businesses. If a person is responsible enough \nto obtain a Federal firearms license in Tennessee, then he is \nresponsible enough to conduct business in Kentucky, North Carolina, or \nCalifornia. The BATF already recognizes this fact but, because of the \nway the current law is written, it must, nonetheless, enforce the \nbyzantine route to conduct business.\n  All those concerned by the illegal use of firearms should support \nthis bill, as direct transfer of firearms will improve the atmosphere \nensuring that all guns will be recorded on dealers' books, thereby \nproviding law enforcement agencies the records they need when firearms \nare used illegally.\n\n[[Page S506]]\n\n  This bill has the support of the Collector Arms Dealer's Association \nwhich represents 50,000 gun dealers and collectors.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. ROBB (for himself, Mr. Daschle, and Mr. Simpson):\n  S. 1537. A bill to require the Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency to issue a regulation that consolidates all \nenvironmental laws and health and safety laws applicable to the \nconstruction, maintenance, and operation of aboveground storage tanks, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n\n\n the aboveground storage tank consolidation and regulatory improvement \n                                  act\n\n Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I introduce legislation to address an \nimportant gap in Federal environmental law: The regulation of \nunderground releases from aboveground storage tanks.\n  With this bill, we have an opportunity to work together with both \nindustry and environmental groups to reform the Federal AST--\naboveground storage tank--program, reduce the regulatory burden on \nindustry, and improve the environment. Following efforts in the 103d \nCongress to improve the safety of AST's, I am introducing the \nAboveground Storage Tank Consolidation and Regulatory Improvement Act.\n  For the past 6 years, those of us who live in northern Virginia have \nreceived an education on just how flawed the current Federal law is.\n  In September 1990, a petroleum sheen was discovered in a neighborhood \ncreek in the Mantua-Stockbridge community in Fairfax County, VA.\n  It was the beginning of a continuing nightmare for a number of local \nresidents, who have had to live with the knowledge that more than \n200,000 gallons of petroleum product-diesel oil, jet fuel and gasoline \nhas leaked from the nearby Pickett Road tank farm.\n  The exact size of the leak, and its precise causes, are still \nunknown. What we have seen however, is the fallout: negative health \neffects, environmental damage, and needless losses of millions of \ndollars. Some residents were temporarily relocated, others have simply \nmoved, and still others continue to live with a cloud over their heads. \nAll of these residents are still wondering when the Federal Government \nwill move to address the issue of leaking aboveground storage tanks.\n  To date, Star Enterprise, a Texaco affiliate, has expended in excess \nof $100 million in remediation costs, real estate transactions, \nsettlement of claims, and compliance with new State AST requirements.\n  Fairfax County has had to spend $500,000 to provide enforcement, \noversight and community relations regarding the Pickett Road tank farm \nincident.\n  Unfortunately, problems with leaking AST's are not restricted to \nnorthern Virginia. Across the Nation, there are hundreds of similar \nleaks from aboveground petroleum storage tanks.\n  Major petroleum releases have occurred in Anchorage, AK; Torrance, \nCA; Port Everglades, FL; Hartford IL; Granger, IN; Cattlettsburg, KY; \nCharlotte, NC; Sparks, NV; Paulsboro, NJ; Syracuse, NY; Greensboro, NC; \nPonca City, OK; Philadelphia, PA; Spartanburg, SC; Austin, TX; and \nTacoma, WA.\n  At least five involve releases larger than the Exxon Valdez oil \ntanker catastrophe.\n  Whereas the Exxon Valdez spilled some 11 million gallons of oil, \naboveground tanks in El Segundo, CA have released between 84 and 252 \nmillion gallons.\n  In Martinez, CA, 28 million gallons have been released.\n  A Tulsa, OK facility has released between 25 and 28 million gallons, \nand a Whiting, IN facility released 17 million gallons.\n  In Brooklyn, NY, residents are sitting on top of a 13 to million \ngallon release.\n  According to the Environmental Defense Fund [EDF], between 20 and 25 \npercent of AST's nationwide and their associated piping are likely to \nbe leaking. A July 1994 American Petroleum Institute industry survey \nshowed that over 85 percent of monitored refining and marketing \nfacilities have confirmed ground water contamination; of the facilities \nwith ground water contamination, a high percentage have off-site \ncontamination--44 percent of refineries, at least 35 percent of \nmarketing facilities, and 27 percent of transportation facilities.\n  A 1995 General Accounting Office [GAO] study on aboveground oil \nstorage tanks that I requested, reported that EPA has found leaks \ntypically originate from the bases of tanks where contact with soil \ncauses corrosion; from underground piping; and from overflows \nassociated with the transfer of stored product.\n  On the basis of age, the likelihood of developing corrosion leaks, \nand leak detection thresholds, EPA's preliminary estimates show that \nAST's with a storage capacity in excess of 42,000 gallons could be \nleaking between 43 million and 54 million gallons of oil annually.\n  Because petroleum contracts and expands as temperatures vary, it is \noften difficult to detect leaks. And because petroleum is relatively \ncheap, it is often less expensive to allow a known leak to continue \nthan to interrupt operations and make a repair.\n  Because AST leaks are often slow and underground, they frequently do \nnot receive the attention of the big oil tanker catastrophes, but are \nnonetheless dangerous.\n  Petroleum releases can present serious health, safety, and \nenvironmental risks. Petroleum, including gasoline, contains extremely \ntoxic compounds, like benzene.\n  A plume of petroleum product can seep into basements and sewers, \nreaching toxic levels and causing explosions and the threat of fire.\n\n  In addition, leaking AST's can permanently contaminate groundwater, a \nsource of drinking water for more than half the Nation. And in many \ncases, groundwater contamination will inevitably lead to surface water \ncontamination.\n  While the extent of injuries is unknown, the 1995 GAO study reported \nthat most injuries to human beings from exposure to oil have occurred \nas a result of inhaling its vapors. Effects on humans from exposure to \npetroleum include everything from lethargy, dizziness, and convulsions \nto coma, blood cancers (such as leukemia) and generalized suppression \nof the immune system from chronic exposure by inhalation.\n  And we know now that these threats present unique challenges for \nsensitive subpopulations such as infants, pregnant women, the elderly, \nand those with AIDS and other debilitating diseases.\n  What is astounding is that where underground storage tanks are highly \nregulated by a comprehensive Federal program, aboveground storage \ntanks, used to store some 100 billion gallons of oil nationwide, are \nonly loosely regulated by a patchwork of confusing Federal regulations. \nIn many cases, State fire codes regulate AST's.\n  State authorities are beginning to take notice of the leaking AST \nproblem, but only 20 States have regulations on the books, and only 5 \nof these currently require genuine secondary containment, such as a \ndouble bottom or liner under a tank or piping.\n  Unfortunately, State programs vary widely and present problems for \ntank owners with multistate operations.\n  This is an enormous problem today; and it will likely continue to \ngrow as storage tank owners seek to exploit the gaps in current Federal \nlaw by acquiring AST's over the more highly regulated underground \nstorage tanks.\n  According to a January 1993 survey conducted by the Steel Tank \nInstitute, new tank purchases of aboveground tanks are running ahead of \nunderground tanks by a 5:2 ratio. And according to many State \nregulators and industry experts, this trend is continuing into the \nfuture.\n  This is troublesome from an environmental standpoint, and also from a \nfire safety perspective since aboveground tanks pose a much greater \nrisk of fire hazard than underground tanks.\n  In 1989, the GAO conducted a study of inland oil spills and found \nexisting laws deficient. In its report GAO proposed seven \nrecommendations to EPA that if implemented, would improve the safety of \naboveground oil storage tanks.\n  In 1995, Senator Daschle, Representative Moran, and I asked GAO to \ninvestigate the progress of EPA's implementation of the \nrecommendations. This report found that overall EPA has failed to \nimplement or take any action on the majority of the recommendations.\n  At the most elementary level, current law does not even require \ncomprehensive data collection or reporting \n\n[[Page S507]]\nto know exactly how many aboveground storage tanks are leaking.\n  In the 103d Congress, I sponsored legislation that would have \nestablished a comprehensive regulatory program for AST's and I \ncosponsored legislation offered by the distinguished Senator from South \nDakota, Senator Daschle, to regulate the estimated 800,000 to 900,000 \npetroleum aboveground tanks, nationwide.\n  Residents in Senator Daschle's home State were victims in 1987 of a \ndisastrous 20,000-gallon leak in which an elementary school had to be \nevacuated and abandoned after vapors began filtering up into the \nbuilding.\n  AST's are largely unregulated by Federal law; no single statute fully \naddresses prevention and cleanup of petroleum releases.\n  The legislation I am introducing today in the Senate, and will be \nintroduced by Representatives Jim Moran and Tom Davis in the House, \ntakes a new approach to dealing with leaking AST's, but maintains the \ngoal of improving the safety of aboveground storage tanks.\n  The problem of leaking AST's has been gaining national attention. In \nthe last 5 years, EPA has conducted studies and consulted with industry \nexperts to better define the causes of AST leaks of petroleum; more \nStates have begun to contemplate AST programs; and the petroleum \nindustry has recently issued standards for aboveground storage tanks.\n  In developing Federal legislation for the 104th Congress we moved \naway from the idea of a comprehensive regulatory program for \naboveground storage tanks. Instead, the bill seeks to enhance, not \nduplicate efforts undertaken by States and the petroleum industry to \nimprove AST safety.\n  There is a patchwork of AST regulations and no less than five Federal \noffices with AST responsibilities. This is confusing to tank owners, \ncostly to taxpayers and harmful to the environment.\n  Tank owners and operators need to have clear, concise guidance on how \nto comply with Federal regulations.\n  This new legislative proposal replaces the need for comprehensive \nreform; instead, it improves the organization of the current program \nand allows EPA to do more with less, while permitting tank owners the \nopportunity to embrace the newly developed industry standards.\n  Reform in the Federal program will improve the effectiveness of \ncurrent regulations, lead to greater prevention and containment of \nreleases from AST's and improve the environment.\n  Prevention is the key to avoiding costly and damaging petroleum \nreleases.\n  Specifically, the bill will:\n  Consolidate all of the Federal offices responsible for AST regulation \ninto one office at EPA. This will increase efficiency and improve \norganization at EPA;\n  Require EPA to consolidate and streamline the current AST program. \nThese steps will eliminate duplicative and conflicting regulations, \ncreate a user-friendly aboveground storage tank program and promote \nprevention measures such as secondary containment and corrosion \nprotection;\n  After consolidation, the bill allows EPA to correct gaps in the \nregulation of large--42,000 gallons and above--aboveground petroleum \ntanks and encourage prevention with narrow regulations based on \nindustry standards and cost-benefit analysis; and\n  Require reporting of releases and give limited emergency powers to \nthe EPA Administrator to better assist tank owners and operators with \nspeedier cleanups.\n  Should a petroleum release occur, the bill gives EPA the authority to \nclose the troublesome part of the storage tank facility, prohibiting \nfurther operation until the Administrator determines that the closure \nis not necessary to protect human health, public safety, or the \nenvironment.\n  That is to say, after a release, the burden shifts to the tank owner \nto cease operations until it can prove there is no ongoing threat.\n  The citizens in Fairfax were outraged when told that EPA lacked such \nauthority; this bill provides it. These provisions are essential to \nprovide predictability and peace of mind to residents living near large \naboveground storage tanks that store petroleum.\n  With reform of the Federal program it is estimated that $17.4 billion \nin savings will result from reduced leak cleanup costs, saved petroleum \nproduct, and decreased costs associated with compensating affected \nresidents.\n  This bill has been developed with the guidance and support of a \ndiverse coalition of industry and environmental groups because it is a \ncommon sense proposal to regulatory reform.\n  Although the bill could easily be incorporated into Clean Water Act \nreauthorization or Superfund reform legislation, I think the problem is \nof sufficient magnitude that the bill can and should move on its own. \nWith the bill's broad support, I don't see a need to have it hung up in \nthe complexity of reauthorization of the larger environmental statutes.\n  It is my hope that the introduction of this legislation today will \nhelp move this issue forward.\n  I would like to thank Senators Daschle and Simpson for their \nleadership on this issue. As original cosponsors, they have contributed \ngreatly to my effort to reach consensus on this issue.\n  We have tried to offer a more targeted version of earlier \nlegislation, which will impose less cost on business, and pose less \npolitical obstacles, but still get to the heart of the problem: The \nlarge marketing and refining facilities which hold the potential for \nenvironmental catastrophe.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I think the time has come to write the \nAboveground Storage Tank Consolidation and Regulatory Improvement Act \ninto law.\n  The County of Fairfax, VA, has recently voted to endorse this bill \nbecause it is convinced that this legislation is necessary to prevent \nor reduce the impact of similar releases of petroleum in the future. I \nhave a letter of support for the bill from the Fairfax County Board of \nSupervisors and I request unanimous consent that it be included in the \nRecord.\n  I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues and with the \nchairman of the relevant congressional committees to make this \nlegislation a reality.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1537\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Aboveground Storage Tank \n     Consolidation and Regulatory Improvement Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) improvement of Federal regulation of aboveground \n     storage tanks will lead to greater prevention and containment \n     of releases from aboveground storage tanks and improvement of \n     the environment;\n       (2) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n     Agency has not fully implemented any of the 7 recommendations \n     made in the 1989 report of the General Accounting Office on \n     inland oil spills;\n       (3) consolidation of Federal aboveground storage tank \n     provisions will lead to simplification of the regulatory \n     program and will allow the Administrator to eliminate \n     duplication and conflicting aboveground storage tank \n     regulations; and\n       (4) in order to promote environmental protection, \n     aboveground storage tank secondary containment structures \n     should meet a minimum permeability standard.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Charles S. Robb,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chuck Robb: Fairfax County is aware that legislation \n     entitled ``The Aboveground Storage Tank Consolidation and \n     Regulatory Improvement Act of 1995'' is to be introduced in \n     the United States Congress in the very near future. It is the \n     County's impression that this bill is designed to consolidate \n     authorities and regulatory functions associated with both \n     aboveground and underground storage tanks for the purpose of \n     strengthening oversight and enforcement, as well as to \n     improve upon the development of regulations for those \n     facilities. We believe that the legislation as proposed has \n     the potential to positively impact the organization and focus \n     of responsibilities and authorities pertinent to the \n     regulation of storage tanks.\n       Fairfax County is home to more than 20,000 commercial and \n     residential aboveground and underground storage tanks. During \n     the last several years the County has had first-hand \n     experience with the potential impacts these facilities pose \n     on public health, safety, and the environment. It has become \n     evident to the County that more focused, concise, and \n     adequate oversight is required to both prevent and correct \n     potential problems associated with storage tank facilities. \n     This view is supported by the County's experiences with the \n     hundreds of leaking underground storage tanks and the more \n     notable problems of the Fairax Bulk Petroleum Terminal \n     release in which over 189,000 gallons of petroleum was \n     discharged into the groundwater traveling into the \n     neighboring Mantua/Stockbridge residential community. The \n     proposed legislation provides the potential for a more \n     focused approach which might prevent or reduce the impact of \n     similar events in the future.\n       On behalf of the citizens of Fairfax County, the Board of \n     Supervisors urges the members of Congress to seriously \n     consider the benefits of the proposed legislation. ``The \n     Aboveground Storage Tank Consolidation and Regulatory \n     Improvement Act of 1995'' and provide the appropriate support \n     to ensure its enactment during the current legislative \n     session. If the County or its staff can be of further \n     assistance with this matter, please do not hesitate to \n     contact me. Your consideration of the County's position is \n     appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Katherine K. Hanley,\n                                                 Chairman.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GLENN (for himself and Mr. Gorton):\n  S. 1538. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor the treatment of excess benefit arrangements for certain tax-exempt \ngroup medical practices, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                  GROUP MEDICAL PRACTICES LEGISLATION\n\n Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, our Nation's few nonprofit medical \npractices have a well-deserved, international reputation for medical \nexcellence. Among those prestigious institutions is the Cleveland \nClinic, considered one of the world's finest medical facilities. The \nCleveland Clinic and other outstanding facilities such as the Virginia \nMason Clinic in Seattle, WA, and the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN, \nprovide significant charity care, offer outstanding medical education \nand training, lead in medical research and are deeply involved in \ncommunity service.\n  However, compensation rules for non-profit employers--including \nteaching hospitals, community clinics, and integrated health systems, \nare governed by stringent limits on reasonable compensation which do \nnot apply to physicians in private practice or in the for-profit \nsector.\n  Today I am introducing along with the distinguished Senator from \nWashington [Mr. Gorton], legislation to amend the Internal Revenue Code \nto provide a limited exemption from IRC section 457 to eligible group \nmedical practices. It would increase the dollar limitations for members \nand employees of those practices from the limitations of section \n457(c)(2).\n  I believe that this change in law would be good public policy. With \nflexibility to offer reasonable deferred compensation packages, these \nclinics can continue to recruit and retain the high quality individuals \nwhose training, skills, and experience are crucial to the patient \npopulation they serve.\n  An important way to encourage physician groups and other medical \nprofessionals to continue to organize in a not-for-profit status. \nHowever, current law provides for disincentives for this not-for-profit \nstatus. This legislation would remove these obstacles.\n  Mr. President, companion legislation has already been introduced in \nthe House. I urge the Senate Finance to carefully review the issues \nthat we raise in this legislation and I urge my colleagues to join me \nin support of this measure.\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today Senator Glenn and I are \nintroducing a limited, but important piece of legislation. This \nlegislation will provide a solution to a vexing problem that afflicts \nmany of the most distinguished not-for-profit group medical practices \nin this country, such as Virginia Mason Clinic in Seattle, the Mayo \nClinic in Rochester, and the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland.\n  Our Nation's not-for-profit medical practices, which include teaching \nhospitals, community clinics, and integrated health systems, perform \nessential public services. They provide significant charity care to our \nNation's poor and elderly, offer some of the finest medical education \nand training in the world, and are acknowledged leaders in medical \nresearch. Furthermore, not-for-profits perform these public services \nwhile maintaining a well-deserved, international reputation for medical \nexcellence.\n  Despite their excellent delivery of essential medical services, tax \nlaws restrict not-for-profit group medical practices from offering \ntheir medical professionals a level of deferred compensation that is \ncompetitive with that available to physicians in the for-profit sector. \nThese limits on deferred compensation exist even though medical \nprofessionals in nonprofit practices already sacrifice substantial \npersonal benefits and competitive salaries in order to serve the most \nneedy in their communities. This sacrifice on the part of nonprofit \nphysicians has potentially damaging repercussions for society when \nphysicians leave the nonprofit sector for the benefits of the private \nsector.\n  Today, we seek to remove some of the disincentive that exist for \nmedical professions to enter into the nonprofit area of health care. \nThe bill we are introducing amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide \na limited exemption from IRC section 457 to eligible group \n\n[[Page S510]]\nmedical practices. This amendment would increase the dollar limitations \nfor members and employees of those practices, index the deferred amount \nfor inflation, and exempt eligible medical group practices from \nlimitations of section 457(c)(2).\n  By providing nonprofit, teaching, medical centers the ability to \noffer deferred compensation packages to their professions at levels \nthat are competitive with the for-profit sector, our nonprofit medical \ncenters will be able to recruit and retain the caliber of individuals \nwhose training skills, and expertise are crucial to the often inner-\ncity or rural patients they serve.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON:\n  S. 1539. A bill to establish the Los Caminos del Rio National \nHeritage Area along the Lower Rio Grande Texas-Mexico border, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n       the los caminos del rio national heritage area act of 1996\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, along the Lower Rio Grande from \nLaredo, TX to the Gulf of Mexico, are found resources of immense \neconomic, natural, scenic, historical, and cultural value. On both the \nUnited States and Mexican sides of the Rio Grande, important historical \nthemes and resources of local, State, national, and international \nimportance characterize the river communities and counties along the \nLower Rio Grande. These include early 16th- and 17th-century Spanish \nand French explorations, 18th-century river settlements founded under \nthe Spanish Crown, 18th-century ranches where the first American \ncowboys rode, Texas independence and establishment of the Republic of \nthe Rio Grande in 1840, the first battle of the Mexican-American War in \n1846, the last land battle of the American Civil War fought near the \nmouth of the Rio Grande in 1865, a thriving steamboat trade in the late \n19th-century, and the development of the Rio Grande Valley as an \nagricultural empire. Today, the Lower Rio Grande is one of the most \ncomplex ecological systems in the United States, with a remarkable \nvariety of species including 600 different vertebrates, such as the \nplain chachalaca, the only member of the curassow family found in the \nUnited States, and 11,000 different and unique plants, like the Texas \nstrawberry cactus.\n  Given the remarkable diversity and international importance of this \narea, local and regional governments, Federal and State agencies, \nbusinesses, private citizens and organizations in the United States and \nMexico have expressed a desire to work cooperatively to preserve the \nmost significant components of the natural and cultural heritage \nthroughout the region, while accommodating sustainable growth and \ndevelopment.\n  Mr. President, in conjunction with these efforts, I am pleased to \nintroduce today the Los Caminos del Rio National Heritage Area Act of \n1996. This act will designate the Lower Rio Grande as a congressionally \nauthorized national heritage area, thereby recognizing the unique and \nbinational importance of the Lower Rio Grande region.\n  The Los Caminos del Rio National Heritage Area Act of 1996 recognizes \nthe special importance of the Lower Rio Grande region as a living \nhistorical legacy of the United States and Mexico. Los Caminos del Rio \nwill create partnerships between public and private entities to finance \nprojects and initiatives throughout the Lower Rio Grande while \nrequiring local governments and private entities to share costs with \nthe Federal Government. Furthermore, it will promote cooperation \nbetween Mexico and the United States while enhancing the economies of \nthe many Rio Grande communities.\n  Mr. President, in a time of fiscal constraints, national heritage \nareas are fiscally sound, budget-conscious alternatives to the \ntraditional national park designation. That is why Senator Ben \nNighthorse Campbell has introduced legislation to encourage such \npartnerships as an alternative to the traditional national park \ndesignation and why I am now introducing the Los Caminos del Rio \nNational Heritage Area Act of 1996.\n  Additionally, I should like to point out that my bill pays particular \nand close attention to the rights of private property owners. I have \nlistened to and worked with various property advocacy groups in order \nto craft a bill that specifically addresses concerns through concrete \nprotections preventing property rights infringement and diminishment of \nvalue. For example, my bill prohibits conditioning of Federal \nassistance on enactment or modification of any land-use restrictions, \nmandates quarterly public hearings within the heritage area, and \nspecifically states that nothing in the bill shall modify, enlarge, or \ndiminish any authority of Federal, State, or local government to \nregulate any zoning or use of land, including fish and wildlife \nmanagement. I hope to continue working with these property groups as \nthis legislation moves toward passage.\n  The Los Caminos del Rio heritage project, which began in 1990 with a \ngrant awarded to the Texas Historical Commission, has become a crucial \nunifier of the Lower Rio Grande region, facilitating contacts between \nsmall communities and their State and Federal Governments and with \nprivate philanthropy. That same process has occurred in Mexico, where \nborder communities that have traditionally felt abandoned and \noverlooked have been able to take advantage of Los Caminos del Rio. \nBecause they are part of a regional project, they are now part of \nnational and State tourism and conservation programs.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working with Senator Campbell and \nothers in passing this legislation to designate Los Caminos del Rio as \na National Heritage Area, to establish guidelines for the designation \nof other such areas, and to offer security for owners of private \nproperty within such areas.\n                                 ______\n\n       By Mr. HATCH:\n\n  S. 1540. A bill to amend chapter 14 of title 35, United States Code, \nto preserve the full term of patents; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n             THE FULL PATENT TERM PRESERVATION ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce S. \n1540, the Full Patent Term Preservation Act of 1996. Very simply \nstated, this legislation will allow the Patent and Trademark Office \n[PTO] to restore patent term in cases in which patent life has been \nshortened due to unusual and unavoidable administrative delay.\n  I wish to commend the majority leader, my good friend from Kansas, \nfor first bringing this matter to my attention. I share Senator Dole's \nconcern that patent term not be eroded due to unusual delays in \nevaluating patent applications by the PTO. The recent adoption of the \nnew 20 year from time of filing patent term has created a need for \nlegislation to address the issues giving rise to the Dole/Rohrabacher \nmeasure.\n  As my colleagues are aware, the legislation implementing the General \nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT] passed by the Congress and signed \nby the President in December, 1994, contained a provision designed to \nachieve harmonization of patent standards in the international \ncommunity. This was accomplished by changing our old system, which \nallowed for a patent term equal to 17 years from the date the patent \nwas issued, to a new system in which patents are valid for 20 years \nfrom the date of application.\n  There has been some concern expressed that the transition under GATT \nfrom a ``17-year from issuance'' to a ``20-year from filing'' patent \nterm will cause some inventors to lose valuable patent term. This can \noccur when patent applications are under review at PTO for unusually \nlong periods of time. To remedy this potential loss of patent term, the \nbill I am introducing today will allow the PTO to restore patent term \nfor up to 10 years if such term are lost because of unusual and \nunavoidable administrative delay. The bill also provides an opportunity \nfor an independent review of the Commissioner's determination.\n  At present, the patent code does not allow for patent term \nrestoration on the basis of ``unusual administrative delay.'' Such a \nprovision was not included in previous legislation because it was \nbelieved that there were too few cases to warrant its inclusion. \nNevertheless, the changes made by the GATT implementing legislation and \nseveral cited cases in which patent applications have taken up to 10 \nyears to be \n\n[[Page S511]]\nprocessed have heightened an awareness of the need to address the \npotential diminution of patent life. If enacted, the Full Patent Term \nPreservation Act of 1996 will allow inventors to regain patent term \nlost due to unusual administrative delay.\n  S. 1540 addresses the same general issue expressed by the \ndistinguished majority leader, Senator Dole, and by Congressman \nRohrabacher in their legislation this Congress. I am very sympathetic \nto the problem which led them to introduce their legislation and I want \nto work closely with them to resolve the matter. At the same time I \nmust note my concern that previous legislative proposals pose at least \ntwo problems. First, a provision that allows each applicant to select \nthe way in which the patent term will be measured could pose \nsignificant administrative problems. And second, I am still concerned \nthat we have not done enough to address the problem of so-called \nsubmarine patents which was one of the motivating factors behind \nadopting the GATT change.\n  As with the Dole/Rohrabacher legislation, the Full Patent Term \nPreservation Act of 1996 attempts to preserve a full term of patent \nprotection for American inventors, thereby promoting creativity and \ninvestment and maintaining U.S. competitiveness in the rapidly growing \nhigh-tech global marketplace. However, by retaining the basic principle \nof measuring the patent term from the earliest filing date, my proposed \nlegislation preserves the necessary incentives for patent applicants to \ndiligently and expeditiously pursue the issuance of their patent.\n  As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, it is my intention to hold \nhearings on these issues in the near future. I want to make clear to my \ncolleagues that the measure I introduce today is an effort to start the \nprocess of finding a middle ground which will accommodate the interests \nof all parties. I intend for the Judiciary Committee to examine this \nissue very closely over the next few months and I look forward to \nworking with Senator Dole and all other interested parties to make any \nnecessary modifications.\n  Before closing, I want to mention my interest in soliciting input on \none particular provision of this legislation. Section 2 grants the PTO \nthe authority to determine the circumstances under which a patent \nadjustment can be made. Some have questioned whether providing this \nauthority to the very agency which caused the delay would be the most \nappropriate way to address the adjustment issue.\n  Mr. President, I believe that S. 1540, the Full Patent Term \nPreservation Act of 1996 is a balanced legislative response to the \nproblem of potential loss of patent term. It will protect the \nlegitimate patent rights of American inventors, uphold our \ninternational treaty obligations under GATT, and provide the necessary \nincentives to ensure the responsible and timely pursuance of patent \napplications. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and look \nforward to its timely consideration.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text and a section-by-section \nanalysis of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1540\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Full Patent Term \n     Preservation Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PATENT TERM DETERMINATION AUTHORITY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 154(b) of title 35, United States \n     Code, is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(b) Determination of Patent Term.--\n       ``(1) Basis for patent term adjustment.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), the term of a \n     patent shall be adjusted to include the period of time for \n     which the issue of the original patent was delayed due to--\n       ``(i) a proceeding under section 135(a) of this title;\n       ``(ii) the imposition of an order pursuant to section 181 \n     of this title;\n       ``(iii) appellate review by the Board of Patent Appeals and \n     Interferences or by a Federal court where the patent was \n     issued pursuant to a decision in the review reversing an \n     adverse determination of patentability; or\n       ``(iv) an unusual administrative delay by the Office in \n     issuing the patent.\n       ``(B) Regulations.--The Commissioner shall prescribe \n     regulations to govern the determination of the period of \n     delay, including the particular circumstances determined to \n     be an unusual administrative delay under subparagraph (A).\n       ``(2) Limitations.--\n       ``(A) Maximum period of adjustment.--The total duration of \n     all adjustments of a patent term under this subsection shall \n     not exceed 10 years. No patent term may be adjusted by a \n     period greater than the actual period of time that the \n     issue of a patent was delayed as determined by the \n     Commissioner.

Short Title.--This section titles the bill the \n     ``Full Patent Term Preservation Act of 1996.''\n       Section 2. Patent Term Determination Authority.--This \n     section makes certain that the term of a patent will be \n     adjusted to include time attributable to certain delays in \n     review of patent applications.\n       Specifically, section 2(b)(1) mandates that adjustments \n     will be made for time elapsed due to: proceedings designed to \n     determine the priority of invention (``interference'' under \n     section 135(a) Title 35 U.S.C.); orders pertaining to a \n     determination that the patent would be detrimental to the \n     national security (section 181 of Title 35); and cases in \n     which the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences or a \n     Federal court reverses an adverse finding of patentability. \n     In addition, the Commissioner shall make adjustments due to \n     unusual administrative delay by the Patent and Trademark \n     Office (PTO) in issuing the patent.\n       The PTO Commissioner is authorized to promulgate \n     regulations to govern how the period of delay is to be \n     determined, including the circumstances that constitute \n     ``unusual administrative delay.''\n       Section 2(b) also establishes a 10 year limitation for \n     adjustments in patent terms under this section and precludes \n     adjustments in patent term beyond the actual number of days \n     that a patent was delayed. No adjustment in patent term may \n     be granted for time periods when the applicant did not act \n     with ``due diligence.'' The Commissioner is authorized to \n     promulgate regulations to define the application of the ``due \n     diligence'' provisions.\n       Section 2(b) also instructs the Commissioner to notify the \n     applicant, on the day the patent issues, of any patent term \n     restoration the applicant is entitled to under this section. \n     Finally, section 2(b) provides the right to judicial review \n     in the United States Court of Federal Claims for those patent \n     applicants \n\n[[Page S512]]\n     dissatisfied with the determination of the Commissioner with respect to \n     patent term adjustments.\n       Section 2(c) makes certain technical conforming changes \n     between sections 154 and 156 of the patent provisions of \n     Title 35, U.S.C. Section 2(c) allows the patent term \n     adjustments provided in section 156 to restore patent term \n     lost due to Food and Drug Administration regulatory review to \n     be additive to any patent term restoration granted under \n     section 154 to compensate for patent term unavoidably lost in \n     the patent prosection process.\n       Section 3. Effective Date.--This section makes the new \n     provisions contained in section 2 effective for any patent \n     application filed on or after June 8, 1995.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. LUGAR (for himself, Mr. Dole, Mr. Helms, Mr. Cochran, Mr. \n        Craig, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Pressler, and Mr. Coverdell):\n  S. 1541. a bill to extend, reform, and improve agricultural \ncommodity, trade, conservation, and other programs, and for other \npurposes; read the first time.\n\n\n                   agricultural market transition act\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to support the Agricultural Market \nTransition Act of 1996. This legislation is identical to Title I of the \nBalanced Budget Act, with two changes which I shall mention shortly.\n  Congress passed the Balanced Budget Act and the President, most \nunfortunately for the country, vetoed it. We hope that some spending \ncuts can be added to legislation raising the Federal debt limit. \nHowever, the veto creates a problem for U.S. agriculture.\n  The problem is that commodity support programs for the next 7 years \nwere part of the BBA. Existing authority for these programs has now \nexpired. All that remain are outdated statutes from 1938 and 1949. The \nClinton administration confirms that implementing these statues could \nadd $10 to $12 billion to the cost of running farm programs for 1996 \ncrops alone.\n  That is intolerable for taxpayers. Farmers do not support such an \nirresponsible policy. The solution is to enact a new farm bill.\n  Farmers need to know what farm policies will be--not just for the \nnext 12 months but for the next several years. We owe it to U.S. \nagriculture to enact a long-term plan, not a stopgap measure.\n  This bill's agricultural provisions are a long-term plan endorsed by \na broad spectrum of agricultural groups. From national groups like the \nAmerican Farm Bureau Federation and the National Corn Growers \nAssociation, to state groups like the Kansas Association of Wheat \nGrowers and the North Dakota Grain Growers, U.S. producer and \nagribusiness organizations support this plan.\n  It is simple, in contrast to the needless complexity of current \nprograms.\n  It offers certainty. Farmers will know what their future payments \nwill be. Taxpayers will know how much will be spent. U.S. agriculture \nwill have security against future budget cuts.\n  Finally, it is market-oriented. Farmers' payments will be the same \neven if they plant alternate crops. Producers' planting decisions will \nbe based on the market--as they should be. Under the BBA, there will be \nfull planting freedom, not arbitrary government production controls.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a brief summary of this \nbill's provisions be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Subtitle A--Agricultural Market Transition Program\n\n       Production flexibility contracts--Eligible producers (those \n     who had participated in the wheat, feed grains, cotton and \n     rice programs in any one of the past five years) can enter \n     into seven-year ``production flexibility contracts'' between \n     1996 and 2002. The deadline for entering into the contract \n     would be April 15, 1996. Payments would be made on September \n     30 of each year beginning in 1996. Farmers would also have \n     the option of receiving half of their annual payment by \n     December 15 of the previous year (except in 1996 when the \n     advance payment would be due within 60 days of the signing of \n     the contract.)\n       Payment would be made on 85 percent of a farm's contract \n     acreage. On this acreage participants would be free to plant \n     any program crop, oilseed, industrial or experimental crop, \n     mung beans, lentils and dry peas. Planting of fruits and \n     vegetables would be prohibited on contract acres. These \n     commodity program changes will result in $8.6 billion in \n     budget savings over the next seven years.\n       Peanuts--The legislation saves $434 million from the \n     federal peanut program, making it a no-cost program. The \n     price support program for peanuts is extended through 2002, \n     but the quota support rate is lowered from $678/tone to $610/\n     ton. The price support escalator is eliminated. The \n     legislation eliminates the national poundage quota floor \n     (currently 1,350,000 tons) and undermarketing provisions of \n     current law. Previously considered reforms for quota \n     reduction, the sale, lease and transfer of quota across \n     county lines, and offers from handlers were removed from the \n     bill due to Byrd rule considerations. These reforms will \n     likely be taken up later as part of separate legislation.\n       Sugar--In order to make the program more market-oriented, a \n     recourse loan system is implemented until imports reach 1.5 \n     million short tons for FY 1997 1997-2002. The bill terminates \n     marketing allotments and implements a one cent penalty on \n     forfeited sugar. Provisions of current law that require the \n     Sugar Program to operate at no-net cost are retained in this \n     bill. It also retains the loan rate of raw cane sugar and \n     refined beet sugar at the 1995 levels, 18 cents and 22.9 \n     cents respectively, and retains a nine-month loan. The \n     legislation would raise the assessment on sugar processors to \n     achieve $52 million in budget savings over seven years toward \n     deficit reduction.\n       Nonrecourse marketing assistance loans--The conference \n     agreement establishes maximum loan rates at the following \n     (1995) levels: Rice: $6.50/cwt; Upland Cotton: $0.5192/lb; \n     Wheat: $2.58/bu; Corn: $1.89/bu; Soybeans: $4.92/bu; ELS \n     Cotton: $0.7965/lb.\n       The Secretary would retain authority to make downward \n     adjustments to wheat and feed grains loan rates based on \n     specified stocks-to-use criteria. The bill also establishes a \n     minimum loan rate for rice at $6.50/cwt and cotton at $0.50/\n     lb. The conference agreement also eliminates the 8-month \n     cotton loan extension. The loan rate provisions of the \n     conference agreement will save $107 million.\n       Payment limitations--The conference agreement reduces the \n     current payment limitation by 20 percent, from $50,000 to \n     $40,000. The bill extends provisions of current law that \n     limit marketing loan gains and loan deficiency payments to \n     $75,000 per person per year. The payment limitation reduction \n     achieves $150 million in budget savings.\n       Program authority elimination--This legislation repeals the \n     Agriculture Act of 1949 as well as the permanent law \n     provisions of the Agriculture Adjustment Act of 1938. Also \n     eliminated are authorities for the Farmer Owned Reserve and \n     the Emergency Livestock Feed Assistance Program.\n\n\n                        subtitle b--conservation\n\n       Conservation Reserve Program (CRP)--The CRP is capped at \n     the current level of 36.4 million acres for a savings of $569 \n     million over seven years. Also adopted was an ``early out'' \n     provision to allow contract holders to terminate CRP \n     contracts upon written notification of the Secretary.\n       Livestock Environmental Assistance Program (LEAP)--The \n     program is established to help livestock producers improve \n     environmental and water quality. The program makes available \n     $100 million annually to provide technical and cost-share \n     assistance in implementing structural and management \n     practices to protect water, soil and related resources from \n     degradation associated with livestock production.\n\n\n         subtitle c--agricultural promotion and export programs\n\n       Market Promotion Program (MPP)--MPP expenditures are capped \n     at $100 million through 2002 producing a savings of $60 \n     million.\n       Export Enhancement Program (EEP)--EEP expenditures are \n     capped at $350 million in 1996 and 1997; $500 million in \n     1998; $550 million in 1999; $579 million in 2000 and $478 \n     million for 2001 and 2002. Total savings for EEP will be \n     $1.27 billion.\n\n\n                       subtitle d--miscellaneous\n\n       Crop insurance--The bill eliminates the mandatory nature of \n     catastrophic crop insurance, but requires producers to waive \n     all federal disaster assistance if they opt not to purchase \n     insurance. Dual delivery of crop insurance is eliminated in \n     those states that have adequate private crop insurance \n     delivery. The bill also corrects a provision of current law \n     by amending the Federal Crop Insurance Act to include seed \n     crops. The crop insurance provisions of the bill result in \n     net savings of $130 million.\n       Agriculture quarantine and inspection--The bill amends the \n     Food, Agriculture, Conservation and Trade Act of 1990 to \n     allow the Secretary to collect and spend fees collected over \n     $100 million to cover the cost of providing quarantine and \n     inspection services for imports.\n       Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) interest rates--Rates on \n     CCC agriculture commodity loans are increased by 100 basis \n     points for a savings of $260 million over seven years.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I would also like to mention two changes from the BBA as \nit passed the House and Senate.\n  Under the Livestock Environmental Assistance Program, limits are \nplaced on the size of operations that may receive benefits. The BBA \ncontained \n\n[[Page S513]]\nthese limits but some felt that for dairy operations, the limits were \ntoo strict. Therefore, dairy operations of 700 or fewer cows will now \nbe eligible.\n  The other change deals with which crops may be planted on acres \nenrolled in income support contracts. The bill introduced today will \ntreat fruit and vegetable crops in the same manner as current law--that \nis, they may not be planted on contract acres.\n  Mr. President, the Agricultural Market Transition Act of 1996 \nrepresents a bold departure from the past. It is a new direction for \nAmerican agriculture. It will reduce Federal spending, reform price \nsupport programs, and prepare U.S. farmers for what promises to be an \nexciting new century, full of opportunities for the most efficient food \nproducers in the world.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my colleagues \nSenators Craig, Dole, Lugar, Cochran, and Grassley, supporting a farm \nbill that will let our farmers farm according to the marketplace and \nstop the Federal Government from telling our farmers what crop to \nplant, when to plant, and how much to plant. These decisions belong to \nthe farmer--not the Federal Government.\n  On September 30 of last year the farm bill expired. Farmers in my \nState of Washington and across the country need to know what the farm \nprogram will be. They cannot wait any longer. Currently, farmers in my \nState are meeting with their bankers, making plans for this year's \ncrop, determining their financial situation, and evaluating their \nequipment needs. As my good friend from Iowa, Senator Grassley, said on \nTuesday, ``farmers of this country deserve to know what the farm \nprogram will be this year and they need to know as soon as possible.'' \nThe senior Senator from Iowa is correct. We cannot in good conscience \ndelay in passing a farm bill. We owe it to the American farmer to take \naction.\n  Farmers in my State tell me that they want less Government, less red \ntape, and less paperwork. Farmers in my State simply want more \nflexibility; they want the Federal Government out of their lives. A \nmarket transition style farm program gives them what they have asked \nfor and provides a seven year transition to full market-oriented \nfarming.\n  A market transition style farm program could not come at a better \ntime. Many important developments have taken place since the completion \nof the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade \n[GATT]. I believe that GATT will continue to open new world markets for \nthe United States, and with a farm program that allows our farmers to \nfarm according to the marketplace we will provide them with the \nflexibility they need to respond quickly to the demands of emerging \nworld markets.\n  A market transition style farm program also moves us towards a \nbalanced budget, saving nearly $13 billion in budget outlays over 7 \nyears. Since 1969, the last year in which there was a balanced budget \nin this country, we have piled debt on our shoulders and on the \nshoulders of our children and grandchildren of almost $5 trillion. That \nmeans, Mr. President, that a child born today inherits an obligation of \nsome $187,000 during his or her life simply to pay interest on the \nnational debt. This statistic alone starkly illustrates not just the \nfiscal and financial necessity, but the moral necessity of a sharp \nchange in direction. This country can no longer continue goods and \nservices for which it is unwilling to pay. If we do not change the way \nwe do things here in Washington, DC, our children and grandchildren \nwill suffer terribly.\n  If we do balance the Federal budget we will provide American families \nand American farmers with better jobs, higher wages, lower interest \nrates, and economic certainty. All of this means more money in the \npockets of American farmers. One thing is for certain, Mr. President: \nwe must balance the budget and we must balance it now.\n  For all of these reasons, Mr. President, I support my colleagues, \nSenators Craig, Dole, Lugar, Cochran, and Grassley, as we work together \nto provide American farmers with the flexibility they need to do what \nthey do best: provide healthy, safe, and abundant food for families \naround the world.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mr. Hollings):\n  S.J. Res. 48. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States relating to contributions and \nexpenditures intended to affect elections; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n             campaign expenditures constitutional amendment\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today for \npurposes, with the cosponsorship of the distinguished Senator from \nSouth Carolina, Senator Hollings, to introduce a constitutional \namendment which is broader than any yet pending, which would authorize \nthe Congress and the State legislatures to set spending limits on what \nany individual can spend of his or her own money in the context of a \ncandidacy.\n\n  I had wanted to introduce this amendment on January 30, which is next \nTuesday, because January 30 is the 20th anniversary of the decision of \nthe Supreme Court in Buckley versus Valeo, which said that an \nindividual can promote his or her candidacy to the maximum extent he or \nshe chooses with their own personal funds as a matter of first \namendment protection of freedom of speech.\n  It has always been a little hard for me to understand how anything \nfrom the freedom of speech is implicated in a matter of campaign \nfinancing. For the past 6 years, Senator Hollings and I and others have \ntried to advance this constitutional amendment, which is difficult \nbecause it picks on the first amendment.\n  But in seeking to amend the first amendment, we do not seek to change \nthe language of the first amendment, which I think is sacrosanct. What \nwe seek to do is to overrule, in effect, a split decision by the \nSupreme Court of the United States in interpreting the first amendment.\n  Money is the scourge of politics, and to buy high public office is, \nobviously, against public policy. There are many who have, in effect, \nbought public office, including some seats of the U.S. Senate. But it \nis only recently that this matter has come into sharp focus when a \ncandidate for the Presidency of the United States, who is reputed to \nhave assets in excess of $400 million, set out to, in effect, buy the \nWhite House.\n  According to this morning's New York Times, some $15 million has \nalready been expended on that effort. I think it is especially \nproblemsome when a substantial part of that money is dedicated to \nnegative advertising which, in effect, seeks to impugn the reputation \nof an opponent who spent more than 40 years in public life.\n  I believe what is going on in the Presidential primaries, the \nRepublican primaries, today has caused a great deal of focus of \nattention, and it is high time that we took some action to stop someone \nfrom buying public office, especially the Presidency of the United \nStates, especially the White House.\n  I will add, Mr. President, that I personally feel especially strong \nabout this particular matter, because I filed for the U.S. Senate \nduring the first election cycle following the enactment of the 1974 \nlegislation which limited the amount of moneys which could be spent on \nFederal elections.\n  That 1974 statute said that for a State the size of Pennsylvania, \nwith 12 million people, the most anyone could spend of his or her own \nmoney was $35,000. That year, I contested for that office with then-\nCongressman John Heinz, who later I served with in the Senate as a \ncolleague and who became one of my very, very best friends, a Senator \nwe sorely miss in this body.\n  But with the playing field somewhat leveled with the $35,000 maximum \nindividual expenditure, I thought that race was one to be undertaken. \nThen, right in the middle of the campaign, on January 30--we had an \nAugust 22 primary in 1976; I declared my candidacy in November of \n1975--right in the middle of the campaign, the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States said any candidate can spend as much of his or her money \nthat he or she wanted.\n  Somewhat anomalous, my brother, who could have bankrolled my \ncampaign--I do not know he would have, but he could have--was limited \nto $1,000 under the act, and that remained in place by the Supreme \nCourt decision.\n  It is a little hard to see the first amendment freedom of speech \nrights of \n\n[[Page S514]]\nSpecter being different than the freedom of speech rights of a \ncandidate. We have lived with Buckley versus Valeo for 20 years, and it \nis bad legal construction. There is nothing in the first amendment, \nthere is nothing in the logic of the law which suggests the first \namendment gives an individual the right to spend as much of his or her \nown money as he or she chooses.\n  It certainly is bad public policy to have someone seek to buy an \noffice, especially the Presidency of the United States.\n  So I urge my colleagues to join Senator Hollings and myself. As we \nhave talked in the quarters and in the cloakrooms and on the floor of \nthe Senate in these past several days, I believe that there is a \ngrowing sentiment in the Congress to do something about Buckley versus \nValeo, to see to it that we do not have high public office up for sale \nin this great country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

The President is authorized and \n     requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of \n     the United States to observe such day with appropriate \n     ceremonies and activities.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and \nSenators Bradley and Moynihan to submit a resolution that will \ncelebrate the 150th birthday of this country's national pastime. This \nresolution would declare June 19, 1996, as ``National Baseball Day,'' \ncommerating this date in 1846 when baseball's first game was played.\n  The seeds of modern baseball were planted on the Elysian Fields of \nHoboken, NJ, on the warm spring afternoon of June 19, 1846. On this \nhistoric date, one of baseball's earliest and most influential teams, \nthe Knickerbockers, invited a group known as the New York Club to join \nthem for a game of ball under a unique set of rules that the \nKnickerbockers had recently devised. As time passed and word spread, \nother baseball clubs soon began to assemble and over the next decade \nthe Elysian Fields grew into the first great center of baseball \nactivity in the United States. Soon the game of baseball spread north \nand south along the east coast of the United States. Today it is played \nfrom coast-to-coast and all over the world. Mr. President, this game, \nunlike any other, has had a profound influence on generation after \ngeneration of Americans.\n  The men that played in these early games were amateurs in the noblest \nsense of the word, as they played for the sheer joy they found in the \ngame. Millions of American boys and girls carry on this tradition every \nyear by participating in amateur baseball and softball leagues. In T-\nBall and Little Leagues across the country, youngsters are not only \nlearning the fundamentals of the game but teamwork and good \nsportsmanship, lessons that can be carried off the diamond. In fact, \nfor millions of Americans, baseball is part of their earliest childhood \nmemories, including the crack of a bat, the smell of a glove, and the \nendless summers spent on sandlots and schoolyards in every community \nacross this great Nation in a uniquely American rite of passage. In \nevery American generation for 150 years, baseball has been an important \nbond between millions of parents and their children who have shared \ncountless afternoons at the ballpark. Baseball binds one generation of \nAmericans to the next through a shared experience that has become \ncentral to our identity as a nation.\n  It is often said that to understand America, one must first \nunderstand the game of baseball. For the past century and a half the \ngame of baseball has been with us through good and bad. During \ndifficult times, baseball has been an aid to Americans, providing not \nonly a distraction to the current hardships, but offering hope that if \nthe pastime of this great country can endure so can the Nation as a \nwhole. It helped keep the home fires burning during World War II and \nmoved us into the civil rights movement with Jackie Robinson. This is \nmuch more than a game, it is a part of who we are.\n  We eagerly await the start of spring training, looking forward to \nopening day and baseball's first pitch. Then summer arrives, where \ntemperatures and pennant races heat up moving us into crisp fall nights \nand the magic of the World Series. The greatness of baseball comes from \nits simplicity and diversity, a trait which makes the game like no \nother. The dimensions of the field differ from park to park, games have \nno set time limits and the phrase ``perfect game'' has a specific \nmeaning with its own precise guidelines. It is a game filled with \ntradition that can not be matched by any other.\n  Mr. President, at its heart, baseball is a communal experience and \nits memories are those we inevitable share. It is a game that allows \nthe fan to remember the past while at the same time looking towards the \nfuture, knowing that the game will be around for generations of sons \nand daughters to enjoy. Baseball is truly a game for the ages.\n  The designation of a ``National Baseball Day'' will provide an \nopportunity to celebrate America's national pastime and to reflect upon \na game that has become a metaphor for our Nation's values and a living \nsymbol of our heritage. I urge my colleagues to support this \nresolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/26/senate-section/article/S514-4", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S515-S516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 216--RELATIVE TO MINTING AND CIRCULATING $1 COINS\n\n  Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Cohen) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs:\n\n                              S.

AMENDMENTS TO THE ATOMIC ENERGY ACT.\n\n       (a) Repeal.--(1) Chapters 22 through 26 of the Atomic \n     Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2297-2297e-7) are repealed as \n     of the privatization date.\n       (2) The table of contents of such Act is amended as of the \n     privatization date by striking the items referring to \n     sections repealed by paragraph (1).\n       (b) NRC Licensing.--(1) Section 11v. of the Atomic Energy \n     Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2014v.) is amended by striking ``or \n     the construction and operation of a uranium enrichment \n     facility using Atomic Vapor Laser Isotope Separation \n     technology''.\n       (2) Section 193 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. \n     2243) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(f) Limitation.--No license or certificate of compliance \n     may be issued to the United States Enrichment Corporation or \n     its successor under this section or sections 53, 63, or 1701, \n     if the Commission determines that--\n       ``(1) the Corporation is owned, controlled, or dominated by \n     an alien, a foreign corporation, or a foreign government; or\n       ``(2) the issuance of such a license or certificate of \n     compliance would be inimical to--\n       ``(A) the common defense and security of the United States; \n     or\n       ``(B) the maintenance of a reliable and economical domestic \n     source of enrichment services.''.\n       (3) Section 1701(c)(2) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 \n     U.S.C. 2297f(c)(2)) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(2) Periodic Application for Certificate of Compliance.--\n     The Corporation shall apply to the Nuclear Regulatory \n     Commission for a certificate of compliance under paragraph \n     (1) periodically, as determined by the Commission, but not \n     less than every 5 years.

AMENDMENTS TO OTHER LAWS.\n\n       (a) Definition of Government Corporation.--As of the \n     privatization date, section 9101(3) of title 31, United \n     States Code, is amended by striking subparagraph (N) as added \n     by section 902(b) of Public Law 102-486.\n       (b) Definition of the Corporation.--Section 1018(1) of the \n     Energy Policy Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 2296b-7(1) is amended by \n     inserting ``or its successor'' before the period.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Mr. Johnston, \nMr. Domenici and Mr. Ford, I submit a substitute amendment to S. 755, \nCalendar number 244, the USEC Privatization Act.\n  Mr. President, this substitute is virtually identical to USEC \nprivatization language contained in the Budget Reconciliation measure \npassed earlier by the Senate. The differences in this amendment and the \nreconciliation language are as follows:\n  We included language in section 4(e) stipulating that the expenses of \nprivatization shall be paid from Corporation revenue accounts in the \nU.S. Treasury. This language is contained in the bill as reported by \nthe committee, but it was left out of the reconciliation language. The \nadministration has requested that this language be restored, and we \nhave agreed to do that in this amendment.\n  The language in this amendment also departs from the language in the \nreconciliation bill in section 13, dealing with low level waste. We \nhave reverted to the language in the bill as reported by the committee, \nand have thus solved another concern related to uranium tails that had \nbeen raised by the administration.\n  Mr. President, with all of the discussions about partisanship and the \ndifficulty of working out complex legislation in this Congress, let me \nhighlight the fact that the year-long effort to develop this \nlegislation has been bipartisan and bicameral. House and Senate \nstaffers have sat down with administration officials and jointly \ndeveloped the bulk of the language in this substitute amendment.\n  I would hasten to add, however, that this amendment does not contain \nlanguage sought by the administration related to a waiver of trade \nlaws. That matter is the subject of ongoing discussions between \nadministration officials, the Senate Finance Committee, and the House \nWays and Means Committee. Those discussions will continue, and those \ncommittees will continue their deliberations on the question of waiver \nlanguage. The absence of waiver language in this amendment should not \nbe construed by anyone as a signal that efforts to arrive at a \ncompromise in that area have been abandoned.\n  It is my hope that we can move this measure as a stand-alone bill, or \nas part of any other legislative vehicle that is available to us in the \ncoming weeks. For that reason, I wanted my colleagues and the public to \nhave an ample opportunity to review this language.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                 THE BALANCED BUDGET DOWNPAYMENT ACT, I\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                       HARKIN AMENDMENT NO. 3122\n\n  Mr. HARKIN proposed an amendment to the bill H.R. 2880, supra, as \nfollows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill insert the following: \n     Notwithstanding any provision of this Act, all projects and \n     activities funded under the account heading ``Office of the \n     Inspector General'' under the Office of the Secretary in the \n     Department of Health and Human Services at a rate for \n     operations not to exceed an annual rate for new \n\n[[Page S521]]\n     obligational authority of $58,493,000 for general funds together with \n     not to exceed an annual rate for new obligational authority \n     of $20,670,000 to be transferred and expended as authorized \n     by section 201(g)(1) of the Social Security Act from the \n     Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Supplemental Medical \n     Insurance Trust Fund.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/26/senate-section/article/S516-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARINGS\n\n\n             the oversight and investigations subcommittee\n\n  Mr. THOMAS.

Mr. President, I would like to place in the \nRecord a copy of a speech about the wrenching subject of racism, \nwritten by a good friend and colleague. Mr. Jim H. Paige III is the \nWest Virginia Secretary of Tax and Revenue, and he recently gave this \nspeech before the 115th Annual West Virginia Council of Churches \nGoverning Assembly. Its words struck me as most sincere, insightful, \nand educational. I hope it will be just as beneficial to everyone else.\n  Despite America's proud history as the melting pot Nation, we still \nstruggle with the signs and attitudes of racism in virtually every \ncorner of our society. It is a problem that most Americans would say is \nabhorrent and unjustifiable, but also one that will not disappear \nwithout even more effort.\n  But I believe it is not only possible to combat discrimination, it is \nalso essential. Diversity in background, skin color, family ancestry, \nreligion, and geography should be celebrated and viewed as the way to \nbuild a stronger nation.\n  The more thought and study each of us give to the issues of racism \nand discrimination, and the more discussions we hold with others on how \nto spread tolerance and equality, the more we can enlighten and educate \nourselves to move toward making equality for all people a reality.\n  It is my honor to submit this compelling text by a very fine West \nVirginian into the Congressional Record.\n  The text follows:\n\n  Speech to the West Virginia Council of Churches Governing Assembly, \n                            October 19, 1995\n\n                         (By Jim H. Paige III)\n\n       It is indeed an honor to be asked to participate in your \n     Annual Governing Assembly.\n       I have been intrigued with the forum which has been \n     organized here and impressed that you set aside a special \n     time to discuss the hopes and concerns of West Virginia's \n     spiritual community.\n       I was asked to speak here tonight about racism.\n       It is a topic that deserves our most intellectual thoughts \n     and energies.\n       Historically, as you know, in the 1860's the most divisive \n     issue in the United States was slavery.\n       The issue of slavery divided the nation.\n       The industrial North had very little use for slave labor.\n       However, the agricultural South had a great need for a \n     large slave labor pool.\n       At that time, slavery was based strictly on race.\n       The Civil War was fought and the slave issue was settled, \n     but the issue of racism was not resolved.\n       Even after the Civil War and during the reconstruction \n     period, our nation still struggled with the issue of racism.\n       Because even after slavery, we had a legacy of Jim Crow \n     laws--of segregation--and this issue of racism was based \n     purely on color.\n       So, although the Civil War was over, our nation was still \n     confused about Lincoln's notion that ``Four score and seven \n     years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new \n     nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition \n     that all men were created equal.''\n       And over 100 years later, in the 1950's and 60's, the \n     nation was still divided by race.\n       As a result, there was a whole movement led by the Civil \n     Rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. who was basically \n     trying to get America to live up to the Constitution.\n       As Lincoln had noted earlier, our preamble states ``We hold \n     these truths to be self-evident--that all men are created \n     equal.''\n       From a historical perspective I think it interesting that \n     during the 1860's there was a strong polarization based on \n     slavery.\n       And in the 1960's that polarization still existed--not on \n     slavery, however, but on segregation, in an attempt to \n     separate our races.\n       So the Civil Rights movement resulted in legislation that \n     was to end this segregation.\n       Therefore, we experienced a desegregation of schools, of \n     public facilities.\n       We now have laws on the books that make segregation \n     illegal.\n       We come to an interesting stage in this brief historical \n     perspective, because what the laws could not do were to \n     change racial attitudes--the way people think and the way \n     people feel about each other.\n       Although tremendous strides have been made, even 30 years \n     after the great Civil Rights movement, the issue of racism is \n     still prevalent in our society today.\n       The recent O.J. Simpson trial and verdict brought back to \n     the surface again this cancer of racism.\n       But the questions that still linger ``What is racism and \n     how do we solve it?''\n       How do we define racism?\n       In order to deal with a problem, we should try to define it \n     first.\n       I define it as an attitude people have in which they feel \n     they are superior to another group of people, and that \n     superiority gives them certain privileges of authority over \n     those people.\n       Now the result of racism is that the people who have been \n     victimized by racism respond with bitterness and resentment \n     toward those who exercise that authority.\n       And, the alienation becomes even greater.\n       So, if you think about it in a logical fashion, racism is \n     based purely on ignorance.\n       Because racism takes one criterion, a superficial \n     criterion--race--and it passes judgment on an entire group of \n     people.\n       Utilizing folklore, tradition, and stereotypes--not facts, \n     not any type of intellectual analysis--racism concludes that \n     all the people in a certain classification are a certain way.\n       I think we all could conclude that this type of deductive \n     reasoning is unwise and unproductive.\n       Whether it's black against white, whether it's white \n     against black--it doesn't matter.\n       This type of attitude is unproductive, unhealthy and \n     undeserved in our society today.\n       Now that we have defined the issue, how do we find \n     solutions to address this evil?\n       I don't believe racism is an issue that our government can \n     solve.\n     \n[[Page S522]]\n\n       Because government cannot legislate morality.\n       Government cannot tell people to think a certain way or \n     feel a certain way.\n       When our government attempts to legislate feelings and \n     attitudes, it creates greater problems.\n       In America, our great land of freedom and independence in \n     which we live, we hold it as a high value and virtue that \n     people can think thoughts they want to think and feel the way \n     they want to feel--they have certain liberties and certain \n     freedoms.\n       And rightly so.\n       The only danger of this is that when people have racial \n     thoughts and racial feelings, it creates a tremendous \n     hardship for society.\n       So, if government cannot solve this problem, how can we \n     address this major issue of racism in our society today?\n       I think this is an issue that can only be resolved with a \n     continuing dialogue, interaction and commitment.\n       Racism is an activity that requires daily moral awakening \n     that leads to real change.\n       The only way we can overcome the stereotypes, the \n     tradition, the false information we have been given about \n     each other is through contact with the people we have learned \n     to disdain and look down upon.\n       There is nothing government can do about that.\n       There is no way we can legislate that black people and \n     white people must sit down together, and learn about each \n     other, understand each other, and appreciate each other's \n     differences.\n       Integration certainly went a long way in bringing our races \n     together.\n       But further steps are needed to change attitudes. Because \n     racism is not genetic--it's a learned value system, it is an \n     attitude that is passed down from one generation to the next.\n       It's a cancer which continues to rob our nation of its \n     productivity.\n       If we didn't have to deal with the barrier of racism, \n     imagine the energy, talent and resources which could be \n     directed toward solving problems in our society which are \n     universal and common to all of us.\n       Now let's examine some solutions to breaking this barrier \n     of racism.\n       First and foremost, I think one has to address this issue \n     openly and honestly on an individual basis using self-\n     analysis.\n       Let me state I don't think there is anything wrong with \n     cherishing your own race--your own culture and values--but \n     the issue is whether you respect others who do the same.\n       In order to have racial harmony in our culture today, we \n     must respect our differences.\n       Actually, to have harmony, we must have differences.\n       For example, in the world of music.\n       You could have an orchestra--which has stringed \n     instruments, percussion instruments--each instrument has its \n     own distinct sound but because they are playing from the same \n     score, and they are contributing what they were designed to \n     contribute, that creates a very harmonious sound which is \n     very pleasing to the ear.\n       Again, they are not competing with each other, they are \n     complimenting each other.\n       In like manner, we can have racial harmony by respecting \n     the fact that we come from different cultural orientations \n     and different historical experiences.\n       But what we bring to the whole, creates something we could \n     not have apart from each other.\n       What we collectively bring together could be much stronger \n     and could be much better than what the individual groups \n     would have independently.\n       Frederick Douglass once said, ``We are one, our cause is \n     one, and we must help each other; if we are to succeed.''\n       And that's the real beauty of America--that we are stronger \n     together as a nation than we are apart.\n       The next step in addressing solutions toward the issue of \n     racism in our society is one of education.\n       And I feel that this educational component is the most \n     important component because it starts in the home with \n     parents teaching their children about respecting not only \n     their own race but respecting other races as well, teaching \n     them to love their neighbors as they would love \n     themselves, teaching them to respect people who are \n     different than themselves, teaching them to recognize that \n     every individual has some intrinsic value and worth.\n       For me, growing up as an African-American in a \n     predominately white City and State, I learned at a very early \n     age to appreciate different cultures because of my parents \n     and my friends.\n       Although I was raised in a culture which was not as \n     economically affluent as others in which I was exposed, I \n     still maintained a high degree of respect for both cultures.\n       Because my goal as I got older was to pull from the \n     strength of both cultures to be the best person I could \n     possibly be.\n       And it's important to note, that one of the severe \n     consequences of racism is that it robs people from being the \n     best they can possibly be, because racism does not allow \n     people to pull from the strengths of others.\n       Therefore, education at home and education in school is the \n     key to opening our minds, to breaking down stereotypes, myths \n     and folklore about other cultures.\n       Because education is the key, I extend to you an \n     opportunity to work with me.\n       I have established several Learning Centers around the \n     state with the primary focus of educating our young people \n     about the difference education can make in their lives.\n       I invite you to come and share your experiences with these \n     children who come from different cultures and races.\n       Together we can learn from each other and attack the \n     problems which we are finding in our communities--illiteracy, \n     juvenile delinquency, ignorance.\n       I'm sure most of you would agree, that these young people \n     are worth saving.\n       And as influential leaders, as spiritual leaders, I believe \n     that ``giving back'' to your individual communities will do \n     more to eradicate racism than all of the marches and trials \n     put together.\n       Your example as a role model in your community is very \n     influential when children are small, but it certainly does \n     not stop there.\n       It is very critical for a young person to have someone to \n     turn to for guidance when they reach an age that they are \n     making the big chioces that will influence their future, \n     whether to stay in school or drop out, whether to stick with \n     their gang or try to move on as an individual, whether to try \n     to hold a job or make money some easier, more dangerous way.\n       Someone of this age can really benefit from association \n     with a mentor--an adult with valuable life experience who can \n     guide a young person through some of the tough decisions that \n     he will have to make.\n       Some schools or churches have formal programs where \n     individuals are paired based on common interests or goals.\n       An adult who is a physical therapist, for example, may be \n     paired with a young person who is interested in pursuing a \n     career in the health field.\n       The adult knows what it will take in practical terms for a \n     person to achieve this goal and is, therefore, a tremendous \n     resource for a young person to have for encouragement.\n       If there is such a program in your area, I urge you to \n     consider becoming involved.\n       If there is not, keep your eyes open for ways that you can \n     support the dreams of young people around you.\n       Dr. William Julius Wilson, the sociologist, grew up poor.\n       His father died when he was twelve.\n       He was the oldest of six children.\n       When asked how he was able to achieve under such \n     circumstances, he said:\n       ``I was able to get out of that situation because first of \n     all, I always had a role model out there, my aunt Janice, who \n     was the first person in our family to get a college \n     education. She used to take me to museums and give me books \n     to read, and so on. And then I served as a role model for my \n     other brothers and sisters.''\n       This speaks powerfully to the tremendous influence that a \n     role model can have on a person's life.\n       There are countless opportunities for you to put the skills \n     you've learned in life to use helping others make their way.\n       And I am really convinced that this is where all real \n     change, all real building for the future takes place--on a \n     very personal level right around you.\n       In the past, some communities have sunk deeper and deeper \n     into decay, waiting for someone to come to the rescue.\n       I say, ``We are our own rescuers. We are the ones who will \n     save ourselves.''\n       We can hope for money or assistance to come from somewhere.\n       Sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't.\n       But we cannot afford to sit and wait.\n       We must do what we can, what is within our power, to make \n     our communities sounder, our children's lives more promising.\n       We need to take advantage of every program that is \n     currently in operation to make our streets safer and our \n     futures brighter.\n       We are the ones who live in our neighborhoods.\n       If we do not care enough to do our very best to make that \n     place a good area in which to live, then why should we expect \n     others to?\n       We have the most to gain by working to improve our \n     communities and the most to lose by sitting back and waiting.\n       If we want better lives, then the very first step is doing \n     what each one of us can do to make positive things happen.\n       Start with you, with your family, your street, this church.\n       We must first be responsible for ourselves and our \n     activities.\n       Then sometimes you find that changes that occur in small \n     places often lead to dramatic changes in wider areas.\n       You never know where your example and influence will lead.\n       But I do know that for any of it to be successful, for any \n     change to occur, we must\n       Maybe you are not the mayor or a famous athlete or a \n     wealthy contributor to charity.\n       But you are a person who influences the quality of every \n     life he touches in small ways and in large ways.\n       Use that power constructively.\n       Use the tools that God gave you to change your world for \n     the better.\n       And this is how I answer the question, ``How do we teach \n     our children how to deal with racism?''\n       A change for our futures and our children's futures must \n     come from me and you. Society's rules should change, and \n     eventually I think they probably will. But think of the time \n     wasted while we sat waiting for that miraculous day to \n     happen.\n       I feel we are all called to be citizens of action. Today is \n     the day, now is the best time, to start building that new \n     life.\n       In closing, I commend your organization's effort here this \n     evening, because we all know that Jesus's ministry is one of \n     reconciliation.\n     \n[[Page S523]]\n\n       We will soon enter into our third century as a nation.\n       Whether we build in that third century a civilization we \n     can be proud of depends on whether we can arrive at a common \n     conception of what that civilization might stand for or what \n     it might do superbly well.\n       It really depends on us and our children. The mantle of \n     leadership has fallen on our shoulders. So let's make this \n     event more than just a dinner and keynote speech, let's allow \n     it to be the first building block in overcoming this barrier \n     of racism.\n       Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/26/senate-section/article/S521-3", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S523]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HONORING RICH STEELE OF RICHLAND, WA\n\n   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, on November 17, 1995, Richard \nSteele of Richland, WA, was presented with an Environmental Hero Award \nby the Washington Environmental Council for spearheading the effort to \nsave the Hanford Reach, the last free-flowing stretch of the Columbia \nRiver. I prepared the following statement for the event and ask that it \nbe printed in the Record.\n\n       Rich Steele is a man with a mission.\n       In fact, Rich Steele is something of a missionary in the \n     crusade to protect the Hanford Reach--the last free-flowing \n     stretch of the Columbia River and a sanctuary for one of the \n     strongest salmon runs left in the Northwest.\n       Rich has labored for 30 years to protect the Reach. But he \n     is not your average environmentalist. Rich was brought up the \n     hard way in the Tri-Cities; worked construction and other \n     jobs until joining the workforce at the Hanford Nuclear \n     Reservation, where he became one of the site's top \n     technicians. As an avid hunter and fisher, Rich came to love \n     the River and became its chief advocate.\n       His call to this mission came in the mid-sixties, when the \n     Reach was threatened by the Ben Franklin Dam proposal. Rich \n     organized the Columbia River Conservation League in 1967, \n     coordinating successful local opposition to the dam and its \n     powerful backers. He revived the CRCL in the 1980s to block a \n     dredging proposal for the Reach. All the while, Rich has \n     preached the virtues of the Reach--its clear waters and \n     fabulously productive spawning areas, its rich human history, \n     its abundant wildlife, its majestic White Bluffs and soul-\n     restoring solitude.\n       On his own time and at considerable personal expense, Rich \n     has led hundreds of pilgrimages down the Reach, making \n     converts among local citizens, the national media, and \n     elected officials. After touring the Reach with Rich last \n     summer, I am among those who believe it deserves the highest \n     level of permanent protection we can give it.\n       Working closely with other long-time advocates like Jack de \n     Yonge, a dedicated group of local conservationists, and the \n     Nature Conservancy, Rich has helped to popularize the Reach \n     to the point that Wild and Scenic River designation enjoys \n     strong support in the Tri-Cities. Despite opposition from \n     some local politicians, we are developing legislation to \n     protect the Reach that I believe will have a good chance of \n     enactment--perhaps even in this Congress.\n       None of this would be possible without Rich Steele's \n     inspired leadership, passionate activism, and three decades \n     of hard work. Rich has devoted his life to saving the Reach, \n     and it is fitting that he be honored as an environmental \n     hero. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/26/senate-section/article/S523-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S523]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONGRATULATIONS TO STEPHEN ORLOFSKY ON HIS CONFIRMATION TO BE A JUDGE \n              ON THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT OF NEW JERSEY\n\n   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, on February 5, 1996, Steve \nOrlofsky will take the oath of office as a Federal District Court Judge \nfor the District of New Jersey.\n  I had the high honor and privilege of recommending Mr. Orlofsky to \nPresident Clinton last year, and I want to take just a few moments of \nthe Senate's time to explain why I am so proud of him, and why I know \nhe will make such an outstanding judge.\n  Mr. President, let me begin by noting that when Steve is sworn in, he \nwill replace Judge John R. Gerry on the bench. Judge Gerry was revered \nin New Jersey, and was widely known as a distinguished legal scholar, \nskilled administrator, and a compassionate, thoughtful judge. He was \ndedicated to dispensing justice, and he had a reputation for always \nacting with great fairness.\n  I mention this because Judge Gerry was Steve Orlofsky's mentor and \nrole model when Steve served as a U.S. magistrate in his court. They \nmaintained a close relationship over the years, even after Steve went \ninto private practice.\n  Mr. President, I spoke with Judge Gerry shortly before his death, and \nhe had one request: that I recommend Steve to replace him on the New \nJersey District bench.\n  Judge Gerry's shoes will be hard to fill, but I am confident that \nSteve Orlofsky will be a worthy successor.\n  Mr. President, Steve Orlofsky is a man of integrity, with a \ncommitment to justice and the law, a judicious temperament, a strong \nintellect and proven legal skills.\n  He meets the highest standards of excellence and will enhance the \nquality of justice in New Jersey.\n  In reviewing his candidacy, the American Bar Association unanimously \nconferred Steve with a ``well qualified'' rating--the highest rating \npossible. This consensus speaks to his superb qualifications.\n  Steve has been a widely respected attorney in private practice, and \nhe has extensive experience in Federal litigation. He previously served \nas a magistrate judge in the New Jersey Federal District Court from \n1976 to 1980. He also has served in leadership roles in his county and \nState bar associations, and has served his community by providing pro \nbono legal services.\n  In addition, he has published in legal journals and served as a \nlecturer in ongoing legal education courses.\n  Mr. President, Steve Orlofsky has the capacity to be an outstanding \nFederal judge not only because of his thorough knowledge of the law, \nbut also because of his commitment to justice. He will offer more than \nextensive legal experience. He has good judgment, solid values, and \nsensitivity to moral and ethical issues.\n  Steve Orlofsky has all of the personal attributes and professional \nqualifications one could wish for in a judge, and then some.\n  So, Mr. President, I want to again congratulate Steve on his \nappointment, and wish him all the best in his new position. I am very \nproud to have recommended him to President Clinton. I hope he will \nserve on our district court for many years. I know he will serve with \ndistinction, dispensing justice to each person who appears before him \nwith compassion, fairness, and wisdom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/26/senate-section/article/S523-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S523-S524]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   SENIOR CITIZENS HOUSING SAFETY ACT\n\n Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, on January 23, 1996, the Senate \npassed S. 1494, a bill extending several housing programs through \nOctober 1, 1996. I am pleased the Senate included in this bill language \nI developed in my legislation, S. 247, the Senior Citizens Safety Act \nof 1995. I am hopeful that the President will match the tough anti-\ncrime rhetoric conveyed in his State of the Union Address, and sign \nthis legislation when it arrives on his desk.\n  This legislation will end the terror that, unfortunately, runs \nrampant throughout many elderly housing projects. It offers both local \npublic housing facilities [PHA] and local property owners with the \npower to screen out and evict from public and assisted housing persons \nwho illegally use drugs and whose abuse of alcohol is a risk to other \ntenants.\n  In my home State of New Hampshire, most people are still afforded the \nluxury of not having to lock their front doors before turning in for \nthe evening. However, many elderly residents of public housing \nfacilities in my State and across America have been forced to not only \nlock their front doors, but are literally being held prisoner in their \nown homes. I believe this is outrageous. I have received numerous \ncomplaints from residents of elderly housing facilities throughout New \nHampshire who are worried about their personal safety in housing \nspecifically reserved for them.\n  While community policing has gone a long way toward making many of \nAmerica's neighborhoods safe for its elderly residents. No longer will \npeople residing in public housing facilities be allowed to harass, \nshake down, or intimidate their elderly neighbors. Our elderly \npopulation remains vulnerable, and I am pleased the Senate has taken \nthis action which will help protect them.\n  Our housing laws must protect elderly residents. Currently, non-\nelderly persons, considered disabled because of past drug and alcohol \nabuse problems, are eligible to live in housing designated for the \nelderly. This mixing of populations may have filled up the housing \nprojects across the country, but it has opened a Pandora's box of \ntrouble. Simply put, Young, recovering \n\n[[Page S524]]\nalcoholics and drug addicts are not comparable with elderly persons. \nMany of these young people hold all night, loud parties, shake down \nmany of the elderly residents for money, sell drugs within the housing \nfacility, and generally disturb the right to the peaceful enjoyment of \nthe premises by other tenants.\n  This legislation, by no means, circumvents the current housing \neviction procedure. It simply mandates that these individuals with \npatterns of drug and alcohol abuse be evicted after one incident if it \nis determined by the local PHA that their behavior threatens the \nhealth, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other \ntenants.\n  This legislation will help to restore order in housing projects \nthroughout the country. It requires tenants to embrace personal \nresponsibility by mandating tenants to sign a statement which says no \nperson who will be occupying the unit set aside for the elderly will \nillegally use a controlled substance or abuse alcohol in any way. \nAdditionally, the bill will allow the local PHA to evict those persons \nwho continuously raise havoc within these housing projects.\n  I want to commend the Senate for its action in passing this important \nlegislation. It will make our public housing facilities safe for our \nmost vulnerable citizens, the elderly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/26/senate-section/article/S523-3", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S524]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HON.

In so doing, I join with the members of his \ncommunity who are honoring Judge Logan on Saturday, February 3, 1996, \nwith the 13th annual Giant Among Giants Award.\n  This award will be presented to Judge Logan at the 14th annual Giants \nBanquet and Awards celebration that will be held on the Grand Rapids \nCommunity College campus in the Gerald R. Ford Field House. This \ncelebration is sponsored by the college and a consortium of African-\nAmerican organizations with the purpose of raising the awareness of the \nGreater Grand Rapids citizenry of the contributions African-American \nindividuals, organizations, and businesses have made to the history, \ncontinuous growth, and progress of metropolitan Grand Rapids.\n  The ceremony honors 14 individuals for their outstanding commitment \nand contributions to the community. Each of the 12 Giant awards \npresented at the event is named after local African-American \nindividuals who have given long-term service in their professional \nareas and dedication to the Grand Rapids community as a whole.\n  The 13th award is the Giant Among Giants Award. The recipients of \nthis unique award are honored not only for their work in the Grand \nRapids metropolitan area, but also for reaching out to other cities and \nStates in their professional areas. This year, the Giant Among Giants \nAward will be presented to the Honorable Benjamin H. Logan II.\n  Ben has been a community-oriented person throughout his life. He has \ngenerously contributed both his time and talents to many organizations \nincluding the Urban League, Boy Scouts of America, NAACP, Lions Club, \nYMCA, U.S. Supreme Court Historical Society, and countless others.\n  In 1988 Judge Logan, in a historic write-in election, became the \nfirst African-American judge of the 61st District Court in Grand \nRapids. He has been victorious in every subsequent election. He is a \nmember of the Michigan Black Judges Association and national chair of \nthe Judicial Council of the National Bar.\n  Serving his country, church, and community throughout his life, \nBenjamin H. Logan II has been an example to others and an embodiment of \nthe values that the Giant Among Giants Award represents. Mr. President \nI am sure that my colleagues in the Senate join me in extending our \ncongratulations to Judge Logan upon receiving this prestigious award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/26/senate-section/article/S524-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S524-S525]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      GREAT PLAINS SYNFUELS PLANT\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an issue of \nextreme important to my State of North Dakota and to this Nation's \nenergy security.\n  The issue is one currently before the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission [FERC], and involves the fate of a unique energy project in \nNorth Dakota--the Great Plains Coal Gasification Plant located near \nBeulah, ND. The gasification plant converts abundant lignite coal into \nclean-burning synthetic natural gas. It is the only commercial-scale \nplant of its kind that produces synthetic natural gas from coal in the \nworld.\n  FERC must decide whether to approve certain negotiated settlement \nagreements between Dakota Gasification Company [DGC], owner of the \nsynfuels plant, and three interstate pipeline companies which purchase \nthe synthetic natural gas produced by the plant. Additionally, DGC \nreached an agreement with the Department of Energy [DOE] which is \ncontingent on FERC approval of the agreements between DGC and the \npipelines.\n  Late last month, an administrative law judge at FERC issued a \ndecision which could have the impact of closing the project. The judge \ninvalidated three of the four settlements between DGC and the \npipelines. Ironically, the fourth was approved by FERC in January \n1995--1 year ago.\n  Mr. President, I hope the FERC commissioners weigh very carefully the \nimpact this judge's decision will have on the State of North Dakota, \nthe DOE, and our national energy goals. Closing the synfuels plant \nwould not serve our national energy interests, and would create a \nserious setback in this country's search for energy independence.\n  The $2 billion Great Plains Gasification Plant was constructed in the \nearly 1980's after DOE guaranteed a $1.5 billion loan for construction \nof the plant. The DOE loan was made pursuant to the Federal Nonnuclear \nEnergy Research and Development Act of 1974. Great Plains is the only \nproject operating today developed pursuant to the act. Additionally, \nGreat Plains is the only project built as a result of the Government's \nattempts in the late 1970's and early 1980's to demonstrate our ability \nto achieve energy independence.\n  The synfuels plant was only made possible as a result of the issuance \nby FERC of its opinion 119 which approved the gas purchase agreements \nbetween Great Plains and the four pipeline purchasers. As approved by \nopinion 119, these gas purchase agreements provide for the sale of \nsynthetic natural gas at prices established by a formula set out in the \nagreements. In issuing the $1.5 billion loan guarantee, DOE relied on \nFERC's opinion 119 and the reasonable assumption FERC would stand \nbehind its commitment.\n  Unfortunately, the original project sponsors abandoned the project \nafter it was completed in 1985 in response to sudden changes in global \nenergy prices. DOE assumed operation of the plant, and eventually \nsecured ownership through foreclosure. In 1988, DOE sold the facility \nto DGC, a subsidiary of Basin Electric Power Cooperative in my State. \nDOE selected Basin over other bidders because of its commitment to the \nlong-term operation of the project.\n  When Congress authorized DOE to sell the synfuels plant, Congress \nindicated to the Department that a commitment to the long-term \noperation of the plant was an important criteria in evaluating bids for \nthe project. In fact, the conference report accompanying Public Law \n100-202 states:\n\n       The managers agree that the Department of Energy should \n     place higher priority on the continued long-term operation of \n     the Great Plains Coal Gasification Plant as part of its \n     divestiture activity. Continued long-term operation is needed \n     to avoid disruptions to the local economy, capture the \n     benefits associates with extended Plant operations and \n     collect emission reduction technology data.\n\n  That sale also continued the Department's interest in the long-term \noperation of the plant by including a profit-sharing arrangement \nbetween DGC and DOE for the profits from the sale of synthetic natural \ngas. DGC and DOE reasonably assumed FERC would continue to stand behind \nopinion 119 when they negotiated the sale of the plant.\n  Following DGC's acquisition of the project, disputes arose regarding \nthe pricing, output, and transportation provisions of the gas purchase \nagreements. As a result, DGC and DOE filed suit against the pipelines \nin 1990. Before the dispute went to trial, DOE, \n\n[[Page S525]]\nDGC, and the pipelines reached settlement agreements in 1994 that are \nexpressly subject to FERC approval. Again, it is worth mentioning that \nFERC has already approved one of the four settlement agreements.\n  The administrative law judge's decision disapproved the remaining \nsettlements negotiated between DGC and three of the four pipelines, and \nruled that the pricing formula in the gas purchase agreements--as \napproved by opinion 119--should no longer be honored. Additionally, the \njudge's decision put on hold the agreement reached between DGC and DOE, \nwhich is contingent on FERC approval of the agreements between DGC and \nthe pipelines. Finally, the decision retroactively imposed a new \npricing scheme and ordered refunds that would total approximately $280 \nmillion.\n  If unchanged, this decision would close the Great Plains Gasification \nPlant. Mr. President, I believe that result would not serve our \nnational energy interests.\n  I urge the FERC commissioners to give this matter their most careful \nconsideration, and give great attention to Congress' public policy \nobjective of continued long-term operation of the synfuels \nproject.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/26/senate-section/article/S524-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S525]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nHONORING WALTER WIELOH AND HIS 40 YEARS OF TEACHING AT WEIRTON MADONNA \n                              HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \na truly devoted teacher, mentor, and friend to the youth in my State of \nWest Virginia, Mr. Walter Wieloh.\n  It is heartening and inspiring, I believe, to learn about the career \nof Mr. Wieloh, a man who dedicated 40 years of his life to teaching. He \nhas been a member of the faculty at Madonna Catholic High School in \nWeirton, WV, since 1955, teaching several generations of families in \nthe area.\n  In December, he was honored at a special event at the high school, \nand I wanted to add my public congratulations to Mr. Wieloh. His career \nof service to students and his commitment to education for four decades \ncan be an example to all of us.\n  Walter Wieloh started his teaching career when Madonna High School \nopened in 1955, and he has been both educator and friend to generations \nof high school students. To students, he has always been a presence of \nwisdom and of guidance, inside the classroom and out. The current \nprincipal of Madonna, Mr. Robert J. Gill, recalls fondly his days as a \nstudent, and later as a colleague, of Mr. Wieloh. He recognizes him as \na force of inspiration to students and an example of professionalism to \nfellow teachers.\n  Mr. President, Walter Wieloh should be an inspiration to us as well. \nIn his 40 years of educating the youth of Weirton, WV, he represents \nmany hardworking teachers across the country who have helped improve \nthe lives and future of the students in their classrooms every year. \nEncouraging young people to learn, excel, and make the transition to \nadulthood is a challenge that every high school teacher faces, and \nWalter Wieloh has been a leader for Weirton Madonna High School. On \nbehalf of every West Virginian, I commend Walter Wieloh. He definitely \nbrings pride to his profession, and our State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/26/senate-section/article/S525-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S525]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    IN SUPPORT OF CONCILIO CUBANO AND INDEPENDENT CUBAN JOURNALISTS\n\n Mr. MACK. Mr. President, late last year, a broad spectrum of \nCuban opposition groups came together in an effort to form Concilio \nCubano. Concilio Cubano, or Cuban Council, is a group that seeks to \nunite an unprecedented number of human rights, professional, political, \nand other organizations behind a common platform that includes amnesty \nfor political prisoners, free and multiparty elections, and human \nrights.\n  The Castro regime's response has been sickeningly familiar. Members \nof Concilio Cubano have been subjected to lengthy interrogations, \nviolent harassment, and a disinformation campaign.\n  The Miami Herald in a recent editorial likened Concilio Cubano to \nCharter 77, the Czech group that bravely opposed the Czech Communist \ndictatorship. Referring to former dissident, now President, Vaclav \nHavel, one of the leaders of the group told the Herald, ``We have more \nHavels than they had.''\n  Concilio Cubano plans to meet in late February. In Cuba, that's no \nsimple matter. In the weeks leading up to this meeting, supporters of \nfreedom, democracy, and human rights in Cuba must watch closely and \nspeak out against any continued attempts to intimidate these democratic \nactivists.\n  Also recently, the Cuban regime has stepped up persecution of \njournalists affiliated with independent news organizations. The \ncampaign of harassment has included detentions and interrogations.\n  To my knowledge, the Clinton administration has been silent on the \nrecent harassment of Concilio Cubano's members and independent \njournalists. The U.S. press has been fairly silent as well. I urge the \nadministration to denounce these violations of the right of free \nexpression and free association and strongly align itself with the \nsupporters of democracy and freedom in Cuba. And I call upon the \nAmerican press to report on the persecution of their fellow journalists \nand on Cuba's newest, broadest coalition of democratic activists.\n  Cuba's people have been subjected to virtually every form of \nsubjugation. Their mildest form of opposition is met with repression. \nThe United States and the American people are their closest friends. I \ncall upon my colleagues in the Congress, and my fellow citizens to \nsupport the Cuban peoples efforts to exercise their inherent rights of \nfree speech and association. The Cuban people have been resisting the \nCastro dictatorship for over 30 years. For as long as it takes, we must \nstand alongside them and let them know we support their \nstruggle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/26/senate-section/article/S525-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S525]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO CYPRESS GARDENS DIAMOND JUBILEE DAY\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. As we arrived at the Capitol today, we noticed the \nremaining ice and snow from the blizzard earlier this month.\n  My thoughts traveled to sunny Florida, America's top tourist \ndestination. Our State is blessed with clean waters, exquisite beaches, \nsubtropical climate, and some of the most beautiful freshwater lakes in \nthe world.\n  Mr. President, some six decades ago, a visionary named Dick Pope, Sr. \nlooked out upon the blessed beauty of central Florida and created what \nbecame Cypress Gardens.\n  This world renown attraction, Cypress Gardens, celebrates its diamond \njubilee on February 1, 1996. The millions who have visited Cypress \nGardens or seen its glory on film join in a national salute to this 60-\nyear milestone.\n  In the six decades since the founding of Cypress Gardens, the \nattractions industry in Florida has flourished. Through decades of \ngrowth and change, Cypress Gardens retains a special place in Florida's \ntourism legacy.\n  These gardens reflect the natural wonderment of Florida, the \ningenuity of Dick Pope and the never-ending appeal of quality family \nentertainment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/26/senate-section/article/S525-3", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S525-S526]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CHRISTMAS IN APRIL\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as a member of the National \nAdvisory Board of a special outreach program called Christmas in April, \nI am extremely proud to speak to you today about a tremendously \ngenerous group of people who deliver Christmas spirit to low-income \nfamilies during the spring.\n  With the support of honorary cochairs, NFL Commissioner Paul \nTagliabue, his wife Chan, along with Arizona first lady Ann Symington, \nChristmas in April, the Nation's largest volunteer home rehabilitation \ninitiative, kicks off its 1996 campaign by rebuilding the homes of two \nfamilies in Phoenix's Hermosa neighborhood during Super Bowl weekend.\n  The focus of this charity is rebuilding and repairing the homes of \nlow-income, elderly, and disabled Americans to help provide warmth, \nsafety, and independence to families in need.\n  Many needy homeowners will receive this assistance in April 1996, \nwhen an army of about 140,000 caring volunteers will arrive on the \ndoorsteps of about 4,200 homeowners in 430 cities and towns across the \ncountry.\n  Thanks to the hard work of these volunteers, Christmas in April has \nexpanded to 160 local affiliates in 44 \n\n[[Page S526]]\nStates which contribute $25 million toward home repairs for \ndisadvantaged Americans across the country.\n  So at this time, Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to the \ncompassion and commitment of Christmas In April volunteers all across \nthis Nation. Each time a grab bar is installed for a disabled child, \nevery time sturdy stairs are built for an aged widow, and a fresh coat \nof paint is applied for a needy family--hope and dignity are restored.\n  Mr. President, this kind of unfailing generosity and kindness are the \nlifeblood of our country, and once again I commend this group and its \nvolunteers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/26/senate-section/article/S525-4", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S526]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        RECOGNIZING SRI LANKA'S 48TH ANNIVERSARY OF INDEPENDENCE\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \ncountry of Sri Lanka which will celebrate its 48th anniversary of \nindependence on February 4, 1996. I would like to congratulate a \ncountry which during the last four decades has made tremendous strides \nin socio-economic development in a democratic system.\n  Democracy in Sri Lanka has deep roots. Its people have maintained a \nfunctioning democracy since independence against great odds. There have \nbeen regular national elections in Sri Lanka where voter turnout has \nbeen remarkably high. At a free and fair Parliamentary election held in \nAugust 1994 and observed by an international team including United \nStates nationals, the people of Sri Lanka elected a new Government \ndefeating a political party that was in power for 17 years. This was \nfollowed by a Presidential election in November 1994 at which Ms. \nChandrika B. Kumaratunga was elected President with a 62-percent \nmandate. The voter turnout at both these elections was above 70 \npercent. I would like to congratulate the people of Sri Lanka for their \ncommitment to democracy and improving human rights.\n  Over the years the United States and Sri Lanka have developed close \nbilateral relations. Sri Lanka has long hosted a Voice of America \nstation on its territory and a project is well underway to upgrade the \nstation. The United States is Sri Lanka's largest trading partner. The \nbilateral trade exceeds $1.4 billion. We have signed a bilateral \ninvestment protection treaty and an agreement to protect intellectual \nproperty rights.\n  Sri Lanka has been a pioneer in the South Asian region by \nliberalizing its economy and following market oriented economic \npolicies. Free Trade Zones have been set up and incentives have been \nprovided for foreign investment. I am pleased to note that there are \nmany United States companies and banks currently operating in Sri Lanka \nand that the American Chamber of Commerce in Sri Lanka organized a \nsuccessful United States Trade Fair in 1995.\n  Sri Lanka's drive for economic development which showed much promise \nin the early eighties has been restricted by the ongoing ethnic \nconflict which escalated in 1983. However, growth rates have averaged 5 \npercent per year. I am encouraged by the newly elected President's \nstated priority in finding a lasting political solution to the \nconflict. I can only share the aspirations of all Sri Lankans that \npeace will return soon to this beautiful country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/26/senate-section/article/S526-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S526]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        UNITED NATIONS INSIGNIA\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, we have all been watching the \nreports as U.S. Army Specialist Michael New has become a casualty of \nthe debate over American troops participating in U.N. operations.\n  In violating a lawful order issued through the U.S. chain of command, \nhe will be held accountable under the standards set by the U.S. Code of \nMilitary Justice for refusing to wear a U.N. cap and shoulder patch.\n  Specialist New was to have been deployed to participate in Operation \n``Able Sentry'' in Macedonia, the stated purpose of which is to observe \nthe border and discourage, by its presence, the spread of hostilities \ninto Macedonia.\n  Mr. President, on October 10, Army Specialist Michael New reported \nfor duty without wearing the U.N. shoulder patch and beret he and his \nunit were issued to wear as part of their uniform while deployed in \nMacedonia. On October 17, Specialist New was charged for failure to \nobey a lawful order in violation of Article 92: Uniform Code of \nMilitary Justice.\n  On January 23, 1996, the trial on the facts in the special court-\nmartial of Specialist Michael G. New began. On January 24, the court, \ncomposed of officers and enlisted personnel, found Specialist New \nguilty of the charged offense of failure to obey a lawful order to \n``wear the prescribed uniform for the deployment to Macedonia.'' He was \nfound in violation of Article 92: Uniform Code of Military Justice.\n  Specialist New was sentenced by the court-martial members to be \ndischarged from the U.S. Army with a bad-conduct discharge.\n  Mr. President, the situation that has resulted from Specialist New's \nactions has caused me great concern. As one who feels very strongly \nabout this Nation's sovereignty and responsibilities placed on our \nArmed Forces to protect and defend this Nation, I find myself very \nfrustrated with what has happened.\n  Mr. President, my sympathy with his decision to refuse to wear the \nU.N. patch and hat does not change the fact that we must abide by the \nstandards set by the military code of conduct if we are to assure order \nand fairness in the military. Our military must rely on strict chain of \ncommand and order. That is without a doubt.\n  However, the men and women who have chosen to serve this Nation and \nthe American people should not be put in a position which forces them \nto bear allegiance to any nation or organization other than the United \nStates of America. Michael New made the decision to serve in the Armed \nForces in order to defend the United States, not the United Nations.\n  In order to address this situation, I introduced legislation that \nprevents any member of the U.S. Armed Forces from being required to \nwear, as part of their military uniform, any insignia of the United \nNations.\n  Mr. President, I hope that we can deal with this issue by proceeding \nin the legislative process with hearings on S. 1370, which now has 25 \ncosponsors. In addition, there is still another, broader issue that \nmust be addressed, and that is the use of U.S. Forces under U.N. \ncommand.\n  Mr. President, I would just urge my colleagues to review S. 1370. We \nmust not lose sight of the fact that the men and women who volunteered \nto serve in our Armed Forces, volunteered to defend the United States \nof America, not the United Nations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from \nVirginia, Mr. Warner, be added as a cosponsor of S. 1370.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/26/senate-section/article/S526-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S526-S527]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CARL S.

He returned to the \nUniversity of Arkansas at Fayetteville late that year to become vice \npresident of governmental relations and public affairs. In July of \n1978, he became president of Arkansas State University.\n  Carl attended the University of Central Arkansas at Conway and Emory \nUniversity in Atlanta, GA, before earning a degree in social welfare \nfrom the University of Arkansas at \n\n[[Page S527]]\nFayetteville.

Lutali of American Samoa has been selected to receive this \nyear's Seacology Foundation Award as the Indigenous Conservationist of \nthe Year in recognition of his superb efforts to preserve the \nrainforest and indigenous Samoan culture. Governor Luitali's successes \ninclude leading the effort to create the National Park of American \nSamoa. He is also responsible for passage of an act to protect the \nAmerican Samoa Flying Fox. Neither of these achievements would have \noccurred without Governor Lutali.\n  Seacology Foundation is a nonprofit foundation founded to help \nprotect island ecosystems and island cultures. Seacology scientist \ninclude experts in endangered species, island flora and fauna, and \nisland ecosystems. Hundred percent of the money donated to Seacology \ngoes directly to building schools, hospitals, installing safe water \nsupplies, and meeting other needs of the rainforest villagers so that \nthey will not have to sell off the rainforest to survive. Seacology \nscientists donate their time as well.\n  I congratulate Governor Lutali and the Seacology Foundation for all \nof their efforts. I ask that the letter from Paul Alan Cox, Ph.D., \nchairman of the board of Seacology Foundation to Governor Lutali be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The letter follows:\n\n                                     The Seacology Foundation,\n\n                                Springville, UT. October 24, 1995.\n     Gov. A.P. Lutali,\n     Office of the Governor, American Samoa Government, Pago Pago, \n         American Samoa.\n       Dear Governor Lutali: On behalf of the Board of Directors \n     and the Scientific Advisory Board of the Seacology \n     Foundation, it gives me great pleasure to inform you that you \n     have selected as the 1995 Indigenous Conservationist of the \n     Year. This award, believed to be the only one of its kind in \n     the world, annually recognizes an indigenous person who has \n     demonstrated heroic efforts in protecting the environment. \n     The Seacology Foundation invites you, at our expense, to \n     attend an award dinner in your honor and a presentation \n     ceremony in Provo, Utah to receive your award, which will \n     consist of an engraved plaque and a cash award of $1,000. \n     Lorraine Clark, Executive Associate Director of the Seacology \n     Foundation, will be in touch with Rob Shaffer from your staff \n     to arrange a convenient date for this event.\n       In making this award, the Seacology Foundation wishes to \n     recognize your personal courage and foresight in protecting \n     the rainforests and wildlife of American Samoa. You have \n     demonstrated your commitment to conservation in many \n     different ways. Examples of your environmental leadership \n     include passage of an act to protect flying foxes, including \n     the rare Samoan Flying Fox, Periopus samoensis, or pe'avao by \n     the Territorial Legislature of American Samoa. Your \n     leadership was crucial in passing this legislation, which is \n     believed to be the first legislation enacted by any Pacific \n     island government to protect flying foxes. Because of your \n     example, many other island governments have now enacted \n     similar legislation.\n       Even more impressive was your visionary foresight in \n     establishing the 50th National Park of the United States of \n     America, the National Park of American Samoa. It was your \n     leadership and your vision that brought together a coalition \n     of Samoan school children, villagers, matai and other \n     traditional community leaders, territorial officials, \n     scientists, conservationists, and U.S. Congressmen to create \n     a new future for the people of American Samoa. You personally \n     held meetings with key scientists and village leaders, you \n     personally hosted a distinguished congressional delegation in \n     Samoa, you personally traveled to Washington, D.C. to testify \n     on behalf of the park and you personally provided leadership \n     at every phase to assure passage of the enabling legislation. \n     You exercised this leadership without any concern for its \n     potential impact on your political future. Because of your \n     selflessness and bi-partisan approach, the American Samoa \n     National Park Bill became one of the first national park \n     bills to pass both houses of the United States Congress \n     without a single dissenting vote. You played a key role in \n     guaranteeing that the aspirations and well being of Samoan \n     villages were paramount in the enabling legislation. Unique \n     land acquisition techniques, revolving around long term \n     leases, were used under your direction. Village chiefs were \n     guaranteed important roles in formulating park policy. The \n     Samoan language and culture are to be highlighted in all park \n     activities. As a result of your foresight, American Samoa \n     will have a national park that will preserve both Samoan \n     wildlife and Samoan culture.\n       Many other examples of your conservation leadership could \n     be cited. The Territorial Division of Wildlife and Marine \n     Resources under your leadership has made important progress \n     in evaluating and protecting the wildlife of American Samoa. \n     Coastal Zone Management has flourished under your leadership. \n     But perhaps most important has been your quiet personal \n     example. You quietly led an effort to re-introduce the rare \n     Samoa toloa or duck to your home island of Annu'u. The crack \n     of dawn has frequently found you on your hands and knees \n     weeding the garden plot in front of the territorial offices. \n     Many have seen you picking up rubbish and doing your own part \n     as private citizen to beautify the exquisite islands of \n     American Samoa.\n       Because of your stellar service, both public and private to \n     conservation, and because of the tremendous example of \n     dedication and courage that you have set for your own \n     people--the Polynesian Islanders--and for indigenous peoples \n     throughout the world, the Seacology Foundation is pleased to \n     bestow upon you the most distinguished award for indigenous \n     conservation in the world by naming you Indigenous \n     Conservationist of the Year 1995. We offer you our sincere \n     appreciation for your tremendous devotion to protecting this \n     planet.\n           Warmest personal regards,\n                                     Nafanua Paul Alan Cox, Ph.D.,\n\n     Chairman of the Board.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/26/senate-section/article/S527-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S527-S529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   OFFICER RONALD MICHAEL RYAN, JR., AND OFFICER TIMOTHY JAMES JONES\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to two \ngallant police officers from Saint Paul, MN. On August 26, 1994, \nOfficer Ronald Michael Ryan, Jr. and Officer Timothy James Jones gave \ntheir lives in the line of duty.\n  It is important that the memory of their brave lives be a part of the \nofficial history of our country. I therefore ask that the following \neulogies by Chief William Finney be printed in the Congressional Record \non behalf of these two slain police officers: The eulogy by Chief \nWilliam Finney in memory of Officer Ronald Michael Ryan, Jr. and the \neulogy by Chief William Finney in memory of Officer Timothy James \nJones.\n  The eulogies follows:\n\n        Ronald Michael Ryan, Jr.--Eulogy by Chief William Finney\n\n       Ron Ryan junior brought youthful enthusiasm, warmth, \n     friendship and loyalty to our department. He touched our \n     lives in a very special way, and gave has all to his brothers \n     and sisters in blue. The greatest thing this extraordinary \n     young man gave to us was his commitment, to make our city a \n     better place to live, to make our department a more pleasant \n     place to work, and to add whatever he could to the lives of \n     those around him. He represented the very best that a Police \n     Officer can be, and in a very real way represented the spirit \n     of the St. Paul Police department.\n       Many people think it's easy for the son of a Police Officer \n     to follow in dad's footsteps, especially when they work for \n     the same department. And especially when the son shares the \n     father's gift of gab, easy humor, and superior people skills. \n     But Ron Ryan junior learned just the opposite. He learned \n     that the trials and tribulations of being a rookie cop who is \n     the son of a cop were extra hard, that there would be a \n     little more razzing from the troops. Ron Junior had a routine \n     of polishing the brass buttons on his \n\n[[Page S528]]\n     uniform before coming to work. One time a supervisor asked to look at \n     those buttons, and Ronnie obliged him. But when he got them \n     back he noticed they were quite tarnished, and that the \n     supervisor had switched them, for his own dirty ones. The gag \n     went on and on, and eventually, Ron got to the point of \n     bringing in an extra set of polished buttons to work. On a \n     larger scale, Ron Ryan junior polished up the image and \n     morale of this department with his tireless well of positive \n     energy.\n       Ron was a hard worker, never afraid to help out a fellow \n     officer or be first on a call. And he was a quick thinker, \n     quick to figure out what had to be done in tough situations. \n     Just a year ago, he and two other officers formed a human \n     pyramid to remove three children from the second story of a \n     burning house. For that he received the Medal of Merit--our \n     second highest award--an amazing accomplishment for a rookie \n     cop. And he didn't let up. Just this year, he was given \n     another commendation. Think about that. Two commendations in \n     less than a year. Ron Ryan junior was one of the best young \n     Police Officers our department has seen.\n       He joined us in July of 1990, as a parking enforcement \n     officer. Never losing sight of his real goal, he took our \n     oath as a Police Officer on January 23rd, 1993. And in just \n     19 short months he made his mark, served his beloved east \n     side, and made his department proud.\n       Today, it is with the heaviest of hearts that I say goodbye \n     to Ron Ryan Junior. We will all remember you for your \n     courage, your heroism, your willingness to serve and that \n     sparkle you gave to those around you. And let no one ever \n     forget that Ron Ryan Junior was truly one of St. Paul's \n     finest.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n          Timothy James Jones--Eulogy by Chief William Finney\n\n       It is my distinct honor to share some thoughts today on the \n     life of Officer Timothy James Jones--a man who was not only a \n     St. Paul Police officer for the past 16 years, but also a \n     talented leader, a loving husband and father, and a special \n     friend to all of us. It is very difficult to convey in words \n     the scope of his contribution to our police department. Along \n     with his energy, humor, and commitment to police work, he \n     also brought what can be a rare commodity: results. \n     (Productivity) When Tim Jones answered a call, you could be \n     sure that the situation would be resolved. For 16 years, he \n     built a strong record of service. He was a mature police \n     officer, who had recently shifted his focus toward helping \n     younger officers improve their law enforcement skills. The \n     advice and direction that he gave the younger officers will \n     be a legacy which will live on in the future of the St. Paul \n     Police Department.\n       Tim had an infectious grin and he could be a bit of a \n     jokester. One of his closest friends told me he's probably \n     looking down from heaven right now, laughing and calling us \n     names. His closest friends lovingly called him ``Nip,'' or \n     ``the Nipper.'' I personally preferred to just call him \n     Jonesy. Another of our Asian American officers, Pat Lyttle, \n     teamed up with Tim to form a racketball duo known as the \n     ``Far East Connection.'' Tim was always ready to laugh, and \n     more than willing to laugh at himself.\n       But when he put on the uniform and hit the street, he was \n     all business. (Pride) He pursued his mission as a police \n     officer at 100 percent, at all times. He was known as the \n     officer who would be the first on the scene, and the last to \n     leave. (Professionalism) His assignment to the canine unit \n     was a natural progression in which he extended his \n     helpfulness across the city. And whenever Officer Jones \n     showed up with his canine partner Ninja or more recently \n     Laser, you knew the bad guy would be found. The other \n     officers would be attracted to him like a magnet, because \n     they knew he would get results. They would watch and wonder \n     and learn. That made him the purest kind of leader--one who \n     leads by example. (Participation) On three occasions, he was \n     given commendations by our police department for his \n     outstanding service to the community.\n       His pursuit of excellence vaulted him into national \n     prominence. In 1988, he and NINJA ranked 4th in the United \n     States in individual canine competition. In 1989, they took \n     third place. In 1990, another third place finish. And in \n     1991, a 5th place finish. They were part of our St. Paul \n     Police canine team which took top honors nationally in 1989, \n     1990 and 1991. Tim didn't really strive for those kind of \n     honors--he just did the best job he could, and he got \n     results. And he made all of us proud.\n       Lately he had been sharing his wisdom. He and Laser would \n     arrive first at the scene, as usual, locate the bad guy, and \n     then keep him confined as he allowed one of the younger \n     canine officers to go in and make the arrest. He wanted \n     those younger officers to get the experience they needed \n     to mature as he had. They responded by telling him he was \n     no longer the Nipper. No, they told him he had evolved \n     into ``Buddha,'' the wise one.\n       Whether he was being the ``wise one'' or a ``wise guy'' Tim \n     Jones was a very special cop. Last Friday, when he heard what \n     had happened to his friend Ron Ryan, he came in on his day \n     off to help. That didn't surprise anyone--that was Tim Jones. \n     It didn't surprise anyone that he would be the first one to \n     locate the suspect, either. It was the outcome that has \n     shocked us, and left us with an empty place in our hearts. To \n     the end, he and his canine partner were heroes. With Officer \n     Jones down, his partner Laser continued to pursue the suspect \n     with his last breaths, after being mortally wounded. His \n     canine partners: Ninja, the national award winner, Laser, the \n     apprehender, and finally, K-C, the narcotics detector, who \n     carries on the Jonesy canine tradition.\n       Tim Jones became a St. Paul police officer on October 31st, \n     1978. It was his 21st birthday. For 16 years, he learned and \n     excelled and led, and passed-on a unique legacy to those \n     around him. Officer Tim Jones epitomized the spirit and \n     essence of the police ``four P's: pride, professionalism, \n     participation and productivity.''\n       He leaves behind his wife Roxanne, and children Matthew and \n     Chelsie. Recently Tim had been skipping golf games to take \n     his son to hockey practice several times a week. He gave \n     everything he had to his family, both at home and at the \n     police department. And we will all miss him deeply.\n       To Roxanne, Matthew and Chelsie: It is not enough to say \n     that he is in heaven. The fact is, heaven was made for people \n     like Tim. He died as he had lived--trying to help others \n     without thinking of himself. But we will all be thinking \n     about you, Tim. For no one has ever given us greater gifts, \n     or a greater sacrifice. My, my, my--wasn't he a piece of \n     work.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask further that the following \nremarks from The Saint Paul Police Department 1994 Annual Report be \nprinted in the Record. Dedicated to the memory of Officer Ron Ryan, Jr. \nand Officer Timothy Jones, it is entitled, ``August 26, 1994--Our Day \nof Tragedy.''\n  The material follows:\n\n                  August 26, 1994--Our Day of Tragedy\n\n       The morning of August 26, 1994 broke with a beauty and \n     clarity that is rare even during Minnesota's fleeting summer. \n     The air was calm, warm and clear as the sun rose above the \n     spire of Sacred Heart Catholic Church at 6th Street and Hope. \n     Officer Ron Ryan Jr., 26 years old, walked up to check on the \n     welfare of a man who was slumped down in the driver's seat of \n     a red subcompact car, parked in the church parking lot. The \n     officer's concern was met by a flurry of gunfire from the \n     drifter. The evil ambush claimed Officer Ryan's life, \n     shattered the calm of that morning, and set a sickening tone. \n     During the search for the suspect that day, there would be a \n     second ambush and the loss of Officer Timothy Jones and his \n     canine partner, Laser. Offsetting the horror and disbelief of \n     those events, was the professionalism of the Saint Paul \n     Police force, who put aside grief, until the search for the \n     suspect had been successfully completed. Only then did the \n     grieving process begin; a grief shared by hundreds of \n     thousands of metro area residents, by police officers across \n     the country, and by many others who reflected on our day of \n     tragedy.\n       It had been 24 years since a Saint Paul Police Officer had \n     fallen to gunfire, more than two decades in which Saint Paul \n     officers had been spared the tragic realities of most other \n     American cities. Some would say it was Saint Paul's \n     reputation for treating suspects with respect. In the course \n     of arresting literally hundreds of thousands of suspects, no \n     Saint Paul Officer had been attacked with deadly force. But \n     it all changed that morning in August. Guy Baker, 26, a man \n     wanted on weapons charges in his native Iowa, had told \n     friends in Mason City that he was thinking about shooting a \n     police officer. For reasons which are still not clear, he \n     decided to borrow a friend's car and drive to Saint Paul. As \n     Officer Ryan walked up to the car that morning, Baker held a \n     gun under the coat he was using as a blanket. He knew the \n     officer would check his identity and then probably arrest him \n     for the warrant. Baker ambushed Office Ryan and then took his \n     service weapon after he had fallen. A resident who witnessed \n     the attack fired a shot at the suspect vehicle from the \n     window of his home, shattering the car's back window. But the \n     suspect got away before the first squads arrived at the \n     scene.\n       Baker drove only a mile before he ditched the car and \n     changed clothing. In a wooded area close to I-94, he waited \n     for the officers he knew would be searching for him. Once \n     again he assumed a position that would allow him to ambush an \n     officer. Unlike the typical suspect who would be acting out \n     of fear, Baker's actions were those of a demented, yet highly \n     trained combat veteran. He took up a position inside an ice \n     fishing shack in the back yard of a home on Conway Street. \n     With a row of windows in the small structure, Baker had an \n     unrestricted view on the world outside. But it would be \n     nearly impossible to see him from the outside. He sat in his \n     killer's perch and waited.\n       Officer Timothy Jones, 36, a veteran canine officer who had \n     won national awards, was enjoying a day off with his children \n     when he heard the news about his friend Ron Ryan. Without \n     hesitation he came into work to aid in the search for the \n     killer. In retrospect, no one was surprised that he would be \n     the first officer to locate the suspect. He was known as one \n     of the best officers in a canine unit that had won the top \n     national award four out of the last six years. As hundreds of \n     officers fanned out searching for the suspect it was Tim \n     Jones and Laser who picked up his scent and began moving \n     toward the fish house. As the officer approached the \n     structure, shots blasted from the inside, through the flimsy \n     window and wall of the structure, hitting Officer Jones. He \n     died less than four hours after his friend and co-worker Ron \n     Ryan. As Baker exited the fish house, Laser attacked, \n     latching onto the suspect with his powerful \n\n[[Page S529]]\n     jaws. Baker shot the animal, but it attacked a second time. After being \n     shot several times, the dying canine was still crawling \n     towards the suspect with his last ounce of energy.\n       Baker had made another getaway, but it was to be short \n     lived. Within two hours he was arrested and taken to the \n     hospital to be treated for the dog bites he had suffered. \n     Eventually he would plead guilty to the two murders.\n       Twin Cities television and radio stations were providing \n     instant, live coverage of the events as they unfolded that \n     Friday. The unprecedented coverage made it a very public \n     tragedy, and that followed through to the funerals. Literally \n     thousands of people lined the streets along the funeral \n     procession routes.\n       Officer Ryan was buried on August 30. In his eulogy, Chief \n     Finney said Ron Ryan Junior ``brought youthful enthusiasm, \n     warmth, friendship and loyalty to our department.'' More than \n     2,000 police officers from as far away as Canada attended the \n     funeral.\n       Officer Jones was buried on August 31. Chief Finney called \n     him ``a talented leader, a loving husband and father, and a \n     special friend.'' An estimated 400 canine officers from \n     across Minnesota and many other states were on hand, along \n     with hundreds of other officers. A four mile long procession \n     of police cars stretched from the Cathedral to Elmhurst \n     Cemetery.\n       The memories of these two fine officers will live on in the \n     history of our department. Ron Ryan Jr. gave much to us, in \n     just a short time. Tim Jones shared his knowledge and \n     maturity with his fellow officers. Without hesitation, they \n     gave the ultimate sacrifice while serving their department \n     and city. They will not be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/26/senate-section/article/S527-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      DAN KELLEY OF AGRIBANK, FCB\n\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I rise today in tribute to \nMr. Dan Kelley, a prominent agriculturist and farm leader in my home \nState of Illinois, who currently serves on the Board of AgriBank Farm \nCredit Bank. Unfortunately, he will soon be leaving the board. I want \nto take the opportunity to commend Dan Kelley for his exemplary public \nservice and the strong leadership he provided during a time of real \nchallenges at the Farm Credit System.\n  Dan Kelley was the last chairman of the former St. Louis Farm Credit \nBank--federally chartered in 1917 to provide credit and related \nservices to farmers in Illinois, Arkansas, and Missouri. As chairman, \nhe led an initiative to bring about the historic merger of the St. \nLouis Farm Credit Bank with a sister institution in St. Paul, MN to \nform AgriBank, FCB. This was the first voluntary merger of a Farm \nCredit bank in the history of the Farm Credit System. Mr. Kelley served \nas the first board chairman of AgriBank and, again, played a key \nleadership role in making the merger work. More generally, the Farm \nCredit System began to regain its position as a leader in agricultural \ncredit markets in Illinois and other States in the Midwest during Mr. \nKelley's tenure as Chairman.\n  To appreciate what Dan Kelley accomplished in his 7 years of service, \none must recall that the Farm Credit System had reached the lowest \npoint in its history when he first joined the St. Louis Farm Credit \nBoard in 1989. The great farm depression of the mid-1980's humbled the \nSt. Louis Farm Credit Bank, the Farm Credit System as a whole, as well \nas a number of other agricultural lenders. Losses were mounting in St. \nLouis and throughout the Farm Credit System, while volume was \nshrinking.\n  Farmers were leaving the Farm Credit System because they were \nunhappy--unhappy with the rates of interest they were paying, and with \nthe service they were receiving. Some borrowers were concerned that \nthey would not be able to keep their loans current. Others left Farm \nCredit due to fears that the stock they had invested in their credit \ncooperative was at risk. The Farm Credit System, once commonly \ncelebrated as a success story, had become a lightening rod for everyone \ndissatisfied with the state of the farm economy. The Farm Credit \nSystem, it was said, had overhead costs that were too high, credit \nstandards that were too lax, and a lack of sensitivity to acute \nproblems being experienced by the distressed borrowers. Not \nsurprisingly, the system was also losing money. The St. Louis Bank and \nthe other predecessors of AgriBank lost more than $1.7 billion in 1985.\n  In short, Dan Kelley and his colleagues on the Board of the St. Louis \nFarm Credit Bank in January 1989 faced obstacles that appeared \nvirtually insurmountable to some. Some observers were drafting an \nobituary for the St. Louis Bank and the entire Farm Credit System. \nThese draft obituaries were premature. The Farm Credit System has \nsurvived and now flourishes. Over the past several years, the System \nhas made an extraordinary recovery from the financial disaster of the \nmid-1980's. Dan Kelley's bank, in particular, restructured and \ncollected billions of dollars of troubled loans. The net result is that \nnonaccruing loans dropped from 7.1 percent of the bank's total in 1989 \nto 2.7 percent in December of 1995. Operating costs were dramatically \nreduced. More than $2 billion in earnings and capital has been \ngenerated, and members' equity in their credit cooperative increased by \nmore than $1 billion.\n\n  Of course, a number of other factors were responsible for the \nremarkable turnaround in the fortunes of AgriBank and the Farm Credit \nSystem. For example, the recovery would not have been possible without \na more general turnaround in the farm economy. Beyond that, however, \nDan Kelley and his colleagues deserve an enormous amount of credit for \nmaking the right decisions on some critical and very difficult issues.\n  Indeed, Dan Kelley's successes and those of the Farm Credit System as \na whole have confounded the cynics who said that farmer cooperatives \ncannot survive, much less prosper, in today's more competitive and \nfast-moving markets.\n  Cynics said that farmer-elected boards of directors would not \nvoluntarily vote themselves out of jobs. Dan Kelley and his colleagues \nproved those cynics wrong when AgriBank was created in 1991 and when it \nwas expanded to include the former Louisville Farm Credit Bank in 1993.\n  Cynics alleged that the Agriculture Credit Act of 1987 could not work \nand that the Federal financial assistance provided to the Farm Credit \nSystem would never be repaid. In October 1992, however, Dan Kelley \nagain proved the cynics wrong by announcing that AgriBank was repaying \nthe $133 million of assistance 11 years ahead of schedule.\n  In short, the cynics underestimated Dan Kelley and other farm leaders \nwho were determined to build a stronger, lower-cost and more effective \ncredit cooperative for farmers. AgriBank is now a reality and has \nexceeded the expectations of many of those responsible for its \ncreation. Its very existence and remarkable success owe a great deal to \nthe hard work, dedication, and good judgment of Dan Kelley.\n  Dan Kelley's departure from AgriBank does not mean he will no longer \nbe a farm leader. His commitment to American agriculture and \ninstitutions serving the American farmer is too strong for that. He \nwill continue to be an active farmer, a member of the Illinois Farm \nBureau, the Illinois Corn Growers Association, and to serve on the \nboard of Gromark.\n  On behalf of Illinois farmers, and those who care about American \nagriculture, I thank Dan Kelley for his achievements, and wish him the \nvery best in his continued endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/26/senate-section/article/S529-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S529-S530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 2726, just received from \nthe House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2726) to make certain technical corrections in \n     laws relating to Native Americans, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nH.R. 2726, a bill to make technical amendments to various laws \naffecting native Americans and to urge its immediate adoption. This \nbill includes a number of provisions which have been considered and \napproved by this body in the first session of the 104th Congress. This \nlegislation addresses a wide range of Indian issues. I am joined by a \nnumber of Senators who have sponsored provisions which were included in \nH.R. 2726. I will briefly describe the provisions of H.R. 2726. Section \n1 of the bill makes technical corrections to section 9 of the Pokagon \nPotawatomi Restoration \n\n[[Page S531]]\nAct. These corrections would change the reference in section 9 from \nplural to singular. Section 2 of S. 325 makes technical corrections to \nthe Odawa and Ottawa Restoration Act. This section corrects all of the \nreferences in section 9 by using the plural.\n  Section 3 of the bill corrects a citation in section 4 of the Indian \nDams Safety Act of 1994. Section 4 of H.R. 2726 amends the Pascua Yaqui \nIndians Act to capitalize the words ``Pascua Yaqui Tribe.'' Section 5 \namends section 3(7) of the Indian Lands Open Dump Cleanup Act of 1994 \nto correct the citation to the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Section 6 of \nthe bill amends the American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of \n1994 to correct a reference in section 303(c) of the act and to correct \na typographical error in section 306 of the act. Section 7 of the bill \ncorrects a reference in section 102 of the Indian Self-Determination \nContract Reform Act of 1994. Section 8 of the bill corrects certain \nreferences in sections 203 and 206 of the Auburn Indian Restoration \nAct. Section 9 of the bill amends the Crow Boundary Settlement Act of \n1994 corrects several references in sections 5, 9, and 10 of the act. \nSection 10 of H.R. 2726 corrects a typographical error in section 205 \nof the Tlingit and Haida Status Clarification Act. Section 11 of the \nbill amends section 103 of the Native American Languages Act to correct \nseveral citations in the section. Section 12 of the bill amends section \n5 of the Ponca Restoration Act to modify the service area of the Ponca \nIndian Tribe to include Indians living in Sarpy, Burt, Platte, Stanton, \nHall, Holt, and Wayne Counties in Nebraska and Indians living in \nWoodbury and Pottawattomie Counties in Iowa. It has been estimated that \nthere are 110 Ponca tribal members living in these counties who are not \ncurrently eligible to receive services from the tribe. This amendment \nto the Ponca Restoration Act would make these members eligible for \ntribal services from the Ponca Tribe. I would like to recognize the \nleadership of the delegation from Nebraska, Senators Exon and Kerrey \nwho brought this provision to my attention and urged its inclusion in \nthe legislation.\n  Section 13 of the bill provides for the revocation of the charter of \nincorporation of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe under the Indian \nReorganization Act. The Minnesota Chippewa Tribe has requested the \nCongress to accept their surrender of the Corporate Charter of the \nMinnesota Chippewa. By its own terms, this charter can only be revoked \nby act of Congress. This provision would revoke the charter. Section 14 \nof the bill amends section 5(6) of the Advisory Council on California \nIndian Policy Act of 1992 to extend the term of the Advisory Council on \nCalifornia Indian Policy from 18 to 36 months in order to allow them to \ncomplete their study of issues affecting California Indian tribes.\n\n  Section 15 of the bill amends section 401 of the Public law 100-581, \nto provide the authority to the Army Corps of Engineers to provide \nfunding for the operation and maintenance of in lieu fishing access \nsites on the Columbia River Public Law 100-581 was enacted in 1988 to \nauthorize the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to develop 32 Indian fishing \naccess sites along the Columbia River for the Warm Springs, Yakima, \nUmatilla, and Nez Perce tribes. These fishing sites were intended to \ncompensate these Indian tribes for fishing sites which were lost due to \nthe construction of several dams by the Army Corps of Engineers. In a \nJune 25, 1995 memorandum of understanding between the Army Corps of \nEngineers and the Department of the Interior agreed to a lump sum \npayment of funds to provide for the operation and maintenance of such \nsites. I would like to express my appreciation to the Senator from \nOregon [Mr. Hatfield] for his leadership in advancing this provision. I \nhave worked closely with him in ensuring that this provision is \nclarified and provides the necessary authority to ensure that these \nsties are adequately maintained. Section 16 of the bill provides \nauthority to the Ponca Indian Tribe of Nebraska to utilize funds \nprovided in prior fiscal years to acquire, develop, and maintain a \ntransitional living facility for Indian adolescents. Sections 1 through \n16 of this bill have been considered and passed by the full Senate in \nthe last session of the Congress.\n  H.R. 2726 includes three additional technical amendments which have \nnot been considered by this body but which are not controversial and \nrepresent purely technical changes and corrections to provisions of \naffecting native Americans. I have reviewed these provisions and I \nsupport them. First such provision is in section 17 of the bill, which \nprovides that authority to the Mescalero Apache Tribe to authorize the \nSecretary of the Interior to reprogram judgment funds awarded to the \ntribe pursuant to Docket Nos. 22-G, 30, 48, 30-A, and 48-A of the \nIndian Claims Commission. This provision will provide the authority \nnecessary for the Mescalero Apache Tribe to modify their judgment fund \ndistribution plan to utilize these funds pursuant to their current \ntribal priorities. Section 18 of the bill authorizes the Lac View \nDesert Bank of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians to amend their tribal \nmembership roll to enroll individuals who meet the tribal eligibility \ncriteria for inclusion in the tribal rolls. This provision does not \nalter the criteria for tribal membership including the tribe's blood \nquantum requirements but merely opens the tribal rolls to individuals \nwho were not previously enrolled. Section 19 of the bill amends section \n403 of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act by \nadding a new subsection that authorizes Indian tribes to include any or \nall the provisions of title I of the act in an agreement entered into \nunder title III or IV of the act. This provision authorizes Indian \ntribes to include any provision under title I of the act relating to \nself-determination contracts in a self-governance compact entered into \nwith the Department of the Interior or with the Indian Health Service.\n  Finally, I would like to express my appreciation for the work of the \nmany Senators who worked on the development of many of these amendments \nand I urge my colleagues to support passage of H.R. 2726.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the bill be deemed \nread for the third time, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements relating to the bill appear at the \nappropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the bill (H.R. 2726) was deemed read the third time and passed.\n\n                   FRANCIS J. HAGEL FEDERAL BUILDING\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Environment \nand Public Works Committee be discharged from further consideration of \nH.R. 2111, designating the Francis Hagel Federal Building in Richmond, \nCA, and that the Senate then proceed to its immediate consideration; \nthat the bill be read three times, passed, and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table, with the above occurring without intervening \naction or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the bill (H.R. 2111) was deemed read for a third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/26/senate-section/article/S530-3", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S531-S538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            FARM CREDIT SYSTEM REGULATORY RELIEF ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, I rise in support of a bill that would \nauthorize the conveyance of the William Langer Jewel Bearing Plant from \nthe General Services Administration to the Job Development Authority of \nthe city of Rolla, ND.\n  The facility provides substantial employment for an economically \ndisadvantaged part of my State. Of the plant's 110 employees, about 60 \npercent are Native American. The Turtle Mountain Reservation, local \nbusinesses, and State officials are all working together to ensure the \nsuccess of the Plant and its growth as a viable enterprise. Residents \nof Rolla have fully embraced the plan to transfer the plant over to the \nlocal Job Development Authority. Moreover, the Langer plant utilizes \nunique micromanufacturing technology that helped form a critical part \nof our defense industrial base and can be reapplied to the private \nsector. The plant's existing production of dosimeters, used in \nmeasuring exposure to nuclear radiation, as well as its hopes to \ndevelop a large scale production of fiber optic cable connectors, known \nas ferrules, will increase its potential to compete in commercial \nmarkets and meet possible future Federal needs.\n  The General Services Administration, the Army Corps of Engineers, and \nthe Department of Defense all report that no federal agency has \nexpressed interest in obtaining the plant. Since local interests cannot \nafford the original cost of $4.2 million, the provisions of this bill \nallow the transfer to occur without consideration to help establish a \nprivate sector firm that will remain a viable part of the defense \nindustrial base. The future of the plant depends on its ability to \ncompete as a commercial manufacturer.\n  This bill will enable the plant to remain a viable economic \nenterprise as it makes this transition to the private sector. I ask my \ncolleagues to support this bill. It relieves the Federal Government of \nthe burden of a facility it no longer needs, while aiding a community \nthat needs the economic activity created by the facility.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/26/senate-section/article/S538-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, JANUARY 30, 1996\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, let me indicate that we hope to have a \nconference report on the telecom bill by \n\n[[Page S539]]\nThursday. It is a very important bill. It ought to be completed. We are \nworking on a number of issues including the spectrum issue which I feel \nstrongly about. If you noted--in fact, I will place it in the Record--\ntoday the spectrum sale which was estimated by the CBO to bring between \n$20 million and $100 million brought $682 million.\n  So as we look at ways to reduce the deficit, let us not start a big \ngiveaway program to some of the broadcasters in America who can afford \nto pay for it. I know they are not very happy. I know they are not very \nhappy with me. But all I ask them is when they make their statements \nand their criticisms, they use the facts.\n  I see a lot of things on the networks about things that happen in \nCongress and how we waste money and all the things that Members of \nCongress do, but I have not seen a single story except for CNN on the \nspectrum on any of the major networks, on how much it means to them, \nhow many billions of dollars it means to them--free. So I would just \nhope in their objective reporting as they cover us in the Congress and \nas they cover other events across America they might at least devote \nmaybe one or two minutes to what the spectrum is all about so the \nAmerican people understand it is not what they say it is about; it is \nabout real money.\n  The late Senator Dirksen used to say, ``$1 billion here and $1 \nbillion there soon adds up to real money.'' This is real money, and at \nthe time we are reducing welfare programs and other programs that \naffect poor people, I hope that those who could afford to pay would be \nhappy to do so--or I would say at least would do so. And we hope we can \nwork that out.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/26/senate-section/article/S538-4", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE NEW DRUG CZAR\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, in his State of the Union Address, President \nClinton announced his intention to reenlist his administration in the \nwar against drugs.\n  Those are welcome words to all of us who have looked to the White \nHouse for leadership in that war these past 3 years, only to be \ndisappointed time and time again.\n  From the gutting of the Drug Czar's Office to the appointment of a \nSurgeon General who spoke out in favor of legalizing drugs, the message \nfrom this administration has been one in stark contrast to the ``just \nsay no'' message that was so successful in reducing drug use in the \n1980's.\n  The President's words of Tuesday evening, however, give hope that he \nhas recognized that the very disturbing increase in drug use among \nAmerica's youth these past 3 years is proof that his policies have not \nworked.\n  And I look forward to hearing from General McCaffrey, the new Drug \nCzar, and hope that he will work closely with the Congressional Task \nForce on National Drug Policy, which Speaker Gingrich and I appointed, \nand which is chaired by Senators Grassley and Hatch, and Congressmen \nZeliff and Hyde.\n  If we are to truly win the war on drugs, however, then President \nClinton should appoint Federal judges who punish law breakers, and not \nlaw enforcement officers.\n  And if a case that occurred in New York City this week is a sign of \nthe type of judges that the President has appointed, then we might as \nwell wave the white flag.\n  Let me briefly describe this case: While stationed in an unmarked \npatrol car, a New York City police officer watched four men walk single \nfile up to a trunk of a car parked in a known hub of drug activity, and \nplace large duffel bags inside the trunk.\n  The men then noticed the police officer and ran off in different \ndirections.\n  Upon searching the trunk of the car, the officers discovered that the \nduffel bags contained 75 pounds of cocaine, and 4 pounds of heroin--a \ndiscovery that had a street value of $4 million. The driver of the car \ngave the police a full videotaped confession, detailing her 4-year \nhistory in a drug-dealing ring.\n  On Wednesday, however, Federal District Court Judge Harold Baer, Jr., \nruled that the drugs and the videotaped confession could not be used as \nevidence.\n  The reasoning? The judge said that running away from the police was \nnot suspicious behavior, because--and I quote: ``The residents of the \nneighborhood tended to regard police officers as corrupt, abusive, and \nviolent.'' Unless this ruling is overturned, a confessed drug dealer \nwill go free.\n  Let us hope that this is the only appointee of President Clinton who \napparently believes that police officers are a bigger threat to the \nwell-being of our communities than those who peddle drugs to our kids.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an editorial from today's \nWall Street Journal discussing this very disturbing case be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 26, 1996]\n\n                             The Drug Judge\n\n       Winning the war on drugs won't be easy if the battles end \n     up in courtrooms like that of Harold Baer Jr. of the Federal \n     District Court in Manhattan. Judge Baer ruled Wednesday that \n     80 pounds of cocaine and heroin that police found in a car in \n     the drug-wracked neighborhood of Washington Heights could not \n     be used as evidence. The drugs, which have a street value of \n     $4 million, are ``tainted evidence,'' he said.\n       He ruled that the police had no good reason for searching \n     the car, despite the fact that the four men putting duffel \n     bags into the trunk took off running when they saw the cops. \n     This, the judge ruled, was not suspicious behavior. Reason: \n     the ``residents of this neighborhood tended to regard police \n     officers as corrupt, abusive and violent.'' As a matter of \n     fact: ``Had the men not run when the cops began to stare at \n     them, it would have been unusual.''\n       The woman who was driving the car gave the police a \n     videotaped confession. Carol Bayless, a 41-year-old Detroit \n     woman, told police that she expected to be paid $20,000 for \n     driving the drugs back home, and said that she had made a \n     total of about 20 trips to New York to buy drugs. Judge Baer \n     threw out the videotaped confession. Unless the ruling is \n     overturned by the appeals court, the prosecutors say they no \n     longer have a case; Ms. Bayless, who faced 10 years to life \n     in jail, will be free to go.\n       The year's young, but we doubt Judge Baer will have any \n     competition for this year's Judge Sarokin Award, named in \n     honor of the federal judge in New Jersey who ruled for a \n     homeless man who used to lurk inside the Morristown library, \n     spreading his ``ambrosia.'' Liberalism manages to deliver us \n     these rulings on a regular basis, so it's appropriate to \n     raise a few concerns.\n       The first has to do with community standards. Aren't the \n     mostly minority residents of Amsterdam Avenue and 176th \n     Street, where the incident took place, entitled to the same \n     level of protection as the mostly white residents 100 blocks \n     south on Amsterdam in the heart of New York's Yuppiedom? We \n     suspect the law-abiding residents of Washington Heights might \n     take a different view about whether the bigger threat to \n     their well-being is the police or fleeing drug runners.\n       The other issue raised by the Baer ruling is the politics \n     of judicial appointments. Judge Baer is a Clinton appointee, \n     named to the federal bench in 1994 on the advice of the \n     Democratic Senator from New York, Patrick Moynihan. Now, \n     certainly it is the case that Democrats have appointed first-\n     rate jurists to the federal bench. But it's also the case \n     that it is at the liberal end of the modern judiciary that \n     communities find their interests trampled by overly expansive \n     and even absurd legal claims for defendants.\n       If Mr. Clinton is re-elected, by the end of his second term \n     he will have filled roughly half of the slots in the federal \n     judiciary, including majorities on the federal appeals \n     courts. And that he would get one, two or even three more \n     appointments to the Supreme Court. Mr. Clinton no doubt would \n     separate himself from decisions like Judge Baer's, but one \n     then has to somehow believe that he would actually separate \n     himself from the constituencies insisting that he pick from \n     the same candidate pool that produces such judges.\n       As for the war on drugs, we commend Judge Baer's ruling to \n     the attention of drug czar-designate, General Barry \n     McCaffrey. In his State of the Union address Tuesday, Mr. \n     Clinton told Americans that ``every one of us have a role to \n     play on this team.'' But the best anti-drug legislation and \n     the best law enforcement won't work unless the judiciary is \n     willing to enforce the laws.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/26/senate-section/article/S539-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S539-S540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     COMPLIMENTING SENATOR THURMOND\n\n  Mr. DOLE.
