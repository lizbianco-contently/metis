Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 2002, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2002) making appropriations for the Department \n     of Transportation and related agencies for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 1996, and for other purposes.\n       Pending:\n       (1) Jeffords-Leahy amendment No. 2337, to provide for the \n     allocation to certain airports with respect to which \n     commercial air service has been disrupted during the past 3 \n     years, an annual subsidy under the essential air service \n     program under subchapter II of chapter 417 of title 49, \n     United States Code.\n       (2) Roth amendment No. 2340, to strike out sections 350 and \n     351, relating to waivers of the applicability of certain \n     Federal personnel laws and procurement laws to the Federal \n     Aviation Administration.\n       (3) Burns amendment No. 2341, to protect shippers in a \n     captive shipper state.\n       (4) Pressler amendment No. 2345, to provide funding for \n     rail freight infrastructure.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The pending question is \namendment No. 2340. Two minutes to a side have been allocated for \ndebate prior to the vote.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 2337 withdrawn\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, before we have the debate, I ask that the \nJeffords amendment be withdrawn. \n\n[[Page S 12114]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the amendment (No. 2337) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n                           amendment no. 2340\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the Roth-Glenn amendment would strike the \nwaiver that would free the FAA from being required to comply with \nFederal personnel and procurement policies. This waiver is bad policy; \nit sets a bad precedent; it is legislation of a most unfortunate type \non an appropriation bill. With this waiver, the FAA could ignore \nFederal personnel and procurement policies and create whatever policies \nit sees fit. It could pay as little or as much as it wants; create new \npensions; ignore such laws as competition in contracting.\n  Make no mistake, this waiver would result in serious controversy and \nlitigation.\n  Mr. President, Senator Glenn and I are the ranking member and \nchairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, which is the committee \nof jurisdiction on personnel and procurement policies. We stand ready \nto work with the FAA in reforming these policies, as we believe reform \nis necessary. But, we have received no request for any such waiver from \nthe FAA.\n  In fact, last year, we gave the FAA authority to test waivers of \nprocurement laws. But, this bill proposes a blanket exemption before we \nknow the results of that test. Moreover, the GAO found the FAA's \nproblems are not the procurement or personnel laws, but a lack of \nadequate management. The FAA cannot properly define what it wants to \nbuy, estimate its costs, or administer its contracts.\n  If the Glenn-Roth amendment fails, mark my words, today is the day \nthat the Senate gives birth to the next major procurement horror story. \nWe are rewarding incompetent managers with more money and no \naccountability. We are putting both billions of dollars and lives at \nrisk. I encourage my colleagues to defeat the motion to table this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, very briefly, I would like to indicate \nthe reason the Appropriations Committee brought this language to the \nfloor. This was at the behest of the FAA and the administration saying \nwe have a crisis, a very serious crisis in air safety, because the FAA, \nas administrators, for years have said they needed to get some kind of \nchange in these rules. Secretary Pena and Administrator Hinson face \nthis today.\n  One example: The FAA is the world's largest consumer of vacuum tubes \nand there is, in this bill, a requirement to use $7 million to buy more \nwhen the private sector has thrown this technology out 20 years ago. \nConsequently, we have to recognize that it is a safety factor that \ninvolves this language. We did not make up this language.\n  Last night, there was discussion and debate saying, well, what is the \nrole of the administration? We ought to get a clarification. Government \nOperations people said they have been ready to talk. Let me give you a \nrecitation. We have a second letter. We had a letter from OMB \nsupporting this. Secretary Pena sends us a second letter reiterating \nthe vital importance to give them this kind of support.\n  DOT says they have talked to Governmental Affairs. DOT does support \nthe committee provision. The National Performance Review, headed by \nVice President Gore, specifically called for a special exemption for \nthe FAA given its crisis situation.\n  So it is a very clear picture here because of whatever--I am not \nmaking any criticism to any committee. Senator Lautenberg and I have \nbeen following the support and the requests of the administration to \nhelp them out of this crisis for the sake of safety of our national \nairlines. Therefore, we will drop this language in conference if we can \nwork out the solution.\n  In the meantime, I urge that we vote to table the Roth amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the motion to table the \namendment.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Bradley] \nis absent because of illness in the family.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2341\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On amendment No. 2341, there are now 4 minutes \nequally divided.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Chair informs the Senate that time is running for both sides.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, the next amendment is my amendment that we \ntalked about last night.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may we have order in the Senate so we can \nunderstand what the amendment is about?\n  May we have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will suspend.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I hope the Senator will not begin his \nexplanation until we get order and we can hear what he says.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. BURNS. The amendment was nothing but language that would protect \nthose States who are captive shippers if we phase out the ICC. I \nunderstand that was the intent of the budget resolution, and that is \nthe route that we are taking. This language does nothing but protect \nthose States who are captive shippers because in my State of Montana, I \nthink there is only one, or maybe two, that would fall under that \ndefinition, because right now we have a circumstance where the freight \nrates on wheat shipping and on agricultural commodities shipped from \nMontana to Portland cost more than it does to ship from Omaha to \nPortland--to the same point--at a longer distance.\n  I understand there is some confusion. I visited with the chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee and have been assured that there will be \nmoney enough for a transition from the ICC to the Department of \nTransportation. If that be the case, then I would consider withdrawing \nthis amendment altogether.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I respond to the Senator from Montana by indicating two \n\n\n[[Page S 12115]]\npoints: The first is the transition has yet to be blueprinted by the \nauthorizing committee. Second, the House has $21 billion in theirs and \nwe have $18 billion in ours for that orderly transition. We feel that \nby the time, hopefully, that we go to conference, we will have a little \nmore clearer signal of how the transition is going to occur. We are \nwilling to certainly have adequate figures, if that means yielding to \nthe House for the figures for the transition.\n  Mr. BURNS. I think that would be the proper way, and that gives the \nCommerce Committee time enough. I know there is some concern by the \nranking member and the chairman of the Commerce Committee. That would \nbe the proper way to do it. I would rather do it through the \nauthorizing committee than this way. But what I was afraid of is that I \ndid not want to leave my farmers and people who ship agricultural \ncommodities exposed during that transition because we are in that kind \nof a situation of being a captive shipper.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, time for debate has \nexpired.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 2341 withdrawn\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the amendment (No. 2341) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. BURNS. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2345\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from South Dakota, Senator Pressler, No. 2345. There are \n10 minutes equally divided for debate.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2345, As Modified\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I send a modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a right to modify his \namendment.\n  The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2345), as modified, is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place in the bill insert the following:\n       On page 26, line 15, strike ``1996.'' and insert ``1996, \n     except for not more than $50,000,000 in loan guarantee \n     commitments during such fiscal year (and $5,000,000 is hereby \n     made available for the cost of such loan guarantee \n     commitments).''.\n       On page 54, line 5, strike ``$5,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$12,500,000.''\n       On page 54, line 8, strike ``$99,364,000'' and insert \n     ``$91,864,000''.\n       On page 26, between lines 15 and 16, insert the following:\n\n\n                     local rail freight assistance\n\n       For necessary expenses for rail assistance under section \n     5(q) of the Department of Transportation Act, $12,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 6, strike ``$9,710,000'' and insert \n     ``$6,336,667''.\n       On page 6, line 13, strike ``$139,689,000'' and insert \n     ``$134,689,000''.\n       On page 18, line 1, strike ``$5,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$9,600,000''.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I would first like to extend my \nappreciation to the managers of the bill, Senators Hatfield and \nLautenberg, for agreeing to permit me to offer this amendment. We spent \na good deal of time last night working in good faith to reach an \nagreement on proceeding forward on my proposal. I very much appreciate \ntheir assistance and that of their staffs and the staffs of several \nother Senators.\n  My perseverance on this matter is because of its great importance to \nmy State and almost every other State. My amendment would provide \nfunding for the Local Rail Freight Assistance Program and the Section \n511 Loan Guarantee Program. These programs are critical to addressing \nour Nation's rail freight infrastructure needs.\n  Adequate investment in our Nation's transportation infrastructure \nmakes for wise use of our very limited Federal resources. Therefore, as \nwe consider this appropriations bill, we must determine funding \npriorities for our entire national transportation system. In that \neffort, we must not forget about one very critical transportation \nmode--rail freight service.\n  The appropriators were unable to fund the LRFA Program or the section \n511 Loan Guarantee Program. I know they have worked hard to consider \nmany funding requests. However, funding for these programs was not \nallocated. Yet these are the only Federal programs that provide for \ninfrastructure investments in short-line and regional railroads.\n  As my colleagues know, H.R. 2002 provides a good deal of money to \nfund rail passenger service. I am proposing we not overlook the \nimportance of rail freight service. Even limited Federal involvement \nwill help to rebuild and improve the raillines serving our smaller \ncities and rural areas. These secondary raillines are critical to the \nsurvival of rural America's economy, but the capital to maintain them \nis extremely limited.\n  We have invested billions of dollars in Amtrak as well as high-speed \nrail initiatives, yet little has been invested in the rail freight \nlines serving our smaller communities. Federal involvement in rail \nservice should not be limited to rail passenger transportation. \nCertainly, Amtrak and high-speed rail are important. However, for \nStates like South Dakota, which has no Amtrak service and will never \nbenefit from high-speed rail, funding for freight rail infrastructure \nis even more important.\n  The LRFA Program has proven to play a vital role in our Nation's rail \ntransportation system. This program was created in 1973 and has helped \nStates save raillines that otherwise would be abandoned. LRFA's \nmatching requirements enable limited Federal, State, and local \nresources to be leveraged. Most of LRFA's success has been due to its \nability to promote investment partnerships, thus, maximizing very \nlimited Federal assistance.\n  Historically, LRFA has received only a very modest level of Federal \nfunding. Only $17 million was provided for LRFA in fiscal year 1995, \nand then $6.5 million of that amount was rescinded by Public Law 104-6. \nYet, LRFA remains very popular.\n  In fiscal year 1995, 31 States requested LRFA assistance for 59 \nprojects--totaling more than $32 million in funding requests. But less \nthan one-third of funding was available to meet these rail \ninfrastructure needs. With continued railroad restructuring, these \nlegitimate funding needs will only increase.\n  On July 20, the Senate Commerce Committee approved legislation to \npermanently authorize LRFA at $25 million annually.\n  As my colleagues may already know, oftentimes, small railroads face \nunique problems and difficulties securing needed financing. Unlike \nother businesses that need short-term loans, smaller railroads need \nlong-term financing for big ticket items, ranging anywhere from \nequipment to track rehabilitation. Yet, I understand most financial \ninstitutions will not make loans that are not repaid within 7 or 8 \nyears. These loan arrangements simply do not work for smaller \nrailroads. Section 511 loans were permanently authorized to address \nthese problems and should be funded.\n  In this era of significant budgetary pressures, the 511 Program \nprovides a cost effective method of ensuring modest infrastructure \ninvestment on a repayable basis. We should support programs like the \n511 Program and LRFA that provide excellent leverage of our limited \nFederal dollars.\n  The 511 Railroad Loan Guarantee program is permanently authorized at \n$1 billion, of which approximately $980 million currently is available \nfor commitment. The Credit Reform Act rules require an appropriation \nfor the 511 Loan Program to cover the anticipated loss to the \nGovernment over the life of each loan. Based on a fiscal year 1994 \nappropriation for a 511 project in New York State--the first 511 \napplication processed under the rules of the Credit Reform Act--5 \npercent of the total loan obligation level must be appropriated.\n  Several regional and short-line railroads are ready to submit loan \napplications as soon as the program is appropriated funding. My \namendment provides $10 million to enable up to $100 million in loans.\n  I have worked to find the least painful offset possible. The managers \nand their staffs, as well as the staffs of several other Senators, \nhelped me in that effort. These programs would be offset by reductions \nin administrative expenses. I believe we have accomplished a reasoned \napproach.\n  Mr. President, LRFA and the 511 Program are worthy programs and \nshould be funded. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment. \n\n[[Page S 12116]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, as much as I would like to respond to \nthe request of the Senator from South Dakota, I have to report to the \nbody of the Senate this account has expired. It is not authorized.\n  The authorization in the Amtrak bill that was reported ordered out of \nthe Commerce Committee in July has not been filed with any report, so \nconsequently we cannot say it is authorized.\n  We rescinded the 1995 amount left in their unexpended budget in the \nrescissions package.\n  The budget resolution terminated the program in the assumptions of \nthe budget resolution.\n  So consequently, as much as we might be prone to help, we are doing \nthis within that kind of a framework and therefore, as the Committee on \nAppropriations tries to follow the authorizers and tries to accommodate \nto the authorizers, this does not really authorize the program.\n  So I would move to table the Pressler amendment under those \ncircumstances, unless there is someone else who wants to use some of my \ntime to make further comment.\n  I might also say it offsets some very vital programs of the next \ngeneration of rail and similar such programs in which we have already \nmade commitments in this budget in allocating money for those programs.\n  I move to table the Pressler amendment. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the Pressler amendment 2345, as modified. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two letters \nfrom Alice Rivlin relating to the issue we have voted on on the Roth \namendment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                  Washington, DC, August 10, 1995.\n     Hon. Mark O. Hatfield,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatfield: I understand concerns have been \n     raised about language in the Department of Transportation \n     appropriations bill that would exempt the Federal Aviation \n     Administration from federal personnel and procurement rules, \n     outside the context of the Administration's proposal to make \n     the FAA a government corporation. The Administration is on \n     record as supporting personnel, procurement, and budget \n     reform in the FAA.\n       The Adminstration's view is that the FAA has a special \n     situation in terms of personnel, procurement, and budget \n     laws, due to its operating demands. The Administration's \n     views should not be considered as a precedent for our views \n     on other possible proposals to exempt government \n     organizations from personnel and procurement rules.\n           Sincerely,\n     Alice M. Rivlin.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                  Washington, DC, August 10, 1995.\n     Hon. Mark Hatfield,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Administration strongly supports \n     reform of the personnel and procurement practices of the \n     Federal Aviation Administration.\n       The Administration called for such reforms in the \n     comprehensive FAA reform legislation submitted on March 30, \n     1995, to create an Air Traffic Control Corporation. Air \n     traffic control is unlike any other government function, in \n     that it is the only 24-hour-a-day, 365-days-a-week government \n     operation that activities of an entire industry. Moreover, \n     the budget constraints we face in the coming years requires \n     that we take actions now to give the Department and the FAA \n     the flexibility it needs to staff and operate critical safety \n     functions. There are urgent needs for ensuring the safety and \n     effectiveness or our air traffic control system as we move \n     into the next century. We greatly appreciate your attention \n     and the attention of the Senate Commerce Committee to this \n     central issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Alice M. Rivlin.\n                  committee recommendation for transit\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I seek recognition to engage in a \ncolloquy with the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the \nAppropriations Committee regarding the funding provided through the \nFederal Transit Administration for section 3 projects.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I will be pleased to discuss this matter with the \nSenator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am pleased to join in the colloquy.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the State of New Mexico, like many of \nour Western States, has more highway transportation than rail or \ntransit. Very seldom do I receive a request for assistance from a town \nor city for assistance with their local transit systems.\n  However, after the Senate Appropriations Committee considered this \nbill, I did receive a request from the city of Taos, NM for funding \nthrough the section 3 program of the Federal Transit Administration for \na small amount to support maintenance facilities and ADA-equipped \nbuses.\n  As the chairman knows, the retrofitting requirements for buses and \nother transportation systems under the Americans With Disabilities Act \nis very costly for small jurisdictions in particular.\n  I realize that the committee has fully subscribed the section 3 \nprogram in the bill. I would hope, however, that should the full amount \ncurrently in the bill not be utilized in conference, that the committee \nmight give this important request its consideration for inclusion in \nthe final bill.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Although it is difficult to anticipate the disposition \nof the section 3 funding in conference, I believe the conferees would \nbe willing to consider this request at the appropriate time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I, too, think the conferees could consider this \nrequest when it considers the section 3 funding.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would appreciate review and consideration of this \nmatter in conference. I thank the distinguished chairman and ranking \nmember for their time.\n\n\n                         essential air service\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, Senator Pressler and I would like to \nengage the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on \nTransportation, Senator Hatfield, and the distinguished ranking member \nof the subcommittee, Senator Lautenberg, in a colloquy on H.R. 2002, \nthe \n\n[[Page S 12117]]\nfiscal year 1996 transportation appropriations bill and essential air \nservice [EAS].\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, Senator Lautenberg and I would be happy \nto discuss the EAS provisions in the appropriations bill with the \nDemocratic leader, Senator Daschle, and the distinguished chairman of \nthe Commerce Committee, Senator Pressler.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, before discussing the EAS provisions in \nthe bill, I would like to take this opportunity to commend the chairman \nand the ranking member on the Transportation Appropriations \nSubcommittee for the fine work they did on this bill. As chairman of \nthe Commerce Committee, I understand the difficult choices they had to \nmake and the limited resources they had at their disposal.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of \nthe Commerce Committee for his kind remarks.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, Senator Pressler and I understand the \nfiscal year 1996 transportation appropriations bill, as approved by the \nAppropriations Committee, limits EAS subsidies for those communities \nthat, first, are located fewer than 75 highway miles from the nearest \nlarge, medium, or small hub airport; and, second, require a rate of \nsubsidy per passenger in excess of $200, when that community is less \nthan 200 miles from a large or medium hub.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, that is also my understanding.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, under those restrictions using 1993 data, \nit is our understanding that Brookings, SD and Mitchell, SD would no \nlonger be eligible for EAS subsidies because they are located more than \n75 miles from the Sioux Falls airport. As my colleagues on the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Transportation know, under data compiled \nby the Department of Transportation in 1993, the Sioux Falls airport \nwas determined to be a small hub.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. The Department \nof Transportation determined that the Sioux Falls airport was a small \nhub in 1993.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, that is also my understanding.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, Senator Daschle and I also understand \nthat preliminary data compiled by the Department of Transportation for \n1994 indicates that enplanements have declined at the Sioux Falls \nairport to such an extent that it will no longer be considered a small \nhub.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, it is our understanding that the Sioux \nFalls airport, in fact, will no longer be considered a small hub \naccording to preliminary data compiled by the Department of \nTransportation for 1994.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, it is our understanding that since the \nSioux Falls airport will not be considered a small hub, Brookings and \nMitchell, SD will be further than 75 miles from a large, medium, or \nsmall hub and, consequently, will continue to be eligible for EAS \nsubsidies.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. The \nadministration will be using the most current data that they have \navailable when administering the program in fiscal year 1996.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, that is also my understanding.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I want to thank the chairman and the ranking member of \nthe Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation for their \nclarification and assurance.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I, too, would like to thank my \ndistinguished colleagues for this clarification.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to discuss my concerns with some \nlegislative provisions in this appropriations bill and to pledge to \ncontinue working with my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee to \ncorrect these deficiencies.\n  First, I must state that I regret that the committee recommends $1 \nbillion less for highway programs than Congress approved in 1995. These \nfunds are available in the highway trust fund and must be fully \nutilized so that our States can maintain an efficient transportation \nsystem, one able to compete in a global marketplace.\n  This bill also contains legislative provisions that are under the \npurview of the Committee on Environment and Public Works. I concur with \nthe committee's recommendation, with some technical adjustments, to \nprovide States with increased flexibility to address the section 1003 \nprovision in ISTEA which could result in a 13-percent reduction in \nState apportionments in Federal-aid highway funds in 1996. This fix \nwill allow States to trade in unobligated balances from prior years to \nrestore fiscal year 1996 apportionments.\n  As the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on \nTransportation and Infrastructure, I can assure my colleagues that we \nhave been working on a resolution to this situation for the past \nseveral months. When the Senate was considering S. 440 to designate the \nNational Highway System, there was no consensus among the States and \nthe Department of Transportation on how best to fix the section 1003 \nproblem. This compromise clearly addresses a critical problem the \nStates will be facing at the beginning of the new fiscal year, on \nOctober 1. For this reason, I support its addition to the \nappropriations bill.\n  However, I do not support the provision which provides for regional \ninfrastructure banks as currently drafted. No emergency situation \nexists which requires the Congress to prematurely adopt this proposal. \nI am generally favorable to innovative finance solutions which would \nallow States to leverage their funds to address the backlog of \ninfrastructure needs. Several provisions were incorporated into the \nNational Highway System legislation to grant States new authority in \nthis area.\n  The regional infrastructure bank proposal put forth in this \nlegislation is unworkable for our States and unlikely to achieve its \nintended purpose. Primarily, I strongly oppose the requirement that \nState infrastructure banks be regional before a State can have access \nto airport funds. The Federal Highway Administration advises me that \ntheir interpretation of this provision requires that there be \nmultistate banks before any of these funds could be utilized.\n  While I believe there is merit to voluntary State infrastructure \nbanks where States determine if their highway funds should be used for \nthis purpose, I fundamentally reject the co-mingling of airport and \nhighway funds as permitted in this proposal. Highway trust fund dollars \nare collected by a tax motorists pay on gasoline for the direct purpose \nof constructing and maintaining our surface transportation system. We \nwould be breaking faith with our citizens each time they buy a gallon \nof gasoline if we allow these funds to be used for airport purposes.\n  As I have previously mentioned, it appears that this provision will \nbe very difficult for our States to implement. There are only a few \nlarge States that currently have the ability to take advantage of this \nprovision. Many States would have to change their State constitutions \nor State laws to create these regional infrastructure banks to allow \nthe mixing of multistate funds.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee will continue to work with us on this very complex and \nimportant matter which could change the direction of financing our \nNation's infrastructure needs. When the Senate goes to conference on \nthe National Highway System legislation, it is my intention to address \nthe need for voluntary State infrastructure banks, in cooperation with \nState departments of transportation and other users of our surface \ntransportation system.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the two floor \nmanagers of the bill, the distinguished Senator from Oregon, Senator \nHatfield, and the distinguished Senator from New Jersey, Senator \nLautenberg, and their staff, for their excellent and efficient \nmanagement of the fiscal year 1996 Appropriations Act for the \nDepartment of Transportation.\n  I would like to take a few moments to discuss an amendment I offered \nlast night, which passed by voice vote without objection. My amendment \nencourages agencies funded under the bill to become more energy \nefficient and directs them to reduce facility energy costs by 5 \npercent. The agencies will report to the Congress at the end of the \nyear on their efforts to conserve energy and will make recommendations \nfor \n\n[[Page S 12118]]\nfurther conservation efforts. I have offered this amendment to every \nappropriations bill that has come before the Senate this year, and it \nhas been accepted to each one.\n  I believe this is a common-sense amendment: The Federal Government \nspends nearly $4 billion annually to heat, cool, and power its 500,000 \nbuildings. The Office of Technology Assistance and the Alliance to Save \nEnergy, a nonprofit group which I chair with Senator Jeffords, estimate \nthat Federal agencies could save $1 billion annually if they would make \nan effort to become more efficient and conserve energy.\n  Mr. President, I hope this amendment will encourage agencies to use \nnew energy savings technologies when making building improvements in \ninsulation building controls, lighting, heating, and air-conditioning. \nThe Department of Energy has made available for government-wide agency \nuse streamlined energy saving performance contracts procedures, modeled \nafter private sector initiatives. Unfortunately, most agencies have \nmade little progress in this area. This amendment is an attempt to get \nFederal agencies to devote more attention to energy efficiency, with \nthe goal of lowering overall costs and conserving energy.\n  As I mentioned, Mr. President, this amendment has been accepted to \nevery appropriations bill the Senate has passed this year. I am pleased \nmy colleagues support it, and again, I thank the floor managers for \ntheir assistance. Thank you.\n\n\n                 terminal doppler weather radar (tdwr)\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, windshear remains the primary weather-\nrelated threat to airline safety. The FAA originally established a \nrequirement for 102 TDWR systems for the U.S. airports that have \nsignificant risks from windshear--severe weather exposure. To date, 47 \nTDWR systems have been purchased; 55 systems remain to be acquired and \ninstalled.\n  The Senate Appropriations Committee was under severe budget \nrestrictions, but did add funding of $2,500,000 above the FAA request \nfor the installation of a previously purchased TDWR at Las Vegas and \nfor the environmental impact statement process in New York. The House \nadded funding for five new TDWR's.\n  Baton Rouge and Shreveport have been identified as airports in need \nof TDWR systems to identify windshear. Both the chairman and ranking \nMember spoke of the need for additional funding for worthy projects. \nWhile I fully understand the budget constraints on all of the \nappropriations bills, I would encourage the conferees to review the \npotential for saving lives that these systems bring to those of us who \ntravel, or have loved ones who travel by air.\n           LOW ROLLING RESISTANCE AND TIRE GRADING STANDARDS\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today to address a question raised \nby the committee during its consideration.\n  A provision included in the House passed bill provides that none of \nthe funds appropriated by the act may be obligated or expended to plan, \nfinalize, or implement any rulemaking to add to section 575.104 of \ntitle 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations any requirement pertaining \nto a grading standard that is different from the three grading \nstandards--treadwear, traction, and temperature, already in effect.\n  The Senate subsequently struck this provision. While I appreciate the \ncommittee's position on this provision and understand the difficulty \nfaced by the committee as it deals with the regulatory process, I \nwanted to make clear my concerns about the proposed regulations \nregarding tire grading standards.\n  As part of a response to the President's Climate Change Action Plan, \nthe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration [NHTSA] has issued a \nnotice of proposed rulemaking to amend the uniform tire quality grading \nstandards [UTQS] to replace the temperature resistance grade with a \nrolling resistance/fuel economy standard.\n  This proposal is currently under consideration by NHTSA and if \nimplemented, tire manufacturers are required to add a new rolling \nresistance grading standard whose value I believe is questionable.\n  The proposed regulation assumes that lower rolling resistance will \nreduce fuel consumption. While there is some validity to the premise, \nin practice it is uncertain and other factors beyond rolling resistance \ncontribute. If low rolling resistance does not effectively reduce fuel \nconsumption then any demonstrated environmental impact is diminished.\n  Tire design is a matter of tradeoffs. For every positive feature some \nallowance may be made for a reduction in other characteristics. Lower \nrolling resistance can compromise traction or treadwear and therefore \nsafety. I believe that these tradeoffs have not been adequately \nreviewed.\n  I am concerned that the cost to both industry and the consumer will \noutweigh any benefit. I understand that the additional cost of each \ntire is estimated to be $22 and that even after potential fuel savings \nare included, the consumer will not pay for the investment.\n  Tire manufacturing is already a globally competitive industry. \nAdditional costs could impact that competitiveness. This rule would \nalso raise a question regarding nontariff trade barriers.\n  I raise these concerns so that the committee will be fully aware of \nthese issues as it proceeds to conference and that these questions can \nbe considered as it continues its work on this bill.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this appropriations bill providing funds \nfor the agencies of the Department of Transportation is truly \nbittersweet for this Senator from California.\n  Although there is much in this bill that will benefit my State, \nhowever, the budget cuts are deeply disturbing. The bill is $1 billion \nless in total spending for transportation over funding for the current \nfiscal year. These cuts were foreseen when the Senate voted for the \nRepublican budget resolution. I opposed the budget resolution, in part \nbecause of how these drastically lower budget levels would block our \nprogress in repairing and improving our infrastructure and \nreinvigorating our economy. This is a budget largely in retreat from \nthe challenges ahead.\n  Our air traffic control system is in crisis. Wednesday's power \nfailure of two of the three power generators--while the third was off \nline for maintenance--at the Air Route Traffic Control Center at \nOakland, CA, was only the latest failure of our aging, 1950's and \n1960's era air traffic control system. The Oakland center lost all \nradar, flight data processing and communications system power. Power \nwas restored in just over an hour but only after causing serious \ndisruptions and threats to air safety for about 60 to 70 aircraft in \nthe area.\n  Sufficient funding for critical air traffic control improvements must \nbe a priority. The bill provides $8 million for air traffic management \ntechnology which was not funded by the House. This funding is key to \navoid delays in the development of new traffic flow management \ncapabilities for the air traffic control system. At $12 million, the \nbill maintains the current year's level of funding for system capacity, \nplanning and improvements, but it is double the House level. Air safety \ntechnology is increased overall from $30 million by the House to $40.5 \nmillion in the Senate.\n  However, I am concerned that neither the House nor the Senate funded \nthe administration's request for $1 million in cabin safety technology \nresearch. As the former chair of the House Government Activities and \nTransportation Subcommittee, I can attest to the ongoing need for \nFederal efforts for improved cabin safety, particularly in reducing \nflammability and improved exiting.\n  I also join with the ranking member, Senator Lautenberg, in deploring \nthe cuts in incentive pay for our overworked air traffic controllers. I \nsupport his efforts to try and restore some of these funds in \nconference with the House.\n  Despite tough budget cuts, we have cause to praise other elements of \nthis bill that deserve recognition. In recognizing the scarcity of \ntransportation project funds, the committee crafted an innovative \nfinancing plan based on the administration proposals. Although the plan \nis not as well funded from the Federal side as I had hoped, it will \npermit California to obtain attractive, private sector financing for \nmajor infrastructure improvements.\n  The bill creates State and regional infrastructure banks, providing \n$250 \n\n[[Page S 12119]]\nmillion in Federal general revenue funds and permitting States to \nallocate up to 10 percent of their Federal highway dollars. Funds \ndeposited in these banks will capitalize a revolving loan program and \nenable the States to obtain a substantial line of credit. The \ninfrastructure banks will assist a variety of projects, including \nfreight rail, aviation and highway projects. This assistance would be \nin the form of financing for construction loans, pooling bond issues, \nrefinancing outstanding debt and other forms of credit enhancement.\n  California will receive $21 million for this purpose, the highest of \nany State.\n  I am pleased that the Senate unanimously accepted my amendment to \nensure that California, and other States which already have authorized \nState infrastructure banks, could participate and not be required to \nform multi-State compacts as provided in the bill. This will help the \nState move quickly on a financing program.\n  I am also pleased that the committee, at my request, cited in its \nreport the Alameda Transportation Corridor project to improve the rail \nand highway access to the Port of Los Angeles and Long Beach as a fine \nexample of a project that could benefit from this financing. I hope \nthat the State will decide to use this option to help the Alameda \nCorridor project. This financing could also benefit the efforts in San \nDiego to reopen the 108-mile San Diego and Arizona Eastern Railway, \nproviding San Diego companies direct access to El Centro-based rail \nnetworks to the Eastern United States and the interior of Mexico.\n  These are important infrastructure projects of both State and \nnational significance and will help expand trade and create jobs.\n  California benefitted from several individual projects in this bill.\n  In particular, I had personally urged members to support the \nPresident's request for $22.6 million for the bay area rail program. \nThis funding is vital for the airport expansion project of the Bay Area \nRapid Transit District and the light rail program along the Tasman \nCorridor in Santa Clara. Not only did the Senate more than double the \nlevel provided by the House, but the funding is directed for the bay \narea program and not limited to BART. This is an important distinction. \nThe bay area program is a careful regional compromise to provide needed \npassenger rail transportation improvements. The House funding directed \nonly to BART is an inappropriate interference with this local program.\n  Unfortunately, the bill also severely under funds the Metro Red Line \n[MOS-3] extension in Los Angeles. The $45 million is drastically below \nthe $159 million requested by the President and $125 million set by the \nHouse.\n  However, despite my urging for the committee to approve the \nPresident's request, I am not surprised by the cut. The problems in \nsubway construction, particularly the lack of adequate oversight and \nmaintenance of construction standards, combined with the disunity among \nlocal officials resulted in this severe cut. I am hopeful that we can \npersuade the House and Senate conferees to at least meet halfway to \nprovide $85 million for the program.\n  Despite this cut, the committee nearly doubled the House level for \nthe Gateway Intermodal Center in Los Angeles, providing $12 million to \ncomplete the facility which will house the central connections for the \nsubway, commuter rail and interstate passenger rail traffic.\n  I am also pleased at the $8 million set aside for the Advanced \nTechnology Transit Bus, the so-called stealth bus that uses the \nexpertise that Northrop developed for the stealth fighter into a high-\ntech urban transit bus for the next century. This funding--above the \nPresident's request--will ensure that we will have prototypes ready to \nroll in the fall of 1996.\n  The bill includes my request for $4.5 million to the bay area transit \nsystems to help them implement the Americans with Disability Act \nrequirements. These improvements include fixed-route improvements for \nthe Contra Costa Transit District, a replacement van for Western Contra \nCosta County Transit Authority, 25 vans for San Francisco Muni, and 20 \nparatransit vehicles, signs and bus stop improvements for the Santa \nClara County Transit District.\n  There is $10 million that I requested for a San Diego-Mexico border \nbus/highway center. The San Ysidro Intermodal Transportation Center \noperated by the Metropolitan Transit District Board will provide \nimproved traffic circulation improvements at this major United States-\nMexico border crossing.\n  There is $10.56 million that I requested for the San Joaquin Rapid \nTransit District in Stockton. The district has an extensive bus \nreplacement program for this rapidly growing area with serious air \nquality problems. Funding will help provide seven replacement and 10 \nexpansion buses using Compressed Natural Gas technology. Another 17 \nreplacement and 6 expansion buses are needed for demand response \nservices and 25 vans for alternative transportation services.\n  The bill also provides $3 million to the Long Beach Transit District \nfor its bus replacement and parts program.\n  Mr. President, although this bill hardly provides everything we need \nin California to erase our infrastructure deficit, at least California \nreceived a fair share of the funds provided and provides tools for \nleveraging scarce Federal dollars.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to applaud the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Transportation for its good work on the fiscal year \n1996 transportation appropriations bill. They produced a relatively \npork-free bill and for that they deserve much credit.\n  I did want to specifically note two provisions in the bill which do \ncause me concern.\n  The bill mandates that $15,000,000 for debt retirement of the Port of \nPortland, OR. I strongly object to this earmark being included in the \nbill.\n  There are many communities around the country which have outstanding \nbonds and debt which they must pay. Those cities and localities are \nworking hard to better their fiscal condition. But they are doing it on \ntheir own initiative. They are not receiving a Federal bailout. And, \nMr. President, that is exactly what this provision is: a Federal \nbailout.\n  It is unfair to those many communities that we are using the Federal \nlargesse to help one specific city on the basis of less than compelling \nfactors.\n  Additionally, the bailout is not truly necessary.\n  Proponents of the bailout claim the port is owed this money because a \nproposed change in law included in the Alaska Power Administration Sale \nAct which is pending in Congress, will adversely affect the port's \nfinancial viability and alter a longstanding Federal-State agreement. \nWhile it is true that we are proposing to change the law, such a \nchange, I believe will not adversely affect the Port of Portland in the \nlong run.\n  Under current law, Alaskan oil is carried by U.S.-flag ships from \nAlaska to the Port of Portland. Because of the large amount of ship \ntraffic, the port has stayed relatively busy. Port officials are \nconcerned, however, that if these same ships are allowed to carry this \noil across the Pacific that they will have their repairs done in Asia, \nwhich will result in a loss of business for the Port of Portland.\n  I believe this fear to be unfounded and thus the bailout not truly \nnecessary. United States law requires that Alaskan oil must be carried \nin U.S.-flag ships. Additionally, these tankers must pay a 50-percent \nduty for any repairs made in a foreign port. This is a strong \ndisincentive for such operators to have repair done outside the United \nStates. As a matter of fact, the additional wear and tear on these \nships generated by their extensive travel may result in an even greater \nuse of the Port of Portland in the long run.\n  Additionally, close examination of the port's financial reports show \nthat the shipyard's fiscal strength began to decline in the mid-1980's. \nTherefore, it is hard to believe passage of any legislation in 1995 \nwould be responsible for a 10-year slow decline of the port's business.\n  Further, while the shipyard has been in decline, other assets held by \nthe port have been rapidly growing. The Port of Portland controls and \noperates a seaport, Portland International Airport, and several real \nestate holdings in the Portland area. Portland International Airport is \none of the fastest growing airports in the Nation. In 1994, the number \nof passengers using the airport \n\n[[Page S 12120]]\nincreased by 16 percent and the amount of freight increased 14 percent. \nThe shipping activities of the seaport have also been growing--\noutpacing the growth of all other seaports on the west coast. There is \nno reason to believe that this growth will not continue to occur.\n  These booming holdings of the Port of Portland should be more than \nable to help the port during any further economic decline, and thus \nthere is no need for Federal assistance to this local--not Federal--\nentity.\n  I also want to note my dismay over a provision added to the bill that \nwould mandate that the General Services Administration and the \nDepartment of Agriculture transfer Federal land to the city of Hoboken, \nNJ.\n   Mr. President, I raise this not to debate whether the land in \nHoboken should or should not be transferred to the city. I am told by \nGSA that they would not oppose such a transfer and that the Federal \nGovernment has no further use for the land.\n  I raise this issue because there is an administrative procedure in \nplace that governs the disposal of excess or unneeded Federal property. \nThat administrative procedure is designed to ensure that all parties \nare treated fairly, and that the Government's--and the taxpayer's--best \ninterests are paramount. By adding a provision to this bill to mandate \nthe immediate disposal of this Federal land, the proper process is \nbeing circumvented. Elected officials, and the public, have no way to \nknow if we are doing the right thing when the proper, open process is \ncircumvented. We can only speculate that this transfer is truly in the \npublic's interest, not to mention that bypassing appropriate procedures \ninvites others to do the same which is neither fair nor in the public \ninterest.\n  Both of the provisions I have mentioned should not be in this bill \nand I would hope they would both be dropped in conference.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I believe the Senator from Arizona, [Mr. McCain], \ndesires to have a brief colloquy before we go to final passage.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will say to the Senator from Oregon, the \ndistinguished chairman, in light of the failure of the tabling motion \nof this language concerning the FAA procurement and personnel reform, I \nask unanimous consent that there be language inserted that that would \nnot take effect until the 1st of April, as we have discussed before, in \norder that the authorizing committees might have an opportunity to act \nin an overall broad reformation of the FAA and the funding.\n  I seek that unanimous-consent request from the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. This was a \ndiscussion yesterday and last evening as well. We are very happy to \njoin in that unanimous-consent request.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I agree. I think it is a wise decision \nand I appreciate the fact that the Senator from Arizona recommended it. \nIt will give the committees an opportunity to do what we wanted them to \ndo in the first place, very frankly, and the reason for the language in \nthe bill. So I think it is a good idea.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that language be \ninserted at the appropriate point in a technical fashion, a technical \namendment, in order to make the effective date of procurement reform, \npersonnel reform of the FAA effective as of April 1.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Will the Senator send his \namendment to the desk?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/10/senate-section/article/S12113-5", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12120]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 1087\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, while we are waiting, I ask unanimous \nconsent that upon disposition of H.R. 2002, the Department of \nTransportation and related agencies appropriations bill, the Senate \nturn to consideration of S. 1087, the DOD appropriations bill. This has \nbeen cleared on the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me just say for the information of all \nSenators, the Senate will begin consideration of the DOD appropriations \nbill after disposition of the pending matter. In the meantime, various \nSenators are still negotiating ABM language that has blocked the Senate \nfrom concluding action on the DOD authorization bill.\n  As soon as that language has been agreed to on both sides, if agreed \nto, it will be my intention to call for the regular order with respect \nto the DOD authorization bill and complete action on that very \nnecessary authorization bill. Once that has been completed, the Senate \nwill resume the DOD appropriations bill and remain on that item until \ndisposed of. If they do not get an agreement, we will finish the DOD \nappropriations bill.\n  There are also a number of nominations we have had a number of \ninquiries about. Depending on what else happens, we may be able to \naccommodate some of those requests. I know the Secretary of the \nTreasury, Secretary Rubin, is very, very concerned about Larry Summers, \na Treasury Department nominee. As I understand, there are at least 25 \nholds on that nomination. I am not certain we will be able to \naccommodate Secretary Rubin. We will be checking on this side of the \naisle to see if there is any opportunity.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the leader yield? I wonder if we can get an \nagreement that there will be no amendment in order on the Defense \nappropriations bill dealing with the controversy that surrounds the \nauthorization bill, the ABM Treaty. It makes no sense to go on the \nappropriations bill if we are going to bring to the floor the people \nwho are negotiating to finally resolve the problem on the authorization \nbill. I hope there will be an agreement our bill will not have any \namendment pertaining to the ABM controversy.\n  Mr. DOLE. I think we will wait until we get to the bill first.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I just want everyone to know that while they are here. I \nam reluctant to take up the bill and get involved in the ABM \ncontroversy. As I said, it will bring the people out of the office who \nare hoping to get that resolved. I will wait, however.\n  Mr. DOLE. We will wait until we get to the bill.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, we did not object to going to Defense \nappropriations since it is understood that we can come back to the \nDefense authorization bill, which we really ought to pass before we \npass Defense appropriations.\n  As I understand it, we will come back to it just as soon as \nresolution is reached on the question of ABM. Senator Nunn of Georgia, \nthe ranking member, I believe is working hard on that, and others are \nworking from our side. We hope to be able to reach an agreement on \nthat.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/10/senate-section/article/S12120-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12120-S12122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                                  1996\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2348\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

The question is on the engrossment of the \namendments and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed, and the bill to be read \nthe third time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I expect to detain the Senate for a few \nminutes.\n  Mr. President, I commend the chairman of the full Appropriations \nCommittee, Mr. Hatfield, for assuming the chairmanship of the \nTransportation Subcommittee.\n  May I say to Senators I expect to speak 10 or 15 minutes. I do that \nwith some apologies, but I think this is a very important bill, and I \nwill not overly detain my friends. This will not be one of my long \nspeeches. Cicero was asked which of the orations of Demosthenes he \nliked most. Cicero answered, ``the longest.'' This will not be my \nlongest. However, I have a few things I want to say about this bill.\n  I have been a member of the subcommittee for many years and have long \nbeen an advocate for increased and sustained funding for our Nation's \ntransportation infrastructure. This is fundamental to the economic \nhealth of this Nation.\n  I know that Senator Hatfield agrees that our Nation's economic \nprosperity depends heavily on the adequacy of our highways, our \nairports, our railroads, and transit systems. And as such, Mr. \nPresident, H.R. 2002, the Transportation appropriations bill, is a \ncritically important bill for the overall economic health of our \nNation. I also want to congratulate not only Senator Hatfield but also \nthe former chairman of the Transportation Subcommittee, Senator \nLautenberg, for the expeditious manner in which this bill has been \nreported to the floor. The bill was passed by the House of \nRepresentatives just 2 weeks ago. The Senate Transportation \nSubcommittee met to report its recommendations to the full committee \njust 1 week later. The full Appropriations Committee reported the bill \nto the Senate this past Friday, and the Senate is about to approve the \nbill.\n  Senator Hatfield and Senator Lautenberg wasted no time in preparing \nand advancing a bill once the House of Representatives completed its \nwork. In addition to thanking the managers of the bill, I want to \nrecognize the contributions of the staff of the Transportation \nSubcommittee, Pat McCann, Anne Miano and Joyce Rose of the majority \nstaff, as well as Peter Rogoff of the minority staff, for their hard \nwork on this bill.\n  Unfortunately, the House bill, as well as the bill before us, is \nsubstantially below a freeze in both discretionary budget authority and \noutlays. Indeed, the bill before us is a full $1 billion in outlays \nbelow a fiscal year 1995 freeze. As such, I fear that this bill \ncontinues a trend of Federal disinvestment in our Nation's physical \ninfrastructure. That is why I have taken the valuable time of Senators \nat this point. I want to make us all aware again of the fact that we \nhave an investment deficit in this country and have had. I pleaded that \ncase when I was at the summit in 1990. I urged that we spend more money \non America--on America's people, on America's infrastructure. We not \nonly have a trade deficit, we not only have a Federal budget deficit, \nwe also have an investment deficit. Since 1980, the investment in \nphysical infrastructure has declined, both as a percentage of all \nFederal spending, and as a percentage of our Nation's gross domestic \nproduct. The cuts embodied in this bill only exacerbate this trend--a \ntrend that is both shortsighted and unwise.\n  Any businessman will tell you that a business cannot prosper for very \nlong if the necessary investments are not continually made in the tools \nand machinery that provide the engine for that prosperity.\n  The owner of a small manufacturing plant can, perhaps, delay \ninvestments in new tools and machinery for a brief period of time. He \nmay be able to piece that machinery together using temporary fixes. He \nmay be able to cannibalize and hold out for a little while. But over \nthe long haul, more often than not, the failure to adequately invest in \nthat machinery and equipment will prove to be a very expensive mistake. \nAnd, in the end, that machinery must be replaced, often at a cost that \nproves to be considerably higher than the cost of continued and steady \nmaintenance and investment. If it is not, then the plant will fall \nfurther and further behind its competitors, and eventually the \nbusinessman will go bankrupt. The same is true for our Nation's \ninvestment and maintenance of its infrastructure. But, increasingly, in \nrecent years, we have embodied this penny-wise and pound-foolish \nfrugality when it comes to our Nation's transportation infrastructure.\n  Now, there is a place for frugality, and I am all for that. For the \nlast several months, we have heard much debate on the Senate floor \nregarding the tragic maladies that are brought about by the Federal \nbudget deficit, maladies that should not be passed on to our \ngrandchildren. The danger of continued budget deficits are very \nevident, but it is equally true that a less than robust economy only \nexacerbates our national deficit problem. I would like to take a moment \nto recount some of the maladies that we will also pass on to the next \ngeneration if we continue to fail to adequately invest in our \ntransportation infrastructure.\n  According to the Department of Transportation, there are currently \nmore than 234,000 miles of the nearly 1.2 million miles of paved, \nnonlocal roads which are in such bad condition that they require \ncapital improvements either immediately or within the next 5 years. The \nNation's backlog in the rehabilitation and maintenance of our Nation's \nbridges currently stands at $78 billion. According to the Federal \nHighway Administration, 118,000 of the Nation's 575,000 bridges--more \nthan one of five--are structurally deficient. While most are not in \ndanger of collapse, they do require that heavier trucks be prohibited \nfrom using them--an action that has an immediate adverse impact on the \nNation's productivity. Another 14 percent of the Nation's bridges are \nfunctionally obsolete, meaning that they do not have the land and \nshoulder widths or vertical clearance to handle the traffic that they \nbear.\n  Fully 70 percent of the Nation's interstate highways and metropolitan \nareas are congested during peak travel times. Such traffic congestion \ncosts the economy $39 billion a year in wasted fuel and low \nproductivity for both passengers and commercial traffic. Congestion \nalso undermines our ability to clean up our Nation's air, since more \nthan 70 percent of the carbon monoxide emitted into the atmosphere \ncomes from motor vehicles. To make matters worse, the Department of \nTransportation continues to estimate increased road and vehicle use \nthat will put us in even worse shape. It has been estimated that the \nnumber of vehicles on our Nation's highways will grow about 8 percent \nby the year 2000. However, over the same period, freight tonnage \ncarried by our Nation's trucks will grow by more than 30 percent. Yet, \nunder this year's Transportation appropriations bill, and it can be \nanticipated for each of the next 7 years, we will be required to cut \nrather than increase our investment in maintaining our Nation's \ntransportation system.\n  As Mr. Hatfield, the distinguished chairman of this subcommittee and \nof the full Appropriations Committee, has said more than once in recent \ndays, as we have marked up our appropriations bill, ``You ain't seen \nnothing yet. If you think it is tough this year, wait until next \nyear.'' He has said that. He is right.\n  Just as our Federal funding patterns have ignored the anticipated \ngrowth in highway use, so, too, are we ignoring the anticipated growth \nin airport use. According to the Federal Aviation Administration, the \nnumber of enplanements expected at our Nation's airports will grow \nalmost 60 percent over the next decade. If no new runways are added, \nthe number of severely congested major airports will grow by \n\n[[Page S 12122]]\n250 percent. The Federal Aviation Administration estimates that in \norder to bring existing airports up to current design standards, as \nwell as provide sufficient capacity to meet the projected demand, it \nwill cost no less than $30 billion over the next several years.\n  Now, Mr. President, we talk about our grandchildren, passing on this \ngreat deficit to them. I have grandchildren. I want us to do whatever \nwe reasonably can do to reduce the deficit and to ameliorate the burden \nthat we are going to pass on to those children and those grandchildren.\n  But we do ourselves and our grandchildren no favor by ignoring these \ntrends and by balancing the Federal budget on the back of critical \ndomestic investments, and at the same time we are talking about passing \non to the American people $250 billion in tax cuts. What folly, utter \nfolly.\n  How can we hope to ensure a prosperous future for our children's \nchildren, if we leave the next generation with a transportation network \nso dilapidated, unsafe, and inefficient that it is a national \nembarrassment rather than a source of national pride? Unfortunately, \nthe funding allocation granted to the transportation subcommittee is \nnot close to sufficiently accommodate the necessary investments to \nenable us to even begin to meet the backlog of highway, bridge and \naviation needs that exist throughout this nation. How can we hope to \nbring the budget into balance if we destroy the efficiency and \nproductivity of private industry with a transportation network so \nseriously inadequate as to cost billions in lost hours and lost \nprofits.\n  With the ill-advised funding levels contained in this bill, we have \nput the nation's vital needs on hold. I am sorry to have to impose on \nthe Senator at this time, but I cannot help but contrast this bill with \nthe profligate spending contained in the defense appropriations and \nauthorization bills which this body is considering and is about to \nconsider later today. It has been considering the authorization bill \nand is about to consider the appropriations bill later today. I can \nonly come to the sad conclusion that we have turned our national \npriorities on their head and enacted appropriations that reflect the \nparanoia of the past and not the priorities of the future.\n  I close with the words of Daniel Webster when he spoke at the laying \nof the cornerstone of the Bunker Hill Monument on June 17, 1825:\n\n       Let us develop the resources of our land, call forth its \n     powers, build up its institutions, promote all its great \n     interests, and see whether we also in our day and generation \n     may not perform something worthy to be remembered.\n\n  I thank all Senators. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall it pass? On this question, the yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I would like to take just a moment to do \ntwo things. First of all, I would like to pay commendation to an \nextraordinary staff which worked so long and so diligently on this \nbill: Pat McCann and Anne Miano and Carole Geagley and Peter Rogoff.\n  I want to also point out a special situation surrounding our staff \nperson, Joyce Rose. This body has listened to the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee over many years, and the ranking member, \ndiscuss the uniqueness of our staffs on our Appropriations Committee.\n  I know that we are served well by staff on all committees. But I want \nto share with my colleagues a very special happening during the markup \nlast Wednesday during the readout of our bill on transportation.\n  Joyce Rose, who is a mother of a 10-year-old boy, that boy fell out \nof a tree and broke both arms, broke his nose and was badly bruised. \nShe spent the time at the hospital, and then appeared on the scene to \nperform her duties at night when we were doing the readout; back to the \nhospital, back to her committee functions. I think it not only is the \ndemonstration of a very dedicated and devoted person maintaining her \nduties as a mother as well as her role as a staff person, but even \nthrough the crises and problems that she faced with her child, she was \nable to--using more hours of the day than anyone else--cover both bases \nand still perform her duties here on our staff.\n  I just want to pay her this tribute, and through her example, such \ntribute to our entire staff.\n  Mr. President, I move that the Senate insist on its amendments and \nrequest a conference with the House on the disagreeing votes of the two \nHouses and that the Chair appoint conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  The motion was agreed to; and the Presiding Officer (Mr. Inhofe) \nappointed Mr. Hatfield, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Specter, Mr. Gramm, Mr. Bond, \nMr. Gorton, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Harkin, Ms. Mikulski, and Mr. \nReid conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  I also thank my colleagues for assisting us in disposing of No. 6 of \nthe 13 appropriations bills, 6 of the 13.\n  Now Senator Stevens will hold forth on presenting the seventh that we \nhope will be completed expeditiously so that when we leave on our \nrecess--when I leave on recess beginning tomorrow afternoon, I would \nlike to feel that maybe we will all be in that similar position, under \nthe leadership of Senator Stevens and ably assisted by Senator Inouye, \nthe ranking member.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak on morning business for not to exceed 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Faircloth pertaining to the introduction of S. \n1145 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the remainder \nof my time.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas).

The clerk will report S. 1087.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1087) making appropriations for the Department \n     of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1996, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing individuals be given privilege of the floor during \nconsideration of this bill: Susan Hogan, Sujata Millick, and Joe \nFengler.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I ask my colleague to add Bobby Scherb and Ryan Henry to \nthat list.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I so ask, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President we are now going to begin consideration of \nwhat I hope will be the last bill before the recess, assuming that we \ntake up and pass the authorization bill first, and we are prepared to \nyield at any time to the committee when they are here with a time \nagreement to finish their bill.\n  This is the 1996 Department of Defense appropriations bill. The \nSenate should be aware that we are moving quickly this year on this \nbill. The House has just started their consideration of the bill and \nwill complete their action when they return in September.\n  In the Senate, as I have just mentioned, the negotiations on the \nauthorization bill are continuing, but this bill before the Senate now \nis an original bill. We have to take this procedure. It is somewhat \nunusual. But that is to enable us to move this bill so it will be ready \nto pass on to the President before the end of the fiscal year.\n  We have sought to accommodate to the maximum extent possible the \ninitiatives that have been recommended by the Armed Services Committee \nin their bill as reported. We have faced a more difficult challenge, \nthough, than any of the other three committees that deal with defense \nmatters in the Congress. We are subject to the budget resolution to an \nextent that does not apply to the other three. The 602(b) allocation \nfor this bill provided $1.4 billion less in new budget authority than \nwas available to the House, and I am sure that the Senate realizes we \nare subject to a point of order in complying with section 602(b) \nallocations, that the point of order does not lie against any bill \nother than ours.\n  Compared to the amounts authorized, our allocation is nearly $1 \nbillion less than the amount that was reported by the Armed Services \nCommittee. As a result, there are many matters that were brought before \nus, requested by Members in particular, that we simply could not \naccommodate. If there is some reallocation of budget authority as we go \nthrough conference, we will, of course, work very hard to address those \nmatters that cannot be considered today.\n  This bill and the committee report have been available to all Members \nof the Senate since July 31. Every Member has had full opportunity to \nreview the matters in the bill, and I personally have spoken with many \nMembers of the Senate on specific matters and answered many inquiries \nthat were delivered to us in writing. Those were answered in writing. \nSenator Inouye and I worked very closely during the consideration of \nthis bill, as we have since we first began our partnership in \nconsidering this matter as either chairman or ranking member. We have \neach served in both capacities.\n  We have jointly proposed a package of managers' amendments that will \nmodify the bill to reflect many of the actions that have been taken to \nadjust the authorized accounts, and we will offer that package at a \nlater time.\n  However, all budget authority and outlays under our allocation have \nbeen consumed. Let me repeat that. We do not have room for any \nadditional budget authority amendments or allocations which will lead \nto outlays. All funding amendments presented to this bill will require \noffsets.\n  Mr. President, this bill does not contain the legislative initiatives \nthat are included in the authorization bill. The legislation that is \nhere before us now is an appropriations bill. After discussions with \nthe ranking member and the leaders, it is our intention to move to \ntable legislative amendments that are presented to this bill. The \nDefense authorization bill should be completed, as I indicated, \nhopefully, before we vote final passage on this bill. And the State \nDepartment authorization bill will come back to the Senate after the \nrecess. We do not want legislative matters pertaining to those two \nbills to be considered in connection with this bill. In conference, we \nare going to have the most difficult time we have ever had. We do not \nneed to try to carry to our conference on appropriations the disputes \nthat pertain to the authorizations bills for the Department of Defense \nand Department of State.\n  We hope we can preserve, incidentally, as much of the recess as \npossible. I am very hopeful we will finish this bill tomorrow so that I \ncan be on a plane joining my family in Alaska tomorrow night. However, \nI wish to tell the Senate I am prepared to stay here into next week if \nit is necessary. I do not believe in letting an appropriations bill for \ndefense just hang over the recess. We are prepared to finish this bill. \nThe leader has indicated that he wants to have this bill finished, and \nI urge the Members of the Senate to accommodate us and help us get this \nbill finished.\n  There is just no reason to repeat the debates on amendments that were \noffered to the authorization bill just this last week or amendments \nthat are still in off-the-floor conferences that are being carried on \non the authorization bill.\n  I urge every Member of the Senate to be considerate about others now \nas we consider this bill and try to get it finished in order that we \nmay all get on our airplanes or in our automobiles, for those who are \nlucky enough to be able to drive home, and enjoy part of August, as we \nshould have been there last week as a matter of fact.\n  Now, Mr. President, title 1 of this bill recommends $68.881 billion \nto fully fund the authorized active duty end-strength and the proposed \nmilitary pay raise.\n  The recommendation also fully funds the authorized increases in the \nbasic allowance for quarters. There is an additional $100 million to \naddress increased overseas-station allowance costs faced by military \nfamilies deployed overseas because of the fluctuation in the value of \nthe dollar.\n  For operation and maintenance activities, the recommendation provides \n$79.930 billion, fully funding the proposed OPTEMPO for military \ntraining and readiness.\n  There are no funds in this bill for contingency operations such as \nBosnia. The House bill, as reported, does provide funding for \noperations such as Iraq. That issue will be considered in conference \nagain depending on how we handle the allocation, but there is just not \nmoney available for those contingencies at this time in our \nconsideration.\n  We do fully fund the proposed civilian personnel pay raise that was \nrecommended in the budget by the President.\n  To authorize the shortfall and inadequate stock of barracks housing \nfor single military personnel, our committee recommends an increase of \n$322 million for the renovation and refurbishment of existing barracks. \nThis is only a downpayment, Mr. President. It will permit the services \nto make progress on one of the key quality-of-life issues that we have \ndiscussed with the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  The bill also addresses several critical National Guard priorities. \nFull funding and legislative direction is provided to sustain the Air \nNational Guard Tactical Fighter Force at 15 aircraft per squadron. A \nfloor is set for civilian technicians, to maintain readiness support \nfor the Guard. I point out to the Senate how much the Guard is involved \nin an active-duty partnership now in many areas throughout the world, \nincluding training in our own country. \n\n[[Page S 12124]]\n\n  There is $100 million added for Army Guard operations and \nmaintenance, to address partially the severe backlog in real property \nmaintenance at Guard facilities and installations.\n  Our bill provides an additional $5.8 billion for procurement, to \nsustain critical modernization programs.\n  The committee based these decisions on the guidance provided, once \nagain, by the military service chiefs. We sought to follow closely \ntheir recommendations and the recommendations given to us by the Armed \nServices Committee.\n  Mr. President, $777 million is the authorized level provided for \nNational Guard equipment. We have no specific earmarks. The bill \nlanguage is included mandating that the Reserve and Guard component \nchiefs report their modernization priorities by December 1, 1995. We \nbelieve that the chiefs should make that allocation of these funds.\n  The recommendation fully funds the ballistic missile defense \ninitiative reported by the Armed Services Committee. And an additional \n$600 million is included.\n  Mr. President, $300 million is provided to accelerated development \nand deployment of a national missile defense system. These are two of \nthe items currently being discussed off the floor by the authorization \ncommittee.\n  An additional $200 million is recommended to restore funds cut in the \nbudget to continue the development of the F-22 for the Air Force.\n  To address medical research priorities, $100 million is recommended \nfor the Department of Defense research on breast cancer. These funds \nare to be available only for use to address the needs of military \nmedical beneficiaries.\n  Under the terms of the budget resolution conference, defense \nappropriations must relate to defense functions. We believe there are a \ngreat many women and women dependents in the military, and there is \nadequate reason to provide this money to the Department of Defense to \ncontinue their initiatives with regard to breast cancer. The House has \nstructured their breast cancer initiative differently. Of course, that \nmatter will be discussed in conference.\n  Again, I have mentioned my good friend from Hawaii, Senator Inouye. \nThe Senate should know that this bill reflects our joint views, as you \nwill hear shortly. We continue to work closely on a strictly--not even \nbipartisan--nonpartisan basis. We see matters of defense I believe from \nthe same point of view, from the point of view of those who served in \nWorld War II, Mr. President. And having that background, we are trying \nto maintain our military to meet the needs of the future.\n  Again, I want to commend my good friend, who is our cochairman. We \nhave both been chairman, and at times we forget who is chairman. I \nthink that is the best way to run this subcommittee that deals so much \nwith the needs of the military services and the men and women who serve \nus in the Armed Forces.\n  We can, I think, complete this bill today with the cooperation of the \nMembers of the Senate. We have already heard of several of the \namendments that are coming. I personally discussed with those Members \nthe opportunity to have a time agreement in advance so that the Senate \nwill know how long we will take on these amendments, and if possible we \nwill stack some of these amendments so we can have as much opportunity \nto not require Members to come back and forth to the floor so often.\n  We will have several votes on this bill today, however, Mr. \nPresident. We hope to accommodate Members of the Senate, and urge their \ncooperation with us.\n  Now, Mr. President, I yield the floor to my good friend from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, let me first begin by congratulating my \nsubcommittee chairman, Senator Stevens, for recommending this bill to \nthe Senate. And I would like to also thank my colleague from Alaska for \nhis very generous comments.\n  The bill that is now being presented to the Senate by the \nAppropriations Committee will protect critical military readiness \nprograms. We hear much about readiness. This bill addresses that. It \nwill fully fund the needs of our men and women in uniform and also \nprovide a much needed increase in the modernization of our forces.\n  In the long tradition of the Appropriations Committee, this bill was \ncrafted in a bipartisan, or as the chairman has noted, a nonpartisan \nmanner. I have had the privilege of working closely with Chairman \nStevens in formulating this bill, as we have in the past. In some \nareas, the committee was constrained by authorization limitations which \ncaused Chairman Stevens and I to recommend less than some of our \ncolleagues might have wanted for certain programs such as defense \nconversion, the Seawolf submarine, or the B-2 bomber. But the chairman \nand I agreed that we would live within the limitations recommended by \nthe Armed Services Committee.\n  Mr. President, I want to point out to my colleagues on this side of \nthe aisle that this bill provides no policy statement on the ABM \nTreaty. I think that should be repeated. This bill does not contain any \nlanguage or any policy statement on the ABM Treaty, nor does it have \nany limitation on the President of the United States in foreign \naffairs, and no other major policy issues.\n  Adhering strictly to the rules of the Senate, this bill addresses \nspending priorities, not legislation. In fact, my colleagues should \nknow that the chairman stripped 90 legislative provisions from the \ndefense bill that was passed by this body last year. This is a very \nclear bill, a very clean bill, which addresses the spending needs of \nthe Defense Department. And, Mr. President, I am proud to support it.\n  The bill before the Senate provides nearly $80 billion for operations \nand maintenance to protect the readiness of our forces. It supports the \nmilitary personnel levels requested by the President. It funds a 2.4-\npercent pay raise for our military personnel and increases their basic \nallowance substantially--all consistent with authorization \nrecommendations. The bill also raises procurement spending by nearly $6 \nbillion, up to $44.5 billion.\n  To those who suggest that the bill provides too much for \nmodernization, I note that even with these increases, we are still \nspending less than half of the amount the Senate recommended for \nprocurement 10 years ago. I might add that Chairman Stevens and I asked \neach of the military Chiefs of Staff to meet with the Defense \nSubcommittee to review the needs of their respective services.\n  The recommendations for procurement spending matched these \nrequirements.\n  The bill funds a very robust ballistic missile defense program, \nadding $300 million for national missile defense research and \ndevelopment. While some might disagree with this recommendation, it is \nthe same amount already approved by the Senate; and it is $150 million \nless than recommended by the House. Research and development spending \nin total will increase by more than $1 billion compared to the present \nrequest.\n  Mr. President, I believe it is essential that we invest in the \nreadiness, quality-of-life, and modernization programs funded by this \nbill.\n  As my colleagues know very well, only a very small percentage of \nAmericans served in the military. Less than 1 percent of us have come \nforward to say that they are willing to stand in harm's way for the \nNation. And so I believe it is our responsibility to make certain that \nwe provide these dedicated men and women fair pay, decent living \nconditions, and the best equipment available. Those who choose to serve \nare our best deterrent of war and the means if necessary to defeat any \nadversary and safeguard our freedoms.\n And so we must support their needs, and I believe that this measure \ndoes just that.\n\n  Mr. President, may I repeat that I am in full support of this \nlegislation. It is a good, a fair, and a very important bill, and so I \nencourage all of my colleagues to support it.\n  One of the major issues in this measure will be the increases that \nthis committee has recommended in procurement. Yes, these are some \nprograms that were not requested officially by the President of the \nUnited States, but these decisions were reached as a result of our \nconsultation with the senior military officers and the senior civilians \nresponsible for our defense. \n\n[[Page S 12125]]\n\n  For example, we have added two DDG-51 destroyers at a cost of $1.4 \nbillion. The question may be asked, Why did we do this? The President's \nprogram calls for four destroyers. However, it calls for two at this \nmoment and two at a later time, about 3 years from now. If we followed \nthe administration's recommendation, that amount, $1.4 billion, would \nbe increased by nearly $400 million. We can get a better deal by \npurchasing four at this time.\n  There is another large item, the LHD-7 amphibious assault ship. It is \n$1.3 billion--a whole lot of money--but even this is in the program \nthat the Defense Department has.\n  We have decided to procure these items at this moment and not at a \nlater date so that we can avoid the peaks and valleys that we usually \nexperience. We have tried to level off our spending programs so that we \nwill not be faced suddenly 2 years from now with a huge peak and then 2 \nyears after that with a valley.\n  We have added, as the chairman noted, $777 million for National Guard \nequipment. These are requested by the adjutants general of the 50 \nStates. Yes, there was a time when National Guard troops were riot-\ncontrol experts, or they filled sandbags for flood control, they did \ncivilian work. But today, as they did in Desert Storm, we have men \npiloting aircraft in the Bosnia theater. In Desert Storm, there were \nthousands of National Guard officers, men and women. So they are no \nlonger local troops that take part in our national endeavors.\n  We also added 12 F/A-18 Navy fighters, $487 million. This is beyond \nthe President's request, but here again, the President's program, the \nDefense Department program, calls for the acquisition of these aircraft \nat a later date. And if you want to have a better contract deal, now is \nthe time to purchase this.\n  There is $300 million for Coast Guard. The Coast Guard has now gone \nbeyond just guarding our coast. They have participated in Bosnia, and \nthey still do; they participated in Desert Storm, and on top of that, \nwe have directed the Coast Guard to conduct certain missions that were \nnot heretofore part of their responsibility. They have a major \nresponsibility in drug interdiction. The Coast Guard account, which is \nin the Treasury account, is not quite sufficient to meet all the \npayments, so we decided in the defense bill, because it is true defense \nwork, to pick up part of the tab.\n  We are appropriating $241 million to purchase a WC-130 Hurricane \naircraft. I hope that my colleagues will be able to convince our \nfriends who live in Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, \nFlorida, Louisiana, and Texas that this aircraft is not necessary. This \nis the aircraft that gives citizens of these areas advance notice that \nsomething horrendous is coming along. Yes, it is expensive, but we need \nthis aircraft.\n  The Army asked for one thing. It was not in the President's request: \nComanche, $174 million. This is a helicopter program.\n  What I have listed represents about 6 billion dollars' worth. Mr. \nPresident, if my colleagues carefully study what we have done, I am \ncertain they will go along with the subcommittee. This is not fat, this \nis not pork, and if I may be a bit parochial and personal about this, \nnone of these items are purchased in Alaska or Hawaii. We do not have \nthe plants that build the fighter planes. We do not have the plants and \nthe shipyards that build these ships and destroyers. The chairman and I \nbelieve that this equipment is absolutely essential at this time if we \nare to modernize our forces and to present to them the best we can in \nequipment.\n  If these men, representing less than 1 percent of our population, are \nwilling to step forward and say to us, ``We are willing to risk our \nlives and shed our blood for you,'' the least we can do is to provide \nthem with the best protection. This will do it.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle will go along with the recommendations that Senator Stevens and I \nare now presenting.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 2350 through 2362, En bloc\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I send to the desk a series of amendments \nthat are technical, conforming and incidental. One is on Corps SAM; one \nLMT; one a study amendment; there is a pentaborane amendment; BIC; \nHydra-70; the JTF; JAMIP; troops to cops; troops to teachers; energy \nsavings; and the helicopter conversion amendment.\n  These have been examined by Senator Inouye and by myself. I ask \nunanimous consent that it be in order that they be offered en bloc and \nadopted en bloc, and with a paragraph before each one explaining the \naction we have taken. These are to conform, basically, with the \nauthorization bill request of Members or amendments that have been \nadopted each time we brought the bill to the floor.\n  May I state for the record that both our staffs, and both of us, have \nstudied these amendments very carefully, and we have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendments en bloc.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens] proposes amendments \n     numbered 2350 through 2362, en bloc.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n                           Amendment No. 2350\n\n       On page 29, before the period on line 13, insert: ``: \n     Provided further, That of the funds appropriated in this \n     paragraph, $35,000,000 shall be available for the Corps \n     Surface-to-Air Missile (Corps SAM) program''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2351\n\n       On page 29, before the period on line 13, insert: ``: \n     Provided further, That of the funds appropriated in this \n     paragraph, $3,000,000 shall be available for the Large \n     Millimeter Telescope project''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2352\n\n       On page 29, before the period on line 13, insert: ``: \n     Provided, That of the funds appropriated in this paragraph, \n     not more than $48,505,000 shall be available for the \n     Strategic Environmental Research Program program element \n     activities and not more than $34,302,000 shall be available \n     for Technical Studies, Support and Analysis program element \n     activities''.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2353\n\n  (Purpose: To place a condition on the use of funds for destruction of \ncertain pentaborane)\n       At the appropriate place in the bill add the following:\n\n     SEC.   .\n\n       None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available \n     under this Act may be used for the destruction of pentaborane \n     currently stored at Edwards Air Force Base, California, until \n     the Secretary of Energy certifies to the congressional \n     defense committees that the Secretary does not intend to use \n     the pentaborane or the by-products of such destruction at the \n     Idaho National Engineering Laboratory for--\n       (1) environmental remediation of high level, liquid \n     radioactive waste; or\n       (2) as a source of raw materials for boron drugs for Boron \n     Neutron Capture Therapy.\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I want to thank the distinguished \nmanagers of the bill for including my amendment on pentaborane into the \nmanagers' amendment. My amendment will prohibit the Department of \nDefense from destroying a material, know as pentaborane, until the \nSecretary of Energy certifies that the material will not be used by the \nIdaho National Engineering Laboratory for remediation of high level, \nliquid radioactive waste or as a source for boron drugs for the boron \nneutron capture therapy.\n  I am told that it will cost the Air Force a little more than $1 \nmillion to maintain the pentaborane material for 1 more year while the \nscientists and experts at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory \ndetermine if this material can be used effectively in waste management \nor boron neutron capture therapy.\n  The energy and water appropriations bill passed by the Senate \nincludes $1 million for the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory to \nmake its assessment of the use of pentaborane. At present, the Air \nForce considers pentaborane a waste. My amendment directs the Air Force \nto maintain this material for 1 more year while pentaborane's possible \nuses by the Department of Energy are assessed.\n  I want to once again thank the managers of the bill, the senior \nSenator \n\n[[Page S 12126]]\nfrom Alaska, Chairman Stevens and the senior Senator from Hawaii, \nSenator Inouye, for their consideration of my amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2354\n\n       On page 29, before the period on line 13, insert: ``: \n     Provided further, That of the $475,470,000 appropriated in \n     this paragraph for the Other Theater Missile Defense, up to \n     $25,000,000 may be available for the operation of the \n     Battlefield Integration Center''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2355\n\n       On page 28, before the period on line 4, insert: ``: \n     Provided, That of the funds appropriated in this paragraph \n     for the Other Missile Product Improvement Program program \n     element, $10,000,000 is provided only for the full \n     qualification and operational platform certification of Non-\n     Developmental Item (NDI) composite 2.75 inch rocket motors \n     and composite propellant pursuant to the initiation of a \n     Product Improvement Program (PIP) for the Hydra-70 rocket''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                           amendment no. 2356\n\n   (Purpose: To make funds available for the Life Science Equipment \nLaboratory, Kelly Air Force Base, Texas, for support of the Joint Task \n                        Force--Full Accounting)\n\n       On page 8, line 13, strike out ``Act.'' and insert in lieu \n     thereof ``Act: Provided further, That of the funds provided \n     under this heading, $500,000 shall be available for the Life \n     Sciences Equipment Laboratory, Kelly Air Force Base, Texas, \n     for work in support of the Joint Task Force--Full \n     Accounting.''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2357\n\n       On page 11, before the period on line 9, insert: ``: \n     Provided further, That of the funds appropriated in this \n     paragraph, $11,200,000 shall be available for the Joint \n     Analytic Model Improvement Program''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2358\n\n       On page 11, before the period on line 9, insert: ``: \n     Provided further, That of the funds appropriated in this \n     paragraph, $10,000,000 shall be available for the Troops-to-\n     Cops program''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2359\n\n       On page 11, before the period on line 9, insert: ``: \n     Provided further, That of the funds provided under this \n     heading, $42,000,000 shall be available for the Troops-to-\n     Teachers program''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2360\n\n       On page 82, between lines 11 and 12, insert the following:\n       Sec. 8087.

Mr. President, I rise today to commend the two floor \nmanagers of the bill, the distinguished Senator from Alaska, Senator \nStevens, and the distinguished Senator from Hawaii, Senator Inouye, and \ntheir staff, for their management of the Fiscal Year 1996 \nAppropriations Act for the Department of Defense.\n  I would like to take a few moments to discuss an amendment I have \nproposed, which has been cleared by both sides. My amendment encourages \nagencies funded under the bill to become more energy efficient and \ndirects them to reduce facility energy costs by 5 percent. The agencies \nwill report to the Congress at the end of the year on their efforts to \nconserve energy and will make recommendations for further conservation \nefforts. I have offered this amendment to every appropriations bill \nthat has come before the Senate this year, and it has been accepted to \neach one.\n  I believe this is a common-sense amendment: the Federal Government \nspends nearly $4 billion annually to heat, cool, and power its 500,000 \nbuildings. The Office Technology Assistance and the Alliance to Save \nEnergy, a nonprofit group which I chair with Senator Jeffords, estimate \nthat Federal agencies could save $1 billion annually if they would make \nan effort to become more energy efficient and conserve energy.\n  Mr. President, I hope this amendment will encourage agencies to use \nnew energy savings technologies when making building improvements in \ninsulation, building controls, lighting, heating, and air conditioning. \nThe Department of Energy has made available for governmentwide agency \nuse streamlined ``energy saving performance contracts'' procedures, \nmodeled after private sector initiatives. Unfortunately, most agencies \nhave made little progress in this area. This amendment is an attempt to \nget Federal agencies to devote more attention to energy efficiency, \nwith the goal of lowering overall costs and conserving energy.\n  As I mentioned, Mr. President, this amendment has been accepted to \nevery appropriations bill the Senate has passed this year. I am pleased \nmy colleagues support it, and again, I thank the floor managers for \ntheir assistance. Thank you.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2361\n\n (Purpose: To revise the availability of funds for loan guarantees for \n           the defense dual-use assistance extension program)\n\n       On page 29, strike out the period at the end of line 13 and \n     insert in lieu thereof ``: Provided, That the funds made \n     available under the second proviso under this heading in \n     Public Law 103-335 (108 Stat. 2613) shall also be available \n     to cover the reasonable costs of the administration of loan \n     guarantees referred to in that proviso and shall be available \n     to cover such costs of administration and the costs of such \n     loan guarantees until September 30, 1998.''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2362\n\n   (Purpose: To make $5,000,000 available for conversion of surplus \n Department of Defense helicopters for procurement by State and local \n         law enforcement agencies for counter-drug activities)\n\n       On page 32, line 19, strike out ``Provided,'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``Provided, That of the funds provided under \n     this heading, $5,000,000 shall be available for conversion of \n     surplus helicopters of the Department of Defense for \n     procurement by State and local governments for counter-drug \n     activities: Provided further,''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the amendments are \nconsidered and agreed to, en bloc.\n  So the amendments (Nos. 2350 through 2362) were agreed to, en bloc.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am informed Senator McCain may have \nsome objection. If he raises an objection, or any other Senator does, \nwe will withdraw it and reconsider it. I believe we ought to just get \nalong with these technical, conforming amendments. Therefore, I ask \nunanimous consent that they be adopted as I indicated, en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That has been done.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I think the Senator from Iowa has an amendment.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendments were agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator from Iowa has an amendment \nwhich we have examined. It continues a policy we started last year at \nhis request. I ask unanimous consent that he take 3 minutes and we will \ntake 2 minutes to consider his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2363\n\n(Purpose: To improve the financial accountability of the Department of \n                                Defense)\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I will not even bother to take the 3 \nminutes. I send the amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2363.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with. \n\n[[Page S 12127]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 82, between lines 11 and 12, insert the following:\n       Sec. 8087. (a)(1) Not later than October 1, 1995, the \n     Secretary of Defense shall require that each disbursement by \n     the Department of Defense in an amount in excess of \n     $1,000,000 be matched to a particular obligation before the \n     disbursement is made.\n       (2) Not later than September 30, 1996, the Secretary of \n     Defense shall require that each disbursement by the \n     Department of Defense in an amount in excess of $500,000 be \n     matched to a particular obligation before the disbursement is \n     made.\n       (b) The Secretary shall ensure that a disbursement in \n     excess of the threshold amount applicable under subsection \n     (a) is not divided into multiple disbursements of less than \n     that amount for the purpose of avoiding the applicability of \n     such subsection to that disbursement.\n       (c) The Secretary of Defense may waive a requirement for \n     advance matching of a disbursement of the Department of \n     Defense with a particular obligation in the case of (1) a \n     disbursement involving deployed forces, (2) a disbursement \n     for an operation in a war declared by Congress or a national \n     emergency declared by the President or Congress, or (3) a \n     disbursement under any other circumstances for which the \n     waiver is necessary in the national security interests of the \n     United States, as determined by the Secretary and certified \n     by the Secretary to the congressional defense committees.\n       (d) This section shall not be construed to limit the \n     authority of the Secretary of Defense to require that a \n     disbursement not in excess of the amount applicable under \n     subsection (a) be matched to a particular obligation before \n     the disbursement is made.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, my amendment is not controversial. I \nbelieve it has been cleared on both sides.\n  My amendment addresses the $30 billion unmatched disbursement problem \nat the Department of Defense or DOD.\n  My amendment continues to ratchet down the thresholds at which DOD \nmust match a disbursement with an obligation before making a payment.\n  Under Section 8137 of last year's bill, Public Law 103-335, any \ndisbursement over $5 million has to be matched with its corresponding \nobligation before a payment could be made.\n  The $5 million threshold took effect about a month ago, on July 1, \n1995.\n  We know that the DOD Comptroller, Mr. John Hamre, is wrestling with \nthe problem. We know he is doing his very best to comply with the law.\n  He tells us he is doing it.\n  And there is no reason why he cannot do it.\n  We know, for example, that one of the major DOD contract payment \ncenters, the one at Columbus, OH, processes about 2,200 invoices per \nyear that exceed $5 million.\n  There is no reason in the world why DOD's vast army of bookkeepers \ncannot make the necessary matches on 2,200 payments per year.\n  That is a small number.\n  It is a modest threshold.\n  Well, on October 1, 1995, the law ratchets the threshold down even \nfurther.\n  On that date, any payment over $1 million must be matched with its \ncorresponding obligation before a payment is made.\n  That threshold just keeps us marching in the right direction, toward \nthe zero threshold goal.\n  That is where all DOD disbursements are matched with their \ncorresponding obligations before payment.\n  That is where DOD needs to be.\n  At the $1 million threshold, DOD has to make matches on about 12,300 \ninvoices.\n  Mr. President, with 25,834 employees, I think DFAS, the Defense \nFinance and Accounting Service, should be able to make matches on \n12,300 invoices.\n  We need to keep the pressure on.\n  DOD must develop a capability to match all disbursements with \nobligations in advance of making payments.\n  We must keep marching down the road toward that goal.\n  My amendment today would lower the threshold one more notch, to \n$500,000, effective October 1, 1996.\n  That is one year from now.\n  That is plenty of time to automate the linkages between DOD's check \nwriting machine and the accounting ledgers and contracting books.\n  There is a breakdown of electronic communications between DOD \ndisbursing and accounting.\n  That is the problem Mr. Hamre is trying to fix. He is trying to \nintegrate the two operations.\n  We want to help him do it, but at the same time, we need to keep the \npressure on.\n  At the $500,000 level, DOD will need to make payments on about 25,000 \ninvoices per year.\n  His interim Electronic Data Interchange System should be up and \nrunning by the time the $500,000 threshold kicks in.\n  Matching 25,000 invoices should then be a piece of cake.\n  Mr. President, I have raised so much fuss over the unmatched \ndisbursement problem for one reason.\n  The $30 billion in unmatched disbursements tells me there are no \neffective internal controls over a big chunk of the DOD budget.\n  This means that those accounts are vulnerable to theft and abuse.\n  The recent cases at Reese Air Force Base, TX, and the DFAS Center in \nNorfolk, VA, brought this problem home hard.\n  Two crooks were able to tap into the DOD money pipe undetected and \nsteal millions of dollars over a period of several years.\n  Both individuals were caught only by chance because of outrageous \npersonal behavior.\n  They were able to steal millions of dollars for one simple reason.\n  DOD does not do very basic accounting work before making a payment.\n  The check writing machine is on autopilot.\n  The money goes out the door. Then DOD begins to worry about matching.\n  DOD tries to make the matches after the fact, often long after the \nfact.\n  By waiting months or even years to make the matches, supporting \ndocumentation disappears.\n  It is missing. Or worse, it does not exist.\n  Either way, without supporting documentation, DOD does not know \nwhether the payment is legitimate. Without documentation, it could be \nfraudulent.\n  Until the matches are made, we do not know whether a payment is \nlegitimate or fraudulent.\n  So it was easy for the crooks in Texas and Virginia to operate \nundetected.\n  Mr. President, that is why we need to take the next step and put the \n$500,000 threshold in place.\n  If we go step by step, we will eventually get to the point were there \nare effective, but very basic, internal control devices in place.\n  I thank my friend from Alaska, Senator Ted Stevens, and my friend \nfrom Hawaii, Senator Inouye, for backing me up on this issue.\n  Their support is crucial to getting the job done. They have been \nbehind me 100 percent. I appreciate all the good support.\n  They held a hearing on the issue on May 23. They understand it and \nknow how important it is.\n  A year from now we can review the situation and make adjustments if \nneeded.\n  Mr. President, I hope the committee is prepared to accept my \namendment.\n  I simply want to thank the chairman and the ranking members, not only \nfor their cooperation this year but this is building on cooperation I \nhad from the chairman and ranking member last year on my attempts to \nbring some discipline to the matching of disbursements with checks \nbeing written. This does build on what we did last year, I think in a \nvery responsible way.\n  I suppose the taxpayers might say it is too timid of a way, that we \nhave a major problem, and we will work at it slowly to get it \naccomplished. This amendment is one more step. I thank the managers for \ntheir cooperation.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We took up this matter during the hearing on this bill \nwith Dr. Hamre, the comptroller of Defense Department. We have worked \nwith him. We were pursuing the matter at the request of the Senator \nfrom Iowa last year. That furthers the concept that we are going to try \nand make certain that we have the identification of the invoice of \ndisbursement. It is not always as easy as it sounds, since disbursement \ncould take place literally in Italy and the invoice could be located \nsomewhere in a small town in Iowa. But, as a practical matter, we are \ngoing to try to make sure that they marry up through the computer \nprocess. The Senator is right. I am prepared to accept the amendment.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate the Senator \nin this process. This is a continuation of \n\n[[Page S 12128]]\nthe process that was started last year, and we commend the author.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  So the amendment (No. 2363) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we have no other amendments pending. I \nhave some 80 amendments on the list on my desk here. We would like to \nproceed. If Senators do not want to come and offer their amendments, I \nwill be happy to make a motion to go to third reading quickly.\n  I think we have a good bill. This bill provides the lowest level of \nspending of any of the authorizations on the DOD bill, as I have \nindicated, because of the limitations on the committee due to the \nallocation and the budget process, but we have met the real \nrequirements of the bill. We have discussed this with the \nadministration, and there is some indication of the dissatisfaction, \nbut we believe we can explain to the administration why we have done \nwhat we have done. This bill should be accepted for the purpose of \nfunding the activities of the Department in the next year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of this bill be printed in the \nRecord at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Summary of Fiscal Year 1996 DOD Appropriations Bill\n\n       Total funding.--The subcommittee allocation provides \n     $242.483 billion in new budget authority, and $243.069 \n     billion in outlays.

Adds $100 million for Army National Guard O \n     to address Real Property Maintenance backlog. Recommendation \n     provides authorized level of $777 million for National Guard \n     and Reserve Equipment, and identifies priority items.\n       Procurement.--$44.460 billion.\n       Provides $5.8 billion over the budget request to restore \n     critical modernization programs. Highlights include: +$82 \n     million for Apache helicopter multi-year procurement; Funds \n     to continue UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter procurement; +$120 \n     million for OH-58 ``KIOWA WARRIOR'' upgrades; Funds for \n     multi-year procurement of the M1-A2 tank upgrades; Includes \n     for Army medium and heavy trucks/HMWVV; Funds for 24 F-18C/D \n     Navy aircraft; Funds for 8 AV-8B aircraft upgrades; Fully \n     funds V-22 procurement; Funds LHD-7 Amphibious assault ship; \n     Funds four DDG-51 class AEGIS destroyers; Advance procurement \n     for two new Attack Submarines; Continued funding for the SSN-\n     23 SEAWOLF; Funds 6 additional F-16 aircraft; Funds 6 \n     additional F-15 aircraft; Fully funds C-17 program/advance \n     procurement for 1997; Provides additional $75 million for the \n     NDAA airlift program; Funds 5 WC-130 aircraft; Provides \n     funding for HAVE NAP, AGM-130 precision munitions; and \n     Provides funding for B-1 upgrades and advanced munitions.\n       Research and development.--$35.474 billion.\n       Provides $343 million over the budget request for weapons \n     research, development and testing.

I yield to my good friend, the chairman of the \nauthorization committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I want to commend the able chairman of \nthe committee for the fine job he has done and the able ranking member \nfor the good job he has done. It is a very difficult situation to work \nthese things out. I think they both have shown great wisdom and shown \ntremendous dedication in working this bill out. I am anxious to see the \nSenate pass it.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We are grateful to the chairman of the authorization \ncommittee not only for his comments but for his presence on the floor \nas we consider these amendments. We look to him for guidance and \nsupport as far as this process is concerned.\n  Mr. President, I will soon suggest the absence of a quorum and hope \nthat amendments will be presented. I am perfectly able to make a motion \nto proceed to third reading. I do not see anybody here on the floor \nthat would object to that. I hope we get amendments pretty quickly.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask each of the Cloakrooms to put out \nthe notice that if we do not have an amendment by 11:50 a.m., I am \ngoing to move to third reading.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I was hoping to obtain clarification from \nthe distinguished Senator from Alaska with regard to language on page \n191 of Senate Report 104-124, under the heading ``Mission recorders.'' \nThis language implies that a digital version of the AN/USH-42 recorder \nis currently in use by the Navy.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator from Louisiana for pointing this \nout. A more precise rendering of the language will be as follows:\n\n       The Committee urges the Director of DARO to evaluate the \n     requirement and potential utilization of Digital Video Tape \n     Recorders on both manned and unmanned tactical reconnaissance \n     systems. This assessment should consider the potential \n     benefit of a small, lightweight, low-cost, digital variant of \n     the AN/USH-42 video recorder.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. I agree with the language proposed by my friend from \nAlaska.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Thank you.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I want to take this opportunity to commend the chairman \nand ranking member of the Subcommittee on Defense for their support for \nthe Defense Department's Financial Management Training and Educational \nProgram.\n  This program, strongly supported by the Department of Defense, will \nestablish urgently needed programs to give the Department's financial \nmanagers and accountants the necessary training that their private \nsector counterparts take for granted. This program will provide the \neducational resources to make these workers more effective and \nefficient and thereby help the Defense Department save millions of \ntaxpayers' dollars.\n  In its report, the committee provides for full funding of the \ntraining program \n\n[[Page S 12129]]\noperations in fiscal year 1996. It also states that the committee \nexpects the Defense Department to accommodate any long-term leasing \ncosts for the planned facility within the amounts appropriated in the \naccount for operations and maintenance, defensewide.\n  I believe that the Department will accommodate these costs in the \nmanner suggested. I would like, therefore, to clarify the view of the \nAppropriations Committee. Is it the understanding of the committee that \nonce the Department meets the reporting requirements contained in the \nDefense authorization bill for fiscal year 1996 on the necessity for \nestablishing a Center for Financial Management Training and Education, \nthe Department will be free to enter into a capital lease for the \nestablishment of the center without seeking further appropriation of \nfunds or reprogramming authority?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes, that is my understanding. The committee \nacknowledges the justification for the training and education program, \nto ensure that the Defense Department's financial managers receive the \nnecessary professional training. As stated in its report, the committee \nintends the Department have the authority to enter into a capital lease \nfor the Center for Financial Management, Education, and Training, using \nfunds appropriated in the operations and maintenance account.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I concur with my colleague, the chairman of the Defense \nSubcommittee. The Defense Department has the authority to proceed with \nthis worthwhile project, once the requirements contained in the fiscal \nyear 1996 Defense Authorization Act are met.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senators for their comments.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to make a few remarks about \nthe pending legislation. I say to my friend from Alaska that I have \nbasically three amendments. I think two of them may be acceptable in \ntalking with the staff.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator is correct; the first two \namendments are agreeable. We would be pleased to consider those and get \nthem out of the way.\n  We are going to accept two of the amendments. Senator Inouye and I \nhave agreed. The third amendment we will request a rollcall.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If it is OK with the Senator from Alaska, I will make my \nremarks, do the first two, and then the third, if that is agreeable.\n  First, Mr. President, I congratulate both the Senator from Alaska and \nthe Senator from Hawaii. This bill has been a dramatic reduction in the \nso-called earmarks, from some $6 billion last year to about $820 \nmillion this year. A lot of the previous bill language that was \nobligating funds has been moved to report language. Obviously, that is \na significant improvement.\n  I also would like to talk about the overall aspects of the bill, \nwhich I think are extremely laudatory. The bill increases funding for \nforce modernization by nearly $7 billion above the budget request.\n  Additional funding is provided for tactical aircraft, DDG-51, missile \ndefense and other important programs recommended by the Armed Services \nCommittee. The bill terminates many nondefense and low-priority \nmilitary programs such as DOD support for the National Science \nFoundation antarctic research program, U.N. peacekeeping assessments, \nNunn-Lugar funding for activities other than weapons demilitarization, \nand more than half the requested funding for the technology \nreinvestment program.\n  The bill does provide an additional $777 million for unrequested \nGuard and Reserve equipment, with which I strongly disagree, but unlike \nthe Armed Services Committee bill, it provides the funding in generic \ncategories and leaves the decisions on specific items to the Guard and \nReserves' component themselves. I very much favor this approach to \nprioritize among programs.\n  Last year, I advised the Appropriations Committee that I object to \nbill provisions in proposing amendments which violate four basic \ncriteria; namely, funding which is unauthorized, locality-specific \nearmarks, research facility earmarks, and other earmarks that \ncircumvent the normal competitive award process, unrequested add-ons \nthat would be subject to a point of order, and transfer disposal of \nFederal property or items in a manner that circumvent existing laws.\n  In addition to conference reports, items added in conference which \nwere in neither bill I would consider objectionable. Unfortunately, \nthis bill includes provisions which violate some of those criteria.\n  There are five provisions in the bill language which, in my view, are \nin variance with at least one of the criteria outlined above. One is \nthe earmark of $15 million for environmental remediation at National \nPresto Industries. No authorization exists for this program. This \nmatter is the subject of an ongoing dispute between the Army and \nNational Presto Industries as to liability for contamination at the \nsite.\n  This is a matter which I believe should be resolved between the \nparties, which may end up involving litigation. A legislative solution \nat this time, in my view, is not appropriate.\n  Second, authority to spend $20 million to transfer federally owned \neducational facilities on military installations to local education \nagencies. No authorization exists for these expenditures, nor has the \nArmed Services Committee reviewed and approved such a policy.\n  Third, $1 million earmarked for the Marine and Environmental Research \nand Training Station. No authorization exists for this spending and no \ndirection is provided concerning the type of research to be conducted \nor the need for that research. I understand that the Navy does not want \nto continue doing business with this organization because of the \ndifficulty of dealing with them in the past.\n  Fourth, authority for the Coast Guard to draw $300 million from the \ndefense business operations fund, known as DBOF. This is an \nunauthorized appropriation and a new authority not considered in the \nArmed Services Committee. Expenditure of DOD funds for Coast Guard \nactivities have been a recurring problem in past years, and this \nprovision would greatly expand the ability of the Coast Guard to draw \non DOD funds.\n  Finally, addition of $25 million for the environmental remediation \ntrust fund at Kaho'olawe Island.\n  Certainly DOD has responsibility to clean up this site, but adding \nfunds to a trust fund which already totals a great deal of money I \nbelieve is a rejiggering of the defense priorities and a waste of \nscarce defense resources.\n  These provisions I do not believe have a place on this bill and \nshould be subjected to the full review of the Armed Services Committee. \nThe amendment I will be offering would not strike the provisions in the \nbill, it would merely subject them to the review of the authorizing \ncommittee and require a specific, separate authorization before the \nfunds could be expended to implement the provisions.\n  Let me emphasize, the amendment would require authorization rather \nthan just strike the funding, because there may be a difference of view \nas to the necessity for the expenditure of those funds.\n                            seawolf funding\n\n  In addition, section 8080 of the bill contains a number of funding \ntransfers, including allocation of additional funds for the Seawolf \nsubmarine.\n  Last year, the Congress imposed a legislative cap on procurement \ncosts for the first two Seawolf submarines. The cap could automatically \nincrease for inflation adjustments as well as changes in labor and \nother laws. It did not permit, however, an automatic adjustment for \nother cost increases, such as change orders or contractor claims.\n  In the fiscal year 1995 ship cost adjustment request, the Navy \nidentified cost increases in the Seawolf program of $65.9 million.\n  Only $34 million of this increase--the amount attributable to \ninflation--is allowable under the legislative cost cap.\n  Therefore, to ensure that the Seawolf program cost remains with the \nlegislative cost cap, the Navy identified $31.9 million in offsetting \nreductions.\n  Unfortunately, in the bill before the Senate, the Appropriations \nCommittee did not include the recommended rescission of $13.6 million \nin fiscal year 1991 shipbuilding funds to keep the Seawolf program \nwithin the legislative cost cap.\n  I am offering an amendment which would add this rescission into the \ncommittee bill, ensuring that the Seawolf \n\n[[Page S 12130]]\ncost cap is not breached only 1 year after it was imposed.\n\n\n                        report language problems\n\n  Throughout the committee's report language, there are additional \nearmarks and set-asides for special interest projects. While report \nlanguage is not amendable in the Senate, it still carries weight with \nthe Department of Defense in allocating funds among programs. \nTherefore, I believe it is inappropriate to include earmarks for \nspecific facilities or locations in the report language.\n  Let me list just a few of the items in the report language which I \nfind objectionable.\n\n\n                            medical earmarks\n\n  The sum of $5 million is earmarked in report language--I want to \nemphasize report language--for research on ``elastin-based biomaterial, \npolymerized by human enzymes and capable of injection molding and other \ntissue replacement application''; additional funds are earmarked ``to \nconduct biologic\n implantation to evaluate immunological responses and healing and to \nprepare data for FDA submission preparatory to human clinical trials'' \nI will not bother to ask the managers what that means.\n\n  Earmarks of unrequested funds for a number of medical research \nprograms: $425,000 for serum cholesterol, $2.025 million for nutrition \nresearch, $1 million for dengue fever, and $3.878 million for \n``Medteams'';\n  The sum of $11.2 million for unrequested program to ``demonstrate a \ntransportable plasma waste treatment system at the Western \nEnvironmental Technology Office'';\n  For spinal/brain research $5 million, and $20 million for the DOD/VA \n``core'' medical research programs;\n  Additional $120 million for AIDS and breast cancer research;\n  ``* * * the committee urges the Department to provide not less than \n$8,000,000 in financial and technical support toward the study of \nneurofibromatosis'';\n  ``* * * the committee urges the Department to provide not less than \n$1,000,000 in financial and technical support toward the study of \nPaget's and related bone diseases'';\n  The sum of $5 million earmarked for the Military Nursing Research \nProgram.\n  Other earmarks are: $5.4 million in unrequested funding ``to continue \nongoing efforts with an established small business development center \nto be administered as in previous years, focused on developing \nagricultural-based services, such as bioremediation. The committee \nsupports targeted research and development projects and agricultural \ndevelopment activities in zones surrounding military installations'';\n  The sum of $1 million for the Mississippi Resource Development \nCorporation for ``continued research and development programs at the \nNational Center for Physical Acoustics, centering on ocean acoustics'';\n  Earmarks for continuing research: $5 million for the Center for \nAstronomical Adaptive Optics, $650,000 for National Solar Observatory, \nand $3 million for Pacific Software Research Center;\n  The sum of $8 million to be ``competitively awarded to a qualified \nWashington, DC, region-based institution of higher education with \nexpertise and programs in computational sciences and\n informatics capable of conducting research and development that will \nfurther efforts to establish an effective metacomputing testbed'';\n\n  Three million dollars of theater missile defense funds earmarked for \noperation of Kauai test facility; and\n  Earmark of unlimited counterdrug funding for Southwest border \ninformation system, to ``permit acquisition of automated systems by \nFederal, State, and local law enforcement offices involved in this \nprogram.''\n  There are a number of other provisions which bear mentioning, because \nthey are so egregious: $3.85 million for family housing and wastewater \ntreatment plans for Hawaii; over $40 million for Pacific missile range \nimprovements and support; $2.6 million to transfer Bryant Army Heliport \nto the Army National Guard at Fort Richardson, AK; additional $10 \nmillion earmarked for C-130 operations, and an unauthorized add of $88 \nmillion for unrequested C-130 aircraft; $30 million for the Allegheny \nBallistics Lab, which was specifically rejected by the Armed Services \nCommittee; $2 million for a natural gas boiler demonstration; $11.5 \nmillion for a training satellite for Air Force Academy cadets; another \n$15 million of unrequested funding for the High Altitude Auroral \nResearch Program in Alaska; another $15 million for research on \nelectric vehicle technology; $1 million for brown tree snake research; \nauthority to procure computer terminals for local law enforcement \nofficials participating in Southwest border control programs.\n  Mr. President, there are others. I will stop.\n  First of all, I emphasize this is report language, not bill language. \nBut, for the life of me, I do not know what a number of these projects \nhave to do with defending our vital national security interests. I can \nimagine that the brown tree snake is a threat to the very vitals of \nthis Nation, but I do not know, nor have I ever heard, that the brown \ntree snake posed a threat to our national security.\n  As I say, there are many others that are very worthwhile programs, \nsuch as breast cancer research, AIDS--I do not know very much about the \nstudy of neurofibromatosis, but I have not heard yet in testimony \nbefore the Armed Services Committee that neurofibromatosis is a threat \nor a consideration of the Pentagon.\n  Paget's and related bone diseases, I am sure are also another that \ndeserve our attention, but I do not think in this bill.\n  I do congratulate my colleagues for their restraint and their \nunderstanding that these defense dollars are becoming less and less, \nand that they have exercised significant restraint. Therefore, I would \nlike to offer the first two amendments to my colleagues, that are \nacceptable, in order. Then I will go to the third, move to the third \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2372\n\n (Purpose: To limit the total amount that may be obligated or expended \n    for procurement of the SSN-21, SSN-22, and SSN-23 Seawolf class \n                              submarines)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk for myself \nand Senator Dodd and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] for himself and Mr. \n     Dodd, proposes an amendment numbered 2372.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 82, between lines 11 and 12, insert the following:\n       Sec. 8087. (a) Except as provided in subsection (b), the \n     total amount obligated or expended for procurement of the \n     SSN-21, SSN-22, and SSN-23 Seawolf class submarines may not \n     exceed $7,223,695,000.\n       (b) The amount of the limitation set forth in subsection \n     (a) is increased after fiscal year 1995 by the following \n     amounts:\n       (1) The amounts of outfitting costs and post-delivery costs \n     incurred for the submarines referred to in such subsection.\n       (2) The amounts of increases in costs attributable to \n     economic inflation after fiscal year 1995.\n       (3) The amounts of increases in costs attributable to \n     compliance with changes in Federal, State, or local laws \n     enacted after fiscal year 1995.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, in behalf of myself and Senator Dodd, I \nwill be brief.\n  Last year, the Congress adopted an amendment to the fiscal year 1995 \nDefense authorization bill which capped the procurement cost of the \nfirst two Seawolf submarines at $4.759 billion, the total amount \nidentified by DOD as necessary to complete construction of these two \nboats.\n  The amendment was necessary to control escalating costs of the \nprogram.\n  When the total cost of the Seawolf program is taken into account, the \ncost per submarine is over $4.3 billion.\n  The procurement-only cost of the first two Seawolf submarines has \nrisen $1.4 billion since the contracts were signed.\n  In December 1983, the Secretary of the Navy set a procurement cost \nceiling for SSN-21 of $1.655 billion; current costs are almost $2.433 \nbillion. The initial cost estimated for the SSN-22 was $1.718 billion; \ncurrent costs are almost $2.236 billion.\n  SSN-23 is currently estimated to cost a total of $2.4 billion, \nalthough just \n\n[[Page S 12131]]\nlast year the Navy was estimating $2.3 billion.\n  In September 1993 and again in May 1994, Navy officials confirmed the \ncost of the first two Seawolf submarines at $4.673 billion, which was \nthe amount I included in my original amendment to establish a cost cap. \nBut then, on June 9, 1994, the Navy wrote to me indicating that the \ncost of the first two Seawolf submarines would go up another $126 \nmillion. The final cost cap amount allowed only approximately $86 \nmillion of these increases, because they were deemed to be truly \nuncontrollable--inflation and labor law changes.\n  Early this year, the Navy replaced the Seawolf program management \nteam, allegedly because of escalating costs above the legal cap--\nperhaps as much as $40 to $70 million. The new management arrangement \nseems to be working well and is structured to allow the Navy to keep a \nclose eye on costs, and hopefully, no further taxpayer dollars will be \nrequired to finish the first two submarines. I wonder, though, why the \nprogram was allowed to escalate out of control for so many years.\n  Therefore, I offer an amendment to expand the existing cost cap to \ninclude the third Seawolf submarine. The provision establishes a \nprocurement cost cap of $7.2 billion on the three Seawolf submarines. \nThis includes an additional $2.4\n billion for the third submarine, as well as an increase of \napproximately $34 million for inflation since the enactment of the cost \ncap last year.\n\n  The provision allows for the same automatic increases for inflation \nand labor law changes as the existing cap. It also exempts the future \ncosts of outfitting and post-delivery for the submarines. These are \ncosts which will undergo congressional review and require authorization \nand appropriations in the future.\n  When the Defense budget has declined 35 percent since 1985, with a \nprojected decrease of nearly 10 percent by the end of the decade, \nCongress should insist on fiscal responsibility for every dime of \ntaxpayer dollars we are asked to approve.\n  We cannot allow a return to the uncontrollable cost escalation that \nwe have seen on the first two submarines, and I believe that imposing \nthe same strict cost controls on the third Seawolf would be to the \nadvantage of the American taxpayer.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor on this amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I will limit myself at this time to the \nSenator's pending amendment. I will answer the comments he has made at \na later time.\n  I believe Senator Inouye will concur. We have examined this amendment \ndealing with the Seawolf. We have no objection. It carries out a \nlimitation. I might add, however, that it does precisely what the \nSenator is objecting to. It is an appropriations bill. Providing the \nnecessary oversight and limitation on expenditures of funds is what we \nhave done throughout the bill and in the report. We have, with regard \nto the Seawolf, this time not totally funded the Seawolf. We have \nincrementally funded the Seawolf in order that we may have the funds \navailable from outlays for dealing with other projects which are in the \nbill, which the Senator from Arizona, I think, has rightfully \nacknowledged was a pretty good idea.\n  We have no problem with this. It puts a limitation on the expenditure \nfor the Seawolf on the calendar year basis, which is what we intended \nto do. I think we do in the report.\n  Senator Inouye and I are prepared to accept this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from Arizona.\n  The amendment (No. 2372) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2374\n\n(Purpose: To add a rescission recommended by the Department of Defense)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain), for himself and Mr. \n     Dodd, proposes an amendment numbered 2374.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 71, between lines 11 and 12, insert the following:\n       ``Shipbuilding and Conversion, Navy, 1991/1995'', \n     $13,570,000.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to say to my colleague that the \nreason I proposed the last amendment--I had not intended to--was \nbecause of the situation regarding the authorization bill.\n  I think there is significant question as to whether there will be a \ndefense authorization bill this year. I included it in the Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  But the reason I put it on this bill was because of the enormous \nuncertainty as to whether there will be an authorization bill in light \nof the continuing failure to reach agreement on the ballistic missile \ndefense issue.\n  Last year, the Congress imposed a legislative cap on procurement \ncosts for the first two Seawolf submarines. The cap could automatically \nincrease for inflation adjustments as well as changes in labor and \nother laws. It did not permit, however, an automatic adjustment for \nother cost increases, such as change orders or contractor claims.\n  In the fiscal year 1995 ship cost adjustment request, the Navy \nidentified cost increases in the Seawolf program of $65.9 million.\n  Only $34 million of this increase--the amount attributable to \ninflation--is allowable under the legislative cost cap.\n  Therefore, to ensure that the Seawolf program cost remains within the \nlegislative cost cap, the Navy identified $31.9 million in offsetting \nreductions.\n  Unfortunately, in the bill before the Senate, the Appropriations \nCommittee did not include the recommended rescission of $13.6 million \nin fiscal year 1991 shipbuilding funds to keep the Seawolf program \nwithin the legislative cost cap.\n  The amendment would incorporate this rescission into the committee \nbill, ensuring that the Seawolf cost cap is not breached only 1 year \nafter it was imposed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I understand the Navy has expressed no \nobjection to this amendment. It is a matter of moneys that are there \nthat could be rescinded at this time. It totally rescinds $13.57 \nmillion in the Navy accounts that are there from 1991 to 1995.\n  I have no objection if the Senator wishes to offer this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from \nArizona.\n  The amendment (No. 2374) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2375\n\n  (Purpose: To prohibit use of funds for programs and activities for \n             which appropriations have not been authorized)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain) proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2375.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 82, between lines 11 and 12, insert the following:\n       Sec. 8087. (a) Funds available to the Department of Defense \n     for fiscal year 1996 may not be obligated or expended for a \n     program or activity referred to in subsection (b) except to \n     the extent that appropriations are specifically authorized \n     for such program or activity in an Act other than an \n     appropriations Act.\n       (b) Subsection (a) applies to the following programs and \n     activities:\n\n[[Page S 12132]]\n\n       (1) Environmental remediation at National Presto \n     Industries, Inc., Eau Claire, Wisconsin.\n       (2) Transfer of federally owned educational facilities on \n     military installations to local education agencies.\n       (3) Activities at the Marine and Environmental Research and \n     Training Station.\n       (4) Support for Coast Guard activities from the Defense \n     Business Operations Fund.\n       (5) Contribution to the Kaho'olawe Island Restoration Trust \n     Fund.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to emphasize that this amendment \nwould be to require authorization for the expenditure of these funds \nbefore the funds are expended as outlined in the appropriations bill.\n  It would not strike the language. It would simply add language \nrequiring that authorization be obtained for these programs.\n  The first--I have discussed these before--is the earmark for $15 \nmillion for environmental remediation at the National Presto Industries \nfor which, as I pointed out, there is no authorization for the program. \nIn addition to that, there is an ongoing dispute between the Army and \nthis corporation as to liability for the contamination of the site.\n  The second one is the authority to expend $20 million to transfer \nfederally owned educational facilities on military installations to \nlocal education agencies. There is simply no authority for that.\n  The third is the $5 million earmarked for the Marine and \nEnvironmental Research and Training Station. No authorization exists \nfor this.\n  Finally, the authority for the Coast Guard to draw $300 million from \nthe Defense Business Operations Fund, and the addition of $25 million \nfor the Environmental Remediation Trust Fund for the Kaho'olawe Island.\n  Mr. President, I have discussed these at some length in my previous \nremarks.\n  So, therefore, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I believe that the Senator from Arizona \nhas presented his point of view ably. I thank him for the comments he \nhas made concerning the bill as a whole.\n  We have a difference of opinion with regard to the functions of the \nAppropriations Committee as compared to the Armed Services Committee. \nIt is my feeling that it is our responsibility to look over the request \nfor money to be spent by the Department of Defense to try to allocate \nit within functions within the Department and within the various \nservices to the best of our ability,\n keeping in mind that the Department has a request for many things.\n\n  The Armed Services Committee deals with the broader general defense \npolicies and with the confirmation of the particular persons that are \nnominated to carry out the Commander in Chief's functions through the \nDepartment of Defense. They have the oversight of planning. They have \nthe oversight of a great many matters, and they basically authorize \ngeneral functions.\n  In recent years, there has been a tendency of some members of the \nArmed Services Committee to try to get down to the point where I think \nthey would like to limit the number of paper clips that each agency can \nbuy. We are inclined to oppose that. We are at that point now because \nwe believe we have the right to put limitations on the expenditures of \nmoneys or to allocate the moneys to particular functions when they are \ndealing with categories of line items, and the line items in this \ninstance are important.\n  Take, for instance, National Presto. That is the environmental \nremediation site at Eau Claire, WI. It was first addressed in the 1988 \ndefense bill. This year we have language that limits the funds only to \nimplement the Army's agreement on that site.\n  Now, under the circumstances, that is limiting the expenditure of \nfunds that we have authorized. It is a limitation on expenditures which \nis entirely our responsibility and not the responsibility of the \nauthorization bill. This was offered by Senator Cochran in our \nsubcommittee and voted on by the subcommittee, approved by the full \ncommittee, and has been brought to the floor as our recommendation on \nthe limit of expenditure of funds contained in this bill. I think that \nis a good example of what we are all about.\n  With regard to the transfer of funds for the support of the Coast \nGuard activities from the Defense Business Operations Fund, we plead \nguilty. The Coast Guard is a defense entity in times of war. In order \nto keep it so that it can be a defense entity, we have since 1981 \nprovided a substantial amount of defense funds either directly or \nthrough the use of funds appropriated to the Department of Defense for \nthe purchase of fuel or supplies that can be used. They acquire them in \nthis instance from the Navy facilities.\n  We have authorized the Coast Guard under this bill to draw services \nand logistics support for defense missions from the Navy. Now, they \nhave had a whole series of defense missions, whether it is Haiti or the \nCuban refugee concept or some of their activities in the blockade of \nIraq.\n  There is a whole series of things the Coast Guard is doing. As a \nmatter of fact, in my opinion, it ought to be 10 times this amount to \nrepay the Coast Guard for what they are doing. But this ensures the \nCoast Guard can participate in these missions. They are also involved \nin the counternarcotics mission with the Navy in both the Atlantic and \nsouthern commands, and they have really I think had an impact on their \noverall readiness for their other activities that are very important in \nareas such as law enforcement, safety inspections, et cetera. They have \nto reduce their effectiveness in dealing with their civilian role \nduring peacetime in order to participate in peacetime in semi-military \nactivities.\n  This $300 million is a bare minimum. I wish to serve notice to the \nSenate that next year it will be more. If anyone believes it is wrong, \nthe bill you have just voted on, transportation, assumes that this $300 \nmillion is there.\n  If the Senator from Arizona wants to help the Coast Guard, if he does \nnot want it here, then he should offer the amendment, in my opinion, to \nthe Coast Guard. Those of us who support the Department of Defense--and \nI am sure the Senator from Arizona does, as I do--ought to realize that \nthe Coast Guard is one of the echelons of the Department of Defense \neven in peacetime now.\n  I think that this, as I said, is a very small payment of what it \nshould be for them. Incidentally, they come under the jurisdiction of \nthe subcommittee that I chair in the Commerce Committee, and my friend \nfrom Arizona serves on the Commerce Committee similarly. This is a \ngreat problem for us because of the fact we cannot today increase the \nfunding for the Coast Guard through the authorization that has been \ngiven to us in the Commerce Committee. This is the one way we can \nassure that the Coast Guard will not decrease its effectiveness in \ndealing with civilian operations because of its overwhelming ongoing \nsemi-military and military operations in peacetime.\n  I also want to say to my friend with regard to the matter of the \nfederally owned educational facilities on military installations, we \nhave over a period of time now fostered a concept of transferring the \neducational facilities on military installations to the local school \ndistricts.\n  We ran into a problem not only in my State but other States where the \nschool districts said they could not take over those and operate them \nbecause they did not meet State standards. So we have over a period of \nyears now funded it. In 1993, 1994, 1995, we funded the upgrade of \nthose federally owned and operated schools so that they would reach the \nlevel that would meet State law. The understanding at the time was they \nwould be transferred to the school districts in the various States, and \nthe main reason is, under their laws they cannot operate in schools on \nproperty owned by somebody else.\n  This is a formality now to carry out agreements that have been in \neffect, in my opinion, for some 3 to 4 years. They are really not \nearmarked, incidentally, I say to my friend from Arizona. We have \nrecognized the priority list established by the Department of Defense, \nand we have funded it according to their priority list. As the schools \nhave been upgraded to meet State standards, they have in fact been \ntransferred. I think this is almost the last of them. I am not sure we \nare totally at the last of them.\n  I think, again, it is within the prerogative of the Appropriations \nCommittee to do exactly that, to pursue a policy to reduce costs to the \nFederal Government. We have pursued that by seeking to transfer these \nschools to \n\n[[Page S 12133]]\nlocal operations. We had to meet the obligations to upgrade them so \nthey would meet State fire and safety codes, and now we have done that. \nSo this says that they should be transferred upon completion of the \nrepairs that we have already financed and we continue to finance in \nthis bill.\n  Similarly, I have to say, Mr. President, if the Senate wants to look \nat the details of the Department of Defense health program, it begins \non page 199 of the report. I am proud of this. I think that we have \nwithin the Department of Defense a series of dedicated people. Again, \nit is peacetime. There is no war ongoing. They have some tremendous \ncapabilities to do research. They are the ones who got us the various \nvaccines over the years starting with malaria, hepatitis. You name it, \nit was the Defense Department's research group that has really been at \nthe cutting edge of research in this country, and that includes AIDS.\n  As early as 1982, we started a fund to try to deal with AIDS. Why, \nMr. President? We found an increasing number of people in the services \nwere contracting AIDS throughout the world, and we had an increasing \nproblem. We had people enlisting and after they were enlisted, they had \nAIDS. We had to have some basic funding for research to determine how \nto deal with that issue.\n  As I said before about breast cancer, we have literally thousands of \nyoung women coming on now into the Department of Defense, and they have \nto have that kind of medical attention. Based upon that medical \nattention, we should have the capability of giving the Department of \nDefense the money to continue research to help to deal with that \ndisease that afflicts so many young women of childbearing age.\n  Those are the people enlisted in the Army, the Navy and the Air \nForce. And the Department has willingly taken on the task of being a \npartner in this type of research. I say I would oppose the Senator's \namendment, if for no other reason than that.\n  I stood here and tried to limit the involvement of our defense funds \nto meet legitimate problems that the Department of Defense is concerned \nwith. But this money is being dedicated, I think, to research that is \nneeded.\n  Go through it. We have disaster management training. There is no \nquestion about it, we need that. We have funds for the support of the \ncomprehensive health care system. We are looking at neurofibromatosis. \nThat is a study that has, I think, the Department's full backing. We \nare developing a regional center for advanced cancer detection.\n  Again, Mr. President, if we are attracting the best of our young \npeople, the people, as Senator Inouye says, who come forward and are \nwilling to place themselves in harm's way, one of the harm's, \nunfortunately, that they get in the way of is different forms of \ndiseases. And we have within our Department of Defense the capability \nto conduct research, not only assisting those individuals who develop \nthese diseases, but using those people to help us better understand the \nway those diseases affect the younger people of America.\n  I cannot think of a thing in that health care section of our report \nthat I would want to change or that I would want to see the Senate \ndelete. There is another item here--I do not know whether the Senator \nfrom Hawaii wants to talk about it--with regard to the contribution of \nthe Kaho'olawe Island restoration fund. That is a fund that we \ncreated--no, that is a contribution. The funds have already been \ncreated to remediate an area of Hawaii that was severely impacted by \nthe use of live ammunition, as I recall. I cannot understand why we \nshould not use Federal money for that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I respond?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have to tell the Senate, I hope the Senate will join \nwith us. I am going to move to table the Senator's amendment as soon as \nhe has had a chance to explain it.\n  If my friend wishes to chat about it, I will be glad to yield to the \nSenator from Hawaii. Mr. President, there are two things I will close \nwith. One is that the Senator from Arizona and I have a disagreement \nover the role of the Appropriations Committee vis-a-vis the Armed \nServices Committee. There is no question about that.\n  But with regard to this amendment, it goes further than that. This \nsays that the Senator from the Armed Services Committee can ask us to \ndelete these items without having sat in the hearings, without having \nsat in the meetings we have had, the subcommittee and full committee \nconsideration, bipartisan review of every item that he has here.\n  I point out that there was no objection in either the subcommittee or \nthe full committee to any one of these items from anyone. I believe \nthey are examples of the kinds of limitations we should put on Federal \nfunds or on those functions that receive Federal funds.\n  Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, if I may respond to the bill that was just \nsubmitted by my dear friend from Arizona.\n  First, on the Kaho'olawe Island restoration. Kaho'olawe is an island \nin the Hawaiian chain. Soon after the election of President Eisenhower, \nthe President felt that the military of the United States required \nconsiderable training and upgrading. The Korean war had indicated that \nour troops were not trained properly and that our Navy was \ninsufficiently supplied.\n  Therefore, he called upon the territory of Hawaii--we were not a \nState at that time--and requested the use of this island. The Governor \nof that island and the legislature consented. The President issued an \nExecutive order that said, when we find that we are no longer in need \nof this island as a target island, we will return it to the people of \nHawaii in a habitable condition. That is what it says, ``habitable \ncondition.''\n  Soon after the island was transferred to the Federal Government for \nuse as set forth in the Executive order, that island was just bombarded \nwith everything from bombs to 18-inch shells, grenades, et cetera. This \nbecame the major training area in the Pacific Ocean, and it continued \nuntil about 5 years ago. All of our Navy pilots, Air Force pilots, Navy \nships, and oftentimes ships from other countries, at our invitation, \nused this island for target purposes. They were not duds, they were \nlive ammunition. So this island is just inundated with unexploded \nordnance.\n  About 5 years ago, the U.S. Government decided that this island was \nnot necessary for target practices. But then they looked over the \nisland and they felt that if we were to return this island to the \npeople of Hawaii in a habitable condition, it would cost possibly a \ncouple billion dollars.\n  And so once again the people of Hawaii said to the Federal \nGovernment, we will set aside certain areas of this island and let us \nclean them up. We realize that to clean the whole island would cost \nbillions of dollars. So this Congress authorized the expenditure of \n$400 million to partially clean the island.\n  Mr. President, it should be noted that all these years from 1953, our \nGovernment used that island and did not pay even $1 a year. No other \nState would have provided land for that purpose for less than market \nvalue. We got no pay. And so now the time comes to return the island, \nand the Senator says the cleanup should not proceed.\n  Mr. President, it should be also noted that this island just happens \nto be the most sacred island for our native Hawaiians. The most \nimportant temple, Heiau, is located on this island. This island also \nwas the focal island for the trips to Tahiti. Long before Columbus ever \nset sail in the Atlantic Ocean, Hawaiians were traveling from Polynesia \nto the Hawaiian Islands, and this island was a focal island. So this is \na very important island.\n  This Congress authorized this money. Granted, the authorization was \nnot initiated by the Armed Services Committee. But this Congress did \nauthorize it.\n  The Senator from Arizona also mentioned the brown tree snake. There \nis $1 million for the eradication of the brown tree snake. I do not see \nit in the bill, but he mentioned that.\n  The brown tree snake was first discovered on the Solomon islands. \nSoon after World War II--and this is in the record--a military cargo \nship, because it was not appropriately cleaned up, carried a few brown \ntree snakes when it landed on the island of Guam. The brown tree snake \njust flourished to the point where six species of birds have been wiped \nout there. They are no longer in existence because these snakes love \nbirds. They eat eggs and eat birds. \n\n[[Page S 12134]]\n\n  Furthermore, as a result of this colony of brown tree snakes on Guam, \nthe people of Guam experienced brownouts almost every night. These \nsnakes like these electrical towers. There are brownouts all the time.\n  Obviously, the people of Hawaii fear the brown tree snake, and we \nhave found that the few brown tree snakes that have been located on \nHawaii have come through the military, through the aircraft. We \nrecently found one in Scofield barracks.\n  Mr. President, we pride ourselves in being the home for many of the \nexotic birds. The few that remain on this globe are found in Hawaii. If \nthis brown tree snake ever found a home there, then the endangered \nspecies program we have would have to be set aside because they will \njust wipe our birds out.\n  Mr. President, there is $1 million to the military, and they want \nthis so that they can set up a program to make certain that these \nsnakes do not travel from Guam to Hawaii.\n  The other measure that my friend from Arizona mentioned, which is not \nhere, is the Pacific missile range facility. This program was requested \nby the Navy. The title, the name and designation of this facility is \nmisleading. It says ``missile range.'' The major purpose of this \nfacility is a submarine training and target facility. Up until \nrecently, it was a highly classified activity. You do not see much of \nit because it is under water.\n  All of our training facilities to date are deep-water facilities. The \nPacific missile range is deep water, but it is also shallow water. It \nis the only shallow-water testing and targeting facility in the United \nStates.\n  In today's possible warfare, we must excel in the skill of fighting \nin shallow waters. This is what it is.\n  It is true, it was not authorized by the Armed Services Committee, \nbut it was requested by the military, and we believe that request was \njustified.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, on the issue of the Kaho'olawe cleanup, \nlet us make it clear that we want it cleaned up. But the fact is, there \nis right now $116 million already in the account to clean up this \nisland. And by the way, for some reasons that are not clear to me, 10 \npercent of everything appropriated goes to the State of Hawaii, but \nthat is not the initial point here.\n  Right now, there is $50 million remaining available in Navy \nenvironmental cleanup accounts, another $66.75 million remaining in the \ntrust fund, more than sufficient to proceed with 1996 planned efforts. \nThe Navy expects to spend $26 million during 1996 for cleanup \nactivities. That would leave approximately $90-some million left in the \naccount.\n  The reason why I say it is not necessary at this time, not that we do \nnot want the island cleaned up, but there are many other areas in \nAmerica that need to be cleaned up as well. I do not know how many \nSuperfund sites there are in America or how many bases, including one \nin my own State, that still needs to have funding to be cleaned up.\n  As far as the Eau Claire Ordnance Works is concerned, in 1988, the \nArmy entered into an agreement with this company, NPI, concerning the \nfunding and the cleanup of the Eau Claire site. The Army agreed to \nrequest authorization for $5 million for site-related environmental \nrestoration costs incurred by NPI or NDC after January 1, 1984, for \npast production-related activities. Although the agreement provided for \nArmy funding of cleanup costs, it also specifically denied any \nacknowledgment of liability or fault with respect to any matter arising \nout of or relating to the site. These two aspects of the agreement \ncause the document to be contradictory on its face.\n  According to the Army, the fundamental premise of the 1988 agreement \nto request environmental restoration funding was that the Eau Claire \nfacility would ``continue to be an integral part of the Army's \nmobilization base.'' It is the Army's position that further funding \nrequests were contingent upon the continued mobilization status of the \nEau Claire site. NDC or NPI could terminate that status at will. The \nArmy maintains that with no reciprocal obligation to continue \nparticipating as part of the Army's mobilization base, it would be \ndifficult for NDC to argue that the Army agreed to incur an obligation \nto continue to request additional funding regardless of NDC/NPI \nmobilization status.\n  In 1988, $5 million was appropriated but not authorized. Most of the \noriginal appropriation was expended for studies and an alternative \nwater system for a nearby town. Pursuant to the 1988 agreement, funding \nin excess of the $5 million was expressly conditioned on congressional \nauthorization.\n  In 1992, the Army determined that the Eau Claire facility was no \nlonger a critical national defense need. Then in 1993, $7 million was \nappropriated but not authorized. The Army unsuccessfully challenged \nthis earmark. The $7 million was expended for studies, combined water \nsystem installation, bottled water and groundwater treatment.\n  In 1995, $2.3 million was earmarked for environmental restoration of \nthe Eau Claire site in the Department of Defense appropriations \nconference report. There was no authorization for this purpose. \nAccording to the Army general counsel's office, that conference report \nearmark does not have the force of law. The Army comptroller has not \nreleased the money.\n  The Army believes that it has no liability for contamination of the \nEau Claire site under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, \nCompensation and Liability Act, known as CERCLA. The Eau Claire \nfacility is a formerly used defense site owned by the Government from \n1942 to 1948. The Army Corps of Engineers has completed a PRP study \nconcluding that there is no evidence related to disposal of hazardous \nsubstances at the site during the period the Government owned the \nproperty. According to Army general counsel, the Army did not exercise \nthe degree of site control from 1978 to 1992 such as to warrant \nconcluding that it was a PRP during that period.\n  To date, the Army has expended about $12 million for Eau Claire site \nremediation. NPI has requested another $15 million for environmental \nremediation of Eau Claire, citing the 1988 agreement as the legal basis \nfor such funding.\n  The Army signed the 1988 agreement that established an obligation to \nrequest Eau Claire site remediation funding in the amount of $5 million \ninitially, and to request additional authorizations.\n  The Army did not clearly identify the underlying premise of its \nagreement as a condition precedent to additional requests for \nauthorization for remediation funding.\n  The Army's expressed willingness to request funding authorization for \nsite remediation suggests that the Army has historically acknowledged \nsome level of liability but now wishes to alter that position.\n  The 1988 agreement also denied liability or default with respect to \nany matter arising out of or relating to the Eau Claire site.\n  The sub rosa purpose for the 1988 agreement was to keep NPI \nfinancially afloat so that it could maintain its mobilization status on \nbehalf of the Army.\n  The Army's PRP study indicated that the Army had no CERCLA liability \nwith the Eau Claire site.\n  To continue to compel the Army to fund the Eau Claire site for \nremediation simply based on a contractual relationship that it shared \nwith NPI, sets a very bad precedent for the Department of Defense.\n  The factual basis for this claim is ripe for litigation, not \nlegislation.\n  What would be most beneficial in this situation is to encourage the \nparties to work out their differences as they agreed to do in the \ncontext of the 1988 agreement. I might add that the Army opposes \nearmarking funds for this site remediation.\n  Mr. President, I do not know if the $20 million to transfer federally \nowned educational facilities on military installations to local \neducation agencies is good or bad. It has never been brought up to the \nauthorizing committee.\n  As far as the Coast Guard to draw $300 million from DBOF, if they are \nfor contingency funds for Haiti and others, I suggest they come out of \nfunds which are for ongoing contingencies, and their operations would \nbe part and parcel for that.\n  The Senator from Alaska is right that we do not agree on the \nrespective roles of the appropriations and authorization committees, \nand I am sure that \n\n[[Page S 12135]]\nwe will continue to have that sometimes intense but always respectful \ndifference of opinion. But I say to my friend from Alaska, his \nauthority to limit expenditures is something that I see exercised in \nthe breech and the exercising of his authority to increase spending is \nsomething that I see exercised with great frequency. Therein lies much \nof our difference of opinion.\n  Mr. President, I want to say that I appreciate enormously the \ndedicated effort that the Senator from Alaska has made for many, many, \nmany years, long before I was a Member of this body, to ensure that we \nhad an adequate and strong national defense.\n And my sentiments are the same for the Senator from Hawaii and his \ndedicated efforts. I know that the Senator from Alaska and the Senator \nfrom Hawaii know I will continue my efforts to avoid earmarking and \nunauthorized expenditures of funds. I will also admit to the Senator \nfrom Alaska that there are bound to be certain gray areas in which \nthere is an open and honest difference of opinion as to what needs to \nbe authorized and what needs to be appropriated.\n\n  So I thank my colleague from Alaska for his indulgence on this issue. \nI am prepared to accept a voice vote on this amendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I simply want to point out, as the \nmanagers have already so capably done, that these provisions are \nincluded after a review by the committee and a decision by the \ncommittee that the allocations of the funds were justified. I suggested \nthat we approve the provision relating to the Eau Claire, WI, site \nwhere environmental remediation is obviously needed, and has been \nagreed to by the Army in a previous written agreement that goes back to \n1988.\n  The fact is that that agreement has not been kept on the part of the \nU.S. Army. So the funds are available in this bill for that purpose, \nand the committee report spells out that they are, much like the \ncommittee report did in 1993, where it concludes with this language: \n``The Department of the Army has not fulfilled its commitments under \nthis agreement.'' The Department is encouraged, and the funds are made \navailable, to complete the obligation and keep its part of this \nbargain. It is a difference of agreement.\n  I urge the Senate to go along with the recommendations of the \nmanagers of this legislation.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask for a vote on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2375) was rejected.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Is there a possibility that we can limit the time on \nthis amendment?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would be agreeable to a time limit. I know there are \nlikely to be people who will want to speak on this. On the other hand, \nwe have debated missile defense issues generally on the Defense \nauthorization bill in recent days for some 8 or 9 hours.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I will serve notice to the Senate that \nwhen the Senator completes his remarks I will move to table the \namendment.\n  This has been debated on the Armed Services Committee bill, and it is \npart of an item that is in conference now. I hope the Senator will \nunderstand that we want to move this bill along. It is a matter that \nwas debated at length on the other bill.\n  It is my intention to move to table at the completion of the \nSenator's remarks.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am more than amenable to having a short time limit, but \nI would like an up-or-down vote on the amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will be happy to have an up-or-down vote if we have a \ntime agreement.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would be happy to do that. I understand we want to try \nto avoid recorded votes between 1 and 2.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We can postpone the time. Others are standing in line.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would be amenable to a 1-hour time agreement equally \ndivided.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I believe that is agreeable. With the vote to take place \nat a time to be mutually agreed upon following completion?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes. That would include no second-degree amendments.\n  Mr. STEVENS. No second-degree amendments.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, can I ask the Senator from Alaska if he \nwould add to that one-half hour for the amendment that I will offer \nafter the Senator from North Dakota on my side, and one-half hour in \nopposition, also without no second-degree and with an up-or-down vote? \nIt would be the amendment I just gave the Senator.\n  Mr. STEVENS. With regard to the amendment of the Senator from New \nMexico, there would be no second-degree amendments prior to the motion \nto table. If the Senator's amendment is not tabled, it would be subject \nto a second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I see very little percentage in me \nagreeing to a time limit under those circumstances.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will make the same offer. I intend to move to table \nany amendment that was debated on the Armed Services Committee bill.\n  Mr. President, has the time agreement been entered into on the \namendment of the Senator from North Dakota?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No unanimous-consent request has been made.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 1 \nhour, equally divided, with no amendments in the second degree, and we \nwill have an up-or-down vote at a time to be agreed upon following the \nexpiration of the hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2377\n\n   (Purpose: To reduce the amount authorized to be appropriated for \n                       national missile defense.)\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself, \n     Mr. Bradley, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. Feingold, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2377.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 29, beginning on line 12, strike out \n     ``$9,196,784,000, to remain available for obligation until \n     September 30, 1997.'', and insert in lieu thereof \n     ``$8,896,784,000, to remain available for obligation until \n     September 30, 1997: Provided, That, of the amount \n     appropriated under this heading, not more than $357,900,000 \n     shall be available for national missile defense.''.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have agreed to a time agreement even \nthough this is an enormously important issue, because we have spent \nmany, many hours debating the general issue in recent days on the \nDefense authorization bill. My amendment would eliminate the $300 \nmillion additional funding that was added in the appropriations bill \nfor something called national missile defense. It was added to the \nDefense authorization bill, and now added to the appropriations bill.\n  We already had a debate on this on the authorization bill, and I lost \nby three votes in stripping out the $300 million extra that was written \ninto the bill that the Secretary did not ask for. This is not money the \nSecretary said we need, that he wanted. This is $300 million extra that \nwas put in the Defense authorization bill, and now put in the Defense \nappropriations bill, for a national missile defense program.\n  Let me try to describe what all of this means. We can go back to the \nmid to early 1980's and President Reagan's announcement one evening at \na press conference of his idea to build an astrodome over America--star \nwars, it was called. If you kind of put an astrodome over our country \nin the form of star wars defense, you create a shield against incoming \nintercontinental ballistic missiles from the Soviet Union. \n\n[[Page S 12136]]\nIt was a very expensive proposition, but at a time when we were in the \nmiddle of the cold war with the Soviet Union, the Reagan administration \npushed very hard to initiate a star wars program, to create a shield \nover this country that incoming missiles could not penetrate because \nthey would be shot down.\n  A lot has happened since 1983. The Soviet Union no longer exists. It \nis a name consigned to the ash bin of history. The Soviet Union is \ngone. Since 1983, we have entered into arms agreements with the Soviet \nUnion that result now in having missiles cut up and destroyed in the \nSoviet Union that previously were sitting in silos with nuclear \nwarheads aimed at American targets. Those missiles are now being taken \nout of the silos, dismantled, and destroyed under our arms agreement, \ninitially made with the Soviet Union, and now continuing to be carried \nout with Russia and the Republics.\n  But one thing has not changed in the intervening period, and that is \nthe appetite for folks who are invested in an arms program to continue \nto build that program.\n  The Soviet Union is gone. The cold war is over. We are now allies \nwith Russia in a whole range of areas. We just had our astronauts up in \nspace with the Russians, cavorting around the space lab.\n  The Russians are now taking their missiles out of their silos and \ncutting them up and destroying them, and the American taxpayers are \nhelping pay for that destruction because it is part of arms control and \nit makes a lot of sense.\n  It makes a lot more sense to pay for the destruction of missiles that \nwere previously aimed at the United States than for us to build a new \nweapons program with all of the tens of billions of dollars that costs.\n  One thing has not changed; that is the appetite to build the programs \nthat were started. So we come to 1995 and something called national \nmissile defense, ergo, star wars. New title, new description. But look \non page 186 of the report before the Senate on the defense \nappropriations bill:\n\n       National Missile Defense. The committee has provided $670.6 \n     million, an increase of $300 million over the budget request. \n     The committee has taken this action to accelerate the \n     development of a national missile defense system. The \n     committee endorses the realignment and augmentation of \n     funding for BMDO and endorses the realignment and funding for \n     1996. The committee shares the commitment articulated in the \n     report on the defense authorization bill that adequate \n     resources should be made available to facilitate the \n     deployment of an operational national missile defense system \n     at the earliest possible time that can fully protect all 50 \n     States.\n\n  Now, what does this mean? What this means is the Secretary of \nDefense, in asking Congress for the money he thinks is necessary for \nthe security of this country, asked for $371 million to continue to do \nresearch and development on a national missile defense program in the \nevent that in the ensuing years, a threat develops that would persuade \nthe Department of Defense authorities that they might want to deploy a \nnational missile defense system.\n  What did the Congress do? Well, those who were beating their chests \nday after day earlier this year about the Federal budget deficit, the \nfact that this country is up to its neck in debt and has enormous \nyearly budget deficits, have changed their tune. Those same folks who \nwere bellowing and crowing and beating their chests about the budget \ndeficit said, ``You know, what we would like to do is to add $300 \nmillion more to this account that the Secretary says he does not want \nand does not need.''\n  In fact, this is just a small part of it. They actually said, in this \nentire bill, we will add $7 billion that the Secretary did not ask for. \nWe will buy trucks, ships, and planes that the Secretary of Defense did \nnot ask for, because we think it is in the national interest. Seven \nbillion dollars was added in the authorization bill, and most of it is \nin the appropriations bill, that the Secretary of Defense said he does \nnot want and does not need.\n  Included in that $7 billion is $300 million for star wars. Some will \nobject and say this is not star wars. Well, read it.\n  This bill says the following: First of all, we ought to deploy a new \nnational missile defense system by 1999. That is 4 short years from \nnow. Second, it ought to be a multiple-site system; that, by \ndefinition, means we want to break the ABM Treaty.\n  The ABM Treaty is the foundation for the arms control agreement that \nnow results today in Russia in the destruction of missiles that used to \nbe aimed at us. They are torn up, cut apart, and destroyed.\n  Those arms treaties result in that. That is progress. That is \nsuccess. I say when you have thousands of missiles and you are \ndestroying rather than building more, that is success.\n  But to deploy a new multisite national missile defense system \nimmediately abrogates the ABM Treaty. Then this bill says that as a \ncomponent part of that system, we will have a space-based component. \nWell, putting weapons in space violates the ABM Treaty too. So all of \nthat simply abrogates the ABM Treaty.\n  Some may want to do that, and think the treaty is irrelevant and \nought to be changed. I think it is the foundation that has led us to a \nposition where rather than building new missiles, we are helping to \ndestroy old ones that used to be aimed at us.\n  I suppose of all the folks in this Chamber who ought to be supporting \nthis, it ought to be me. One of the likeliest sites for national \nmissile defense is northeastern North Dakota. Most everybody says that \nwould be one of the first sites because that is where the only ABM \nsystem was ever built.\n  In the early 1970's, this country built an antiballistic missile \nsystem, and spent billions of dollars doing it. Within 30 days of it \nbeing declared operational, it was mothballed. Within 30 days of this \nantiballistic missile system being declared ready and operational it \nwas closed and mothballed.\n  The ABM Treaty provides if we have another ABM site, it shall be in \nthat same State. If anybody in this Chamber probably would be expected \nto support this because it is likely in part to be built in North \nDakota, I suppose it would be me. But I do not support it because I do \nnot think this country ought to spend money it does not have on things \nit does not need.\n  That is the case with star wars. It is out of step. It is out of \ntime. It makes no sense in the current circumstances to initiate the \ndevelopment of a new $48 billion program, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office statistics--$300 million this year, yes, \nbut it would cost an estimated $48 billion in total.\n  Now, what is the threat and what is the administration's policy? \nWell, let me read a statement of the administration's policy. These are \nthe folks who run the Defense Department. ``The bill would direct the \ndevelopment for deployment by 2003,'' and the bill also says the \ninitial deployment in 1999, ``of a multiple-site system for national \nmissile defense that, if deployed, would be a clear violation of the \nABM Treaty. The bill would severely strain U.S./Russian relations and \nwould threaten continued Russian implementation of the START I treaty \nand further Russian consideration of the START II treaty.''\n  Incidentally, they are involved in the issue of consideration of \nratifying the START II treaty at this point. This could not come at a \nworse time and could not be, in my judgment, a worse policy. ``These \ntwo treaties will eliminate strategic launchers carrying two-thirds of \nthe nuclear warheads that confronted the Nation during the cold war.''\n  We are saying that the treaty which was the foundation for all this \narms control progress is a treaty we now essentially ought to violate.\n  Now let me read a statement from Secretary Perry, the Secretary of \nDefense:\n\n       The bill's provisions would add nothing to DOD's ability to \n     pursue our missile defense programs and would needlessly \n     cause us to incur excess costs and serious security risks.\n\n  I do not know how you can say it more clear than that. You have a \nSecretary of Defense that says you do this and you cause this country \nadditional security risks. You have a Secretary of Defense that says he \ndoes not want this $300 million, and a bunch of folks that call \nthemselves conservatives saying not only do we not care if you do not \nwant it, we insist we give it to you and you spend it. This makes no \nsense to me. \n\n[[Page S 12137]]\n\n  Now, some will stand up in this Chamber and say, ``You do not \nunderstand anything about defense. You oppose all these things.'' I \nsupport a strong defense. I supported many weapons programs which I \nthink are necessary for the country. I have also been willing to stand \nup and confront some programs that I think are complete total \nboondoggles, this among them.\n  Some will say, well, you do not understand; maybe it is not Russia, \nmaybe it is not the cold war, but it is a new threat, they tell us. In \nfact, several stood on the floor of the Senate recently in the last \nweek and said: It is a new threat; you do not understand. It is Iraq, \nit is Saddam Hussein, it is the country of Iran, it is Muammar Qadhafi \nand Libya; it is North Korea, in fact. That is what they say. They \nbring charts out and they show big pictures of missiles that North \nKorea is developing.\n  Well, all the credible experts in intelligence tell us there is no \ncredible threat to this country in the next decade from a terrorist \nnation delivering a nuclear warhead with an intercontinental ballistic \nmissile. It is far more likely that a terrorist nation, if it managed \nto get sufficient materials with which to produce a nuclear bomb, would \nthreaten this country with a suitcase bomb, or with a bomb in the trunk \nof a rusty old car parked at a dock in New York City; or perhaps with a \nsmall glass vial of deadly biological agents smuggled into this \ncountry.\n  But that, unfortunately, does not augur for a defense mechanism that \nwould allow one to build a $48 billion program with jobs all over the \ncountry to construct a new missile program and relight the torch of the \narms race at exactly the time we have started to make progress, to see \nthe destruction of missiles that used to be aimed at us.\n  No, it is hard to dim the appetite in these Chambers for weapons \nprograms. It does not matter what year it is. You just change the \nargument. It does not matter that the Soviet Union does not exist; just \ndebate Korea. Just say Korea has some missiles now.\n  Listen to some defense experts; in fact, maybe listen to the folks \nback home. Listen to the taxpayers. Do you want to talk about a threat \nto this country? Maybe the threat to this country ought to be best \ndescribed as debt and deficits, a $5 trillion debt and nearly $200 \nbillion in annual deficits.\n  In a circumstance where when we debate that, the very folks who now \ntell us that they want to stuff the Pentagon's pockets with $300 \nmillion this year that the Pentagon does not want, and up to $48 \nbillion in the future, to build a star wars system, the very same \npeople who say that they are the warriors in confronting the budget \ndeficit become wallflowers when the defense budget comes to the floor \nof the Senate\n because they are the ones who are the wild-eyed, reckless spenders. \nThey are the ones who say it does not matter to us that we do not need \nit, it does not matter to us that nobody asked for it. We insist, in \nfact we demand that we build it and spend it.\n\n  We have already had a vote on this issue: $300 million for early \ndevelopment, 1999, a new star wars national missile defense program. We \nalready had a vote on it. I lost, 51 to 48. That was in the defense \nauthorization bill.\n  This is the appropriations bill. Someone might argue, ``Well I voted \nto authorize it but I really did not vote to spend the money.'' Here is \nwhere we are going to decide who is willing to vote to spend the money \non something we do not need. This is when we find out who is really the \nsteward of the taxpayers' dollar.\n  As I finish this discussion I cannot help but also point out there is \na tendency in this Chamber--and it is probably a tendency that has been \naround for a long, long while--to say if you do not support this sort \nof thing you do not support a strong defense. In fact, someone stood up \non the other side of the aisle last week and said: You know, what the \nfolks who do not want to build the star wars system are saying is let \nus protect everyone else but America. Let us not protect America.\n  What a bunch of babble. What a lot of babble coming from folks who \ntalk that way. We spend $260 to $300 billion on defense in this \ncountry. We build bombers and fighters and tanks and trucks and we \nbuild weapons, sophisticated and unsophisticated. The fact is, we spend \nso much more than any other country in the world on defense that you \nare embarrassed to see the ratio. You can add up all the rest of the \nexpenses by all of our allies and we still spend more than all of them \nby far.\n  So for anybody to suggest if you do not swallow this minnow, if you \nare not willing to build this project, start a new star wars and \nabrogate the ABM Treaty, somehow you do not care about this country--I \nsay that is the kind of debate that largely renders thoughtfulness \nirrelevant in this Chamber.\n  I do not mind if somebody stands up and prints a cardboard cutout of \nsome hyperinflated missile threat from North Korea. If they really want \nto do that, they have every right to do that. But it does not comport \nwith what the intelligence experts say.\n  I do not mind if somebody says, you know, it is true we cannot afford \nto have poor kids at school have an entitlement to a hot lunch because \nwe do not have the money; it is true we cannot afford to fully fund \nMedicare for the elderly because we do not have the money; and it is \ntrue we have to make it more difficult for kids to go to college and \nfor their parents to pay for it because we do not have the money for \nstudent financial aid--that is all true, but then they say it is not \ntrue we are short of funds when it comes to building star wars.\n  I respect the debate about priorities. Those folks who believe that, \nthat this is wrong and that is right, that investment in human \npotential is not what helps our country but investment in the Star Wars \nprogram when the Soviet Union is gone, they think that is the right \npriority--I respect that difference. But I have minimum high regard for \nthose who stand on the floor and say those of us who would oppose a new \nStar Wars program that will cost up to $48 billion somehow do not want \nto protect America. The best way to protect America, in my judgment, is \nto not spend money we do not have on something we do not need; and not \nabrogate the ABM Treaty. This treaty is a vital part of arms control, \nand it is arms control agreements that have put us where we are now \nwith now, helping to destroy missiles that were previously aimed at us.\n  I intend to ask for a record vote. I want people to register how they \nfeel about spending this extra $300 million, and consigning us to spend \nan extra $48 billion, reignite the arms race and abrogate the ABM \nTreaty with this kind of foolishness.\n  With that, Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, at the outset, I believe the record should \nshow that a week ago, when this amendment was proposed to the \nauthorization bill, I did support with some reluctance this amendment. \nToday I stand before my colleagues as one of the managers of the \nappropriations measure. In the past week, several things have happened \nwhich places this amendment in a different light.\n  First, this measure has been voted upon after an 8-hour debate and \nthe vote was close, 51 to 48. Second, the underlying proposition, which \nis the possible abrogation of the ABM Treaty, is now very seriously \nnegotiated by our leadership, Mr. Dole and Mr. Daschle, by members of \nthe State and Defense Departments, and by the senior members of the \nArmed Services Committee. At this moment, Mr. Warner, Mr. Cohen, Mr. \nNunn, and Mr. Levin are very seriously discussing this matter.\n  Many of us have been assured that this negotiation process is moving \nalong in a very fruitful fashion; that we can anticipate some sort of \nresolution. And therefore it is with that understanding that the \nappropriating committee came forward and presented our bill. There is \nan understanding that, if a resolution is reached, we would be set \naside and the authorizers will come into the picture.\n  Third, this $300 million is for research and development. The amount \nof $48 billion has been mentioned. The $48 billion is a possibility in \nthe future, if--and I say if--this country should decide to establish \nan antiballistic missile system, setting up bases all over \n\n[[Page S 12138]]\nthe United States. That decision has not been made and I believe that \nat this stage it is very unlikely that a decision of that nature would \nbe adopted by this Government, or by this Congress. Therefore, I hope \nmy colleagues here will be a bit more patient and wait until the \nnegotiators have concluded their meetings, wait until our Defense and \nState Department officials have expressed their views, and wait until \nthe authorization measure is taken up in the appropriate fashion and \nvotes are taken to make their final decision.\n  Therefore, I must advise my colleagues that on this vote I will be \nvoting with my chairman which would be against the proposition.\n  Mr. President, how much time have I consumed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 4 minutes and 15 \nseconds.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me make a couple of additional \ncomments.\n  There is no one for whom I have higher regard in the Chamber than the \nSenator from Hawaii. I regret that he will not be able to vote for the \namendment. But I want to make a couple of additional points.\n  There are negotiations going on right at the moment. I have been at a \nnumber of meetings today on this subject. Frankly, I doubt very much \nwhether those negotiations are going to be able to bridge the gap. Some \nof us essentially want a multiple-site missile program, with a space-\nbased component, both of which will violate the ABM Treaty. Others of \nus believe this is a gold-plated boondoggle, it wastes the taxpayers' \nmoney, and it will commit us to spending $48 billion for a national \nmissile defense system that probably does not work and that we \ncertainly do not need.\n  But I point out that the $300 million that is in this bill is $300 \nmillion specifically in the authorization bill designed to lead to \ndeployment. It is not as innocent as just research. If it were, I maybe \nwould not be on the floor in quite this manner. But it is designed to \nlead to deployment of this system. That is the dilemma.\n  I fully understand the appropriators who bring this to the floor \ngenerally would support what they have written in the appropriations \nbill. But I want to make one final point.\n  The fact that something has been authorized does not necessarily mean \nthat it must be appropriated. Any number of things have been authorized \nby Congress. But then, any number of times, we decided subsequently \nthat maybe we could do that but when you looked at all the priorities \nwe did not have the money and we were not going to fund it. The \ndecision here is, are we going to fund it? Are we going to pay for it?\n  I ask my colleagues, all of those who believe that we ought to deploy \na new star wars program, where are you going to get the money? Where \ndoes the money come from? What are you going to cut to fund it? Which \ntaxes are you going to raise to pay for it? Those are a series of \nquestions that ought to be answered if we commit ourselves to spending \nthis kind of money on a project that I think this country does not \nneed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  Mr. STEVENS. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 25 minutes and 40 seconds. The \nSenator from North Dakota as 8 minutes and 53 seconds.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Hawaii has \nalready spoken. I shall not repeat what he said. I say to the Senate, \nwhen are we going to decide whether this bill is going to pass? This \namendment was debated before, as the Senator from Hawaii has indicated. \nIt was a matter within the jurisdiction of the Armed Services \nCommittee, not our committee. There are times when we debate something \nin that jurisdiction, but this is not one of the times.\n  I just say simply to the Senate that, if this amendment is not \ntabled, as far as I am concerned I am going to ask the majority leader \nto pull the bill down. I see no reason for us to debate once again hour \nafter hour after hour comments that were considered by the Senate in \nconnection with the Armed Services Committee.\n  The Senator has every right to offer this amendment. Unfortunately, I \nfeel I have the duty to move to table it. We had an agreement to vote \nup or down. That is even worse really. But it is worth the price. We \nmust have the support of the Senate to defeat the amendment. I am \nprepared to yield back my time if the Senator is.\n  We have an understanding, I might say to the leader, that we will not \nvote before 2 o'clock. But we will have other amendments that are ready \nto go. So we will proceed with other amendments right away.\n  The Senator has some additional time, Mr. President. It is I hope \ngoing to be a precedent for the Senate that we determine not only now \nbut for future considerations of this bill that if there are amendments \nconsidered in connection with the Armed Services Committee bill it will \nnot be considered on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair might advise the Senator that there \nis a vote scheduled on this but the Chair understands there has not \nbeen an agreement yet as to what time that will be.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would say to the majority leader and the \nmanagers of the bill that I have no intention of delaying. That is why \nI agreed to a rather short time period. I would have no objection to \nsetting a time for the vote at 2 o'clock. I would have no objection to \nmoving to other amendments. There are some who may wish to use the \nremaining time, if we could simply provide the remaining 8 or 9 minutes \nif there is someone between now and 2 o'clock who wants to come to \nclaim that on this side of the issue. I would have no objection to \ndoing it. I have no objection to getting to a vote here at a time \nspecific.\n  Mr. STEVENS. If the Senator will yield for an inquiry. What is the \ntime situation now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 3\\1/2\\ minutes and \nthe Senator from North Dakota has 8 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we each \nretain 8 minutes and let us put this amendment aside.\n  Mr. DORGAN. No objection. I would ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I asked for that because I do not know if someone on \nthis side might wish to answer the Senator. I do not think so. Whenever \nthe leader wishes to call this back up, there is a possibility of 16 \nminutes definitely before the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Each side will retain 8 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator from New Mexico [Mr. \nBingaman] has an amendment that he indicated he wishes to offer. We are \nprepared for that, and the Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords] is here \nwith an amendment. There are several amendments coming.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. The Senator from North Dakota indicated to me that he would \nbe willing to vote at 2 o'clock unless you want to stack the next \namendment and his at the same time. That would save some time, too.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We are happy to hold this amendment whenever it is, at \nthe leader's convenience.\n  Mr. DOLE. I would suggest that, if we are going to have another \namendment by Senator Bingaman which might require a rollcall, we have \ntwo at once.\n  Let me indicate to my colleagues who are not here--the managers are \nhere and they are prepared to discuss amendments--that it looks as \nthough now this will be the last bill to come up before we go home. So \nwhen it is over, it is over, if we get a very tight time agreement on \nthe DOD authorization bill. If we cannot get that time agreement, we \nwill be back to DOD. But if we get a very tight time agreement, which \nwould not take more than 4 or 5 hours when we come back, we would do \nthat on Tuesday the 5th and then go to welfare reform.\n  So for those people who have come to me and left notes under the door \nsaying ``Let's get out of here,'' and all of \n\n[[Page S 12139]]\nthese things, here is their opportunity to come to the floor and offer \ntheir amendments and enter into a very short time agreement. It will \nspeed up the process and make the managers very happy, and many others \nwill be pleased, I might add.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Byrd pertaining to the submission of Senate \nResolution 162 are located in today's Record under ``Submission of \nConcurrent and Senate Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Are we in a period \nof morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No.\n  Mr. BURNS. I ask unanimous consent that I may speak as if in morning \nbusiness for such time as to introduce several bills.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Burns pertaining to the introduction of \nlegislation are located in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Chair, and yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Montana.\n                  marine corps mps enhancement program\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I wonder if I might engage the \ndistinguished chairman and ranking member of the Defense Subcommittee \nin a brief colloquy.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Certainly, the Senator from New Hampshire may proceed.\n  Mr. SMITH. First of all I want to commend the Senators from Alaska \nand Hawaii for their fine work in formulating this appropriations bill. \nI know that the subcommittee was confronted by some significant fiscal \nchallenges, and I appreciate their outstanding work in balancing \nresources with our military requirements.\n  One issue that I am concerned with, however, is the Marine Corps \nMaritime Preposition Ship [MPS] Enhancement Program. As my colleagues \nknow, the MPS Enhancement Program would add an additional ship to each \nof three Marine Corps preposition squadrons. These ships would be \nloaded with an expeditionary airfield, two M1A1 tank companies, a fleet \nhospital, Navy mobile construction equipment, a command element \npackage, and additional statement. These assets will provide tremendous \nflexibility for crisis response and contingency operations.\n  Last year, under the leadership of the Senators from Alaska and \nHawaii, the committee appropriated $110 million for the first ship in \nthe MPS Enhancement Program. This was an important statement of support \nfor the preposition concept in general, and the Marine Corps program in \nparticular. The Armed Services Committee has sustained the momentum on \nthe MPS Enhancement Program by authorizing $110 million in fiscal year \n1996 for the second ship in the program.\n  In reviewing the legislation before us, I am unclear as to what the \nrecommendation of the committee was with respect to the second MPS \nenhancement ship. I wonder if the Senators from Alaska and Hawaii could \ncomment on this issue.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator from New Hampshire is correct in his review \nof the legislative record on this issue. The Appropriations Committee \ndid fund the first ship last year, and is supportive of the Marine \nCorps MPS Enhancement Program. At the time the committee marked up its \nlegislation for fiscal year 1996, it was unclear whether the Navy was \nmoving forward with the program established in the fiscal year 1995 \nauthorization and appropriations bills. The committee was concerned \nover the lack of noticeable progress in acquiring and converting the \nfirst ship under the program. The committee was also confronted by some \nsignificant funding shortfalls in the shipbuilding and conversion \naccounts.\n  However, the committee did direct that the Secretary of Navy may \nobligate appropriations up to $110 million for the procurement of a \nsecond MPS ship in fiscal year 1996.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Let me assure the Senator from New Hampshire that the \ncommittee did carefully consider this matter. It is the view of Senator \nStevens and myself that the language in our legislation provides \nauthority to move forward with the second ship in the MPS Enhancement \nProgram. I expect this issue will be further explored during \nconference, as well.\n  Mr. SMITH. I thank the distinguished chairman and ranking member for \ntheir comments. I gather from their statements that the Appropriations \nCommittee continues to support the Marine Corps Maritime Pre-position \nShip Enhancement Program, but is concerned over delays by the Navy in \nmoving forward to implement the program established last year in the \nauthorization and appropriations bills. Is it fair to say that if the \nNavy can convince the committee that their program is sound, and that \nthey can demonstrate that they are fully exploring means to reduce \noverall program costs, such as multiple ship contracts, that the \ncommittee would be inclined to support a second ship in fiscal year \n1996?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I think that is an accurate description.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Yes. That is correct.\n  Mr. SMITH. I thank my colleagues for their comments, and fine work on \nthis bill. I look forward to working with them on this important \nprogram.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I would like to discuss with the \ndistinguished chairman of the Senate Appropriations Defense \nSubcommittee a matter of importance to our Army National Guard Forces.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would be pleased to learn of my colleague's thoughts \non this matter.\n  Mr. BOND. Chairman Stevens, this year, as in the past, your \nsubcommittee has demonstrated its continued commitment to insuring the \nArmy National Guard remains adequately supplied with modern and \neffective combat equipment. Currently, the Army Guard is wrestling with \nhow best to modernize its artillery inventory. A key component of this \nmodernization plan is the upgrade of 51 battalions and 7 additional \nbatteries with the M109A6 Paladin system. The initial cost estimates of \nthis modernization effort are prohibitive.\n  I suggest an affordable altnernative--one that is already endorsed by \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee. I suggest that the Army develop an \nupgrade of the M109A5 currently in use by the Army National Guard, \nusing components of the Paladin system. This upgrade would include \ndigital and survivability enhancements which would significantly \nimprove the combat performance of this weapon system. I would encourage \nthe Department of the Army to evaluate this upgrade project and urge \nthe committee to establish an M109A5 upgrade RDT program element with \nfunds from the Paladin line to enable the Army to procure and evaluate \na platoon of four M109A5 upgrade systems for use by the Army National \nGuard.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, my colleague raises an excellent point. I \nunderstand that $3,000,000 would be required by the Army to acquire and \nevaluate an M109A5 upgrade system. I will work in conference to make \nfunds available for this program.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that further proceedings under \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2356, as modified\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would call the attention of the clerk to amendment No. \n2356.

Mr. President, the President of the United States just held \na press conference as it relates to the regulation of tobacco. I will \nmake a few remarks in response to that.\n  The President's announcement today is very disappointing. After weeks \nof attempting to arrive at a solution with the White House, offering \nproposal after proposal, my farmers lost out to the zealots. We had \nagreed to almost everything the White House proposed, with ways to put \nteeth into that agreement. I know that, because I have been attempting \nto negotiate since day one. No one, to my knowledge, was attempting to \nblock the President's position of reducing underage smoking. We were \noffering a fair and enforceable way to get there.\n  Mr. Kessler wanted a scalp on his belt, and the White House was \ndetermined to give it to him. Even Representative Ron Wyden of Oregon, \na strong antitobacco advocate, asked the President to basically agree \nwith our offer. The administration has chosen litigation over \ncompromise, delay over action. The President has chosen a press \nconference instead of a negotiating conference. He has chosen a process \nthat reaches his goals later rather than sooner.\n  I am not only disappointed, Mr. President, but I am hurt. My first \nthought was to be vindictive, use every means I have available to me--\nand there are several--to get back at the White House. But I have \ndecided not to take that course. I will, however, try to seek out \npeople of reason to help work through this problem.\n  I have never been one who thought it wise to appoint a person to your \nadministration from another, especially if he or she was of a different \nparty. Mr. Kessler is a carryover from the Bush administration, and I \nam not sure he is doing this administration any favors.\n  The President said he wants to work to pass legislation that would \naccomplish these goals. I will introduce such a bill when we return in \nSeptember and believe it will be acceptable to the White House. The FDA \nis so far behind now in making important decisions and with the attempt \nto acquire additional work, I believe the people of this country will \nbe ill-served to a much greater degree by this decision.\n  Mr. President, I have five grandchildren. Three of those \ngrandchildren are teenagers. None of my grandchildren smoke, thanks to \ntheir parents, because they have seen to it that they did not.\n  I am not advocating teenage smoking. All I am trying to do here is to \nput into place an agreement with the White House so that we may proceed \nand do those things that are necessary, because today suits have been \nfiled all over the country as it relates to the proposed regulations.\n So now we have confrontation where we could have had an agreement. I \nam very hopeful that when we come back in September, those who are \nreasonable and fair will join with me in accomplishing the purpose of \nreducing or eliminating smoking among teenagers and do it in a very \nfast and appropriate manner.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment reflect that Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Exon, and Mr. Kerrey from \nNebraska are listed as cosponsors of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment does several things. Let \nme describe what those are. It provides over a billion dollars--in \nfact, $1.63 billion--for ongoing military operations which the \nSecretary of Defense stated was his highest priority for funding if we \nwere able to find any additional funds to use this year in addition to \nthe President's requested budget. It does so by striking the \nexpenditures in the bill by $1.3 billion for the LHD-7 amphibious \nassault ship. It also, Mr. President, strikes two other provisions of \nthe bill, which I think need to be stricken, and which I will explain \nas I go forward.\n  Mr. President, prior to the Armed Services Committee markup of the \nbill, we had a breakfast in the Armed Services Committee with Secretary \nPerry and General Shalikashvili to discuss what the needs of the \nDepartment of Defense were. The Secretary at that time told the \ncommittee that he would need $1.188 billion in fiscal year 1996 to fund \nongoing operations in Iraq--on \n\n[[Page S 12141]]\nIraq's borders, that is, and at Guantanamo Bay and in Bosnia. He stated \nthat if these operations were not funded in the authorization and \nappropriations bills that we pass this year, then he would be forced to \ncome back to Congress with a supplemental next year asking for this \nexact amount of money--at least this amount of money. He indicated that \nhe knew for a fact we were going to have to be spending this much in \nthese different areas.\n  Mr. President, this chart, I think, captures the essence of what the \nSecretary has asked for. Under Iraq, we have two ongoing activities \nthere at the present time which are well known to those who follow the \nnews in that part of the world. We have what we call the ``provide \ncomfort'' activity in northern Iraq and the ``southern watch'' activity \nin southern Iraq. The first of those, the Secretary indicated, will \ncost a minimum of $143 million in 1996. The second of those in southern \nIraq will cost a minimum of $504 million in the next fiscal year.\n  So, in addition to Iraq, we have ongoing refugee support at \nGuantanamo. We are all aware of the fact that the military is having to \nexpend funds to deal with the refugee problem in Guantanamo. The figure \nthe Secretary gave us--again, this is a minimum figure as he presented \nit to us--is that the Department of Defense will have to expend $178 \nmillion, minimum, in the next fiscal year to carry through as they were \ndirected by the President.\n  In Bosnia, if we do nothing more than we are presently doing--and \nthere has been criticism on the Senate floor that we are doing too \nlittle--if we do nothing more than we are presently doing, that is, \noffering humanitarian support and the ``deny flight'' activity there, \nthe estimate the Secretary gave us is that we will spend a minimum of \n$363 million next year.\n  Quite frankly, Mr. President, I think these are low figures. The \nSecretary himself indicated he thinks these are low figures. But he \nsays he knows for a fact that we are going to have to spend at least \nthis much on ongoing operations. These are not contingencies; these are \nnot things which might or might not happen; these are ongoing. It is \nnot an emergency that we are responding to here. We know for a fact \nthat these are expenses we are going to have in the next fiscal year.\n  Despite the Secretary's plea to us, Mr. President, the authorization \ncommittee chose to meet only $125 million of the Secretary's request. \nThat is about enough to fund these operations for 37 days and get us \nthrough to the 7th of November. The funding which the Secretary \nproposes for the operations was a minimum, as I indicated. We have \nadded to this bill $7.1 billion above what the Pentagon requested. The \nPentagon's request was $245.8 billion. We added $7.1 billion to that. \nBut in adding all of that money, we have not funded what the Secretary \nsays is his top priority request for additional funding.\n  Last fall, and earlier this year, the issue of near-term readiness of \nour active duty forces was the central issue in the defense debate. I \nheard many Senators coming forward and saying we have to do more about \nreadiness, we have to do better by our troops. President Clinton, at \nSecretary Perry's urging, added funding to the defense budget to \naddress the problem, and both the Armed Services Committee and the \nAppropriations Committee have now essentially endorsed the Pentagon's \noperations and maintenance budgets for the next year. However, because \nof a long history, which I understand began during the Vietnam war--it \ngoes back at least that far--the Pentagon did not include in its \noriginal request the necessary operations and maintenance for these \nongoing operations.\n  So that is what we are trying to correct with this amendment. \nSecretary Perry has promised in all future years to include the minimum \ncost that he can see for ongoing operations in the budget request that \nis sent to the Congress at the first of the year. Funding for new \ncontingencies is not discussed in my amendment. Certainly, I agree with \nthose who will say we do not know what additional costs we might have \nin Bosnia. I would be amazed, Mr. President, if we got through 1996 \nonly spending $363 million in Bosnia. I think most of us would be \namazed. If Saddam Hussein again makes a feint toward Kuwait, obviously, \nwe will need additional expenditures there. If the United States has to \ndeploy ground forces in Bosnia, clearly, that will be a very, very \nmajor expense for which the Secretary would have to come back to \nCongress with a request.\n  But, Mr. President, I think for us to add $7 billion to this bill and \nstill not provide the funds the Secretary and administration have asked \nfor for ongoing operations is really dishonest with the American \npeople, because we know that we are going to have to pay for these \nitems. There is no question about that. We ought to go ahead and pay \nfor them in this bill, and that is what I am trying to get accomplished \nwith this amendment.\n  Now, the offset that I have identified is the LHD-7. This is an \namphibious assault ship which is not in the Navy's budget request until \nthe year 2001. A great deal is being made of the fact that it is in the \nFYDP. For those people who have been around Washington too long, they \nknow what that means. The FYDP is the 5-year defense plan that the \nmilitary gives us each year. They say this is what we want next year \nand, by the way, here are the things we would also like in the 4 years \nafter that. That changes every year. Things that are in the 5th year of \nthe 5-year plan may not be in next year's 5-year plan, or they may. We \njust do not know.\n  But the committee has chosen, in the case of this amphibious assault \nship, the LHD-7, to move the procurement from 2001, where it appears in \nthe long-term plan of the Defense Department, up to next year. I think \nthat is a mistake. I think the question that we need to be addressing \nin this amendment, and we are addressing in this amendment, is: Should \nwe fund the top priority of the Secretary of Defense for next year, or \nshould we begin next year to buy a ship which the Secretary says he may \nin fact want us to buy for the Navy in the year 2001?\n To my mind, it is very clear that we should go ahead and put this \nmoney in these ongoing operations instead.\n\n  There was a discussion we had before the Armed Services Committee \nearlier this year and General Sheehan, who is the commander of USA Com \nsaid in that discussion, ``The force that we have in the inventory \nright now is a quality force.''\n  This was his response to questions being raised by my colleague from \nMississippi, Senator Lott. ``The real issue is what we can afford. This \nNation very frankly has got to manage risk in a better way than we have \nin the past because we just cannot afford to buy everything we need.''\n  Mr. President, that is why my argument with regard to the LHD-7--I am \nnot opposed to buying another amphibious assault ship at some stage if \nthe need is still there, and I understand also the argument which will \nbe made by the proponents of maintaining that funding, that we can save \nmoney if we buy it now.\n  Mr. President, when I first came to Washington I was startled to see \nthat they were having enormous sales out at all of the department \nstores one weekend. On Friday I picked up the paper and it seemed to me \nthat every major department store was having a great big sale that next \nday. I thought how fortunate I am to have discovered or to have been in \ntown on the day when all these department stores are having a sale.\n  Now I have been here 13 years, and I notice every Friday they are \nhaving enormous sales at all the department stores the next day. That \nis exactly what we are faced with here.\n  The contractor on this project has indicated they will give us a \nbetter price if we go ahead and buy this now than in the year 2001. I \nsay that there is no defense contractor that has ever been in business \nthat would not make a similar pledge in order to get business committed \nat an early stage.\n  Mr. President, I need to make another point which I think is obvious \nto most who try to follow defense-related issues. We have in this bill, \nand it is admitted in the committee report accompanying the \nauthorization bill, we have in this bill more defense than we are able \nto afford under the budget resolutions, the budget plan, that has been \nadopted in this Congress for the next 7 years.\n  It is clear to me that we do not have the resources and are not going \nto have \n\n[[Page S 12142]]\nthe resources in these outyears to buy everything that is in these \ndefense bills.\n  I think it is also clear to those who are proponents of this \nadditional LHD-7 amphibious assault ship, that they know that the \ngetting is better now than it is likely to be 2 years from now or 4 \nyears from now, and they want to get this ship authorized and \nappropriated now while there is still money to be had in the defense \nbudgets.\n  Mr. President, as I say, I have no particular dislike for that ship. \nI think it is a question of priorities. I think it is clear that if \nthis amendment is adopted we will do several things: We will fund the \nongoing operations which the Secretary of Defense has said is his top \npriority for any additional funding that we can find.\n  We will save taxpayers over $100 million because, in fact, the \nsavings by not going ahead and purchasing this ship next year, will \nfund all of these ongoing operations and, in addition, save us $111 \nmillion. That is the estimate I have been given. It does those two \nthings.\n  Let me say there is also another very good part of my amendment which \nI want to call to the attention of my colleagues.\n  When looking at this bill which we are now dealing with, there are \nsome provisions in there, Mr. President, which I have great difficulty \nunderstanding, and I propose to strike those provisions out.\n  I call my colleagues' attention to section 8082 on page 81 of the \nbill. It provides ``None of the funds available to the Department of \nDefense shall be available to make progress payments based on costs to \nlarge business concerns at rates lower than 75 percent on contract \nsolicitations issued after enactment of this act.''\n  That is one provision, Mr. President. Let me just focus as to what \nthis language means. I am proposing in my amendment to strike that \nlanguage. I want to tell people why.\n  Essentially, that is saying that the present practice of paying 75 \npercent progress payments of total amount due as progress payments, \nthat is going to be changed in the case of large businesses, large \ndefense contractors, up to 85 percent.\n  In other words, the government is going to start paying money faster \nto large contractors. Not to all of its contractors, but just to those \nthat meet this definition of large business--whatever a large business \nis.\n  Mr. President, I certainly am not arguing that we should not pay our \nbills. We should pay our bills. We should pay them promptly. There is \nno doubt about that.\n  I have great difficulty understanding why we need to be paying 85 \npercent of progress payments instead of 75 percent as we historically \nhave.\n  I have tried to keep some general knowledge about the financial \nperformance of some of our defense contractors. I am pleased to say \nthat they are doing very well, thank you. I have here a chart that is \nentitled ``Financial Performance of Top 20 Department of Defense \nContractors for the First Quarter of 1995.''\n  We can go right down the list. McDonnell Douglas reports profits of \n$189 million; Lockheed Martin, $137 million; General Motors, $2.154 \nbillion; Raytheon, $173 million.\n  Each of these companies is doing quite well in its profit reports and \nits financial performance, Mr. President. I wish them well. I think it \nis important that we have successful, profitable, defense contracts in \nthis country.\n  I cannot understand why we are putting a provision in law here saying \nwe have to pay them 85 percent progress payments rather than 75 percent \nprogress payments.\n  Let me also focus my colleagues' attention on the other provision \nthat I am proposing to strike as part of this amendment. That is \nsection 8083. It says in this provision ``Notwithstanding any other \nprovision of law, the Department of Defense shall execute payment in \nnot more than 24 days after receipt of a proper invoice.''\n  Mr. President, the practice throughout the business community as far \nas I am aware and the practice throughout government as far as I am \naware is to pay your bills within 30 days. I think that is a reasonably \ngood practice. I certainly believe we should pay our bills and do so \npromptly.\n  I cannot understand why we are separating out the Department of \nDefense for a different standard and saying, no, no, when we are \ndealing with defense contractors, we do not want to use the general \nprovision that applies to all other contractual arrangements the \nFederal Government makes. When we are dealing with defense contractors, \ninstead of paying them in 30 days we have to pay them in 24 days. That \nis exactly what this provision calls for.\n  Mr. President, I have proposed to strike the provision in the bill \nthat says we have to go to 85 percent progress payments rather than 75. \nI have also proposed to strike the provision which says that we have to \ngo to 24 days for payment of all of our bills, rather than 30 days.\n  I have proposed to fund all of the ongoing operations, the remainder \nof the ongoing operations that the Secretary of Defense has indicated \nare his top priority for funding and which we all know--every Member of \nthis body--knows that we are going to pay the bill that is being \nidentified here.\n  It is a question of whether we do it in a straightforward above-board \nway in this bill or whether we put it off until next year and come back \nto the American people and say, by the way, we had an emergency, \nunexpected contingency came up and we will have to spend this money.\n  The truth is, we know we have to spend this money. The Secretary of \nDefense has said it is his top priority. Mr. President, I urge my \ncolleagues to support the amendment. I think it is a very \nstraightforward amendment which will return over $100 million to the \ntaxpayers of the country.\n  In addition, we will see to it that our priorities are straight in \nthis legislation.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am about ready to make a motion to \ntable. Is the Senator from Mississippi wishing to talk for a while?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Can I make a couple points?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Can we have an agreement on time? Can I yield to the \nSenator from Mississippi for 5 minutes and then I be recognized again?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am easy to yield, but I want to get to this motion to \ntable soon. Upon the completion of that, if someone else wants time for \na reasonable period, I will be glad to do it.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I did not hear the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request was to yield to the Senator from \nMississippi for 5 minutes and then move to table.\n  Mr. STEVENS. No, to come back to me, that I be recognized at that \npoint.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. If there is a request, I ask I be given 5 minutes to \nsummarize my arguments before we go to a final vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will be more than willing to enter into a time \nagreement on the amount of time between now and the time we would vote. \nI intend to make a motion to table.\n  I see the Senator from Nebraska. Could I inquire how much time these \nSenators wish?\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, 4 minutes is adequate.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I would like 5 minutes to sum up my position before we \ngo to a final vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, could we have it, then, 12 minutes on a \nside? I might want to make a comment myself before I make the motion to \ntable. I ask unanimous consent there be 12 minutes on a side controlled \nby Senator Bingaman on his side and by me on my side. Is that \nagreeable?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Mississippi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, my remarks are going to be directed to \nthe issue of taking the funds that are appropriated in this bill for \nthe LHD-7 and transferring them to the account suggested by the Senator \nfrom New Mexico.\n  The Senate should understand that the funds in this bill for this \nship have \n\n[[Page S 12143]]\nbeen authorized by the bill as reported from the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee. They have also been funded fully in this bill. And the \nreason is simple. It is to try to save about $700 million in the costs \nof our shipbuilding program.\n  Right now, the Navy has a contract, an agreement to construct this \nship. If it does not fund and complete the construction of this ship, \nit is going to cost, according to the Secretary of the Navy in a \nmemorandum he sent to the Secretary of Defense the other day, the sum \nof $415 million in constant-year dollars.\n  This is a cost-effective provision in this bill. According to Admiral \nBoorda, the Chief of Naval Operations; General Mundy, then Commandant \nof the Marine Corps when he testified before our committee; the \nSecretary of Defense; the Secretary of the Navy--this is a ship the \nNavy wants, the Navy needs, in order to fill out the 12 amphibious \nbattle groups that rely upon this ship as its centerpiece.\n  This is the amphibious ready group that is called upon in case of \nserious problems that may break out anywhere in the world. They are the \nones that are called on to provide the quick--quick response.\n  Senators will remember, last May, for example, it was the U.S.S. \nKearsarge, LHD-4, that provided the force that launched the mission to \nrescue Capt. Scott O'Grady after his F-16 had been shot down over \nBosnia.\n  In Haiti, last August there was the U.S.S. Inchon that led an \namphibious ready group to that area just a matter of a couple of weeks, \n2 weeks, after coming back from spending 6 months off Bosnia and then \nSomalia. It was an amphibious ready group that stood off the coast of \nSomalia, that guaranteed the safe withdrawal of U.N. forces from \nSomalia.\n  There is no doubt about it, according to the testimony from senior \nmilitary and Navy officials, the LHD-7 is an essential part of our \nfleet, and it ought to be constructed as soon as possible. The \nadditional funds that are provided in this bill are sufficient to fund \nthe construction of this ship. The budget did not request it for this \nyear because of the fact that the budget simply did not have the funds \nthat were then provided in the budget resolution that passed the \nCongress, that was approved by the Congress.\n  So it makes sense to use these funds. It saves the Government \nsubstantial sums. The ship is needed, according to everybody's \ntestimony, to sustain the ability of our country to provide the forward \npresence and the war-fighting capability that we need.\n  I urge the Senate to reject this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na memorandum for the Secretary of Defense from John Dalton, dated \nAugust 2, 1995.\n  There being no objection, the memorandum was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    The Secretary of the Navy,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 2, 1995.\n     Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense.\n     Subject LHD 7.\n       1. I am following up on your question to me concerning \n     Congressional action on the LHD 7. Both the Senate Armed \n     Services Committee and the Senate Appropriations Committee \n     have recommended funding the LHD 7 in fiscal year 1996.\n       2. As you know, the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) \n     contains funding for buying the LHD 7. Because of funding \n     limitations, we were not able to buy the LHD 7 until the end \n     of the FYDP. By accelerating the procurement of the LHD 7, we \n     will be able to avoid an expensive break in production and \n     save an estimated $415m in Constant Year Dollars. Bringing \n     forward the program will also free up shipbuilding funds at \n     the end of the FYDP which we will need to resource submarine \n     construction and other shipbuilding requirements.\n       3. There is no question we do need to procure the LHD 7 at \n     some point in order to sustain twelve Amphibious Readiness \n     Groups (ARGs). The LHD 7 is the last of the LHD 1 WASP class \n     amphibious assault ships planned to meet the 12 ``Big Deck'' \n     (LHA/LHD) amphibious ships necessary to meet the Defense \n     Planning Guidance and the CINCs' requirements.\n                                                   John H. Dalton.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nNebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized for 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor of the Bingaman \namendment. The amendment takes the funds added into the Defense \nappropriations bill for an unrequested $1.3 billion LHD-7 assault ship \nand shifts them to the readiness accounts to cover the cost of ongoing \nUnited States operations in Bosnia and Iraq.\n  As I stated earlier in my opening remarks on the defense \nauthorization bill, the cost of the 1996 defense budget to the taxpayer \nis not complete at the committee-passed funding level of $264.7 \nbillion. Members of the Senate as well as those at home watching this \ndebate should be aware that there is a built-in cost overrun in the \nappropriation bill before the Senate. In the rush to fund unrequested \nand unnecessary weapons programs totaling billions of dollars, the \ncommittee did not fund the anticipated expenses for ongoing Department \nof Defense operations in crisis spots such as Iraq and Bosnia. This \nunfunded expense, the cost of which will in the mean time come out of \nPentagon operations accounts, will come due next calendar year and I \nwarn my colleagues to not be surprised when this $1 billion cost \noverrun is covered in part by more domestic spending cuts.\n  Ironically, this built-in cost overrun is nearly identical to the \ncost of the LHD-7 assault ship added on to the administration's budget \nrequest. I find to interesting that the so-called readiness debate we \nused to hear so much about is dead after only 1 year. This year, the \nfunding increases in the bill are going to new ships, planes, and \nweapons systems the administration has not asked for. The operation and \nmaintenance accounts we watched so many in Congress wring their hands \nover last year are now being undercut in this year's multibillion-\ndollar arms spending spree. The committee decided to short-change the \nPentagon's readiness funding in order to feed the large appetite of \nhome State defense contractors. I believe this is fundamentally wrong. \nI support the Bingaman amendment because it corrects this upside-down \norder to defense funding priorities. The Bingaman amendment places the \noperations funding of our troops in the field above the cost of \nbuilding an unneeded naval vessel, as is appropriate.\n  We have heard that the LHD-7 is part of the Pentagon's future years \ndefense program and therefore is a legitimate requirement. We have also \nbeen told that by buying the LHD-7 earlier than anticipated it will \ncost us less. Both of these points are true.\n  But this is true of everything we ever buy. If we buy it now, it is \ngoing to be cheaper than if we buy it next year. That is because of \ninflation. It is common sense that this money will be saved by buying \nsomething today rather than 5 years from now--it is just not sound \nbudgeting. Does that mean we should accelerate the funding for every \nfuture ship in the 1996 budget, under the assumption and for the reason \nthat if we buy it now, we will save money in the future? That is like \nmy wife going to a sale and being forced to buy a dress because of the \namount of money she has saved.\n Of course, such a proposal would be foolish. So the question remains, \nwhy the $1.3 billion LHD-7?\n\n  The present 6-year shipbuilding would have us purchase the LHD-7 in \nthe year 2001, 5 years from now. Under the committee bill, we are \nleapfrogging it over all other ships to be bought during this time \nperiod. Also, why should this accelerated purchase and the resulting \n$1.3 billion add-on to the budget request take precedence over the \nreadiness needs of our troops overseas, in the field, participating in \nongoing operations in Iraq and Bosnia. In my opinion, first things \nfirst. We should fund the readiness needs of our military before we \nstart looking into next century and start picking out pet projects for \ncertain home States and buying them well in advance of their military \nneed.\n  Mr. President, I simply say the amendment offered by the Senator from \nNew Mexico is a very sound one. Ordinarily I would be for these \nadditional ships as needed on down the line but I do see no reason \nwhatsoever to be moving them up in the priorities now, especially when \nwe would definitely be hurting readiness.\n\n[[Page S 12144]]\n\n  I urge Senators to vote for Bingaman amendment and eliminate the \nbillion-dollar cost overrun hidden in this bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, will the Senator yield some time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 9 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield the Senator 6 minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nAlaska for yielding this time.\n  Mr. President, the Bingaman amendment has three problems:\n  First, it creates an authorized slush fund for ongoing military \noperations in Iraq, Cuba, and Bosnia--operations Congress has not \napproved; removes funding for a ship that we need and is in the Defense \nDepartment's procurement plan; and will ultimately require additional \n$700 million to buy the ship in 2001;\n\n\n                            contingency fund\n\n  Second, Congress should not preauthorize money for military \noperations. We did not do this for Somalia or Haiti--and we should not \ndo it now.\n  Creating a preauthorized slush fund creates a huge outlay imbalance. \nShip construction money pays out over 5-7 years. The Bingaman amendment \nwill outlay $1.2 billion almost immediately.\n\n\n                        requirement for the ship\n\n  Third, a valid military requirement exists for this ship. Military \nleadership across the board has endorsed the need for the ship.\n  Adoption of the Bingaman amendment will increase the cost of the ship \nby $700 million. Competitively awarded firm fixed-price contract option \nexists for the LHD now. If you wait until 2001, the price increases \n$700 million.\n  The Secretary of Defense does not support using LHD funds for \nmilitary contingency funding.\n\n\n                       lhds and recent experience\n\n  LHD-3 U.S.S. Kearsarge rescue of downed pilot, Capt. Scott O'Grady in \nBosnia--June 1993; LHD-2 U.S.S. Essex March 1995 Somalia withdrawal; \nand LHD-1 U.S.S. Wasp September 1994 Haiti operations.\n\n\n                            lhd capabilities\n\n  Carries 2,000 marines; 14 tiltrotor aircraft; 8 Harrier jump jets; 7 \nSea Stallion helicopter; 5 Cobra helicopters, and 2 Huey helicopters.\n  It also has a 600 bed hospital, 6 operating rooms, 22,000 square feet \nof vehicle space, and 100,000 square feet of cargo space.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  Someone once said: ``To be always ready for war is the best way to \navoid it.''\n  Buying the LHD-7 now makes sense. We need it and should buy it when \nit costs the least.\n  As General Wilhelm commander of marine forces in the Atlantic said, \nthe LHD-7 ``can be regarded as either a ship of war or a ship of peace, \nwith a degree of versatility absolutely unrivaled by any other ship \nafloat.''\n  Buying the LHD-7 is one of the best ways to ensure that the United \nStates is always ready to fight and win. Being ready to fight is \nperhaps the best way to avoid it.\n  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Bingaman amendment. This \nmatter was considered in the Armed Services Committee. We had a \nconsiderable debate about what to do with these contingency funds for \nthe ongoing operations, and the committee really felt that we should \nnot authorize these slush funds for ongoing or anticipated military \noperations whether they be in Iraq, Cuba, or Bosnia.\n  Congress has this one way of keeping the control and insisting on \ninformation about what is happening with these ongoing operations or \nfuture operations.\n  Not since Vietnam--I want to emphasize that to my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle. That is when this funding in advance of \nactivities was really stopped. We have not done this sort of thing. We \nshould not move into a program now where we give hundreds of millions \nof dollars in sort of a honey pot to be used for these ongoing \noperations. We need to keep a close check on what is happening with \nthis money, and what is happening with these operations.\n  Conversely, the Bingaman amendment removes funding for a ship that we \nneed, and is in the Department of Defense procurement plan for the \nfuture. If we delay this acquisition, it will cost us hundreds of \nmillions of dollars more to buy a ship that we must have. Congress \nshould not get into this position of preauthorizing money for military \noperations, and we should not take an action to pay for it that will \nwind up costing us even more money.\n  I have before me letters from the administration emphasizing how \nstrongly they feel about the LHD, one from the Secretary of the Navy, \nJohn Dalton, in which he says:\n\n       The LHD-7 is the last of the LHD-1 WASP class amphibious \n     assault ships planned to meet the 12 ``Big Deck''. . . \n     amphibious ships necessary to meet the Defense Planning \n     Guidance and the CINC's requirements.\n\n  Then there is a letter received by the Senator from New Mexico from \nSecretary of Defense Perry who responded through Comptroller John Hamre \nto this effect. He said:\n\n       Secretary Dalton correctly relayed to the Secretary that \n     the LHD-7 is in our future year defense plans.\n\n  And:\n\n       If offsets are needed in your amendment, we would ask that \n     you first consider those programs the Committee added that \n     are not in our future year defense plans.\n\n  So I think that this amendment should not go forward. I thought we \nwould probably have a chance to consider it as a part of the \nauthorization bill. But that has been delayed. Now here we are \nconsidering it on an appropriations bill.\n  The leaders of this committee have done excellent work. The Senators \nfrom Alaska and Hawaii have come up with a proper balance for \nshipbuilding and for the future defense of our country. They are very \nhesitant to get into funding these operations before we even know \nexactly what is happening with them.\n  And, therefore, I urge that we defeat this amendment overwhelmingly.\n  I yield any time I might not have used back to the distinguished \nSenator.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes and 45 seconds.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that we add about 5 minutes on \neach side because we have had an additional request for time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, on that basis, does the Senator wish to \nuse his time now?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I defer to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, how much time remains altogether?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes and twenty-six seconds.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield 4 minutes each to the Senator from South \nCarolina and the Senator from Maine, if I may.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized \nfor 4 minutes.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, in April of this year I sent a letter to \nthe distinguished chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Senator \nDomenici, in which I expressed my concerns about this year's defense \nbudget and requested additional funding for a number of specific \ninitiatives. Among other observations, I noted a continuing decline in \nprocurement funding over the past 10 years and highlighted its current \nlevel, the lowest since 1950. I also commented on the unfortunate \nconsequences. Critical new systems had been pushed into the future, \nwhile aging equipment imposed relentlessly increasing demands for \nmaintenance support.\n  The observations of this letter evolved into markup guidance for the \nsubcommittee chairmen. Evaluating the markup results, I think that the \nSeapower Subcommittee followed this guidance with great care. Its \nrecommendation to authorize the amphibious assault ship, LHD-7, is a \ncase in point.\n  There is clearly a commanding requirement for this ship, justified by \na series of studies and testimony by a long list of senior defense \nofficials and military commanders. Despite this compelling requirement \nand an opportunity to buy LHD-7 now at a good price or pay $700 million \nmore under the future years defense plan, funding constraints have kept \nit in the out years. The superb capability that the \n\n[[Page S 12145]]\nLHD class can bring to bear was amply demonstrated by U.S.S. Kearsarge \n(LHD-4), whose embarked marines rescued Capt. Scott O'Grady after he \nwas shot down in Bosnia.\n  Conversely, because it has been unable to procure LHD-7, the Navy has \nbeen forced to keep an old ship, USS Guam, in service will beyond its \nscheduled retirement date at a great cost in terms of lost capability \nand maintenance. Guam and her sister ships were built in the mid-\n1960's, are manpower intensive, have an inadequate command and control \ncapability by today's standards, and for years have imposed an \ninordinate maintenance burden to keep them operational.\n  While I do not deny that ongoing contingency operations with which \nCongress concurs should be funded,\n there are established procedures to obtain it that begin with \nsubmission of a supplemental request by the Department of Defense. No \nsuch request has been received. I acknowledge the letter that the \nSecretary of Defense sent immediately prior to our markup. However, it \nhas no formal standing with our Senate Appropriations Committee, which, \nas you all know, is very sensitive that established procedures should \nbe followed. It is a fact that the $125 million that we added for \nsupport of such contingency operations during our markup was not \nsupported by the Appropriations Committee in its markup. Until the \nDepartment of Defense has been able to work out an agreement with \nCongress that revises existing procedures, there is no reason to \nbelieve that the diversion of funds proposed by this amendment would \nnot meet a similar fate.\n\n  Mr. President, on the one hand I have the committee markup, which \nmatches available resources to an urgent requirement for procurement of \nLHD-7. On the other hand I have an amendment that would ship them off \nto an uncertain future, leave the requirement for an amphibious assault \nship unsatisfied, and cost the taxpayer at least $700 million more in \nthe long run. I have no difficulty with that choice. I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to join me in opposing this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and yield back any time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I yield time to the Senator from Maine. I \nam trying to save 2 minutes.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I yield 4\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator \nfrom Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized for 4\\1/\n2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. COHEN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, the argument has been made to support this amendment \nthat this ship is not in the President's budget. The fact is that the \nPresident's budget is lower than the budget approved by the U.S. \nSenate. So, because the President's budget is smaller, the argument is \nwe have to reduce down what we think is required for the national \nsecurity interests of this country. We fundamentally disagree with the \nPresident on this issue. We think we have to do more in the way of \nprocurement, not less. We cannot continue to go on any kind of a \nprocurement holiday, as some in the military have expressed. We have \nhad a shortfall in readiness. We have tried to measure up to that \nshortfall. But we are now compromising on procurement. In fact, our \nprocurement budget as a percentage of that budget is lower now than it \nwas back 45 years ago. We cannot go down any lower. So we decided that \nwe have to do more.\n  Some have argued that this is like buying a dress. We are not talking \nabout dresses. We are talking about warships. We are talking about war-\nfighting capability. This is a war-fighting capable ship. It is the \nkind of ship that we are going to have to deploy to those amphibious \noperations that we are talking about off the coast of Iraq, or Iran, or \nthe Mediterranean, the Persian Gulf and Haiti, and elsewhere; Bosnia. \nThose are the kinds of deployments that this ship is going to be used \nfor.\n  Is there no need for this ship? The President says there is a need in \nthe 6-year plan. They just do not want it in this year's plan.\n  So that is the argument made by my colleagues from Mississippi. We \ncan buy this now, and the reason to buy it now and not later is to save \n$700 million. That is the reason we are buying it now. We are not \nbuying an unneeded dress, or an unneeded ship. We need the ship, and we \nprovide the money to pay for the ship.\n  So the notion somehow that this is unnecessary, this is simply window \ndressing, so to speak, that we do not really need this kind of \ncapability is absurd. We need the ship. We ought to pay for it this \nyear. We can save money in doing so. There is not a person in this \ncountry who said if you have a requirement for it that you ought not to \nbuy it at the best possible price. This is the best way to achieve \nsavings for the American people.\n  Mr. President, I hope that when it comes time for this motion to \ntable that we will listen to the Senator from Alaska, who has looked at \nthis, and to the Senator from Hawaii who has looked at this, and the \nArmed Services Committee which has looked at this and said this is a \nrequirement that the Navy has. It has expressed this. Two consecutive \nCNO's have said we need this capability. What the Senate would like to \ndo, if you follow this amendment, is to defer it to the future. Well, \nif you defer it to the future, there is a chance you might not have the \nmoney in the future.\n  If you defer it to the future, it is going to cost you another three-\nquarters of a billion dollars. That is the kind of economics I think \nhas brought this country to a point where it no longer is willing to \nsupport what is necessary for strong national defense.\n  So I hope at the conclusion of the debate the Senator from Alaska \nmakes a motion to table and our colleagues will resoundingly move to \ntable and defeat the amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 2 minutes and 13 \nseconds.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to my friend from Hawaii.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized for 1\\1/\n2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I support my chairman, and I am opposed to \nthis amendment. No. 1, the Marines want it and need it. It is of the \nhighest priority. No. 2, the master plan of the Defense Department \ncalls for the acquisition of this 12th LHD. And No. 3, there is no \nquestion that we have a good deal at this time. If we do not buy \naccording to the contract of this day, we purchase it in the year 2000, \nwe are looking at a $2 billion tab.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time remains on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 12 minutes and \n41 seconds.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much remains for the opposition?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The opposition has 2 minutes and 24 seconds.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield myself all but 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, we have heard a great many arguments as \nto why this amendment should not be adopted.\n  Let me try to go through several of them. First, the argument has \nbeen made that this ship is sorely needed by the military.\n  I earlier erred when I was describing the request of the Department \nof Defense. I thought they had asked for this in the last year of the \n5-year plan. It used to be they referred to the 5-year plan. The FYDP \nwas an abbreviation for the 5-year defense plan. They have now gone, I \nam informed, to a 6-year defense plan, and now the FYDP stands for \nfuture year defense plan, and this ship is not requested in the 5 \nyears; it is requested in the 6th year of the 6-year plan. So clearly \nthere is a request, but it is way in the future, as far in the future \nas you can get and still be requesting.\n  As I understand it, we just had the launching of one of these \namphibious ships in February of this year. We have two more that are \nunder construction at this very time. This will be the 12th of these \namphibious ships if we go ahead and fund it as proposed in the bill. \n\n[[Page S 12146]]\n\n  Mr. President, I do not doubt that in a perfect world it would be \nnice to buy a 12th amphibious assault ship and to do so in 1997 rather \nthan the year 2001. But we have to exercise some discipline in this \nbody and some sense of priorities. The priorities of this \nadministration are to put the funds in ongoing operations where the \nSecretary of Defense has said we need them.\n  Here is a quotation from the letter that the Secretary sent to our \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Thurmond. He says, \n``I suggest that you fund these contingencies first if you decide to \nincrease the DOD budget this year.''\n  Mr. President, we have decided, the Congress has decided to increase \nthe DOD budget this year by over $7 billion, and yet we are not funding \nthese ongoing operations. Not only are we not funding them first, we \nare not funding them. We are saying to the American people, ``Do not \npay attention; we will come back next year and ask for this money next \nyear, and we will tell you then that it is an emergency. And so, then \nyou ought to be willing to accept it.''\n  Mr. President, that is not responsible. We should not be doing that. \nWe should go ahead and pay for those things we know need to be paid for \nin this bill.\n  I also want people to recognize that the debate has shifted very \ndramatically in this Senate on defense spending. I remember when we \nstarted the year I heard a drumbeat from my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle about how we had a shortfall in readiness, how we had \nbeen neglecting readiness, how the Clinton administration had not asked \nfor enough money for readiness and the operations and maintenance of \nour troops.\n  Mr. President, the administration is asking for funding for \nreadiness. Anyone who votes against this amendment needs to desist from \nfurther requests for funding for readiness, because, quite frankly, we \nhave a very direct request here, and anyone who is not willing to fund \nit is being given a very good chance to do so.\n  Let me just summarize what we are doing in the amendment. I think it \nshould be clear to my colleagues, but let me summarize it again. We are \nadding $1.188--$1,188,000,000--to pay for known bills for ongoing \noperations in northern and southern Iraq, in Cuba, and in Bosnia. This \nis not a honeypot that we are creating here. I heard my colleague from \nMississippi say we are creating a honeypot. These are ongoing \noperations. These bills are coming due every day, and they will be \ncoming due every day as we get into this new fiscal year as well.\n  So we need to provide these funds. We are providing the $1.3 billion \nfor the LHD-7 amphibious assault ship not because it is a good ship but \nbecause it has been requested in year six of the future year defense \nplan, and it is something we need to put off until someday when we can \nafford it. We cannot afford it this year.\n  In addition, this amendment strikes two provisions of the bill which \nI believe really cannot be justified. I have noticed that none of the \ncomments on the other side in opposition to the amendment have even \naddressed these issues because there is really no argument to be made.\n  I am striking two provisions in the bill that increase outlays by \n$1.238 billion by forcing the Pentagon to pay large contractors 85 \npercent rather than 75 percent progress payments and to pay bills in 24 \ndays instead of 30-days. We do not require that anywhere else in the \nGovernment. We do not require it of any other Department of Government. \nWe are saying to the Department of Defense, you have to pay these \ndefense contractors faster than you have paid them in the past. You \nhave to give them a higher progress payment than you have given them in \nthe past or than we give to anyone else who does business with the \nGovernment.\n  General Sheehan when he testified to our committee did not equivocate \non this. He said it would be nice to buy these things, but we cannot \nafford everything. And that is essentially the point of our amendment \nhere today. We cannot afford everything.\n  The claim that we are going to save $700 million by going ahead and \nbuying this LHD-7 right now is pure speculation. Nobody knows what the \nbidding climate is going to be in the year 2001. I tend to think that \nthere may be some defense contractors out there who are very willing to \ngive us a good deal in the year 2001 just like they are willing to give \nus a good deal this year. So I do not buy the argument that we are \nsaving money and we are necessarily going to have to spend more later \nif we put this off as the Department of Defense is requesting.\n  There are higher priorities for this country this year than buying a \n12th amphibious assault ship. One of those priorities--in fact, the \nfirst of those priorities in the eyes of the Secretary of Defense--is \nto fund these ongoing operations. That is what we are trying to do in \nthis amendment. I think it is clearly the responsible thing to do. It \nis what the American people want us to do.\n  I urge my colleagues to take this opportunity to put our priorities \nin order in this legislation, to go ahead and adopt the amendment, fund \nthe ongoing operations which all know have to be paid for, and then do \nso by putting off, as the Department of Defense requested, any funding \nfor this additional ship.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes 50 seconds.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Is there any additional discussion on the other side? I \nwill ask the Senator from Alaska if he wishes to conduct any at this \ntime.\n  Mr. STEVENS. My answer is no.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me just summarize very briefly.\n  I think the first question you ask when you go to put a defense \nbudget together, or any budget, is, what is your top priority? Here we \nknow what the top priority of the Secretary of Defense is if there is \nany additional money for defense. He has made it very clear. I am just \narguing that we should do the responsible thing and fund that top \npriority.\n  It will be dishonest, Mr. President, for us to put this off and then \ncome back to the American people next year and say, Surprise. All of a \nsudden we have discovered that it costs us money in 1996 to operate \nthis operation down in Guantanamo. Surprise. We find it is costing us \nmoney to do these activities over in Iraq. Surprise. We find it is \ncosting us some money to do what we are doing in Bosnia, and, \ntherefore, we have got an emergency and we need to pass a supplemental \nappropriations bill to add to the defense bill that we passed last \nyear.\n  So it is not just what the President requested for the 1996 defense \nbill. Is not just that. It is not just the $7 billion extra. It is that \nplus the $7 billion, plus what we ask for in the supplemental which we \nknow is going to come if we turn down this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment, pay our \nbills as we go. You hear a lot of talk about the importance of pay as \nyou go around here. That is what we are asking people to do: Pay as we \ngo; fund the top priority of the Department of Defense, and do so by \nputting off the purchase of this ship, which we will have 5 more years \nin which to consider whether or not we want to go ahead with this 12th \namphibious assault ship. I think during that time we can make a much \nbetter judgment than we are making today.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 2 minutes 33 \nseconds.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I now ask unanimous consent that the time remaining on \neach side be carried forward and it be in order for me to move to table \nthe amendment.\n  It was the request of Senator Byrd, and others, that we have some \ntime in between these stacked votes so that the proponents and \nopponents might be able to explain just briefly the subject matter for \nthose who are not on the floor at the time. That is the reason for the \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \ntabling motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second. \n\n[[Page S 12147]]\n\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his courtesy.\n  Mr. President, I note the Senator from Colorado is on his feet. I \nknow he has an amendment. I would like to inquire if he would consider \na time limitation before action is taken in regard to his amendment.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I will be happy to agree to a time \nlimitation. I will be guided by what the distinguished chairman wants. \nMy belief is the problems have been worked out on this and it will not \nrequire an extended debate.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am slightly without words because I do not know what \nthe subcommittee involved. This is an amendment which really should be \nplaced on the foreign assistance bill. It pertains to the Department of \nState; am I not correct?\n  Mr. BROWN. Well, the reason the initial NATO Transition Act was on \nthis bill last year was because it was specific with the military \naspects of it. And I believe this is the place that we always planned \nto offer it. I think it does work out. It is specifically with NATO \ntransition in the military that appears therein.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will just do this, Mr. President.\n  If I may put the Senate on notice that this is an amendment that has \nvery broad impact on the NATO forces, as I understand it. I am prepared \nto listen to the Senator from Colorado and determine what the position \nof our committee would be with regard to taking it to conference. I \nhave discussed it with my friend from Hawaii.\n  We are prepared to have a time limitation of 15 to 20 minutes on a \nside, if that is acceptable to the Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. That would certainly be acceptable to me.\n  Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.\n  I just heard from the leadership that it now requires the attention \nof Senator Nunn and Senator Pell.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It would be my intention to move to table the amendment \nat the end of that time. If we lose, we lose. But would the Senator \nlike to wait for the time limitation, too?\n  Mr. INOUYE. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask the Senator if he wishes to proceed. We can \ndiscuss the time limitation at a later time.\n  Mr. BROWN. I will proceed. I will be happy to observe the guidance of \nthe Chair and do not want to monopolize the time on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2391\n\n (Purpose: To amend the NATO Participation Act of 1994 to expedite the \ntransition to full membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n       of European countries emerging from Communist domination)\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment and I ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending Bingaman amendment?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. I offer this on behalf of myself, Senator Simon, Senator \nDole, Senator Mikulski, Senator Santorum, Senator Lieberman, Senator \nRoth, Senator McCain, Senator McConnell, Senator Warner, Senator \nNickles, Senator Craig, Senator Hutchison, Senator Inhofe, and Senator \nDomenici.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Brown], for himself, Mr. \n     Simon, Mr. Dole, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Lieberman, \n     Mr. Roth, Mr. McCain, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Warner, Mr. Nickles, \n     Mr. Craig, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Inhofe, and Mr. Domenici, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2391.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Amendments \nSubmitted.'')\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, this amendment is a followup to the NATO \nParticipation Act which was enacted last year as an amendment to this \nbill. It follows up with further clarification on the process of \nincluding the Central European powers, specifically Poland, Hungary, \nthe Czech Republic, and the Slovak Republic, in NATO, defining their \ntransition and dealing with the kind of transition assistance and \ncooperation that is essential to completion of that process.\n  In the process of developing this amendment, we held extensive \ndiscussions with Members of the Senate and others, and the \nadministration. In that process, a number of Members had suggestions, \nand the suggestions boiled down to a variety of ones by the \nadministration to expand the discretion given to the President in this \nprocess. Those are principally embodied by Senator Lugar.\n  We had a number of members in the Foreign Relations Committee make \nrecommendations in that area. And to respond to that, to answer those \nconcerns, an amendment to the bill, or this concept, was produced. \nSenator Lugar was the primary contributor to this, and it contains much \nof his work.\n  Mr. President, so that we could incorporate those changes that \nSenator Lugar suggested and that other members of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee suggested, I offer a second-degree amendment to my amendment \nat this time.\n  This amendment is proposed by myself, Senator Simon, Senator Dole, \nSenator Lugar, Senator Mikulski, Senator McCain, Senator McConnell, \nSenator Domenici, Senator Warner, Senator Nickles, Senator Craig, \nSenator Hutchison, Senator Inhofe, Senator Santorum, and Senator \nJeffords.\n  Mr. President, I offer that second-degree amendment, and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to offering the second-\ndegree amendment?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President.\n  I am just going through this amendment, and I want to put the Senator \nfrom Colorado on notice and the Senate on notice, I think this is \ngetting into a very wide area and, if it leads to extended debate, \ncould really lead us to being here next week.\n  Mr. BROWN. If I might----\n  Mr. STEVENS. I want to reserve the right to object later. I do not \nknow how I am going to do it. Right now I cannot object to offering a \nsecond-degree amendment, but I do think this is a very broad issue to \nget involved in.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator, you cannot \nreserve the right to object.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I understand that. But somehow in the Record I want the \nSenate to understand we are getting to a very broad subject now dealing \nwith foreign assistance, coming out of an appropriations that is not \nsubject to our subcommittee. This is subject to a point of order. And I \nreally think--I hope my friend from Colorado will understand that it is \ninappropriate for us to get into this now.\n  This is a very broad-range foreign assistance program, some $60 \nmillion out of a bill I do not manage. I am very uneasy about that. If \nthe Senator wishes to offer his amendment, again, I hope the Senate \nwill stand by the managers of the bill to keep this bill clean of \nthings that involve controversy that will take us into next week. I \ncannot object at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BROWN. If I might inquire of the Senator before a final \ndetermination is made on his part, the perfecting amendment that is \noffered is one that is designed to suit the concerns of a number of \nMembers on his side of the aisle. It was put together primarily by \nSenator Lugar, and it reflects the concerns the administration had. So \nthe perfecting amendment is meant to respond to the concerns that \npeople had. It is not meant to strengthen the amendment. It is meant to \nmake it acceptable to both sides. I have offered it in this fashion, \nthat is the first amendment and the second, so Members might understand \nthat what is offered is a compromise.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, in response to my friend from Colorado, \nI still need to object. The Democratic leader has asked that we protect \nthe rights of people to offer second-degree amendments. This would \nblock that, if I understand what is being requested.\n\n[[Page S 12148]]\n\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2391, As Modified\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I appreciate the point the Senator has \nmade. I believe there is an easy way to accommodate that point. It \ncertainly would not be my intention to block second-degree amendments \nif anyone should have them. I am not aware of them. I appreciate the \nSenator's point. I believe there is an easy way to handle that. \nTherefore, I modify my first-degree amendment with the changes that \nhave been sent to the desk, and I ask unanimous consent that such \nmodification be allowed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). Is there objection to the \nrequest?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I only object to state that, as I understand it, the \nSenator has a right to modify his amendment at any time. I will state, \nthough, to my friend, we have now contacted the chairman of the Foreign \nOperations Subcommittee, who is a sponsor with the Senator from \nColorado, and he indicates to this Senator that this matter will be \ndealt with in the markup of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee in the \nfirst week of September, and he intends to support it there.\n  I urge the Senator not to bring it to our bill. The chairman of the \nForeign Ops Subcommittee is prepared to hear this the first week we are \nback in September. It is something foreign here, and I just smell a \ncontroversy coming at me. I also smell fish coming into the Alaska \nrivers, and I want to get home. This is not consistent with finishing \nthis bill before tomorrow evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a right to modify his \namendment. His amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2391), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new title:\n\n         TITLE ____--NATO PARTICIPATION ACT AMENDMENTS OF 1995\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``NATO Participation Act \n     Amendments of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n     (NATO) has played an essential role in guaranteeing the \n     security, freedom, and prosperity of the United States and \n     its partners in the Alliance.\n       (2) NATO has expanded its membership on three different \n     occasions since 1949.\n       (3) The sustained commitment of the member countries of \n     NATO to mutual defense of their security ultimately made \n     possible the democratic transformation in Central and Eastern \n     Europe and the demise of the Soviet Union.\n       (4) NATO was designed to be and remains a defensive \n     military organization whose members have never contemplated \n     the use of, or used, military force to expand the borders of \n     its member states.\n       (5) While the immediate threat to the security of the \n     United States and its allies has been reduced with the \n     collapse of the Iron Curtain, new security threats, such as \n     the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, are emerging to the \n     shared interests of the member countries of NATO.\n       (6) NATO remains the only multilateral security \n     organization capable of conducting effective military \n     operations to protect Western security interests.\n       (7) NATO has played a positive role in defusing tensions \n     between NATO members and, as a result, no military action has \n     occurred between two NATO member states since the inception \n     of NATO in 1949.\n       (8) NATO is also an important diplomatic forum for the \n     discussion of issues of concern to its member states and for \n     the peaceful resolution of disputes.\n       (9) America's security, freedom, and prosperity remain \n     linked to the security of the countries of Europe.\n       (10) Any threat to the security of the newly emerging \n     democracies in Central Europe would pose a security threat to \n     the United States and its European allies.\n       (11) The admission to NATO of European countries that have \n     been freed from Communist\n      domination and that meet specific criteria for NATO \n     membership would contribute to international peace and \n     enhance the security of the region.\n       (12) A number of countries have expressed varying degrees \n     of interest in NATO membership, and have taken concrete steps \n     to demonstrate this commitment.\n       (13) Full integration of Central and East European \n     countries into the North Atlantic Alliance after such \n     countries meet essential criteria for admission would enhance \n     the security of the Alliance and, thereby, contribute to the \n     security of the United States.\n       (14) The expansion of NATO can create the stable \n     environment needed to successfully complete the political and \n     economic transportation envisioned by European states \n     emerging from communist domination.\n       (15) In recognition that not all countries which have \n     requested membership in NATO will necessarily qualify at the \n     same pace, the accession date for each new member will vary.\n       (16) Nothing in this title should be construed as \n     precluding the eventual NATO membership of European countries \n     never under communist domination, namely, Austria, Finland, \n     and Sweden.\n       (17) The provision of NATO transition assistance should \n     include those countries most ready for closer ties with NATO \n     and should be designed to assist other countries meeting \n     specified criteria of eligibility to move forward toward \n     eventual NATO membership.\n       (18) The evaluation of future membership in NATO for \n     countries emerging from communist domination should be based \n     on the progress of those nations in meeting criteria for NATO \n     transition assistance and evolving NATO criteria, which \n     require enhancement of NATO's security and the approval of \n     all NATO members.\n\n     SEC. 3. UNITED STATES POLICY.\n\n       It should be the policy of the United States--\n       (1) to join with the NATO allies of the United States to \n     redefine the role of the NATO Alliance in the post-Cold War \n     world;\n       (2) to actively assist European countries emerging from \n     communist domination in their transition so that such \n     countries may eventually qualify for NATO membership; and\n       (3) to work to define the political and security \n     relationship between an enlarged NATO and the Russian \n     Federation.\n\n     SEC. 4. REVISIONS TO PROGRAM TO FACILITATE TRANSITION TO NATO \n                   MEMBERSHIP.\n\n       (a) Establishment of Program.--Subsection (a) of section \n     203 of the NATO Participation Act of 1994 (title II of Public \n     Law 103-447; 22 U.S.C. 1928 note) is amended to read as \n     follows:\n       ``(a) Establishment of Program.--The President is \n     authorized to provide expanded security assistance and other \n     related assistance to countries designated under subsection \n     (d) to facilitate their transition to full NATO \n     membership.''.\n       (b) Eligible Countries.--\n       (1) Eligibility.--Subsection (d) of section 203 of such Act \n     is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(d) Designation of Eligible Countries.--\n       ``(1) Presidential review and report.--Within 60 days of \n     the enactment of the NATO Participation Act Amendments of \n     1995, the President shall transmit to the Congress an \n     evaluation of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, \n     as well as Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia, Bulgaria, \n     Romania and Albania, in accordance with the criteria in \n     paragraph (3) and specifically designate one or more of these \n     countries to be eligible to receive assistance under the \n     program established in subsection (a).

DEFINITIONS.\n\n       ``For purposes of this title:\n       ``(1) NATO.--The term `NATO' means the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization.\n       ``(2) Designated congressional committees.--The term \n     `designated congressional committees' means--\n       ``(A) The Committee on International Relations, the \n     Committee on National Security, and the Committee on \n     Appropriations of the House of Representatives; and\n       ``(B) the Committee on Foreign Relations, the Committee on \n     Armed Services, and the Committee on Appropriations of the \n     Senate.\n       ``(3) European countries emerging from communist \n     domination.--The term `European countries emerging from \n     Communist domination' includes, but is not limited to, \n     Albania, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, \n     Lithuania, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, and \n     Ukraine.''.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, let me say to the distinguished chairman, \nit is my intent to cooperate with him in every way possible. It is not \nmy intent to add controversy to the bill. I believe the problems and \nconcerns have been met and modified. I believe it is the kind of policy \nof which the Senator would be very strongly supportive.\n  Let me simply outline quickly what has changed in the effect of this \namendment.\n  The original version, before the establishment of the program for \nNATO transition, the compromise that is before the body now simply \nauthorizes that. The difference is, this is simply an authorization so \nthe President can move ahead with it if he wishes.\n  Second, the original version determined that Poland, Hungary, the \nCzech Republic, and the Slovak Republic were members of the program; \nthat is, the transition program. The compromise version requires the \nPresident to evaluate those countries but does not require that they be \nnamed in the transition program. It also gives the President the option \nthen to name those that he would like to have participate in the \ntransition program.\n  Third, the original amendment did not authorize funds in response to \nthe administration and others. This does authorize funds for countries \nat the transition level that are included in the transition level, and \nit is basically comparable to what was included in the President's \nWarsaw initiative in terms of those powers.\n  Last, Mr. President, this measure urges participation of the old \nversion, which urged participation of the North Atlantic Council \ncountries in NATO. That is deleted in the compromise version. I believe \nevery concern that has been raised or expressed, that we are aware of, \nhas been dealt with in the compromise version. It is clearly a step \nforward.\n  Mr. President, let me last of all indicate this. This does clearly \nrelate to NATO and military matters and the \n\n[[Page S 12150]]\nmatters before the body. While this does not divert the funding \npriority that the distinguished committee has put forward, it does \ncarry a very significant symbolic message, and that message is this: \nThat we believe that countries who believe in democracy and will stand \nup for freedom in Central Europe that were subject to the horrors of \nWorld War II and the horrors of Soviet domination in the cold war, if \nthey want to join free men and women in standing up for freedom, that \nwe ought to welcome them.\n  This is not simply a technical issue; it is an issue that goes right \nto the heart of what free men and women want for their lives, for their \nchildren and for their future. These are people who want to join arms \nwith us and want to stand up for freedom and want to pledge their \nsecurity with our security. They want to join hands with us.\n  Mr. President, at the end of World War II, this country turned to the \ncountries in Europe and Japan, and we did a number of things. First, we \nnot only extended a hand of friendship, but we extended a hand of \nassistance.\n  Second, we opened up our trade markets to let them earn their way out \nof the tragedy that had befallen them.\n  And third, and most significant of all, we extended an umbrella of \nprotection for their mutual security.\n  What happened at the end of the cold war to those countries that had \nbeen victimized by Soviet occupation was that the European Economic \nCommunity did not open their markets to them, although they are in \nnegotiations to do so. That move to open their markets, which would \nhave done more for the Central European countries than perhaps any \nsingle thing that can be done, is still being worked out, and, frankly, \nmembership in NATO is viewed as a key way to accomplish that objective. \nIf you look at the transition for Greece and others who joined the \ncommon market, it was exactly the door of NATO that helped bring them \nin.\n  So opening markets was not done for Central Europe. And frankly, \nassistance was not done, although there have been some minor programs \nand they have not pushed hard for it, but the kind of assistance we \ngave with the Marshall Plan has not been offered and not really asked \nfor.\n  Last, and maybe most important, we have not done that which they ask \nfor the most, and that is to join hands with them in pledging mutual \nprotection for each other.\n  Those three things that were so important for turning Japan and \nEurope around have not been done for Central Europe. This would move \nforward in terms of allowing those people to join hands with us in \ntransitioning to NATO membership. The idea and the concept and the \nsymbol are terribly important for the security of Central Europe.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Helms as a \ncosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I retain the remainder of my time.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record letters supporting \nthis amendment from former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and from \nPresident Carter's National Security Adviser, Mr. Brzezinski.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           Henry A. Kissinger,\n\n                                                    July 27, 1995.\n     Hon. Hank Brown,\n     Senate Foreign Relations Committee,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Brown: Thank you for bringing to my attention \n     the Brown-Simon ``NATO Participation Act Amendments of \n     1995''.\n       In my view, continuing security in Europe hinges upon a \n     stable NATO alliance open to early membership by countries \n     like Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. Ambiguous \n     Western security arrangements for the heart of Europe will \n     not serve the cause of peace there. Rather, they will \n     generate uncertainty and instability.\n       As you know, I was solidly in favor of the 1994 NATO \n     Participation Act. It sent a strong indication of United \n     States support for the countries emerging from communist \n     domination in Central and Eastern Europe. Accordingly, I was \n     disappointed by President Clinton's decision not to act on \n     his authority. A valuable opportunity was missed to enhance \n     the security of Europe.\n       The ``NATO Participation Act Amendments of 1995'' seek to \n     correct this mistake by requiring the Administration to \n     extend to these fledgling democracies some of the most \n     important security benefits U.S. law extends to existing NATO \n     members. This action will speed their transition into NATO. \n     Furthermore, this measure sends a clear signal in part from \n     its specific designation of Poland, Hungary, the Czech \n     Republic, and Slovakia as eligible countries.\n       I strongly support the Brown-Simon amendment and urge your \n     colleagues of both parties to join in passing them at the \n     earliest opportunity.\n           Sincerely,\n     Henry A. Kissinger.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         Center for Strategic & International Studies,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 31, 1995.\n     Hon. Hank Brown,\n      U.S. Senate,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Brown: Thank you for notifying me about the \n     Brown-Simon ``NATO Participation Act Amendments of 1995'' and \n     your intention to offer them as amendments.\n       From my perspective, the United States and her allies have \n     arrived at a unique juncture in history. An excellent \n     opportunity now exists to contribute to the creation of a \n     stable and secure Europe. An important element to that \n     region's long-term peace is our continued commitment to a \n     strong NATO open to early membership to countries like \n     Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia.\n       For this reason, I strongly support the ``NATO \n     Participation Act Amendments of 1995.'' These proposals would \n     strengthen the 1994 NATO Participation Act by requiring the \n     Clinton Administration to implement a transition program to \n     help eligible countries move closer toward the high standards \n     of NATO membership. This action surely will accelerate the \n     inclusion of these nations into this key security alliance.\n       I urge your colleagues to join in support of the Brown-\n     Simon amendments.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Zbigniew Brzezinski.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I can only, once again, ask my friend \nfrom Colorado to cooperate by withdrawing the amendment and presenting \nit as it will be presented in the Foreign Operations Subcommittee bill. \nIf this remains in our bill, when we get to conference with the House, \nwe have to conference with two separate subcommittees. They will not \nconference with us on the foreign operations matters when we have the \nDefense Subcommittees meeting.\n  This is going to delay getting us our bill. I happen to be one who is \nin the forefront in support of what the Senator from Colorado is doing. \nI believe in expansion of NATO. I believe we may have some trouble with \nregard to the extent of our capabilities to provide the assurance that \nwe will come to the defense of any of these nations in the current \ncircumstance over there, but I am more than willing to explore how we \ncan do that, because I think it is right to do. But I believe it is \ngoing to open up this bill now to a very wide-ranging debate and that \nevery Senator is going to want to talk about it and we are going to be \nhere tomorrow morning.\n  I urge the Senator to listen to the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nsubcommittee, who has committed that it will be brought up at his \nsubcommittee in the first week of September and be carried through from \nthere. It does not belong on this bill. We are not capable of handling \nthis in conference. I hate to take something to conference which means \nthat when we are in conference, we have to step aside and let other \nsubcommittee members from either side come in and handle an issue not \nwithin our competence. I do not believe it ought to be on this bill.\n  I urge the Senator--he made his point, and I think there will be an \noverwhelming support for his proposition once everyone has expressed \ntheir point of view here today, probably. But it does not belong on \nthis bill.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, let me respond to the very thoughtful \nconcerns of the chairman. Let me assure him that if this becomes a \nburden for his bill or untimely delays it, I am going to be with him in \ntrying to find another avenue for it. I hope the Senator does not feel \ncompelled to oppose this effort if indeed we have addressed those \nconcerns.\n  Mr. President, I at this point ask that Senator Moseley-Braun from \nIllinois be added as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  I believe Senator Simon at this point would like the opportunity to \naddress the measure. I will yield to him.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, that is the problem. Every Senator wants \nto \n\n[[Page S 12151]]\ntalk about this amendment that does not belong on my bill. We ought to \nfind some way to test this. It is my intent to make a motion to table \nthis amendment very soon, because I say we are going to go home, and \nthe way we are going to get home is not standing here talking about \nsomething that belongs on another bill.\n  The Foreign Relations subcommittee will report their bill the second \nweek in September, and that is when it should be considered. The Senate \nis going to have a chance to make up its mind whether it is going to \nfinish this day or not. I am not going to make the motion now. I want \nto confer with the Senator from Colorado. I believe we ought to be \nlistened to. This is not something that belongs on this bill. We are \nnot capable of handling the subject matter. We cannot conference with \nthe Defense subcommittee on the other side.\n  While I support the intent, it is not something we ought to be \ndealing with. It is legislation on an appropriations bill, and it \nshould not be here. The way to answer that is to either make a point of \norder against it or move to table it. I will do one or the other before \ntoo long.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I will just take 2 minutes. I want to \nassure the Senator from Alaska that in terms of making a point of \norder, that precedent has been set and this is in order. There is no \nquestion about that.\n  The question is, Is this significant enough that we ought to put this \non this piece of legislation? And I think the answer is yes. It will \nadd to stability in Central Europe. I think the answer is clearly yes. \nThe language is so couched that I hope we can accept it very quickly.\n  I want to get out of here as much as the Senator from Alaska wants to \nget out of here. A simple way of getting out of here is to accept this \namendment and move forward. I think this is in everyone's best \ninterest.\n  Let me add one other point. There are those who say somehow this will \noffend Russia. The reality is that the time may come when Russia can \nbecome a part of NATO. Ultimately, the threat to Russia does not come \nfrom the West, it comes from China, in the long term.\n  So I think this does make sense, and I am pleased to support the \namendment of Senator Brown.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Colorado \n[Mr. Brown], has demonstrated his customary fine leadership in offering \nhis amendment to bring a possible NATO membership one step closer for \nfriends of the United States in Central Europe.\n  Now, nations from Latvia to the Czech Republic have bitter memories \nof the period following World War II when they were left in a security \nvacuum. Some 50 years of Communist captivity ensued.\n  I ask unanimous consent to be identified as a cosponsor on the Brown \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the amendment provides incentive for \ncontinued reform in countries of that region by offering closer \nintegration with the West for countries that meet the fundamental \ncriteria of democracy and economic reform.\n  While some countries have taken more steps than others in fulfilling \nthe criteria outlined in the Brown amendment, reform efforts are so \nfluid and governments evolve so often that I do not believe it is fair \nto prejudge any one country, or set of countries, for that matter, at \nthis time.\n It would certainly not be honest to make the judgment that Slovakia, \nfor example, has made more progress in fulfilling the criteria in this \nbill than have Estonia or Slovenia. While I support Slovakia's \nindependence and the people of that country, the Government of that \ncountry has backed away, I am sorry to say, from privatization and has \ninterpreted democracy to mean total control by the ruling political \nparty of the country.\n\n  The Brown amendment offers a real blueprint for forging closer \nrelations with the free nations of Central Europe. We should not \ncontent ourselves with the Clinton administration's tepid approach to \nour victory in the cold war. To this day, the administration has failed \nto define the process by which Central European countries can become \nNATO members. The Brown amendment will right this unfocused approach by \nconcentrating our assistance on those countries taking brave steps to \nreform their political, economic and military systems and tie their \nfuture to NATO.\n  I firmly believe that NATO enlargement to countries which prove \nthemselves capable of contributing to the NATO Alliance is in the U.S. \nnational interest. Spreading NATO ideals to Central Europe at this time \naligns these countries in a defense-oriented posture which must be more \ncomforting to Russia than the current undefined security situation in \nCentral Europe.\n  I would encourage the President to take the bold step of making all \nthe countries in this bill eligible for much of the NATO transition \nassistance provided in this amendment.\n  I urge the adoption of this amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/10/senate-section/article/S12140-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12151-S12166]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            NATO ENLARGEMENT\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today as one who has been a long-\nstanding supporter of NATO. For this reason, I am a cosponsor of the \nBrown amendment, the NATO Participation Act Amendments of 1995.\n  Mr. President, no other issue is more crucial to European security \nthan NATO's relationship with Central and Eastern Europe. Today, we are \nin the midst of an historical era, an era of transition, the so-called \npost-cold-war era. It is a phase in which the strategic landscape of \nEurope is particularly malleable. It is a phase that will not last \nforever and which will end sooner rather than later.\n  How the alliance manages its relationship with the nations of this \nregion during this period will determine whether or not Europe will \nultimately benefit from an enduring and stable peace.\n  Careful, gradual, but undeterred enlargement of NATO should be the \ngeopolitical priority of America's Europe policy. The alliance is \nuniquely qualified to provide the institutional foundation for regional \nsecurity and peace. No other institution, including the European Union \nand the Organization for Security and Cooperation, combine the two \nnecessary requisites to serve in this role: a transatlantic dimension \nand proven operational capability.\n  The Brown amendment explicitly endorses and facilitates a process of \nNATO expansion. If passed, this amendment would authorize the President \nto establish programs to facilitate the integration of Poland, the \nCzech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary as well as other Central and \nEastern European nations into the alliance.\n  Passage of this amendment would be an important step toward \nestablishing a system of European security consisting of two pillars: \nan enlarged NATO and a strategic partnership between the alliance and \nRussia.\n  With the end of the Cold War, Central and Eastern Europe once again \nfind themselves outside of any viable security structure. The region \nis, in essence, a security vacuum between NATO's eastern frontier and \nRussia. Both recent- and long-term history show us that the region's \nstrategic vulnerability has been a source of instability on the \ncontinent--with calamitous consequences that drew the United States \ninto two World Wars.\n  Extending the alliance's membership to the nations of Central and \nEastern Europe, beginning with the nations of Poland, Czechia, \nSlovakia, and Hungary, will help transform this region from a source of \ninstability into a cornerstone of peace.\n  NATO enlargement would help facilitate the economic and political \nintegration of this region into the West. The absence of a stable \nsecurity environment only exacerbates fears and insecurities that \njeopardize the political and economic reform necessary for integration \nto occur.\n  NATO enlargement would project greater stability into Eastern and \nCentral Europe and thereby enable the \n\n[[Page S 12152]]\nregion's nations to more confidently focus on their internal \nchallenges. Mr. President, security is not an alternative to reform, \nbut it is essential for reform to occur.\n  I must add, Mr. President, that the adoption of this amendment would \nsend a much-needed signal of American support to the nations of Central \nand Eastern Europe and the reform efforts within them. It has been over \n5 years since the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and nearly 5 years since \nthe implosion of the Soviet Union. Many in Central and Eastern Europe \nhave been disillusioned with the West and the United States for our \nfailure to more aggressively embrace these nations into the \ntransatlantic community.\n  Mr. President, passage of this amendment would demonstrate the \nAmerica's commitment to consolidating an enlarged Europe, and it would \ngive more incentive to all the nations of Central and Eastern Europe to \ncontinue their reforms.\n  Second, two great European powers, Germany and Russia, are now \nundergoing very complex and sensitive transformations. Their outcomes \nwill be significantly shaped by the future of Central and Eastern \nEurope. The extension of NATO membership to Central and Eastern Europe, \nbeginning with Poland, Czechia, Slovakia, and Hungary, would positively \ninfluence the evolution of these two great powers.\n  Germany, as a consequence of the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and \nGerman reunification, has become more concerned about developments \nbeyond its new eastern frontiers. And today, Germany is more capable of \nindependently addressing her relations with Central and Eastern Europe.\n  Failure to adequately realize the integration of this region into the \nWest is likely to foster a more nationalist security policy in Germany. \nIn fact, this is a fear that Bonn's politicians and experts openly \narticulate. NATO enlargement would further lock German interests into a \ntransatlantic security structure and consolidate the positive role Bonn \nplays in European affairs.\n  NATO enlargement would also assist Russia's democratic evolution. It \nwould do so by enhancing Russia's own security and by bringing Europe \ncloser to Russia.\n  Of all of Europe's reborn nations, Russia is experiencing the most \nrevolutionary and difficult transformation. Following the collapse of \nthe Soviet Union, Russia is adjusting to the unraveling of an empire \nand the return to frontiers dating back to the 16th century.\n  By enhancing and reinforcing stability in Eastern Europe, NATO \nenlargement would make unrealistic the calls by Moscow's extremists for \nRussia's westward expansion. Greater stability along Russia's frontiers \nwill enable Moscow to direct more of its energy toward the internal \nchallenges of political and economic reform.\n  There are two other geopolitical dangers consequent to the \nperpetuation of isolation and insecurity in Central and Eastern Europe:\n  Isolation not only fosters the nationalization of the foreign and \nsecurity policies of Germany and Russia, but also of the nations within \nthe region.\n  Additionally, Eastern Europe's institutional separation from Europe \nand the West certainly sustains Russia's sense of isolation and thereby \nrisks revitalizing its historic sense of alienation from European \naffairs. These dynamics could well present unfortunate opportunities, \nif not incentives, for great power revanchism.\n  Mr. President, allow me to address some of the key arguments being \nmade against NATO enlargement:\n  Moscow's sensitivities are frequently highlighted as arguments \nagainst NATO enlargement. Proponents of this view claim that because \nRussia perceives NATO enlargement as part of an effort to isolate her \nfrom the rest of Europe, we risk prompting a more aggressive and \ndangerous Russian foreign policy.\n  It is absolutely essential that Russia not be given the false \nimpression that NATO enlargement is designed to isolate Moscow from \nEurope. That is why I support the establishment of a strategic \npartnership between the alliance and Russia. This intent is reiterated \nclearly and forthrightly in the Brown amendment.\n  At the same time we must not overreact to outdated Russian \nsensitivities at the expense of strategic realities and objectives \ncentral to the interests of the alliance, as well as the United States.\n  The fact is that Russia is far from being an isolated nation. Today, \nMoscow benefits from special bilateral relationships with the nations \nof the transatlantic community, especially the United States and \nGermany. It is a member of the U.N. Security Council, an active \nparticipant of the OSCE, and has recently become a member of NATO's \nPartnership for Peace program. Russia is a chief recipient of foreign \nassistance from the United States and the European Union, not to \nmention the IMF and World Bank.\n  In many ways, Russia enjoys far greater engagement with the West than \nis now enjoyed by any of our Central and East European neighbors.\n  Let me emphasize that it will not be NATO enlargement that will shape \nRussia's relationship with the alliance, but Moscow's reaction to \nenlargement. If Moscow resists the process through intimidation or \naggression, NATO enlargement will more likely be directed against \nRussia.\n  On the other hand, if Russia respects the rights of other nations to \ndetermine their own geopolitical destinies, if Russia recognizes the \nobjective benefits of NATO enlargement, and ultimately works with the \nalliance in this process, NATO enlargement will contribute to a broad \nprocess of engagement and integration that will bring Europe and Russia \ncloser together.\n  A second argument against NATO enlargement is that it risks creating \nnew and destabilizing lines within Central and Eastern Europe.\n  The fact is that our legislation works to eliminate lines from a \nbygone era by replacing them with a process of inclusion reaching out \nto all the nations of Central and Eastern Europe. Those nations that \nwould not be in the first group of states admitted to NATO would \nbenefit in two ways:\n  These nations would end up less isolated from the Alliance. They \nwould no longer be left on the distant fringes of a gray zone in \nEuropean security. Geographically, they would be closer to NATO, if not \nbordering the alliance. Most importantly, they would be part of a \nregion being actively integrated into the West.\n  A third argument one hears against our legislation is that it smacks \nof American unilateralism in Europe and would undermine NATO cohesion.\n  Mr. President, this legislation endorses a vision of European \nsecurity. It does not impose it upon our allies. It in no way \nundermines the Washington Treaty and its chapters governing the \naccession of new members. It does require the President to undertake \nprograms that will help the nations of Central and Eastern Europe \nprepare themselves for the responsibilities of NATO membership.\n  I can think of no European Ally that would oppose any of these \nprograms. By enabling the nations of Central and Eastern Europe to more \neffectively cooperate with the Allies, we are assisting the interests \nof all our Allies.\n  Mr. President, let me close by emphasizing that NATO enlargement is \nnot a unique historical step. It has already occurred on three separate \noccasions since 1949 with nations whose levels of democratic \ndevelopment at that time are clearly matched by that found today among \nthe nations of Central and Eastern Europe.\n  Enlargement is a process for which the alliance has always been \ngeared. Indeed, article 10 of the Washington Treaty provides for the \nenlargement of the alliance to any European state ``in a position to \nfurther the principals of this Treaty and to contribute to the security \nof the North Atlantic area.''\n  Mr. President, current policy is overly concerned with Russia's \npsychological well-being and insufficiently focused on central \nobjectives. America's policies toward Europe must be structured to \nshape a strategic landscape that enhances economic, political, and \nmilitary stability in all parts of Europe. That should be our national \ninterest--and that is the intent of the NATO Participation Act \nAmendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Brown \namendment be set aside temporarily so we may proceed with another \nBingaman amendment. \n\n[[Page S 12153]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2392\n\n  (Purpose: To strike out section 8082, relating to progress payments)\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2392.\n       On page 81, strike out lines 16 through 20.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment which I \ndo not think anyone should have any difficulty understanding. It \nrelates to the earlier amendment I offered only in one respect, in that \nI did propose to amend this same section there as well. But this does \nnot relate, I would point out to my colleagues who are here on the \nfloor, to the LHD-7. It does not relate to ongoing operations. It does \nnot relate to any specific funding program or any specific project in \nthe defense bill.\n  What it does is it says this provision which was included in the bill \nto require the Department of Defense to make 85-percent progress \npayments, rather than 75-percent progress payments as does the rest of \nthe Federal Government, should be stricken from the bill.\n  This is a particularly bad provision. This is section 8082 on page 81 \nof the bill. It says:\n\n       None of the funds available to the Department of Defense \n     shall be made available to make progress payments based on \n     costs to large business concerns at rates lower than 85 \n     percent on contract solicitation issued after enactment of \n     this act.\n\n  This provision, which I am proposing we eliminate from the bill, is \nparticularly objectionable because it is limited to large business \nconcerns. Why do we want to make 85-percent payments to large business \nconcerns and retain the 75-percent progress payment to any other \nbusiness concern, as is presently the case? Why do we want to have one \nset of rules which are more advantageous for defense contractors than \nthe set of rules we have for all other contractors?\n  I have great difficulty understanding the rationale for this. I am \nnot just raising this as a philosophical issue. According to the \nfigures we have been given, these five lines in the defense bill cost \nthe American taxpayer $488 million. This is $488 million that the \nDepartment of Defense is going to have to spend in the 1996 fiscal year \nmore than otherwise would be the case because of these five lines.\n  All I am saying is we have some other needs in this country besides \nspeeding up the rate at which we pay defense contractors. We need to \npay these defense contractors. They need to be profitable. We do not \nwant to fall behind on our payments. I agree with all of that. But I do \nnot see why it is in the best interests of the people I represent in \nNew Mexico, or the general public in this country, for us to spend $488 \nmillion in this way in the next fiscal year.\n  So I think clearly the merits are on changing this to just \neliminating this provision, allow us to continue the present \narrangement where we pay defense contractors just as we pay others, \nparticularly these large business concerns which are talked about in \nthis language.\n  Mr. President, in discussing the earlier amendment I also went over \nthis issue to some extent and pointed out that these so-called large \nbusiness concerns--I assume that term, although that is a fairly new \nterm, at least in any bill I have seen--I assume that within that \ndefinition of a large business concern you would include the 20 top \ndefense contractors that do business with the Federal Government. Just \nas in the previous debate I asked then to have printed in the Record a \ncopy of the financial performance of the top 20 Department of Defense \ncontractors during the first quarter of 1995, I again ask unanimous \nconsent we print that as part of this debate.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF TOP 20 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE CONTRACTORS                       \n                                               [1st quarter 1995]                                               \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                            Return on  Return on\n                        Company                           Profits      Sales      Assets      assets     sales  \n                                                        (millions)  (millions)  (millions)  (percent)  (percent)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMcDonnell Douglas.....................................     $159.0      $3,333     $12,026        5.3        4.8 \nLockheed-Martin.......................................      137.0       5,644       8,961        6.1        2.4 \nMartin Marietta (See Lockheed-Martin)                                                                           \nGeneral Motors........................................    2,154.0      43,285     188,201        4.6        5.0 \nRaytheon..............................................     173.90       2,387       7,258        9.6        7.3 \nUnited Technologies...................................      135.0       5,344      15,618        3.5        2.5 \nNorthrop..............................................       54.0       1,617       2,919        7.4        3.3 \nGeneral Dynamics......................................       60.0         753       2,635        9.1        8.0 \nLoral.................................................       94.8       1,459       3,228       11.7        6.5 \nGrumman (See Northrup-Grumman)                                                                                  \nBoeing................................................      181.0       5,037      20,450        3.5        3.6 \nGeneral Electric......................................    1,372.0      15,126     251,506        2.2        9.1 \nWestinghouse Electric.................................       15.0       2,024      10,553        0.6        0.7 \nLitton Industries.....................................       28.6         694       3,834        3.0        4.1 \nNational Steel & Shipbuilding.........................       44.7         753       2,304        7.8        5.9 \nRockwell International................................      191.4       3,361       9,885        7.7        5.7 \nTRW...................................................      114.7       2,596       5,336        8.6        4.4 \nTexas Instruments.....................................      230.0       2,862       5,993       15.4        8.0 \nTextron...............................................      109.0       2,387      19,658        2.2        4.6 \nTenneco...............................................      153.0       2,163      15,373        4.0        7.1 \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: Business Week Corporate Data.                                                                           \n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, when you go down this list it is a list \nof some of our best corporations. They do a superb job in supplying \nproducts and services for the Department of Defense: McDonnell Douglas, \nLockheed-Martin, Martin Marietta, General Motors, Raytheon, United \nTechnologies, Northrop, General Dynamics, Loral, Grumman, Boeing, \nGeneral Electric, Westinghouse Electric, Litton Industries, National \nSteel & Shipbuilding, Rockwell International, TRW, Texas Instruments, \nTextron, Tenneco.\n  Mr. President, I do not believe that these companies should get any \nworse treatment than any other company that does business with the \nGovernment. I think they should be treated well. The Government should \npay its bills on time. The Government should pay its bills promptly.\n  I think it is appropriate we make the customary progress payments as \nthey complete work on a contract. The customary progress payments are \n75 percent--you get paid for 75 percent of the work completed--then \nthere is some portion held back to ensure that the entire job is done \nwell and you can pay the rest at the end of the contract. That is the \ncustomary way in which contracting is done.\n  I do not think it is worth $488 million to the American people to \nchange that, just for this next fiscal year, and begin paying them an \nextra 10 percent as part of these progress payments. It just makes no \nsense to me.\n  I argued long and hard yesterday to try to get support from my \ncolleagues for $26 million in funding for Indian education. This was \nnot new money. This was to try to keep the 1995 level of funding again \nin 1996. We were turned down. People said there is not enough money, we \ncannot do it.\n  In light of that, if those are the circumstances we face, if we do \nnot have enough money, if we are trying to balance the budget, and \nclearly there is a legitimate desire to get to a balanced budget by \nmany Members of this body, then clearly people should support this \neffort to cut out this $488 million from the bill. So I urge my \ncolleagues to support the amendment. I think it speaks for itself. I do \nnot believe we will need additional time.\n  Mr. President, I address a question to the manager of the bill, the \nSenator from Alaska. If the Senator from Alaska could respond to a \nquestion, if he would like to have the same kind of arrangement of 2 \nminutes for and 2 minutes against prior to a vote on this, I would have \nno objection to that course of action.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I join in asking unanimous consent that when I make the \nmotion to table there be an understanding that before that vote there \nwill be 2 minutes on each side--2 minutes for the Senator from New \nMexico and 2 minutes for someone to oppose this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is my hope we will have another \namendment to present soon here. So we can hopefully stack the votes and \nhave a vote sometime around 4:30, hopefully, on all four of these \namendments.\n  We are looking for one other. We know there is one other that will \ntake about half hour on each side.\n  Let me say on this one that I understand the Senator from New Mexico. \nIt is a very technical issue that he has raised. Actually, the current \nprogress payment level that the Department is using now is 75 percent.\n  This is a regulation that is trying to force the Department of \nDefense to keep their progress payments at a specific level that deals \nwith outlays. That is why I say it is very technical. \n\n[[Page S 12154]]\nWe have outlays when we authorize funds. We authorize $1 million for \none project. They actually might spend half of that the first year. \nThat would be an outlay of 50 percent. If we have another project and \nthey only spend 25 percent the first year, it would be an outlay of 25 \npercent for the first year.\n  This is dealing with the outlays, and progress payments are related \nto those outlays in the current year. We have raised it to 85 percent \nbecause we have a surplus of outlays for 1996 as compared to \nauthorization. Therefore, that will force the Department to keep its \npayments up to make sure that we are not carrying over until the next \nyear payments that should be made this year. If they were not made this \nyear and carried over to the next year, it would mean we might not be \nable to use the authorizations that we have for the next year in order \nto bring about outlays in 1997.\n  Under the circumstances, I oppose the Senator's amendment, because \nthe fair way to keep the contractors coming to the Department of \nDefense to do work is to see that they are assured that they will not \nget less than a specific amount on their progress payments per a time \nperiod of the year. If they do not get the progress payments, they have \nto go out and borrow money to continue their operation, and it \nincreases the cost in the next year because, by definition, that \nbecomes a cost to the contract. And we are much better off when we have \nthe outlays available to force the Department to make their payments on \ntime and, therefore, reduce the amount of money that contractors borrow \nand later charge us the interest on the borrowing.\n  When interest rates are low, we are not that compelled to do this. \nBut when they get higher, there is an absolute compulsion to do it. \nThat is why I say we are dealing with a current regulation of 75 \npercent. We put this in. This is a provision of our bill that goes up \nto 85 percent. It will keep the contractors, particularly the smaller \ncontractors, as the Senator from New Mexico mentioned--I disagree with \nhim on his conclusion--this means smaller contractors will be more \nattracted to doing business with the Department of Defense.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 2 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is a misunderstanding, Mr. President. The 2 minutes \napplies to the time after I have made the motion to table. We want the \nopportunity for the Senator from New Mexico to explain his amendment \njust before the vote.\n  There will be a series of votes. Under this, there will be the third \nvote that we will have stacked. The Senator will have 2 minutes, and I \nor someone here will have 2 minutes to respond. I apologize to the \nChair for the misunderstanding.\n  But, again I say to the Senator, what we are doing is not only \nassisting the smaller contractors who want to work on defense business \nthis time. The normal payment, everyone realizes, would be 100 percent. \nIf you have a progress payment concept in your contract, you get 100 \npercent of your progress payments.\n  The Department of Defense was not keeping up with those payments. So \nwe said, ``You have to pay at least 75 percent. You can never fall \nbehind more than 25 percent in any progress payment period.'' Now we \nhave told them, ``You have to go to 85 percent,'' because that forces \nthem to assure contractors that they will get 85 percent of the \nprogress payments they are entitled to under the contract in 1996.\n  Again, I say to my friend, it is very technical. It is related to the \nSenator's first amendment because his first amendment would be subject \nto a point of order if it was not possible to have outlays available, \nand this amendment makes those outlays available. If the first \namendment were to carry, the second amendment would have to carry, too. \nAt least that is my understanding of the intertwining of them.\n  He also has a principle involved. I appreciate the principle. There \nis a disagreement between the two of us over what is accomplished by a \nprogress payment mandate.\n  I would be happy to let the Senator proceed. I do not know of anyone \nelse on this side who wants to have time. He understands that I will \nmake a motion to table when he has finished with his remarks.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator \nfrom Alaska. I will make just a few more remarks to clarify.\n  First of all, this amendment strikes a provision that sets up a \ndifferent procedure for progress payments to large business concerns. \nThat is what the statute says. It does not say small business. It says \nlarge business concerns. We set up a requirement for 85 percent \nprogress payments for large business concerns. The 75 percent which is \ncustomary in the industry remains the procedure for all others.\n  So this is not a way to help small businesses; this is a way to help \nlarge defense contractors.\n  To my knowledge, Mr. President, I do not believe anybody could come \nto the floor and critique or disagree with me on this.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would like to disagree. This is the second time the \nSenator made the point. The Senator realizes that under our provision, \nprogress payments for small business will rise to 90 percent and \nprogress payments for small disadvantaged businesses will rise to 95 \npercent because we have not changed the formula under existing law \nwhich forces the Department to pay small businesses higher than the \nlarger concerns. So if we set the larger concerns at 85, under existing \nprocedures the small business automatically is at 90, and the small \ndisadvantaged at 95.\n  So the Senator has implied that this does not apply to small \nbusiness. To the contrary, it applies to a greater extent to small \nbusiness.\n  Does he understand that?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate that clarification. The \nlanguage I am trying to strike out is limited to large business \nconcerns, and there may be some provision elsewhere that applies to \nsmaller businesses and their progress payments.\n  But let me again make the point that I was making initially. That is, \nwe do not have a problem with the profitability of our large defense \ncontractors. They are all profitable today. They are all reporting \nrecord profits today. Their stocks reflect that. In all respects they \nare doing extremely well. And I wish them well. I have no problem with \nthat.\n  I think the suggestion that the Senator from Alaska made that the \nnormal practice is to make 100 percent progress payments is just not in \nmy recollection of how business is done. I have been in Government a \nwhile. But I can remember before I got in the Government hiring \ncontractors to do some simple things like building an office building \nfor me. I had a contract where I made progress payments as that office \nbuilding was completed. There was no suggestion by any contractor that \nI should make 100 percent progress payments as we went forward. The \nunderstanding was we would keep back some of the money until the \nproject was completed, and that was an incentive to the contractor to \ncomplete the project on time and to my specifications.\n  So I can remember building an office project or an office building in \nSanta Fe, NM, and the progress payments there were 75 percent. I cannot \nbelieve that these various defense contractors whose names I read off \nbefore, which are some of the largest, most successful, most profitable \ncorporations in the country, are not used to doing business on the same \nbasis.\n  So the argument that we have to raise these progress payments this \nyear in order to look out for the financial well-being of these large \ndefense contractors is somewhat hard for me to believe. I strongly \nbelieve that we have here $488 million that we could save in this bill.\n  I think the simple truth is, this bill as it came out of the \ncommittee has in it nearly $1.3 billion of outlays; that the budget \nresolution, as I understand it, has about $1.3 billion of outlays that \nare not needed, and, therefore, we have provisions like this in the \nbill to try to soak up some of those outlays.\n  Mr. President, I do not believe it is reasonable to tell the American \npeople we are going to charge them $488 million next year in order that \nwe can advance these progress payments or increase them to 85 percent \nfor major defense contractors. We have other needs in this country for \nsome of this money. Clearly, if we have an extra $488 million, we ought \nto spend it on some of those other needs and not be spending it on this \nkind of provision.\n \n[[Page S 12155]]\n\n  So I do hope that my colleagues will support the effort to strike the \nprovision when it comes to a vote later.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, that again shows our disagreement. The \nSenator is correct. We have an allocation to our subcommittee of more \noutlays than we can use with the budget authority that was given us \nbecause a lot of the budget authority was taken away and used in areas \nwhere they do not have the outlays that we might have had.\n  We looked at this and we saw that there was a group of contracts out \nthere and if they increased the rate of compliance with existing \ncontract provisions now, they would use those outlays this year. If \nthey do not comply with the contract provisions, it shifts the money \ninto next year, where we might then have to use money under these \ncontracts and not be able to pay for the costs of whatever it might \nbe--the DDG-51's, the pay raise that is coming, whatever it might be. \nWe are asked now not to use this money because the rate of payment of \nbills is too slow. We are saying you must get at least an 85 percent \nlevel of compliance with your own contracts now in making payments for \ndefense contractors.\n  And again, when we say that it is based on the cost of large \nbusinesses, that automatically means that for small businesses it is 5 \npercent higher, and for disadvantaged small businesses it is 5 percent \nhigher than that. So what we are saying is use this money now. We do \nnot want you to stretch these contracts out because in doing so you \ncause the contractors to borrow money which goes on the next year's \nbill.\n  In addition to that, what it means is we are denied the ability to \nmeet the schedule for bringing on-line these other items that are being \nauthorized by the authorization committee. We will have to tell the \nauthorization committee, if we do not do this, next year we will have \nto tell them we are sorry, we did not use the outlays last year; we \nhave shifted them to next year, and although you have been authorized \nthis money we cannot allow you to spend it because we do not have the \noutlays to allocate to you.\n  This is an accounting principle, and the Senator is very astute in \nfinding it because most people would not find it. But we have done that \nfor the purpose of assuring that we do not fail to keep up with the \nrate of payment.\n  Incidentally, I am just a country lawyer. As far as I am concerned, \nif I submit a bill, they ought to pay 100 percent of it, right? And we \nfind they are not even paying 75 percent. This says you must pay at \nleast 85 percent of the progress payments that are presented to you \nthat are due and payable within the year 1996.\n  So based upon the understanding that we have, I do move to table the \nSenator's amendment with the understanding that we will have 2 minutes \non each side prior to the time that it will come to a vote, and we \nexpect that vote to come sometime, I would say, around 4:20, 4:30, \nbecause we are going to have another couple of amendments brought up \nhere.\n  I do make that motion to table with that understanding. Is that \nagreeable?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I have no objection to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has allowed 2 minutes to a side.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                        Striking of Section 8078\n\n  Now, Mr. President, I understand the Senator from Vermont has a \nstatement. But I also understand the Senator from Oklahoma has worked \nout an amendment with the Senator from Hawaii. If he wants to offer \nthat at this time, may we get this out of the way, I ask the Senator?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Yes. I am going to offer an amendment and withdraw it.\n  Mr. STEVENS. This will just take a minute.\n  Mr. INHOFE. This will just take a minute.\n  Let me compliment both the Senator from Hawaii and the Senator from \nAlaska for being understanding and looking at an amendment with which I \nhave a problem. I believe the section, which is 8078, clearly violates \nthe current statutory 60-40 relationship between contract and private \nmaintenance, inhouse depot maintenance.\n  I also believe that this section would violate the intent of the \nwhole BRAC process.\n  I appreciate very much the willingness of the Senator from Hawaii to \npull out section 8078, and I inquire of the chairman of the committee, \nis it necessary to propose it as an amendment?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that section 8078 \nbe deleted from the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INOUYE. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, this section would have allowed the Air \nForce to compete core workload. The Pentagon and the Congress have \nindicated that core workload is so critical to America's readiness to \ngo to war that this work must be done by the Pentagon in its depots.\n  In addition to this, the GAO has a draft report on this very issue \nthat indicates that competing the workload addressed in this section \ndoes not make sense based on the excess capacity in the Air Force \nDepots.\n  By striking this section of the bill, core workload is retained in \nthe Pentagon's depot system as outlined in Pentagon policy and title 10 \nof the U.S. Code. It also follows the recommendations of the GAO \nreport.\n  The effort to get this section stricken from the bill was truly a \nteam effort on the part of myself and my State colleague, Mr. Inhofe.\n  I want to thank my friend Mr. Inhofe for his efforts. I also want to \nthank the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee staff, as well as \nSenators Stevens and Inouye who have managed this bill in their \ncustomary fair and open manner.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I understand there is some \nmisunderstanding. I did move to table the first Bingaman amendment. If \nthere is any misunderstanding, for the Record, I again move to table \nthe Bingaman amendment with the understanding that there are 8 minutes \non a side for debate on that amendment when it first comes up.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2393\n\n          (Purpose: To provide funding for certain impact aid)\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nexisting pending amendment be set aside temporarily for the purpose of \noffering an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. The amendment is at the desk, I believe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2393.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 82, between lines 11 and 12, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 8087. FUNDING FOR CERTAIN IMPACT AID.\n\n       (a) In General.--Of the funds appropriated by the \n     provisions of this Act, $400,000,000 shall be available for \n     carrying out programs of financial assistance to local \n     educational agencies authorized by title VIII of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, of which--\n       (1) $340,000,000 shall be for payments under section \n     8003(b) of that Act;\n       (2) $20,000,000 shall be for payments under section 8003(d) \n     of that Act; and\n       (3) $40,000,000 shall be for payments under section 8003(f) \n     of that Act, which amount shall remain available until \n     expended.\n       (b) Limitations on Availability of Funds.--(1) Funds \n     available under subsection (a) shall be used only for \n     payments on behalf of children described in subparagraph \n     (A)(ii), (B), and (D) of section 8003(a)(1) of that Act.\n       (2) Such funds may not be used for payments under section \n     8003(e) of that Act.\n       (3) Such funds shall be governed by the provisions of title \n     VIII of that Act.\n       (c) Payment Amounts.--(1) Payment amounts for local \n     educational agencies shall be calculated by the Secretary of \n     Education under the provisions of title VIII of that Act \n     based on the total amounts provided to the Department of \n     Education and the Department of Defense for Impact Aid.\n       (2) The Secretary of Defense shall distribute funds to \n     local educational agencies based on calculations under \n     paragraph (1).\n       (d) Offset.--The amount made available by subsection (a) \n     shall be derived from a reduction in the amounts appropriated \n     by this Act. In achieving the reduction, a reduction of an \n     equal percentage shall be made from each account (other than \n     the amount from \n\n[[Page S 12156]]\n     which the funds under subsection (a) are made available) for which \n     funds are appropriated by this Act.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Let us step back for a moment and think about the big \npicture here. Our job is to set the priorities for the Nation, and in \ndoing so, restore the economic health of our Nation by putting the \nbudget on the path towards balance. If we fail to make spending cuts, \nour children will pay a terrible price. And if we make those cuts \ninappropriately, or by some strict formula without regard to merit, \nthey will pay an equally harsh price. Our job is to prioritize, to \ncarefully scrutinize the relative value of the various functions of \nGovernment and to decide how a shrinking resource base should best be \ndivided.\n  To do this exercise properly requires the ability to examine each \narea of the budget on its own merit and to move funds appropriately. \nPersonally, I believe that the construction of firewalls hinders that \nability. Firewalls separate off certain areas of the budget and remove \nthem from consideration, forcing us to make tradeoffs within certain \nlimited areas of the budget. However, I am aware that the Senate went \non record again last week in support of retaining the firewalls between \ndefense and domestic spending. And while I disagree with this decision, \nsince it has prevailed, we must look carefully at the full implications \nof that policy.\n  The premise of firewalls is that the Department of Defense should not \nhave to pick up the tab for nondefense spending. And should not the \nreverse also then apply--that other departments should not be picking \nup the tab for costs incurred by the Department of Defense? I believe \nso, and I think the majority of my colleagues will agree with me.\n  One area where the Department of Defense has traditionally enjoyed a \nreprieve from carrying its full weight is that of impact aid. Current \nlaw recognizes that local communities surrounding military \ninstallations incur costs in the education of military dependents that \nare not collectable in the traditional manner of local governments \nbecause the installations do not pay taxes to the towns. Impact aid was \ndesigned to offset these costs and ensure that military children are \nnot relegated to a second-rate education.\n  But, Mr. President, the funding for impact aid currently comes \nentirely out of the Department of Education. Yet, this is clearly a \ncost incurred by the Department of Defense. DOD has accepted the \nresponsibility of bearing the full costs of educating military \ndependents overseas--why should it be allowed to shirk its \nresponsibility for offsetting the costs that it incurs at home?\n  The amendment that I am offering on behalf of myself and Senators \nHarkin and Simon does not increase Federal spending by one dime. Nor \ndoes it effect in any way the formula devised for distributing aid to \nimpacted communities. All it does is to ensure that DOD pick up the \ncosts it incurs instead of continuing to pass those costs off to the \nDepartment of Education. If we are to have firewalls, Mr. President, \nthen it is only fair that they be respected in each direction.\n  It is important that my colleagues recognize the backdrop against \nwhich we are operating. While defense spending has declined in the past \ndecade, it has done so only moderately, particularly in the context of \na greatly reduced threat to the security of the United States. The \ndisappearance of our chief adversary entitles the American people to \nreap some of the fruits of this hard won victory. And this must \ntranslate into being able to direct some of our national investment \naway from armaments and into the real bulwarks of national defense--a \nsound economy, a vibrant technological base and a topnotch educational \nsystem.\n  But this is not what we see happening here. Federal spending for \neducation has been cut. Since 1983, education's share of total Federal \nexpenditures decreased by more than 25 percent, falling at a time when \npoverty is on the rise. More than one-quarter of all our future front-\nline workers are now growing up in poverty, a statistic unparalleled \namong advanced industrialized nations.\n  And compared to these competitors, our students are failing. \nThirteen-year-olds in the United States are at the bottom in math and \nscience performance, subjects which are key to our future economic \nviability, scoring lower than 15 competitor nations. We have already \nbegun to see the consequences as our students fall farther behind. Over \nthe past 20 years, real income in the United States has grown at a rate \n5 times slower than in Canada, 6 times slower than in Germany, 7 times \nslower than in Italy, France, and Japan, and 8 times slower than the \nUnited Kingdom.\n  More than half a trillion dollars in GDP is lost each year because we \nfail to educate our people. We spend $208 billion in welfare \nexpenditures and $200 billion for employment training. In addition, the \nfact that 50 percent of adults in this country are functionally \nilliterate costs the marketplace $225 billion in lost wages each year.\n  Thus, this amendment goes beyond the Washington rhetoric of arcane \nbudgetary terms such as fire walls. This goes to the heart of the \ndefense of our country--our education.\n  Mr. President, I offer this amendment because I think it is an \nincredibly important issue of concern to a great number of Members. \nHowever, let me inform my colleagues that it is my intention to \nwithdraw the amendment and to propose it on the authorization bill when \nit comes up later. I am confident that there will be general support \nfor this issue when it is fully understood.\n  As I have said previously, my first concern is with education. I am \nnot going to speak at length, as I have to my colleagues in the past, \nabout the serious problems this Nation faces with respect to its \neducational programs. I only point out that our deficiencies seriously \nthreaten our economic capacity and our ability to have the best trained \npeople engaged in the defense of this Nation. Instead, I would like to \ntalk about the children of military personnel and about the history of \nwhat this Nation did to make sure the communities in which they reside \nand are educated are not punished by a loss of property tax revenue.\n  Some 40 years ago or more, I believe back as far as 1949, impact aid \nwas designed to assist local communities educate the children of our \nmilitary personnel.\n  Impact aid makes payments to local education agencies to make up for \nthe shortfall of funds to the communities in which they reside. The \npurpose, therefore, was to help military kids. After the creation of \nthe Department of Education, funding for impact aid was transferred to \nthe Department. However, the payments still are made to the local \neducational agencies.\n  So I believe the history is clear that these costs are incurred by \nDepartment of Defense personnel, and the fact that it is now funded out \nof the Department of Education does not change that. I believe upon \nfurther study of this issue my colleagues will agree with my conclusion \nthat this is not a firewalls issue.\n  The House has made roughly a 10-percent cut in impact aid. Those of \nus who represent not only military children but all of the children of \nthis country are going to look at areas where we can, under the force \nof the budget, shift the funding responsibilities for those programs \nwhich rightfully belong in other departments. There is no question that \nhistory establishes the obligation for impact aid with the Department \nof Defense.\n  At this particular time in our history, to quote a very fine \neditorial from David Broder, it is ``just plain dumb'' to be cutting \neducational funds, whether those funds are used for establishing the \nnecessary standards to make sure we are competitive worldwide or \nwhether they are used for the general education and the general health \nof the Nation. It is just plain dumb to be cutting our investments in \nhuman capital--which would otherwise increase our revenues and decrease \nour social costs--while attempting to eradicate the deficit.\n  So, Mr. President, I would like to say that it is an obligation of \nthe Department of Defense to take care of its own children. They do \nthat now in the DOD schools. They send direct payments to the DOD \nschools. The DOD also sends direct payments to local educational \nagencies, but those funds are being cut back. They are not, however, \ncutting back the funding for DOD schools. \n\n[[Page S 12157]]\n\nHence, my goal is to ensure equal provisions for the education for the \nchildren of our military personnel. It is a perfectly legitimate issue \nto raise. Please note, though, that we are not discussing or \nconsidering other impact aid provisions which should rightfully be the \nresponsibility of the Department of Education.\n  Mr. President, I do not intend to speak much longer, but I want to \nreiterate that I do not believe this is a question of firewalls or \nanything else. This is a question of making sure that the Department of \nDefense lives up to its obligation, created in 1949, to pay for the \ncost and the impact of military children on local districts.\n  I hope that we will consider this issue at the appropriate time and \nvote to ensure that DOD takes its money to help the children of its \nmilitary personnel. That is my intent. At the appropriate time I will \noffer the amendment again.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from Vermont raised \na very complex and meaningful issue. It involves not only the subject \nhe raised, but also involves the complexity of payment in lieu of taxes \nthat are paid to communities because of nontaxable Federal property \nwithin their jurisdiction.\n  It does seem to me that we have to particularly now as we enter into, \nI hope, a long peacetime era where there are going to be fewer of these \ninstallations and less impact, really, on schools, that we try to find \na more fair way to deal with those situations where the children of \nmilitary dependents do have an adverse impact on school districts. The \nimpact aid concept was created for that purpose.\n  Now, we actually have communities competing for these bases. It is \ndifficult, on the one hand, to have people competing for bases, and \nthen when they get them, for us to be in the position where the \ntaxpayers should provide the assistance for programs such as impact \naid.\n  I think the Senator--my feeling is we should have really some \ndialogue between the committee on which he serves and the authorization \ncommittee, chaired by the Senator from South Carolina, and the Senator \nfrom Hawaii and myself, to see how we can find a way to transition this \nmoney to the Department of Defense.\n  We do not want to get to the position where once it is not coming out \nof your budget, that your committee feels that you can raise this \nstandard higher and higher because it is coming out of the Department \nof Defense funds. On the other hand, we do agree, when we are living \nunder a cap, that the Defense impact should be met from Defense funds.\n  I am prepared to make a commitment to the Senator that we will work \nwith him and with the Armed Services Committee to try to fashion a \nprogram that will give us the advice of those who do have the oversight \non education assistance from the Federal Government, while at the same \ntime striking the proper balance between authorization and those of us \nwho must find the money to pay the bill.\n  I appreciate the willingness of the Senator to withdraw the amendment \nand congratulate him for bringing the issue forward, because it can be \nvery meaningful to generations of children whose parents are serving in \nthe armed services.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the Senator for his remarks. I know we are both \nconcerned about this issue and want to make sure that all the young \npeople of this country, including the children of military personnel, \nreceive the best education possible. And that can only be done if we \nall work together and share costs in an equitable fashion. I look \nforward to working with the Senator on this issue.\n  As I said, I also intend to offer this amendment before the \nauthorizing committee at the appropriate time to stimulate a similar \ndiscussion and perhaps pursue it further.\n  Mr. President, I withdraw my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 2393) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I want to commend the able Senator from Vermont for \nbringing up this question. In some cases school districts are put at a \ngreat disadvantage where they have large numbers of schoolchildren and \ndo not get impact aid. I think it is a matter we have got to consider \nin some way, somewhere, by somebody. I want to commend the Senator for \nbringing this question forward and commend him for withdrawing it so it \ncan receive careful consideration by all the people considered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the Senator and yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2394\n\n (Purpose: To strike out section 8083 relating to payment of invoices)\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, if it is appropriate at this time, I \nwill send another amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2394.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 81, strike out lines 21 through 23.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this is in some ways a companion \namendment to the one that I just offered a few minutes ago. The lines \n21 through 23 on page 81, which I am proposing to strike, read as \nfollows:\n\n       Section 8083. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     the Department of Defense shall execute payment in not more \n     than 24 days after receipt of a proper invoice.\n\n  Mr. President, to the uninitiated that seems like a very apple pie \nkind of a proposal. Who could argue with that? The problem with that \nproposal, Mr. President, is that it will cost the American taxpayers, \nin fiscal year 1996, $750 million to advance payment by 6 days from \nwhat has been the custom in government and in industry throughout the \nWestern World. So, Mr. President, this is a concern.\n  Let me go to the bottom line here. We are requiring the Department of \nDefense to spend an extra $750 million next year by paying its bills in \n24 days rather than in 30 days. We are saying by the language that I am \ntrying to strike out of the bill here--if the language stays in there, \nwe are saying that paying our bills 6 days earlier is a higher priority \nthan providing funds for education, even funds for education of \nmilitary personnel, such as the Senator from Vermont was talking about \njust a few minutes ago. We are saying that paying these bills a few \ndays early is a higher priority than funding health care. We are saying \nthat this is a better use of funds than anything else we have been able \nto come up with.\n  Mr. President, the simple fact is, the provision in the bill that I \nam trying to strike out, it is not a serious provision to try to speed \nup payment of Government bills. If the Appropriations Committee wanted \nto speed up payment of Government bills by the Department of Defense \nand require the Department of Defense to pay its bills more quickly \nthan any other agency of Government, then clearly what they would do is \nprovide additional funds, additional staffing to our various \ncontracting centers so they could gear up to do this.\n  If this became law, this would put a significant burden on those \ncontracting centers which no other agency of the Federal Government has \nto deal with and, in fact, which no private firm has to deal with. I do \nnot believe there is a private firm in this country that has a policy \nof paying its bills in 24 days rather than 30 days.\n  Let me explain to my colleagues what, with this requirement of paying \nbills within 24 days rather than 30 days, really is going on here.\n  Earlier this year, much of the discussion about our defense spending \nwas that the problem we had in our defense spending was inadequate \nfunds for readiness. We had hearings in the Armed Services Committee, \nand we had speeches given saying that we had neglected readiness; the \nClinton administration had neglected readiness. So the Budget Committee \nadded both budget authority and outlays for the defense accounts, \nassuming that some of that \n\n[[Page S 12158]]\n\nwould go to operations and maintenance, which is what we use to fund \nour readiness accounts.\n  Instead, all of the additional funds that we are adding to this bill, \nthis $7 billion, in fact, and in the authorization bill, all goes to \nprocurement and R instead of to readiness. So they have $1.238 \nbillion in outlays left over.\n  These two provisions, the one that my previous amendment addressed \nand the one that this amendment is addressing, are provisions that are \nsimply put in this bill to soak up those outlays and to preserve those \nuntil they get to conference, so that they can go to conference and \nhave those available to be spent by the conferees on other activities.\n  Obviously, they are not going to keep this provision in law. There is \nno intention to do so. I believe this is not good policy. It would be \nmuch better to strike these out and admit that the budget resolution \nmade a mistake. If we are not going to put the money into readiness, as \nwe originally thought we would at the time the budget resolution was \nwritten, if the problem now is weapons modernization, what we see \nreflected in the defense bill, the defense appropriations bill as well, \nthen let us shift these outlays to the domestic subcommittees.\n  We can use these funds in the Labor-HHS Subcommittee, we can use them \nin the VA-HUD Subcommittee, we can use them in the Interior \nSubcommittee, which we had a very difficult time with yesterday when we \nwere considering it on the floor because of the drastic cuts which were \nrequired to be made in the accounts that are under the jurisdiction of \nthose subcommittees.\n  So, Mr. President, that is what is really going on here. There is no \nlegitimate effort to try to speed up the payment of bills by the \nDepartment of Defense. What we are doing is we have some provisions in \nhere--this one that I am trying to deal with in this amendment will \ncost the Department of Defense $750 million. So if it is dropped in \nconference, then there will be $750 million of outlays available for \nuse somewhere else by the committee conferees.\n  I think we are much better off, the American people are much better \noff, if we recognize we do not need these outlays, given our change in \nthe situation as we see it. We do not need these outlays in the \nDepartment of Defense for these purposes and, accordingly, they should \nbe spent elsewhere, or they should be applied to the deficit.\n  There are a lot of people out there in the country who figure if you \ndo not need to be spending that $750 million, you should not spend it. \nThat is a hard thing for me to argue with, Mr. President. I do think \nthe better part of valor would be for us to adopt this amendment and \nthat way not have to explain to people in our home States why it was \nworth $750 million to them for the Department of Defense to pay its \nbills 6 days early.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I know others wish to debate the \namendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, again, it is a difference of agreement \nhere, but this is money that is owed to private entities, individuals, \nby the Department of Defense. President Bush ordered that all such \npayments must be made within 23 days once they are declared to be due \nand payable. That was moved back to 30 days because of the need for \noutlays in a bill in 1994. It was not done by this committee; I think \nit was done by the authorization committee. Someone did it.\n  The impact of it is that, to the contrary of what the Senator from \nMexico says, the further they push out, the sooner the interest is due \nand payable. This is not a situation where this will save the \nGovernment any money by delaying them. To the contrary. It is a budget \ncalculation that you save the money for a particular period, but it \nbecomes due later and, as a matter of fact, it pyramids. So that in the \nnext year, you owe more money and you have to have greater outlays \navailable to make the payments.\n  If the DOD pays valid invoices in a timely manner, it reduces the \ncost to the taxpayers and it is a simple thing. When you get a bill \nfrom a credit card--how many have credit cards? What does it say? Pay \nit in 30 days or you pay interest. Now, that is exactly what our law \nsays: Pay it in 30 days or you pay interest. But beyond that, if you \npay it sooner, you do not have to have the problem of carrying over, in \nsome instances, into the next year. This amendment has the effect of \n$750 million, that if you take it out and put it back in the 30 days, \nit means theoretically you do not have to spend $750 million in fiscal \nyear 1996. But guess what? You have to pay that same $750 million out \nin the next year and you have to have a greater amount of outlays \nallocated to you to accomplish that and pay other bills that are also \ndue in 1997.\n  We are moving back toward a concept of simply saying, ``The \nDepartment of Defense, pay your contractors within the 30-day period.'' \nAs a matter of fact, we are calculating that they should pay them \nwithin 24 days, and if we do that, this provision will help small \nbusinesses, again, because they will be able to survive with the DOD as \na customer since they know their bills will be paid promptly.\n  If they are paid promptly, then they do not have to go down, again, \nand borrow money to carry over until the Defense Department pays their \nbills. When that happens, on the next bid, the small businessman or \nperson has to increase the cost to the Government to pay for the cost \nof carrying their business because they were not paid on time. It is \n$150 million a day that theoretically you do not have to have outlays \nfor, but guess what? It is not something that goes into a savings \naccount, because it does have to be paid. We are saying pay these \ninvoices on time, pay them in a timely manner, reduce the cost of doing \nbusiness with the United States and you will get a better price as we \ngo on, and that has been proven.\n  I do hope the Senate will support us with the concept that is \ninvolved here. Again, I have to confess, and I congratulate the Senator \nfrom New Mexico on his work and his staff's work, we would not be able \nto do this if we did not end up with a year that we had outlays that \ncannot be used because we do not have the budget authority. But since \nwe do that, if we move them now to 24 days, we do not have to do \nanything next year. There is no savings or loss by keeping that \nschedule. You have a savings or loss where you change it for the \npurpose of increasing the outlays or decreasing outlays. We have the \noutlays available to get this back on time.\n  I say it is a good place to allocate those outlays. They are going to \nspend money by paying bills that are due promptly. That cannot hurt the \neconomy.\n  As a matter of fact, I was raised to pay them when they come in the \ndoor and not wait the 30 days. The assumption is they are going to wait \nat least 24 days before they make the payment on a bill that is \npresented for payment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Let me just respond very briefly. I am not arguing we \nshould not pay our bills promptly. I pay my bills promptly. I am sure \nthe Senator from Alaska pays his bills promptly. All of the commercial \npractice that I am aware of calls for people to pay their bills within \n30 days. That is the practice in the Department of Defense; that is the \npractice in the Department of Commerce; that is the practice in the \nSenate; that is the practice of VISA, Mastercard, and anyplace else you \nlook. I think there is no problem with that. I am not trying to disturb \nthat.\n  All I am saying is that we can save $750 million in outlay for use \nsomewhere else in the budget by not having this provision in here that \nartificially says let us speed up the payments in the Department of \nDefense. There is not a serious effort to speed up payments in the \nDepartment of Defense. If there was a serious effort, if it was really \na priority for the Congress to get these bills paid in the Department \nof Defense in 24 days rather than 30, like everybody else in the \nWestern World--and maybe the Eastern World, too--I would say put some \nmoney into these contracting centers; give them additional people. Let \nus tell them to get these things out the door. I have heard no \ncomplaints in my office about them not paying their bills on time. I am \njust saying, here is $750 million in outlays that can be better used \nsomewhere \n\n[[Page S 12159]]\n\nelse in the Federal budget. We cannot get the smallest amounts of \nfunding added to for these activities.\n  The Senator from Vermont was here talking about the importance of \neducation. I have heard so many speeches about the importance of \neducation. You ask your colleagues to support adding $20 million to \neducation and you would think you asked for Fort Knox. Here we have \n$750 million of budget authority--$750 million that is in this bill \nsimply to speed up the payment of our bills out of the Department of \nDefense. It is not a priority, Mr. President. It is something we ought \nto strike out of here. I hope my colleagues will support the efforts to \ndo so.\n  As I understand it from the earlier statements of the Senator from \nAlaska, he intends to move to table this amendment. We will have 2 \nminutes of debate on each side prior to the final vote, is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I must oppose this amendment. Much has \nbeen said, but there are two items. One, it is the policy of this \nNation--and we have an act that says we shall promptly pay our debts; \nthat is the law of the land and the policy of the land, to make prompt \npayments.\n  Second, among the many reasons we used to justify this change was a \nvery simple one. We have gone through a very painful period in the \nhistory of our Defense Department, a period of BRAC. As a result, many \nfine companies, many manufacturing plants have had to close their doors \nor to send yellow slips to their employees. And we felt that by \nspeeding up the payment process, we would save them money and provide \nthem the resources to recoup.\n  Mr. President, it is true that when we went from 30 days to 24 days, \nwe knew it would cost the Government about $700 million. We could have \namended the Prompt Payment Act and gone from 30 to 36 days, and we \nwould have saved--if that is the argument--$750 million. But we felt \nthat the time had come that with this pain that we are inflicting upon \nthe people of the United States, we should do whatever we can to \nprovide some relief. Keep in mind that for each large procurement--take \nthe B-2--it is not the big companies that are involved; there are 200 \nsmall subcontractors. They are the ones who want prompt payment; they \nare the ones who will suffer, and they are the ones who send out the \npink slips.\n  So, Mr. President, I must oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, some of the centers have a policy to pay \nin 10 days. But the overall rate is somewhere around 29, 30 days. We \nare moving it back because of the reasons stated by the Senator from \nHawaii. For 2 years, by the way, a study showed that they actually paid \nin an average of 23 days. It was faster than we are requiring now, but \nit was slipped because of the pressure of trying to obtain outlays.\n  So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we have a period of 2 \nminutes for Senator Bingaman to explain his position, and 2 minutes on \nour side to explain the opposition to Senator Bingaman's amendment.\n  I make a motion to table his amendment based upon that unanimous-\nconsent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Did the Senator from Alaska ask for 2 minutes \nand 1 minute?\n  Mr. STEVENS. No, 2 minutes on each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Does the Senator move to table the Bingaman amendment?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  I now ask unanimous consent that the amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from North \nCarolina wishes to comment. And the Senator from Arkansas is here to \noffer another amendment. When he finishes his amendment, we will try to \nhave a vote on all five of the amendments that will be available for us \nto vote on at that time. I have not been able to determine from the \nSenator from Arkansas how long he will take. We will do that soon and \nannounce to the Senate when we expect to vote on the five amendments \nthat will be stacked.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I have been in three successive meetings \nall afternoon long, each dealing with a different aspect of foreign \npolicy. I have lost track of what is going on the floor. Am I to \nunderstand that you have four amendments in line now? I make that \nparliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five amendments have been set aside for votes.\n  Mr. HELMS. Is the amendment of the distinguished Senator from \nColorado [Mr. Brown] one of the five?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is one of those set aside but not set for a vote as \nyet.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No time has been set for any vote, but the \nBrown amendment, as I understand, has been called up and set aside.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I will try to clarify the situation as I \nunderstand it. We have the Dorgan amendment, three Bingaman amendments, \nand the Bumpers amendment to come.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, on behalf of the distinguished majority \nleader, Mr. Dole, Senators Lieberman, and McCain, and myself, I shall \nmomentarily send a bill to the desk to be read for the first time and \nappropriately referred.\n  I will pause here just a moment, Mr. President, to ask a \nparliamentary inquiry. Inasmuch as what I am to discuss--and Senator \nDole will be here momentarily to make his comments. We are introducing \na bill to be properly referred. Is it necessary that we ask unanimous \nconsent to lay aside any amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The introduction of a bill is in order only \nduring morning business, so the Senator should request unanimous \nconsent to proceed as in morning business.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, on behalf of the majority leader and \nmyself, I ask unanimous consent in that regard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I will defer to the majority leader because \nhe has another appointment that he needs to make.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, \nwill the Senator allow me to make a unanimous-consent request on what \nwill happen after?\n  Mr. HELMS. Certainly.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent, on an amendment offered by \nSenator Bumpers, there be a 1-hour time limit, 45 minutes for the \nSenator from Arkansas, and 15 minutes for the opponents.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That will follow the introduction of the bill by the \ndistinguished leader, and the Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dole and Mr. Helms pertaining to the introduction \nof S. 1157 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after the \nBumpers amendment I be able to offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  \n[[Page S 12160]]\n\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2395\n\n  (Purpose: To reduce the amount of total contingent liability of the \n           United States for defense export loan guarantees)\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2395.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 69, strike line 3 and insert in lieu thereof the \n     following: ``section may not exceed $5,000,000: Provided \n     further, That the exposure fees charged and collected by the \n     Secretary for each guarantee, shall be paid by the country \n     involved and shall not be financed as part of the loan \n     guaranteed by the United States,''.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I do not know what the people were \nthinking last fall when they swept the Democrats out of Congress and \nturned it over to the Republicans. But I can tell you one thing that I \ndo not think they were thinking. I do not think they intended for us to \ndesign yet one more way to sell arms in the international market. We \nhave four methods on the books right now; four--count them. We have \nfour ways that the arms merchants of this country can finance arms \nsales to other nations. You would think that would be enough. Obviously \nit is not. We have a fifth one in this bill.\n  No. 1, most people do not know it but the President can guarantee any \nloan from any company to any country. That is a powerful thing for the \nPresident. He does not often exercise the power. But he has it. Then \nevery year when we pass our foreign operations bill--the bill that the \nordinary man on the street in this country thinks is going right down a \nrat hole--a good big portion of that is for weapons, $1.5 billion for \nEgypt, $1.5 billion for Israel. If anybody wants some weapons, stand in \nline. We will give them to you. If you cannot afford them, we will \nfinance them for you. That is called the Foreign Military Financing \nProgram; No. 2.\n  No. 3, securities assistance: The Securities Assistance Program I \nthink is also in the foreign operations program. I am not sure. But \nthat is where we finance a country-to-country sale. I assume we take \nweapons out of our stock, out of our inventory, to sell to somebody \nelse, and we finance it; No. 3.\n  No. 4, 3 years ago I fought like a saber-toothed tiger to keep the \nEximbank out of the arms financing business, and succeeded marginally. \nWe kept the Export-Import Bank from selling tanks, howitzers, \nairplanes, and lethal weapons. But they now are permitted to finance \nnonlethal military equipment. I guess that means tents and blankets and \nanything that will not explode.\n  Now here is the fifth one in the DOD authorization bill.\n  I get too loud when I am on the floor of the Senate. But I feel so \nstrongly about these things I guess it is irresistable to express my \ncontempt for the United States to be the leading arms merchant of the \nworld, and now we are setting up yet another program to make it easier \nfor countries to buy all the weapons they want. Do you know who most of \nthese countries are? They are people that are starving their own people \nto buy weapons. That is the moral dimension to arms sales.\n  But here is the financial dimension. This bill that we have before us \nright now provides for 15 billion dollars' worth of credits to sell \narms to foreign countries. I am going to tell you this is a real enigma \nto me. I do not understand it nor has anybody been able to explain it \nto me. They say it will work just like the Export-Import Bank works. \nYou pay a fee. You bear in mind that this is not set up yet. The \nauthorization bill directs the Department of Defense to set this \nprogram up and to guarantee loans from arms manufacturers in this \ncountry to about 37 different nations. Turkey, for example, who cannot \nafford a turkey sandwich will be eligible. I do not mean to demean \nTurkey. They have been a reliable ally of ours. But they are a poor \nnation. They cannot afford it. But here is $15 billion in this bill.\n  Just so you will know. I did not drag that figure out of thin air. On \npage 68 of the bill, section 8067, ``To the extent authorized in law, \nthe Secretary of Defense shall issue loan guarantees in support of U.S. \ndefense exports not otherwise provided for, provided, that the total \ncontingent liability of the United States for guarantees issued under \nthe authority of this section may not exceed $15 billion.''\n  My colleagues, all you tight-fisted budget balancers who ran last \nyear and promised the American people how you were going to balance the \nbudget, go home and tell them that there is $15 billion in this bill \nthat is not even scored, and does not count for anything.\n  When I sit down I want the managers of this bill to tell us how we \ncan assume $15 billion in contingent liabilities and it not cost us one \npenny. In my 21 years in the Senate I have never heard--my staff tells \nme there are a couple of examples like that--but I have never \npersonally heard of us assuming a $15 billion liability and it does not \ncost us anything. It sounds like the good old days of the S's in the \nlate 1980's to me.\n  So how does this work? An arms manufacturer comes to the Defense \nDepartment and says, ``We have country A and they want to buy 500 \nmillion dollars' worth of weapons from us, and we sure would like to \nsell them because we have 3,000 people working in plants that will \nproduce this 500 million dollars' worth of weapons.''\n  The DOD which wants to set this program up will say, ``Well, you have \nto pay a fee.''\n  ``How much?''\n  ``One percent.'' What is 1 percent of $500 million? The authorization \nbill says this will be paid either by the country that is buying the \nweapons or by the company that is selling them.\n  I strike company in my amendment. Do you know why? Everybody here \nknows that a company will say, ``Look. This is really $500 million.'' \nBut you do not have $5 million to pay the fee. ``We will pay it for \nyou.'' And the sale price will be $505 million. So instead of charging \nthem $500 million, they charge $505 million. And they get their $505 \nmillion, and they turn around and put $5 million of it in the DOD \ntreasury as the guarantee.\n  I say if we are going to do it--you all know we debated this the \nother night. I tried to strike this in the authorization bill. I think \nI got 40 votes, and when you have 100 Senators and you only get 40 \nvotes, you lose. I lost.\n  But I am saying that if you are going to go forward with this \nprogram, which I deplore, at least make the purchasing country put up \nthe fee. If they do not have enough to pay a 1- or 2-percent fee, \nwhatever it happens to be, they certainly have no business obligating \nthemselves for such massive amounts--98 percent and 99 percent--more \nthan they can come up with even for the guarantee.\n  Mr. President, right after Desert Storm we had a field day. In 1993, \n1994, and 1995, we sold 54.5 billion dollars' worth of weapons. \nIncidentally, some of these countries we sell these weapons to American \nmen often get the opportunity to face those weapons because those \nweapons last longer than our friendships. I was in Iran in 1976 when \nthe Shah was trying to buy every single weapon we would sell him.\n  I went to an airport in Tehran. It was loaded with F-16's. And he \ncould hardly wait for us to produce the F-18. He wanted that one, too. \nAnd the Shah wanted weapons and a strong military not because of an \nexterior threat but because that was the way he solidified his power. \nNow, unhappily, he was replaced with a government that was just as bad, \nbut all these dictators want weapons to make sure nobody challenges \ntheir authority. And he was no exception.\n  So now one of the people we classify as one of the most likely \nadversaries of the United States is Iran. Iran has a big arsenal of \nweapons that we sold them, and they are considered one of the four most \nlikely adversaries we will ever have to face.\n  Vietnam, what an arsenal we left when we left there. The Vietnamese \nwere rich with American weapons, and they sold them to the contras. \nThey sold them to Cuba. I never liked the idea of selling the Afghans \nStinger missiles. One Stinger missile can hold any international \nairport in the world hostage. A terrorist can simply say: We \n\n[[Page S 12161]]\nhave a Stinger missile. Any airliner coming into this country and into \nthis airport is going to get it at some point. The whole city and the \nwhole country is terrified as a result.\n  I am not sure how many Stingers we sold to Afghanistan. I voted no, \nno, no, and yes. It came up constantly because we felt the Afghans \ncould make the Soviets losses so great they would pull out. And let us \nface it; it pretty much worked. But there is a problem. We do not know \nwhat happened to all the Stingers. Iran --I mention Iran again--got 35 \nof them, so I am told.\n  So Iran, which is considered a terrorist nation, is in a position to \nhold 35 international airports hostage thanks to Uncle Sugar.\n  That is all just a way of coming back from whence I started. This \nprogram has not even been set up. My amendment says it is not likely to \nbe set up and very many sales made before we argue these points again \nnext year. My amendment says, therefore, let us cut this $15 billion \nauthority to $5 billion. We are only planning on selling 10 billion \ndollars' worth of weapons in foreign sales this year which, \nincidentally, will probably be about 52 percent of all arms sales in \nthe world except France made a couple of big airplane deals so they \nhave quite a few weapons to sell this year. They will be a player. But \ntoday we sell 52 to 53 percent of all the weapons sold in international \ncommerce, and by the turn of the century we will be up to 59 percent.\n  Let me ask my colleagues, for a brand new program, never been tried, \nwe do not know how it is going to work, do you think it makes more \nsense to start with a $5 billion authority or a $15 billion authority \nwhen we are only likely to sell a total of $10 billion from all sources \nin the coming year? And that will include foreign military, the foreign \nmilitary sales program that is in the foreign aid bill, the securities \nassistance programs, the Export-Import Bank program, any arms weapons \nthat the President guarantees the price of. Do you not think $5 billion \nis going to be enough?\n  But here is the real clinker in this whole thing. How do we guarantee \n$5 billion or $15 billion with no liability? As I say, that beats the \nS crisis. We are going to take a fee from these people to sell \nweapons and if they default, as Egypt did in 1990 to the tune of $7.1 \nbillion, DOD has to pay it. Where do they get it? Congress gives it to \nthem. Where does Congress get it? Right out of the pocket of the old \ntaxpayer.\n  I have been through this defense bill for 20 years. This is one of \nthe most bizarre things I have ever seen. They put $15 billion in there \nas though it is chump change and say sell 15 billion dollars' worth of \nweapons and, Congress, do not worry; do not score it; it does not count \non the deficit. If all these people default, you have to cough up $15 \nbillion, but we will worry about that later.\n  It is the height of irresponsibility to pass something like this. But \nI have already tried to kill the program without success. So now I am \nsaying for God sakes, do not put $15 billion in a brand new program \nthat nobody has a clue as to how it is going to work. I feel like the \nmost magnanimous person in the world by saying $5 billion is enough.\n  When the managers of this bill take issue with this amendment, I do \nnot want them to overlook telling my colleagues in the Senate how you \nput $15 billion in authority here to finance 50 billion dollars' worth \nof weapons, a good portion of which we will wind up paying for because \nthese countries will default on. Only the least creditworthy countries \nare going to opt for this. I want you to tell my colleagues where the \nmoney is coming from.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I send a modification of my amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n       On page 69, strike line 3 and insert in lieu thereof the \n     following: ``section may not exceed $5,000,000,000: Provided \n     further, That the exposure fees charged and collected by the \n     Secretary for each guarantee, shall be paid by the country or \n     company involved and shall not be financed as part of the \n     loan guaranteed by the United States;''.\n  Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, if the Senator from Hawaii will yield, \njust for edification we inadvertently put in $5 million instead $5 \nbillion.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I have been advised the Senator from Connecticut wished \nto be recognized to speak against the amendment.\n  Does the Senator from Connecticut wish to be recognized?\n  Mr. President, may I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes are yielded to the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the amendment offered \nby my friend and colleague from Arkansas.\n  Mr. President, there is a sense of deja vu about this because we did, \nas the Senator from Arkansas has indicated, argue this out in an \namendment he submitted to the Department of Defense authorization bill \non the subject, which was an attempt to actually do away with the \nprogram entirely. Here in this amendment he aims to diminish the \nguarantee authority from $15 billion down to $5 billion.\n  I was pleased to initiate this proposal with my colleague from \nConnecticut, Senator Dodd, and with my colleague from Idaho, Senator \nKempthorne. I believe Senator Kempthorne is on his way to the floor to \nspeak against the amendment that has been offered.\n  There is a basic point here to which I do want to go back, which is \nthat we are talking here about a way to make sure that the American \ndefense industry can compete on a level playing field with the defense \nindustries of other countries that are competing in the area of arms \nsales around the world.\n  Mr. President, part of why we feel this is necessary and why it is a \ndecent investment--in fact, a cost-free investment--is because all the \nfees are paid by those who are beneficiaries of the program. We \nobviously are in a time where the resources we are devoting to defense \nare shrinking. There have been some arguments here about whether we are \nspending too much in the defense authorization bill or in the \nappropriations bill for defense purposes before us now as others have \nsaid before me. We are spending for defense at a percentage of GDP that \nis historically low. And the world, with the cold war over, remains a \ntroubled world.\n  But let us leave that macroeconomic data aside. The fact is that each \nof us knows--and I can speak to this with painful intimacy coming from \nthe State of Connecticut--our defense industries are cutting back. \nThousands of people are being laid off who had good jobs and are having \ntrouble providing for their families. That, of course, is just the \nworst experience for them.\n  But what is at risk is the capacity of our country to maintain an \nindustrial base for defense purposes so that we are capable of at least \nturning out a reasonable, if not minimum, number of weapons systems and \nequipment that we can use to defend our national security, but also to \npreserve these defense factories, to keep them alive, even if at a \ndrastically reduced level, so that in case of some future conflict or \ncrisis we will have the ability to surge, to build more; we will not \nhave to recreate these industries.\n  One way to do it, frankly, is for American defense companies to be \ninvolved in arms sales throughout the world. This is not a case of \nAmerica sort of pushing arms on people who do not want them. This is a \ncase of a demand for arms that will be satisfied either by American \ncompanies making weapons, made by American workers, or that demand for \narms will be satisfied by foreign defense companies employing foreign \ndefense workers. And what our companies find increasingly is that they \nare losing contracts to other defense companies from other countries \nbecause their governments have defense loan guarantee systems.\n  This is the basic principle of the Eximbank which has been so \nimportant to American exporters generally, which, generally speaking, \nthe American defense industry is prohibited from employing that we are \nnow attempting, through the creation of this program, to extend in a \nlimited way \n\n[[Page S 12162]]\nwithout risk here, limiting the number of countries that can be \nsupplied with weapons. And when we went through this before, my friend \nfrom Arkansas cited many countries. But let us be very clear about it. \nThe only countries that can participate are NATO allies, our major non-\nNATO allies, or qualified Central European and APEC non-Communist \ncountries in Asia. That is a total of 37 countries. The program \nmechanics that are set up are structured so that defaults are highly \nunlikely and a country that has any record of risk will have to pay \nvery high administrative fees.\n  Mr. President, this is a 2-year program. Reports are required on the \ncost, benefits and recommendation for modification. The $15 billion \nlimit which is in the defense appropriations bill that is before us now \nperhaps will not be reached, although the truth is that in this area $1 \nbillion is a sale number that recurs over and over again. So we have to \nsee what develops.\n  The authorizing language in the Department of Defense bill requires \nthat a fee be paid incrementally in proportion to the amount of the \nguarantee issued. And I think that is in its way a response to the \nsecond part of the amendment offered for my friend from Arkansas.\n  I saw an article in the paper the other day. I say, finally, Mr. \nPresident, unfortunately I did not cut it out, and I do not have it \nwith me. But it said in one category, in a large category of arms \nsales, that last year the French actually replaced the United States in \nsales. French sales doubled. American sales were cut in half. And that \nis a significant development which has implications for the jobs of \nthousands of workers here in our country and in defense plants and has \nimplications, as I indicated, for our industrial base.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair and look forward to returning as the \ndebate continues.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat the amendment as they did defeat a \nsimilar amendment on the DOD authorization bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, Senator Bumpers' amendment will limit the \nability of the Government to guarantee loans for defense exports to $5 \nbillion.\n  Now, that seems reasonable at first blush. But this is the situation. \nI am told that we are in a period of reduced spending for domestic \nrequirements for defense systems and defense equipment. At this time \ndefense exports make a significant contribution not only to the \npreservation of U.S. jobs and industrial base, but to the extent they \nare successful, actually lower the unit cost of the defense production \nthat we must acquire if there is a wider market throughout the world \nfor the produce that comes out of our major defense industries.\n  Now, we have found that in the international defense export market, \nit is a very competitive market and one that is very difficult for a \nU.S. defense company to deal with, unless it can offer the same kind of \nproposal that its competitors can offer.\n  Particularly this is so because the market financing is one of the \nmain factors, a decisive factor, in what is the cost of the loans. \nThese guarantees give our U.S. industrial base the opportunity to be on \na level playing field with industries from governments that do not just \nguarantee loans, they actually loan their industry money.\n  Now, the Department of Defense has indicated to me that it strongly \nsupports this program because it gives the U.S. industrial base the \nopportunity to compete in the world market and will reduce the cost of \nour acquisition of systems in the future.\n  This amendment was proposed to the Senate Armed Services Committee \nlast week. That was defeated by a substantial amount. I do believe that \nthe Senate should be reminded we voted against this amendment just last \nweek by a vote of 41 to 58. Now, it is our intention to oppose the \namendment and to make a motion to table when all time has expired.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes 7 seconds.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I see the Senator----\n  How much time? Five minutes?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Five minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield the Senator 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Thank you. And I want to thank the floor manager.\n  I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by my friend from \nArkansas. The Bumpers amendment proposes to limit the amount available \nfor the self-financing--I stress the self-financing--export loan \nguarantee program at the Department of Defense.\n  As the Senator from Alaska pointed out, last week we dealt with this \nvery issue. The amendment was defeated 41-58. The program provides \nfinancing for defense sales to a very selected list of countries that \nmeet all the existing export controls and nonproliferation policies of \nthis administration. It grants the administration the authority, but it \nis not a requirement that they must utilize this program.\n  It is also important to note that the authority is not limited \nstrictly to arms. In many cases American companies lose bids to \nmaintain or upgrade previously sold military equipment because they \ncannot offer financing.\n  The program in the defense authorization bill will allow U.S. \ncompanies and American workers to compete on a level playing field with \nour international competitors. Today almost every major arms exporter \nprovides financing to support the export of their domestic products and \nservices.\n  Indeed, some purchasers now make financing a requirement before a \ncompany can bid on a proposed purchase.\n  The program is financed by fees paid by the buyer or the seller. \nBased upon the exposure fees charged by the Export-Import Bank, the fee \nis determined by the creditworthiness of the buyer. Therefore, a high-\nrisk buyer is excluded by the high-exposure fee which makes the loan \ntoo expensive for them to even enter into.\n  The list of eligible countries is limited to our NATO allies, \nnonmajor allies, Central European countries moving toward democracy, \nand selected members of the Asian Pacific economic cooperation group.\n  Of the 185 members of the United Nations, only 37 countries would be \neligible for this program.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the list of those 37 \ncountries be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                     The List of Eligible Countries\n\n       1. Albania.\n       2. Australia.\n       3. Belgium.\n       4. Brunei.\n       5. Bulgaria.\n       6. Canada.\n       7. Czech.\n       8. Denmark.\n       9. Egypt.\n       10. France.\n       11. Germany.\n       12. Greece.\n       13. Hong Kong.\n       14. Hungary.\n       15. Iceland.\n       16. Indonesia.\n       17. Israel.\n       18. Italy.\n       19. Japan.\n       20. Luxembourg.\n       21. Malaysia.\n       22. Netherlands.\n       23. New Zealand.\n       24. Norway.\n       25. Philippines.\n       26. Poland.\n       27. Portugal.\n       28. Romania.\n       29. Singapore.\n       30. Slovakia.\n       31. Slovenia.\n       32. South Korea.\n       33. Spain.\n       34. Taiwan.\n       35. Thailand.\n       36. Turkey.\n       37. U.K.\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, as a result of our defense downsizing, \nAmerican companies continue to lay off thousands of U.S. defense \nworkers every month. This program will help us avoid paying \nunemployment for the defense workers of America and help us preserve \nthe United States defense industrial base.\n  It makes sense to sell U.S. defense systems and services to our \nfriends and our allies, assuming those countries \n\n[[Page S 12163]]\nqualify for the equipment under our existing export controls.\n  The House-passed defense authorization bill includes similar \nlanguage, and in a strong bipartisan vote, the House voted 276 to 152 \nto keep this language in the bill.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, I stress again this certainly is far \nmore advantageous than us paying unemployment benefits to American \nworkers who are unemployed. It allows us to keep our defense base in \nproduction. It allows us to have capacity, should we need it, to again \nprovide for the needs for this country. This program goes through the \nexisting safeguards that are in place for nonproliferation, and it is \nan authority. It is not requiring the administration to do so. It is a \ntool that can help our allies, that can help our friends, but it also \nis significantly going to help the American worker.\n  With that, I yield my time back to the floor manager and yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-seven minutes and eighteen seconds.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I yield such time as the Senator from Illinois may \nrequire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Arkansas, and I \nthank him for this amendment.\n  There is only one flaw with this amendment, and that is it still has \n$5 billion in it. It should not have anything.\n  Do you know what the total amount owed by all countries through the \nyears, the accumulated amount right now is? The total amount owed by \nother countries right now is $16 billion. This will, for all practical \npurposes, double.\n  We do from time to time forgive loans to other countries, and I have \nvoted for them. I am not critical of this. But when we make these loans \nfor weapons--Egypt, for example, we forgave $7 billion. I voted for it. \nPoland, I forget what the amount was we forgave. That did not happen to \nhave any weapons in it. Jordan we forgave.\n  I note the presence on the floor of Senator Lieberman from \nConnecticut who was mentioned, that this came as a suggestion from \nSenator Lieberman and Senator Dodd. They are two of the finest Members \nof this body. But even a fine Member can be wrong, and the State of \nConnecticut which has a lot of defense industry happens to have the \nhighest per capita income of any State in the Nation. We should not \nshed too many tears for people in Connecticut, and certainly should not \nburden the taxpayers of the United States of America with $15 billion \nworth of debt.\n  We are already far in excess of where we ought to be in this defense \nappropriation. We are spending more than the next eight countries \ncombined. If you look back to 1973, I say to my colleague from \nArkansas, put the inflation factor on and we are spending more today \nthan we were in 1973 on defense. Then we were in Vietnam, we had twice \nas many troops in Europe, we had a cold war, we had a totally different \nsituation. And here, through the back door--and that is really what is \ngoing to happen--through the back door, the Defense Department and the \nU.S. taxpayers are going to guarantee $15 billion worth of weapons to \nany country that defaults. Guess who automatically, not through a vote \nhere--at least in the case of Egypt, the case of Poland, the case of \nJordan, we had to have a vote on the floor of the United States Senate. \nNow it will just be automatic for any country that defaults.\n  I think it is not sound policy. We talk about deficits, and we let \nsomething like this get out and we will pick up a huge, huge burden.\n  Let me ask my colleague from Arkansas a question. If Ford wants to \nsell some Fords to some other country, do the U.S. taxpayers guarantee \nthose sales?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, the answer to that is ``yes,'' under \ncertain conditions, the Export-Import Bank would finance it.\n  Mr. SIMON. The Export-Import Bank would finance it only to the extent \nthat there may be a risk to that government.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Absolutely.\n  Mr. SIMON. It is not this kind of a guarantee.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I might also say that is not a 100-percent guarantee \neither.\n  Mr. SIMON. Right. In fact, we will say to the defense industry, ``You \nare going to get preferential treatment over Ford, Chrysler, and \nGeneral Motors. You are going to get preferential treatment over \nfarmers who want to sell grain.'' Any nonmilitary exporter, you are in \nthe second tier. The preferential treatment goes to the defense \nindustry. That does not make sense.\n  As I said in my opening remarks, there is only one thing wrong with \nthis amendment. He leaves $5 billion in there. I wish we did not have \nthe $5 billion in, but I know the Senator from Arkansas is trying to be \npractical.\n  What we are doing, if we approve this--there is no question for those \nwho say this will be great for the defense industry, they are right. \nThis will not be great for the taxpayers of America. I commend my \ncolleague from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I thank my very distinguished colleague \nand good friend from Illinois for his comments. When he leaves the \nSenate, there is going to be a great big void. He has been the \nconscience of this place on so many occasions.\n  I cannot say that particularly about myself, but I do not know who \nhas fought many more laudable but losing causes than I have, unless it \nis the Senator from Illinois.\n  I say to my colleague, it is tough to shape this place up, is it not?\n  Let me just close with a few remarks. First of all, my good friend \nfrom Alaska, the chairman of the committee, said the administration \nsupported this. Here is what, 10 days ago, the White House said in its \nStatement of Administration Policy:\n\n       The bill would require the Secretary of Defense to \n     establish a program to issue loan guarantees ensuring against \n     losses arising from the financing of Defense exports to \n     certain countries. The administration opposes this program \n     because the administration has not found it necessary given \n     the availability of existing authority for transactions of \n     this type and the substantial American presence in \n     international markets for military equipment.\n\n  So we are not alone. The administration also opposes this.\n  No. 2, let me just remind my colleagues--because our memories grow \ndim around here in about 2 days--George Santayana said, ``Those who do \nnot understand history are doomed to repeat it.'' Voltaire, a long time \nbefore that, said, ``History does not repeat itself; men do.''\n  We never seem to learn around here. We just keep making the same \nmistakes and paying heavy prices. But I agree with Bill Perry: We do \nnot need this program. Let me ask you this. Who here wants the United \nStates to guarantee arms loans to Albania? Who here wants to guarantee \narms sales to Bulgaria? Who here wants to guarantee loans to the \nPhilippines? Then there are Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia and Romania. \nThey are fine countries. But are they good credit risks? How many of \nyou want to stand up and say, I think this is a jim-dandy idea to \nfinance weapons to those countries? People are staring in the streets \nin some of them. It is almost obscene to encourage them to buy weapons.\n  Do you remember the big agricultural loan program to Iraq? We really \ndid not want Iraq or Iran, either one, to win the war, and it looked \nfor a time as though Iran might have a little of the upper hand, so we \nstarted financing agricultural sales to Iraq. It went the same way as \nwhen our weapons are turned against us. Look where Iraq is now--a \nmortal enemy, and we are paying off $2 billion in agricultural loans \nthat we guaranteed to Iraq. But that has been 10 years ago, and the \nSenate just cannot remember that far back.\n  The Senator from Illinois, a moment ago, said that we are spending \nmore money than our eight most likely adversaries. I hesitate to \ncorrect my good friend, but the truth is that we spend twice as much as \nour eight most likely adversaries, including Russia, China, Iraq, Iran, \nNorth Korea, the whole schmear--twice as much as all of them combined.\n  What has been the record on the four programs we have in existence \nright now in arms sales? I am not absolutely sure of this, but I think \nNorway and Israel are the only two nations that have been totally \nreliable in paying their \n\n[[Page S 12164]]\ndebts to us. Already this year, we have forgiven Jordan $300 million \nthey owe us for arms, and I was for it because they have been \ninstrumental in the Middle Eastern peace process. But $300 million \nwhere I come from ``ain't bean bag.'' I also voted to forgive Egypt the \n$7.1 billion in 1990, because they are an important ally. But you are \ngoing to be voting for a lot more of those if you pass this thing.\n  The worst argument I know of for arms exports is jobs. Let me say to \nthe Senator from Connecticut right now, you vote against this program \nand I will vote for whatever you want up to a billion dollars to \nattract industry to Connecticut.\n  Did you see where Virginia just got a new deal for a chip \nmanufacturing company? It did cost Virginia some money, $165 million. \nBut compared to financing $500 million worth of weapons and \nguaranteeing them to a poor country that can't afford them, that is the \nbest deal Virginia will ever pull off, and it is the best deal for the \nUnited States Government.\n  So, when it comes to jobs, I promise you, with what we are going to \nwind up paying out of this program, we could create three times as many \njobs as the arms industry is going to get out of this program.\n  Another argument is: ``If we do not do it, somebody else will.'' The \none thing my father told me when I was a kid is, ``I do not want you to \nbe like others. I do not want you to do things just because everybody \nelse is doing it.'' I suspect I am not the only Member of the Senate \nwhose parents ever admonished him on that point. He expected more of \nme. But, above all, he wanted me to think for myself and do what I \nthought was right, not just because somebody else was doing it. And we \nare going to sell these weapons because if we do not, somebody else \nwill. Let them. Why should we be immoral just because somebody else is \nimmoral?\n  Finally, Mr. President, I know, after my 21 years in the Senate, what \nthis is; this is a foot in the door. You get this program firmly in \nplace, and next year it will not be 37 countries eligible, it will be \n50. And the year after that, it will be 60. I have never, in 21 years, \nseen that prediction fail. It is the nose under the tent.\n  So, Mr. President, I have done my best to talk sense on this issue--I \nam sure to no avail. The Senator from Alaska will move to table. Some \nMembers will walk in that door not having a clue as to what was said in \nthis debate, and they will vote however he tells them to vote. Serious \nindictment, but true. And they will go home to the Chamber of Commerce, \nand if there is an industry in that town that has an overseas sale, \nthey will take credit for it. And if the taxpayers wind up having to \npay that loan off, you will never hear that mentioned in the same \nChamber of Commerce banquet.\n  Let me tell you a little anecdote that has nothing to do with this \ndebate. But I have chided the Senator from Idaho about the amendment he \noffered the other night on the hard rock mine law reform that said \nmining companies will be required to pay the fair-market value for the \nland. I squealed like a pig under a gate, and you could have heard me \nin Charleston, AR, about what a sham that was. The truth of the matter \nis that the land has no value; $10 per acre will cover most of it. It \nwas the billions of dollars worth of gold under that ground I was \ntalking about.\n  Anybody that voted for that, who does not come from a mining State, \ncan go home, and if somebody asks him a question in a town-hall \nmeeting, ``How come you voted to give away $15.5 billion worth of gold \nthe other night to the richest mining companies in America,'' he can \nsay, ``I also voted to make them pay fair-market value.'' They will not \ntell you it was just for the surface and not the minerals. Who in that \nroom is going to know the difference?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I point out to my good friend from \nArkansas that section 8067 says, ``To the extent authorized in law, the \nSecretary of Defense shall issue loan guarantees in support of U.S. \ndefense exports not otherwise provided for.''\n  We go on to say that total contingent liable, ``the total guarantees \nunder this authority may not exceed $15 billion.'' We are putting a \nlimitation on existing law. The law, by the way, is contained in the \nauthorization bill that has not passed yet. We are really putting in \nthis section a limitation on a law that may be enacted in September.\n  It is a total outstanding guarantee and cannot exceed $15 billion. In \nview of the amount that we do, in fact, procure ourselves, that is \nreally not an extensive amount in the worldwide scene to try to make \nsure that our allies and those who are aligned with the United States \nare able to provide the defense that we rely upon them to provide.\n  Does the Senator from Connecticut desire to speak?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I ask for the Senator to yield the remaining time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Two points. The Senator from Alaska made the point, I \nthink convincingly, about why the $15 billion was chosen.\n  Second, the Senator from Arkansas keeps talking about leading some \nprograms to conclude that we are granting money, these billions of \ndollars to foreign nations.\n  These are loan guarantees. Every other loan guarantee program, and \nthe fees, are paid by those who use the program, and they have default \nrates that are extremely low. The State of California has operated a \nprogram like this for 10 years. The default rate is just under 1 \npercent.\n  Finally, to my friend from Illinois, it is true we have the highest \naverage income in Connecticut, but believe me, it is not based on those \nwho work in the defense industry. They are losing their jobs. This bill \nwill save thousands of those jobs and keep those workers and their \nfamilies at a decent level.\n  A final example, in the State of Connecticut the Norden defense \nindustry operation was forced to move some of its production to Canada \nin order to qualify for the Canadian export defense loan guarantee \nprogram to allow Norden, a Connecticut company, to sell to a foreign \nbuyer. Mr. President, 72 jobs leave Connecticut.\n  This bill will turn that around.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven minutes are remaining.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I will take just a minute, Mr. President, to remind my \ncolleagues of one thing: The bill allows the company selling the \nweapons to pay the guarantee fee.\n  Think about that. They can either add it to the price of weapons and \nthen finance the entire thing, thereby financing effectively the fee \nthat they have paid, or they can have such a cushy profit in whatever \nthey are selling they will say we will sell them for $16 million apiece \nand we will pay the fee. If the fee is 1 percent and their cost is $12 \nmillion for that product, they still have a bonanza.\n  I want Members to think about this: Here is a loan program that is \ngoing to make every other program pale because the company--if you do \nnot vote for this amendment--the company can pay the fee and finance it \nas part of the loan that is guaranteed by the taxpayers.\n  So everybody that wants weapons and do not have the money to pay for \nthe weapons, and do not even have the money to pay a fee of 1 percent \nor 2 percent, the company will pay it. And Uncle Sugar is going to be \nheld for the principle of the loan.\n  I still do not understand how we can obligate ourselves for $15 \nbillion in this bill and not have a dime scored against the deficit or \nagainst this bill. It is in the bill--$15 billion. The Senator from \nAlaska says we have not authorized that yet; that is only because we \nhave not passed the Defense Authorization Bill yet. Passing that is as \ncertain as the Sun coming up in the morning.\n  I am not even trying to kill the program. I have tried that already \nand got 41 votes. I am trying to reduce our liability from $15 billion \nto $5 billion just for 1 year. They do not need $15 billion. They have \nnot even got the program in place yet.\n  Colleagues, for God's sake, do your duty. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask that we proceed with the amendments \nthat have been set aside, calling up first the Dorgan amendment for \nfinal consideration, with time for an explanation.\n  This amendment would cut national defense spending by $300 million. \nThe arguments have taken place. The spending here in this bill is \nconsistent with the levels in the Senate Armed Services authorization \nbill. \n\n[[Page S 12165]]\n\n  The same amendment was defeated by a vote of 51 to 48 last week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the amendments will \nbe considered in the order they were offered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Will the Senator from Oklahoma yield for just a second? \nI failed to yield back the balance of my time and I am prepared to do \nthat.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2377\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield 3 minutes on the Dorgan amendment to the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from Alaska for yielding this time.\n  At the risk of sounding redundant, I do not feel badly about that \nbecause the Senator from North Dakota has been redundant in his \ndiscussion of this effort to take the money out of our national defense \nsystem.\n  I think what we need to do is be sure we understand that we have \nvoted on this amendment before. This amendment has failed before. This \nis the same amendment. It is not changed at all. It is taking $300 \nmillion out of what we feel is necessary to put ourselves in a position \nto have a national missile defense system of some sort by the time the \nthreat is here by the year 2000.\n  The assumption from the Senator from North Dakota is that there is no \nthreat out there, that the cold war is over and the threat is no longer \nthere. Yet at the same time, the former security adviser to the \nPresident of the United States, Jim Woolsey, has said we know between \n20 and 25 countries that have developed or are developing weapons of \nmass destruction either nuclear or chemical or biological, and they are \ndeveloping the missile means of delivering those weapons. Five of those \ncountries are North Korea, Iraq, Iran, Libya, and Syria.\n  We learned in the Persian Gulf war that the technology of the short-\nrange missiles is there. It is a reality. It works. The Scud missiles \nwere aimed at Israel and Saudi Arabia and our United States troops. In \nfact, 28 of our troops, the largest single casualty in one incident, \nwas the result of a Scud attack.\n  The CIA has now said the Taepo-Dong I intercontinental missile should \nbe ready by the year 2000, and it is ironic that the two managers this \nafternoon are from Hawaii and Alaska. The Taepo-Dong I intercontinental \nmissile would have the capability of reaching both of those States by \nthe year 2000.\n  It is something that is here. It is upon us now. Even though the CIA \ncame out and said a long-range missile is not likely, not likely by the \nyear 2005, not likely is not enough security for me to ignore the fact \nthat we have a $38 billion investment in a system that could be ready \nfor deployment in the year 2000.\n  We have talked about this before, but the threat is very real. The \nintelligence community agrees that the threat is real.\n  As I asked the Senator from North Dakota when we debated this \nearlier, what if you are wrong? What if it is the year 2000 instead of \nthe year 2005? We have an opportunity right now. This is not Star Wars. \nThis is not a fantasy. This is a technology that is here today, with a \ncombination of land-based missiles, Aegis missiles, the 22 ships we \nhave that are ready for the upgrades.\n  This is a system that can be improved upon now. We can come up with \nat least a modest method of defending ourselves by the year 2000.\n  For those who may have seen on television from my home State of \nOklahoma the devastation that took place with the Murrah Federal \nBuilding, standing outside as I was, on April 19, 20, and 21, not \nknowing how many people were alive and dead in that building, and you \nmultiply that disaster by 1,000, that is what we are potentially faced \nwith.\n  All we are trying to do is keep the $671 million to keep the \ndevelopment going so we can be ready by the year 2000 in the event the \nthreat is there at that time. It is very reasonable.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against it as they did before on the \nDorgan amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of time on our side \non the Dorgan amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Dorgan, I yield the \nremainder of his time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on the Dorgan \namendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, may I make a statement before we start? \nIt is our intention, following this amendment, to have a dialog \nconcerning further amendments after this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent the votes to follow this amendment, there are \nfour others that will come immediately thereafter, will be limited to \n10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Reserving the right to object, I understood from the \nSenator from Alaska there would be a 4-minute hiatus between each vote \nto be equally divided between the proponents and opponents of each \namendment, 2 minutes each.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator is correct. That may be extended in some \ninstances. But the request I have just made limits the time within \nwhich to take the rollcall. It limits the time of the rollcall, not the \ntime preceding the rollcall. I renew my request.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Will the Senator consider making that a part of the \nrequest, for 4 minutes in between each vote?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I say to the Senator from Arkansas, there are at least 2 \nminutes on each side before each vote. I have been informed there may \nbe a request for additional time before one or two of the votes, and we \nare prepared to yield that if it is necessary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Vote On Amendment No. 2377\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on agreeing to the \nDorgan amendment No. 2377.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Bradley] \nis absent because of illness in the family.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber who desire to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 45, nays 54, as follows:\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 384 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--45\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Chafee\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hatfield\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--54\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Packwood\n     Pressler\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Bradley\n       \n  So the amendment (No. 2377) was rejected.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I call attention to the fact that this next vote will be \na 10-minute vote, and under the agreement we will have now a series of \nvotes. Just before the votes we have 2 minutes on each side to explain \nthe amendment.\n  Senator Bingaman has 2 minutes.\n  It can be yielded back.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2390\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Chair. \n\n[[Page S 12166]]\n\n  Mr. President, this amendment is sponsored by myself, Senator \nLautenberg, Senator Exon, and Senator Kerrey from Nebraska.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to provide in this bill funds for \nthe highest priority that the Secretary of Defense has identified if we \nare in a position to provide any additional funds in this defense bill.\n  As everybody here knows, the administration asked for a certain level \nof funding, and this body is adding $7 billion to that pursuant to the \nbudget resolution. The Secretary told us in the Armed Services \nCommittee that if we had any additional money--not if we had $7 \nbillion, but if we had anything extra--we should fund what he \nconsidered ongoing operations. Those are the two operations going on in \nIraq--one in northern Iraq and one in southern Iraq--we should fund the \nrefugee support at Guantanamo, which is ongoing, and we should fund the \nhumanitarian support and the deny-flight activities in Bosnia. He said \nat a very minimum next year he is going to have to spend a total of \n$1.188 billion on those activities.\n  We did not in this bill fund that, and what I am proposing in this \namendment is that we go ahead and fund that as he requested. In \naddition, we reduce the outlays in the total bill by $111 million.\n  Now, the offset is to cancel, at least for this year, or put off, I \nshould say, the funding of an amphibious assault ship, the LHD-7. This \nis a ship which the Department of Defense said they would like to come \nto Congress and request funds for 6 years from now, in the year 2001--\nnot 1996, the year 2001.\n  The appropriators have taken the request for the 6th year and moved \nit forward into this next year. We do not need this ship next year. \nThis would be the 12th LHD amphibious assault ship that we are buying. \nThere are two under construction now. We just christened one in \nFebruary of this year.\n  Mr. President, it is not a priority for the Pentagon. It was not \nrequested by the Pentagon in this year's budget, and it was added by \nthe appropriators. We should delete the funding for that and spend it \non the top priority of the Department of Defense. That is what the \namendment does. I hope my colleagues will support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this does subtract $1.3 billion for the \nLHD-7. It is the top priority for the Marine Corps and the Navy. The \nSecretary of Navy has reaffirmed support of the LHD-7. It is authorized \nin the authorization bill.\n  I have moved to table. I yield back the remainder of my time. I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a suffered second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on agreeing to the \nBingaman amendment No. 2390. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. This is a 10-minute rollcall.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are going to proceed to the next \nBingaman amendment. Senator Bingaman has asked for the right to have 2 \nminutes before the second and third amendments. He would like to use \nfour amendments now and have the two amendments run without any \nintervening debate. I so ask unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for 4 minutes.\n\n\n                      Amendment Nos. 2392 and 2394\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 of the 4 minutes. If I \ncan be notified at the end of that time, then I will yield the last \nminute to the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. President, these two provisions, which are the subject of the \nnext two amendments, are provisions which are hard to understand unless \nyou understand the context.\n  The first of these amendments strikes a provision that is in the bill \nthat increases progress payments to defense contractors from 75 percent \nto 85 percent. It is for large defense contractors. There is clearly no \nneed for us to do this. All of these contractors are profitable. There \nhas been no complaint about the current procedure where we pay 75 \npercent in progress payments. This provision is in the bill not to \naddress a need. It is in the bill simply to soak up $488 million in \noutlays which the Defense Subcommittee did not want to leave unused.\n  This provision would also deny all discretion to contracting officers \non whether or not to make these payments, even if the contractor is not \nperforming. They would have to make 85 percent progress payments if \nthis provision remained in the bill, which it will not. This provision \nwill be dropped in conference, and the funds that are protected here, \nas outlays, will be used for other purposes. That is the whole idea of \nhaving this provision in the bill.\n  There are better uses for this $488 million in outlays. We could use \nit for deficit reduction, we could use it for some domestic accounts. \nClearly, I urge my colleagues to vote to strike the provision. \n\n[[Page S 12167]]\n\n  Let me also address the second of these. The second provision is also \ndesigned to soak up outlays in the bill--$750 million of outlays, to be \nspecific. It requires the Pentagon to pay its bills in 24 days instead \nof in 30 days like everybody else in the commercial world and in \nGovernment. There is not a serious effort to speed up payment. When \nadded to the previous provision, what it does is it protects in this \ndefense appropriations bill $1.238 billion in outlays.\n  Mr. President, what happened here, very simply, is that this bill was \nmarked up, it was sent to CBO; CBO came back to the committee and said, \n``You have not spent all your money.'' And they said, ``OK, in order to \nspend the rest, we will put these provisions in and we will drop them \nin conference and spend it on something else.'' That is exactly what is \ngoing on here. I think we ought to strike these provisions and use this \nmoney--keep this money for future needs. It will certainly be needed \nafter this famous train wreck we are all expecting to occur around here \nin October.\n  I yield the remaining minute to the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, the Senator from New Mexico described this \nvery well. I do not know of any other place where we have said in the \npast that we would make progress payments that would not be below a \ncertain amount. They are putting this up. We usually go at 75 percent. \nWe are putting this up and saying you cannot pay them below that no \nmatter what the status is at that point. That does not make sense. The \nsecond part of this is requiring that we pay within 24 days. That is \nhow we got in some trouble a couple years ago under the Prompt Payment \nAct, where we forced people in rapid payment and they made mistakes, \nand we wound up having to get back $1.4 billion from contractors that \nhad been erroneously overpaid because of the short payment time.\n  So I support the Senator from New Mexico, and I hope everybody \nsupports his amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we are dealing, first, with an amendment \nthat says that the Department of Defense should make payments at the \nrate of at least 85 percent on progress payments that are due under a \ncontract. Mind you, they are due. The current level, by law, is 75 \npercent for major businesses, 80 percent for small businesses, and 85 \npercent for disadvantaged small businesses. What we are saying is that \nthey should make the payments required by these contracts not less than \n85 percent. They should be making them 100 percent, but the law says \nyou only have to make 75 percent. We say they should do at least 85 \npercent. By the way, if the Bingaman amendment is adopted, it will \nincrease outlays for this year.\n  The second one is the prompt payment amendment. The Department of \nDefense used to pay their bills with a maximum, by law, of not more \nthan a 30-day delay on bills that are due and payable. Again, that is \nthe prompt payment legislation. They were paying their bills within 23 \ndays. Now they moved it to 30 days. That means that in this period of \ntime, small businesses, in particular, are forced to go out and borrow \nmoney. So they will have to increase the cost to the Government in the \nnext contract if they are forced to borrow the money. This requires the \nDepartment of Defense to pay these businesses as soon as possible, and \nwe assume they will pay them within 24 days rather than 30 days.\n  Now, it is true that it affects outlays, and it means it is a good \nplace to put money. By the way, if we do not use the outlays this year, \nwe will have to make the payments next year. That pyramids the outlays \nand decreases the 5-year budget scheme. I made a motion to table each \nof these amendments. These will be two 10-minute votes back-to-back, \nwith no intervening debate.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, do I have remaining time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 seconds.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I will yield it back.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Have the yeas and nays been requested?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have not been requested on \nthe motion to table the second amendment, No. 2394.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask for the yeas and nays on the motions to table both \nBingaman amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n               Vote on Motion to Table Amendment No. 2392\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is the last of the stacked votes. We \nintend now to go to a series of amendments. We encourage Senators to \nraise them. \n \n[[Page S 12168]]\n\n  We will have another session where we will have votes that have been \nstacked sometime after 9 o'clock. Senator Bumpers is entitled to some \ntime before this amendment.\n  But let me state that I hope there will be no objection. We would \nlike to ask unanimous consent that all remaining first-degree \namendments be offered by 8:30 this evening. They will be subject to \nrelevant second-degree amendments.\n  I ask unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Reserving the right to object, is there any way that we \ncould have this debate tonight and come back in the morning?\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is precisely what we are trying to set up for you. \nWe hope to have some debate between now and 9. We want to look at those \namendments in the interim between the time we will have the next series \nof votes. Then we will have debate on the remaining amendments and have \nthe votes on them tomorrow morning, and that will be the last of this \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Summers matter will be taken up later.\n  The Senator from Arkansas is entitled to 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Reserving the right to object, did the Senator from \nAlaska say we will vote, debate, or both in the morning?\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is our request that we ask that all amendments be \nfiled by 8:30. We will look those over. We are going to have a series \nof amendments between now and, say, 9 o'clock. We will vote on \namendments that have been debated before 9 o'clock, and then after 9 \no'clock, we will take up the remaining amendments. We will stay here as \nlong as people want to explain their amendments.\n  Tomorrow morning, at about 9 or 9:30, we will start voting on all the \nremaining amendments, and we will vote until they are done and go home.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Further reserving the right to object, does the Senator \nhave any idea how many amendments are expected to be filed?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I might say we had some, I think, 80 amendments when we \nstarted. We are now down to, I think, no more than 20. We have taken \ncare of a lot of them. We expect to be able to take care of a lot of \nthose filed by 8:30. The remaining amendments that are not voted on by \n9 o'clock will be voted on tomorrow morning.\n  I believe that is the understanding that everyone has agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Alaska restate the \nunanimous consent request?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that all first-degree amendments \nbe offered by 8:30 this evening and that they be subject to relevant \nsecond-degree amendments.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, is the \nunanimous-consent request that the amendments be offered or that the \namendments be filed? It has been stated both ways.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Offer them, and we will set them aside. You can offer \nthem, as many as you want, whatever you want. They will be offered, and \nwe will look at them and determine how we allocate them, whether we \nought to take them up now. You can offer them now and debate them after \n9 o'clock.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. My own view would be it is reasonable to request they \nbe filed or sent to the managers by 8:30, and it is probably not \nreasonable to ask us to actually call them up for debate here in the \nSenate.\n  Mr. STEVENS. If the Senator wishes to do so, I will be happy to have \na request that all amendments be brought to either the Senator from \nHawaii or myself by 8:30. That is fine with me. Unless they are in our \nhands by 8:30, then I would like to set up a procedure where we get \nthrough.\n  I yield to the leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me just respond. I think this is a \nvery appropriate way to handle this process. We have done it before. We \nwant to expedite to the extent we can to accommodate all Senators. It \nis not too much to ask to have these amendments offered. I will be as \nsupportive as anyone in setting aside whatever business we have to \naccommodate Senators who want to have these amendments offered.\n  I would like to know what amendments are out there. If we do not have \nthem offered, we are not going to know what amendments are there.\n  So it is very important I think that we try to accommodate the \nschedule. Let us lay down the amendments. We can agree to time limits \nlater on. But this will give us a good indication of what we have left \nto do as anything I know.\n  So I hope we can work with the managers and get the job done and \ndetermine what the schedule is after that.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, if I could ask the manager, is there a \nparticular reason why--the Senator from New Mexico was quite correct; \nwe could have a vote. And I have an amendment which will take some \ntime. I do not know if there would be enough time for them to offer \nthem. But they can file them. Is there a particular reason why, at 9 \no'clock, you want to get more votes as opposed to stacking them and \nhaving the votes tomorrow? I am trying to figure out why.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the reason is that we think everyone \nshould be on notice as to what is going to be called up while you are \nnot here. We do have a provision for relevant second-degree amendments. \nBefore you go home, you ought to know what they are. We will be happy \nto disclose them to you. If you have a reason to offer the second-\ndegree amendment, that means they have been filed. You may then tell us \nthat you have a second-degree amendment, and we will protect you. But \nwe cannot protect you if they are brought up and filed and we do not \nknow what they are. We could have second-degree amendments coming off \nthe wall.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. My second question was, having the vote after 9 \no'clock as opposed to debate and having the amendments offered and \nhaving the votes tomorrow morning, stacked votes, is there a particular \nreason?\n  Mr. STEVENS. There has been a request that we have sort of a time \nhere where people want to go to dinner. We have some votes that are \nready to go right now. We have one more called for, but we have others \nthat we could call up. For instance, we thought we would wait and let \npeople go to dinner and have one more set of votes any time you want. \nBut we picked 9 o'clock so we can look at the 8:30 filings and inform \nSenators at that time what kind of agenda we have for tomorrow morning.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. My only question is, is there a reason you have to \nvote after 9 o'clock? Could the amendments be offered, debated, and \nstack the votes tomorrow? That is the question, why votes after 9?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The main reason is as a matter of fairness so people \nwill understand what is here in case they want to offer second-degree \namendments. You cannot come in tomorrow morning and offer second-degree \namendments if we have already closed off debate and said that there is \nno longer any debate on that amendment.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I do not want to be obstreperous and I \nwill not object to this. But I would say to the Senator from Alaska \nthat it seems to me that we are making eminent good sense to ask for a \nunanimous-consent agreement that all amendments be offered by 8:30, \nlook and see how many you have and how many you think are serious, and \nthen go to another unanimous-consent request by 9 o'clock on how you \nwant to dispose of those. If you have 20 serious amendments--I have an \namendment that I had anticipated asking an hour on. I assume others \nhave that. I do not think there is any way to get all of this done \ntonight and start voting in the morning. If we have to come tomorrow \nmorning for votes, why not do some debating?\n  Mr. STEVENS. We will do all the debating tonight and vote tomorrow \nmorning because people want to leave. Beyond that, my friend, you said \nprecisely why we want to come back at 9. We will know by 8:30 what is \nthere. You will have a chance to protect yourself for second-degree \namendments if you wish to do so. And we will be proceeding through the \nnight. Senator Inouye and I have agreed to stay here. Anyone \n\n[[Page S 12169]]\nwho wants to debate these can. We have not asked for the time yet \nspecifically when we start voting tomorrow. But after that, there will \nbe no more debate.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I would anticipate that under this agreement, we could \nplan to be having breakfast in the Senate dining room in the morning.\n  Mr. GRAMM. If you want to debate, you will. If you do not want to \ndebate, you will not.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is interesting. I did ask, as chairman of the Rules \nCommittee, it be open tomorrow morning.\n  I renew my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Alaska revise his \nrequest to say filed with the managers of the bill?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The leader has asked me to stay with the original \nagreement that has been agreed to between the two leaders, and that is \nthat we have first-degree amendments offered by 8:30; second-degree \namendments can be offered to any of those that are offered by 8:30. No \namendments may be called up after 8:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object. I wish to make sure that I \nam protected in my amendments. Let this Senator understand it \ncorrectly. If I have four amendments, they have to be submitted prior \nto 8:30?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Offered. We did this several times before. All you have \nto do is just come in and say, ``I offer this amendment.'' We say, \n``Fine,'' and set it aside.\n  Mr. HARKIN. And there is no time limit.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We have no time limit on these amendments. There will be \na time limit in the sense that we are going to listen to you all night \nif you want to talk, but tomorrow morning we are going to start voting \nand there will be no more debate.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Well, at what time tomorrow morning?\n  Mr. STEVENS. We have not agreed to that. That is why we are coming \nback at 9 o'clock.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Maybe this Senator does not want to stay up all night.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Then come back at 9 o'clock and object then.\n  Mr. HARKIN. So there could be debate tomorrow?\n  Mr. STEVENS. There could be depending what agreement we reach after 9 \no'clock. We cannot determine what kind of agreement to make until we \nsee these amendments.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Is the unanimous consent just to have all the amendments \nfiled by 8:30?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Offered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Offered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is all it is, with the understanding in the \nagreement that they are subject to second-degree amendments. We have \nnot waived second-degree amendments.\n  I renew my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator from Arkansas is entitled to be recognized \nfor 2 minutes.\n  Mr. DOLE. Before we do that, if I could just say a word.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. There is a good chance we can complete our work here if \neverybody cooperates and does not take too much time.\n  We have listened to two or three Senators all afternoon and they have \nmore amendments. That is certainly their right. I wish they would \nunderstand there are Members on each side who have other ideas for \ntomorrow. One idea is not staying here all day. So if they would like \nto talk, as I said, go home and make the speech. A lot of people at \nhome never hear the speeches. We hear them every day.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2395, as modified\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. May we have order so we may listen to the Senator from \nArkansas for 2 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is not in order.\n  The Senator from Arkansas has the floor and is entitled to be heard.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, last week on the Defense authorization \nbill we voted to add a fifth method of financing arms sales to foreign \ncountries. We have four programs right now. This bill appropriates for \nthat fifth method--an Arms Export Loan Guarantee Program.\n  This bill says the Department of Defense can accumulate liability up \nto $15 billion in this brand new loan guarantee program--shades of \nS's of the 1980's. I handed most of you the talking points and a list \nof 37 countries that are going to be eligible to buy these weapons with \nloans guaranteed by the U.S. Government--15 billion dollars worth.\n  I lost the other night when I tried to kill the program. It is still \nintact. What this amendment does is to cut the taxpayers liability from \n$15 billion to $5 billion. This program has not even been set up yet. \nThe committees in the Congress have not approved it. Why in the name of \nall that is good and holy would we put $15 billion in a program that is \njust a gleam in somebody's eye?\n  We will be here next year. We will sell 10 billion dollars worth of \nweapons this year. Under this program, starting next year we can sell \nweapons with guaranteed loans to Slovenia, Slovakia, Albania, Bulgaria, \nthe Philippines, just to name a few of the eligible countries. Many of \nthem are very poor countries. So the bill allows the American that \nwants to sell weapons to pay the risk fee on behalf of the country that \nwill buy them. Now, how do you like that?\n  Do you think countries that cannot even give you a 2 or 3 percent fee \nare worthy of millions and billions of dollars' worth of credit \nguaranteed by the taxpayers of this country? I plead with you. All I am \nsaying is let us not start off exposing the taxpayers of this country \nto $15 billion in liability. For Pete's sake, let us keep it at $5 \nbillion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. STEVENS. What this simply does is put a limit of $15 billion on \nloan guarantees that may be authorized by the armed services bill. It \nis not authorized yet. This sets a limit of $15 billion, period.\n  I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the Bumpers amendment No. 2395, as modified. The yeas and nays \nhave been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 34, between lines 13 and 14, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 8000. REDUCTION IN TOTAL AMOUNT TO BE APPROPRIATED.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the total \n     amount appropriated for fiscal year 1996 under the provisions \n     of this Act is hereby reduced by $3,200,000,000, with the \n     total amount of such reduction to be used exclusively for \n     reducing the amount of the Federal budget deficit.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, my amendment is designed as a follow-up \nor a follow-on to a close vote we took in this body last week on an \namendment to the DOD authorization bill from the Senator from \nWisconsin, Senator Kohl, and the Senator from Iowa, Senator Grassley, \nwhich I cosponsored.\n  That amendment would have reduced by $7 billion the total authorized \ndefense spending provided for in this bill. The same amount of defense \nspending provided for in the Senate version of the budget resolution \npassed earlier this year.\n  Mr. President, during consideration of the budget resolution in May, \na bipartisan majority of 60 Senators voted against an amendment which \nwould have increased defense spending above the level requested by the \nClinton administration. To my surprise, some of those Senators switched \nlast week and voted to support the bill even with this huge increase, \nwhich they had opposed just a few months earlier.\n  My amendment seeks to find the middle ground by cutting a modest $3.2 \nbillion from the amount appropriated in the bill overall, without \nidentifying specific programs to be reduced.\n  Unlike the Kohl amendment, which I supported, and which would have \nreduced total spending in the bill by $7 billion, the amount requested \nby the administration for this year, this amendment would simply cut \nthe overall total by $3.2 billion, leaving a total of about $240 \nbillion to be spent next year on defense.\n  Mr. President, that is still about $3.2 billion more than the \nPentagon itself requested for next year. As outrageous as this may seem \nto Americans who were listening, especially those who consider programs \nlike job training and education and student loans and Medicare, \nprograms that are being slashed in both the House and the Senate, this \ndefense bill, in its current form, provides $6.4 billion more than the \nPresident, more than the Secretary of Defense and more than the Joint \nChiefs of Staff have requested for this year--an amount, I believe, Mr. \nPresident, already vastly more than is necessary to defend our Nation.\n  With the Kohl amendment, not only has the Senate gone on record as \nwanting to hold the defense budget completely harmless as we work to \nreduce the deficit, but it has even gone on record as opposing attempts \nto scale back defense spending to the administration's request. Sadly, \nthe Kohl amendment to cut $7 billion was defeated by a close margin \nlast week.\n  This amendment will test how far Senators are willing to go back \ntoward the principle that all sectors of our society, including defense \ncontractors, ought to bear some modest share of the deficit reduction \nburden. From that earlier vote, I conclude that there are 48 Senators \nwho believe that the Pentagon budget provided for in this bill is too \nhigh and should be lowered as we move forward in the budget debates \nthis year.\n  Mr. President, while the amendment does not designate specific \nprograms to be cut, I will be discussing specific examples of programs \nthat were not requested by the administration and that should be \nremoved from it. Some have been focused on by Senator Bingaman, Senator \nMcCain and others already. They are mostly weapons systems included in \nthis bill to satisfy various Defense Committee members and military \ncontractors but that were not judged to be needed by the \nadministration. Some were ships or planes that were not scheduled to be \nbought by the Pentagon until after the turn of the century, but which \nwere accelerated by 6 or 7 years, at a time when we are supposed to be \ndoing deficit reduction. Others were rejected by the Pentagon, \naltogether as ineffective or too costly, but they are included in this \nappropriations bill.\n  If we pass this bill without my amendment, my Minnesota constituents \nwill continue to pay their taxes to bolster the treasuries of bloated \ndefense contractors, who are building ships, planes, and weapons \nsystems that we do not need and cannot use and that will not make our \nNation any more secure.\n  So that there is no mistake, Mr. President, let me repeat that for \nthose who are listening, we are considering today a defense spending \nbill that spends a full $6.4 billion more than the President requested \nin his budget. We are doing this despite the fact that there is no \nsudden extraordinary threat to justify such an increase and many of \nthose in this body who are pressing for such a huge increase are \nprecisely the same people who are out on the floor day after day, week \nafter week, month after month, howling about how we simply have to get \nthis deficit under control. They are doing this while at the same time \nlarding defense bills with billions in spending for the local shipyard \nor weapons contractor, or plane manufacturer. Have we no \n\n[[Page S 12172]]\nshame, Mr. President? Is there no sense of limits in this body when it \ncomes to wasteful and unnecessary weapons programs? Mind you, this $3.2 \nbillion is all for deficit reduction.\n  Now, controlling the deficit is important, and I have supported \nresponsible, fair-minded deficit reduction proposals totaling hundreds \nof billions of dollars. But I cannot allow this debate to move forward \nwithout observing a few of the blatant incongruities here. Mr. \nPresident, while virtually every other agency of the Federal Government \nis taking huge cuts in order to help reduce the deficit and programs \nthat actually serve millions of people in our States are being scaled \nback or shut down altogether, the Pentagon budget is actually growing \nby leaps and bounds. As I said the other day, Mr. President, this is \none of the craziest things I have seen during my time in the Senate. \nEven during the defense budget of the 1980's, Congress was not pressing \nmore spending on the Pentagon than it had requested, as this bill would \ndo. Make no mistake, Mr. President, the post-cold-war defense budget is \nbecoming less and less focused on our real national security needs and \nmore and more on the needs of particular Members of Congress to sustain \njobs in their home States.\n  American taxpayers are paying for costly, obsolete, fantastically \nexpensive cold war era weapons systems that are no longer justifiable, \nbasically to preserve the political health of certain Members of \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, that is the sad, unvarnished truth. Many of the \nweapons systems we are still paying for were initiated during the \n1980's defense buildup and have little or no relation to the changed \nstrategic situation we now face in the post-cold-war era. Yet, we \ncontinue to fund them, terrified that scaling the spending back \nmodestly will cost precious jobs in our States. And it is particularly \ntroubling that the Armed Services Committee has proposed these hefty \nincreases at the same time that the Defense Department is being called \nto task for not being able to account for billions of dollars--over $13 \nbillion, Mr. President, at last count, in its own spending.\n  In May of this year, the Pentagon's own spending watchdog, its \nComptroller General, John Hamre, conceded that the DOD could not \naccount for over $13 billion of spending. Their own report says that \nthey could not account for $13 billion of spending. We now have here $6 \nbillion more than was in budget.\n  Mr. President, it has just been lost in the ocean of paperwork at the \nPentagon, and this $13 billion will never be sorted out. In fact, the \nComptroller has all but given up trying to find out what happened to \nmost of the money, arguing that it would be more expensive than it \nwould be to track it down. So here we have a report, $13 billion of \nwasteful money, expenditure of money that we cannot even account for. \nNow we have $6 billion more in this appropriations bill than requested, \nand this amendment says just cut that in half and, for God's sake, can \nwe not use that for deficit reduction?\n  I see my colleague here on the floor. He will be part of the \ndiscussion on this amendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank my colleague for his courtesy. Actually, I not \nonly wanted to be part of the discussion, I wanted to ask my colleague \nfor the forbearance to put an amendment in so that I could be covered \nby the 8:30 curfew.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am pleased to yield to my colleague \nto make sure that none of his time would be taken.\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I send a motion to the desk and ask for its \nappropriate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry] moves to \n     recommit S. 1087 to the Committee on Appropriations with \n     instructions to report back to the Senate legislation that \n     does not appropriate funds to the Department of Defense in \n     excess of the President's request for fiscal year 1996.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. I will quickly explain this motion because it complements \nthe amendment of the Senator from Minnesota. The Senator is seeking a \n$3 billion reduction. This amendment seeks to recommit the bill on the \nbasis that we should not be requesting more money than the President of \nthe United States has requested.\n  I think the Senator from Minnesota has most appropriately focused on \na series of problems within the accounting process, in spending \nprocurement process, of the Defense Department.\n  In addition to that, Mr. President, I know the Senator feels this \nvery strongly. We ought to be making decisions around here based on the \nreal needs of the country, not on wish lists.\n  It is very, very difficult when we look a the level of teenage \npregnancy, when we look at the fact that last year 36 percent of the \nhigh school graduates in America graduated with a below basic reading \nlevel capacity. Fifty percent of minorities in this country graduated \nwith a below basic reading level capacity.\n  This means last year we put 750,000 people in the work force in \nAmerica with a skill level for jobs that disappeared 50 years ago.\n  That, Mr. President, is something we really ought to be focusing on. \nI can go through a list of items in this bill, including $564 million \nincrease on fighter planes or $125 million increase on the request for \nthe Kiowa Warrior Scout Helicopter and other things.\n  I am all for upgrading and keeping up with a defense that is second \nto nobody in this planet. I believe, Mr. President, $236 billion will \ndo that. There is not a compelling need to spend $242 billion-plus.\n  Now, I think when we measure all of the things we have done, the \nGoals 2000 in education, we will cut substance abuse prevention money, \nwe will cut safety schools and drug money, we are making it harder for \nkids to go to college, yet we are going to come along with a series of \nexpenditures here ranging from the post 1996 D-5 missile production.\n  If we have good enough START II implementation, and we get the Duma \nin Russia to ratify it and we continue downwards, there is no reason to \nbuild D-5's after 1996. We have money for that in here.\n  We could increase burden sharing by the Republic of Korea. We can \nprocure the most cost-effective airlifter, C-17's or commercial. There \nare many things we could do, Mr. President.\n  I have $37 billion worth of reductions I think we could find. All we \nare looking for is $6 billion. I do not think at this time in the \nUnited States choice-making here in Washington, where we are seeking to \nfind the things we need to do for the country that we ought to be \nfilling some extraordinary wish list, when this golden moment in \ninternational affairs is staring us in the face. We could really make, \nI think, a tougher set of choices.\n  I yield the floor back to the Senator.\n  I simply think we ought to have a vote here before we put this bill \naway as to whether or not the President was not well advised to suggest \nto the U.S. Senate that $236 billion will do the job, and why it is \nthat we must spend this additional $6 billion this year and a lot more \nover the next 5 years and beyond.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KERRY. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator. I would have outlined some of the \nsame weapon systems the Senator enumerated.\n  Is the Senator aware of the fact that in May during consideration of \nthe budget resolution, a bipartisan majority of 60 Senators voted \nagainst an amendment which would have increased defense spending above \nthe level requested by the Clinton administration?\n  Mr. KERRY. That is correct.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. So, not that many months ago, a short period of time \nago, Senators went on record saying certainly in this time of tight \nbudgets, when we are talking about deficit reduction and lots of people \nare being asked to tighten their belt, and we are making cuts in \neducation, and as the Senator said, in substance abuse programs, \ntreatment programs and in job training and low-income energy \nassistance, the Senate went on record.\n  Now all of a sudden we see contrary to the advice of the \nadministration, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Pentagon itself--I \ncannot remember a time where we are now talking about an appropriations \nbill that is $6 billion above the request.\n\n[[Page S 12173]]\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Let me answer that by saying to my friend I think there \nare three great issues that most Americans are concerned about.\n  The first is their decline in income. It is the increasing anxiety of \nthe workplace, the fear that people will lose a job, or that if they \nget a job, they cannot raise their standard of living, they cannot, \neven by working harder, make ends meet. That is the first and foremost \npriority of people in this country.\n  I cannot point to very much--maybe some of my colleagues can do a \nbetter job than I can--but I cannot find anything that the Senate has \nworked on yet this year that will address that issue in a profound way.\n  The second great issue that faces Americans is the question of \nwhether or not they can walk out of their house and go out at night to \na restaurant without fear of not finding their car when they come out \nof the restaurant, or maybe being hit over the head, or whether their \nkids can go out and play in a neighborhood.\n  There is nothing that we have done, yet, that fundamentally addresses \nthat need, except reduce the expenditures for substance abuse--the \ngreatest problem in America being drugs--and target for attack the idea \nof putting more cops on our streets, which was the great issue of last \nyear.\n  The third great issue that I think Americans are concerned about is \neducation. I just spoke about it. Our school systems are falling apart. \nIn city after city, community after community, teachers are \ndemoralized, people are not paid enough, the curriculum stinks.\n  We have a whole host of problems, and here we are with Russia, at \nodds about whether or not to ratify the START treaty with a moment \nwhere we could be greater leaders in the world with respect to \nproliferation, with respect to our capacity to have intrusive \ninspection, and what are we doing?\n  We are cutting Head Start. We are cutting substance abuse. We are \ntargeting the program that puts police on the streets. We have not \naddressed one of those three profound needs, but we are going to spend \nmore than the Joint Chiefs of Staff think we ought to, and that the \nCommander in Chief has asked us to, does not make sense, Mr. President.\n  I thank my colleague for allowing me to put my amendment in at the \nappropriate time. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts \nfor his amendment and also for his words here on the floor of the \nSenate.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2404\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I would like to summarize, and I will \nget a chance to summarize for my colleagues again.\n  Here we have a situation--and I want to be clear about what this \namendment does--here we have a situation where we have in this \nappropriations bill $6.4 billion more than requested by the \nadministration, by the Pentagon, by the Joint Chiefs of Staff--over \nbudget.\n  This amendment says, can we not at least cut half of that, $3.2 \nbillion, and all of that goes for deficit reduction? Mr. President, I \ndo not designate what weapon system to be cut, though I raised \nquestions about many of those weapon systems and the value of them, as \nhas the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  What I do know, Mr. President, is that it seems to me in a time when \nwe say we are for deficit reduction and we are calling for sacrifice \namong people in the country and we are putting into effect some really \nserious cuts--not just in programs but in programs that have a critical \nimpact on the quality or lack of quality of the lives of people--\neducational opportunities for children, food, nutrition programs, Head \nStart, early childhood development programs, Women, Infants, and \nChildren, low-income energy assistance program, job training program, \nmaking sure that young people can afford higher education--I just say \nto my colleagues, why in God's name when we are making cuts in all of \nthose programs, and now what we are doing is we have $6 billion more \nover budget, $6 billion more than requested by the administration--I do \nnot think there is any standard of fairness to this. Surely we can make \nsome cuts here as well, Mr. President.\n That is what this amendment calls for.\n\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote aye on this amendment to \nreduce, by $3.2 billion, the total spending in this bill. That will \nstill leave about $240 billion in this bill to be spent on defense next \nyear and over $260 billion in total, when you add in Energy Department \nweapons programs and military construction projects provided for in the \nDOD authorization bill.\n  Vote to at least bring the defense budget more closely in line with \nwhat the President and the Secretary of Defense have requested, I say \nto my colleagues, a figure that is already too high, in my view. And \nespecially to those Senators, 60 in all, who voted for lower defense \nspending numbers on the budget resolution, I appeal to you, vote to \nrestore some sanity to defense budgets that have gone dangerously awry. \nVote aye on this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I, for the moment, yield the floor and I retain the \nremainder of my time.\n  Might I ask how much time I have remaining, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has 6 minutes 10 \nseconds.\n  Mr. AKAKA addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). Who yields time? The Senator from \nHawaii.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2405\n\n(Purpose: To require the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the \n Army to reconsider the decision not to include the infantry military \noccupational specialty among the specialties for which special pays are \n         provided under the Selected Reserve Incentive Program)\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, to meet the requirements of the chairman of \nthe committee, I have an amendment to offer. I send an amendment to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Akaka] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2405.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 83, between lines 11 and 12, insert the following:\n       Sec. 8087. The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of \n     the Army shall reconsider the decision not to include the \n     infantry military occupational specialty among the military \n     skills and specialties for which special pays are provided \n     under the Selected Reserve Incentive Program.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask it be laid aside for further \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, it may be laid \naside.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2406\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding underground \n                            nuclear testing)\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I have another amendment to send to the \ndesk, and I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Akaka] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2406.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1062. SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING UNDERGROUND NUCLEAR \n                   TESTING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The President of France stated on June 13, 1995, that \n     the Republic of France plans to conduct eight nuclear test \n     explosions over the next several months.\n       (2) The People's Republic of China continues to conduct \n     underground nuclear weapons tests.\n       (3) The United States, France, Russia, and Great Britain \n     have observed a moratorium on nuclear testing since 1992.\n       (4) A resumption of testing by the Republic of France could \n     result in the disintegration of the current testing \n     moratorium and a renewal of underground testing by other \n     nuclear weapon states.\n       (5) A resumption of nuclear testing by the Republic of \n     France raises serious environmental and health concerns.\n\n[[Page S 12174]]\n\n       (6) The United Nations Conference on Disarmament presently \n     is meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, for the purpose of \n     negotiating a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), \n     which would halt permanently the practice of conducting \n     nuclear test explosions.\n       (7) Continued underground weapons testing by the Republic \n     of France and the People's Republic of China undermines the \n     efforts of the international community to conclude a CTBT by \n     1996, a goal endorsed by 175 nations at the recently \n     completed NPT Extension and Review Conference (the conference \n     for the extension and review of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \n     Treaty).\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Republic of France and the People's Republic of \n     China should abide by the current international moratorium on \n     nuclear test explosions and refrain from conducting \n     underground nuclear tests in advance of a Comprehensive Test \n     Ban Treaty.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. I ask it be set aside for further consideration, and I \nyield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, article I, section 8, of the Constitution \nof the United States states the following:\n\n       Congress shall have the Power To *** raise and support \n     Armies * * * To provide and maintain a Navy; To make rules \n     for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval \n     Forces; To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute \n     the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections, and repel \n     Invasions.\n\n  Mr. President, I cite the Constitution because in the debate today we \nhave heard on several occasions that the President did not approve this \nor the President did not ask for appropriations, that the President did \nnot have this in his budget request.\n  Mr. President, the Constitution of the United States does not say \nthat the President shall have the power to raise and support armies or \nthat the President has the power to provide and maintain a navy. It is \nthe Congress that has the power. And what we are doing today, and this \nevening, is to exercise that power and authority that has been granted \nto the people of the United States and to their representatives in the \nHouse and the Senate.\n  If we abide with some of the suggestions made by my colleagues, I \nwould say the Constitution should read that the Congress of the United \nStates will be the rubberstamp of the President. I do not believe that \nwas ever the intention of our Founding Fathers.\n  Second, throughout the debate today, the sum of $7 billion has been \nheard on several occasions. It represents sums of moneys that this \ncommittee has recommended for the purchase of certain equipment. It is \ntrue that what I am about to list were not specifically requested by \nthe President. But in the exercise of our authority as set forth in \narticle I, section 8, of the Constitution, we felt that the best \ninterests of this Nation would be served if we did exercise this \nauthority. So, if I may, I would like to go down the list so my \ncolleagues will know what is involved.\n  The so-called master plan of the Department of Defense states that, \nby the year 2000, we will purchase 15 DDG-51 destroyers. These are the \nlatest destroyers, the most powerful on the seven seas. The President \nrequested two. We decided for the sake of economies, we should have \nfour.\n  In the scheme of contracting and building, I think it is common \nknowledge that if one purchases in larger quantities the purchase price \nwould be less--$1.4 billion. Before we made this decision we conferred \nwith the Chief of Naval Operations, we conferred with the Secretary of \nthe Navy. They considered this to be of high priority.\n  Just a few moments ago this Congress, this Senate, by a vote of 72 to \n27, approved the appropriation of $1.3 billion for the purchase of an \nLHD-7 amphibious assault ship. That ship was not requested by the \nPresident of the United States, but it is part of the master plan of \nthe Department of Defense. It is scheduled to be purchased in about 3 \nyears. But, in checking with the shipyards of this Nation, we found \nthat this year would be the year to make that contract. This is one of \nthe highest priorities for the U.S. Marines.\n  We call upon the Marines almost every year, unfortunately, to send \ntheir men in harm's way. They are the first on the beach. They are the \nfirst to shed blood. And they want to make certain, if they are going \nto be first, they do so with the best of equipment, best of survival \nfacilities--and this ship will provide that survivability.\n  Mr. President, $770 million for the National Guard. The President of \nthe United States did not request $770 million for the National Guard \nequipment, but every adjutant general of the 50 States begged the \nCongress for assistance in this area. It is common knowledge among us \nthat, up until now, the National Guard gets all the leftovers.\n When the regular services get new equipment, they get the old \nequipment. When the M1A2 tank comes out, they will get the M1A1 tanks. \nThey put up the sand bags for floods. They are involved in Bosnia. They \nwere in Desert Storm. They were in Somalia. And they will be going to \nthe next place wherever it is. And if we are calling upon the National \nGuard, the citizen soldiers, to stand in harm's way, I think it is only \nreasonable for the Congress to provide them with the necessary \nequipment.\n\n  That was $777 million.\n  This bill has 12 FNA-18 aircraft, $484 million. The master plan calls \nfor the purchase of 24. The administration had requested 12. We added \n12. Here again, it was a matter of economies, and by economies I am \ntalking about big economies. By doing this, we would have saved over \n$250 million.\n  A high priority for the military are the F-15's and F-16's; $370 \nmillion for 12 of them.\n  A few hours ago this Senate, by an overwhelming vote, approved the \nfunding of $300 million for the national missile defense research and \ndevelopment. That was not requested by the President. We added the $300 \nmillion.\n  We also added $300 million for the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard, as \nyou know, Mr. President, is funded through the Department of the \nTreasury. They are not part of the Defense Department. For all intents \nand purposes, the Coast Guard is now part of the U.S. Armed Forces. \nThey were deeply involved in Desert Storm. They suffered casualties \nlike all the other services. They are presently involved in the \nblockade in Bosnia. They are also involved very deeply working with the \nNavy in drug interdiction.\n  So the Treasury Subcommittee came to us, and they did so about 3 \nyears ago, to provide a helping hand with the Coast Guard. And we have \nbeen doing this. The Senate knows that, the House knows that, and the \nPresident knows that.\n  The sum of $174 million for the Comanche helicopter; if one should \nlook over the whole appropriations measure--and I say so as a former \nArmy person--the Army was the one that was shortchanged. The Navy got \ntheir ships, and the Air Force got their aircraft. This is the one \nthing that the Army wanted, the Comanche helicopter, $174 million.\n  This bill also has $250 million for five hurricane aircraft. Mr. \nPresident, they were not requested by the President of the United \nStates. But I hope my colleagues will be able to confer with the \nGovernors of the coastal States and the gulf States and ask their \nopinion--all of those. Every moment at this time of the year there is \nsome hurricane popping around in the Caribbean or in the Atlantic. And \nwe have heroic men and women 24 hours a day up in the air checking \nthese things out. The least we can do is to give them adequate \nequipment and the best of aircraft. This will provide it, Mr. \nPresident.\n  There is no pork in here. Listening to the debate, one gets the \nimpression that this is all waste, this is all pork. And as I said \nearlier this day, I do not wish to sound personal and parochial. But \nthere is not a single item in here that is made in Alaska or Hawaii. \nThere is no pork in here for our two States. But we feel as chairman \nand ranking member of the subcommittee that these are absolutely \nessential.\n  We know that this is a very painful period, Mr. President. I, too, \nwould like to see more money being spent for the homeless, for the \npoor, and the hungry, and for those who are not receiving appropriate \neducation. But we have not arrived at the millennium that we pray for. \nThere are still people outside our borders and inside our borders that \nwould relish the thought of destroying us. This is not paranoia, Mr. \nPresident. This is the real world.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues will look over the list \nthat I have just set forth for you, sir. And if they can tell us that \nthey do not need the destroyer, they do not need the hurricane \naircraft, they do not wish to have the National Guard fully equipped, \nthey do not wish to have the \n\n[[Page S 12175]]\nCoast Guard better equipped, then we might think otherwise. But no one \nhas come forth telling us to cross out the F-22, cross out the F-15, \ncross out the F-15 and the F-16. No. Mr. President, it has been $7 \nbillion.\n  I do not often speak on the floor. But I just want my colleagues to \nknow that making decisions such as this is not an easy chore. I can \nassure you that this is a lean and mean defense bill. If there is fat, \nit is almost negligible. And it is not in this list, sir.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Arizona wants to \nfile an amendment. I yield to him for that purpose.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2407\n\n (Purpose: To place a limitation on the use of funds for Former Soviet \n                        Union Threat Reduction)\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2407.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 82, between lines 11 and 12, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 8087. LIMITATION ON USE OF FUNDS FOR COOPERATIVE THREAT \n                   REDUCTION.\n\n       (a) Limitation.--Of the funds available under title II \n     under the heading ``Former Soviet Union Threat Reduction'' \n     for dismantlement and destruction of chemical weapons, not \n     more than $52,000,000 may be obligated or expended for that \n     purpose until the President certifies to Congress the \n     following:\n       (1) That the United States and Russia have completed a \n     joint laboratory study evaluating the proposal of Russia to \n     neutralize its chemical weapons and the United States agrees \n     with the proposal.\n       (2) That Russia has, with the assistance of the United \n     States (if necessary), prepared a comprehensive plan to \n     manage the dismantlement and destruction of the Russia \n     chemical weapons stockpile.\n       (3) That the United States and Russia are committed to \n     resolving outstanding issues under the 1989 Wyoming \n     Memorandum of Understanding and the 1990 Bilateral \n     Destruction Agreement.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) The term ``1989 Wyoming Memorandum of Understanding'' \n     means the Memorandum of Understanding between the Government \n     of the United States of America and the Government of the \n     Union of Soviet Socialist Republics Regarding a Bilateral \n     Verification Experiment and Data Exchange Related to \n     Prohibition on Chemical Weapons, signed at Jackson Hole, \n     Wyoming, on September 23, 1989.\n       (2) The term ``1990 Bilateral Destruction Agreement'' means \n     the Agreement between the United States of America and the \n     Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on destruction and non-\n     production of chemical weapons and on measures to facilitate \n     the multilateral convention on banning chemical weapons \n     signed on June 1, 1990.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Alaska has 5 minutes 12 \nseconds.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Does the Senator from Minnesota have any time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has 6 minutes 4 \nseconds.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I will make one comment for the \nconsideration of my friend from Minnesota, and that is to tell him that \nof the three other bills pertaining to the Department of Defense for \n1996, compared to the three other bills this is the lowest level of \nspending in any of the DOD authorization or appropriations bills. We \nare below the authorization in the House, we are below the \nauthorization in the Senate, and we are below the appropriations in the \nHouse. How can we be so far off the mat as I have been hearing?\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, for my colleagues I would like to read \nfrom a letter from the administration.\n\n       The administration does not support the committee 202(b) \n     allocation, or the level of funding provided by the committee \n     bill, which is nearly $6.5 billion above the President's \n     request. By providing an increases for defense programs that \n     are neither wanted nor justified, the bill would seriously \n     undermine the President's goal of achieving a balanced budget \n     while increasing investment programs essential to a higher \n     standard of living for all Americans.\n       As reflected in his budget, the President firmly believes \n     that it is possible to maintain a strong defense without \n     sacrificing critical investments. The committee's allocation \n     raises serious concerns about the overall priorities \n     reflected in the appropriation process.\n       For this reason and other concerns discussed below, the \n     President's senior advisers would recommend the President \n     veto the bill if it were presented to him in the current \n     form.\n\n  I have a tremendous respect for my colleague from Hawaii, and he is \nnot on the floor now, but just in response, I do not think the Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff is a millenniest. I do not think that the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff does not make very rigorous \ndecisions about national security.\n  Again, one more time, we are talking about deficit reduction. We are \ntalking about cuts in education, child nutrition, low-income housing, \nlow-income energy assistance programs, health care programs, you name \nit. And at the same time we are going $6.4 billion above budget, and \nthis amendment just says can we not cut $3.2 billion in budget \nauthority and use that for deficit reduction?\n  Mr. President, it just seems to me that people in Minnesota and \npeople around the country are saying, sort out your priorities. We are \nspending billions of dollars renewing cold war relics like star wars, \nthe antimissile defense system, the B-2 bomber, new generations now of \nattack helicopters and airplanes, more destroyers, more carriers, more \nexpensive weaponry.\n  It is like the sky is the limit. All of my colleagues who talk so \nmuch about deficit reduction over and over and over again, they seem to \nbe great when it comes to reducing an investment in children and in \nhealth care and in job training and in reducing violence in our \ncommunities, but when it comes to the military contractors, it goes on \nand on and on and on.\n  In all due respect, I do not think the Pentagon, I do not think the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, I do not think these are the \nkinds of people who do not make rigorous analysis about what is in our \nnational defense.\n  But enough is enough. Enough is enough. It seems to me we can \ncommunicate a message to people in this country that there is going to \nbe some little deficit reduction here in this Pentagon budget. Forty-\nnine Senators voted for this proposition. That was $7 billion. I cut \nthis in half. I am hoping to have the support of my colleagues.\n  Finally, I would say to my colleagues on the other side--not all of \nmy colleagues on the other side--I think there comes a point in time we \nare going to have to redefine national security. And part of national \nsecurity is surely the security of our local communities--that is what \nthe Senator from Massachusetts was trying to say, I say to my colleague \nfrom New Mexico--the security of local communities, where there is less \nviolence, where there are opportunities for children, where there is \naffordable child care, where there is decent housing, when people are \ntrained for jobs, when there are jobs available. This is all part of \nnational security, too.\n  This amendment just says cut $3.2 billion--that is it--of the $6.4 \nbillion over budget and use that for deficit reduction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, how much time did I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has 1 minute 28 \nseconds.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. In the interest of time, I again will not comment very \nlong on this.\n  Again, I point out that we have a real problem in the sense we do not \nhave the allocation that the other bills have, and yet we are being \ncriticized for having the level which is the lowest spending level that \nhas been presented to the Congress during this session by any of the \nfour bills.\n  I say this to my friend from Minnesota. If you look at the 5-year to \n7-\n\n[[Page S 12176]]\nyear trend, the President's budget comes down and then goes back up. We \nhave a budget level which is almost a straight line going through the \n7-year period. The difference between the President's bill and ours is \nthat we use the money such as on the LHD-7 or on the extra two DDG-51's \nto spend it wisely so we get a savings.\n  There is nothing in this bill that is not in the President's program \nultimately in the same 7-year period. But we are getting it at a \ndifferent pace, and we are using our head about when to continue a line \nand when to shut it down. The LHD-7 for instance funded in this bill \nnow will save us $700 million over this period of the 7 years. We save \na similar amount of money by starting the funding on the DDG-51's.\n  I cannot understand why we are criticized for getting more for less \nmoney. Again, I want to state that. We spent less money than any of the \nother three bills, and we get more for defense, meet more of the \nobjectives, and I believe that you will see the Department of Defense \nrecognizing that.\n  I yield to my friend from Arkansas. And I see the Senator from South \nDakota here, too, to qualify amendments.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, if my colleague will yield for a \nmoment----\n  Mr. PRYOR. The curtain is about to fall.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am sorry. I was going to say we will be done in 1\\1/\n2\\ minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR.

The Senator from Minnesota has 1 minute and 31 \nseconds.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to the \nSenator from North Dakota and ask unanimous consent that he be included \nas an original cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment that is \noffered by my colleague from Minnesota. It is important that we all \nunderstand what he has offered.\n  What the Senator from Minnesota is saying is that we should not buy \nthings for which the Pentagon has not asked. We should not spend money \nthat the Department of Defense has not requested. We should not decide \nto be wild-eyed big spenders when it comes to this bill for things that \nno one has said we need.\n  This bill spends $7 billion more than the Department of Defense asked \nfor on trucks, planes, ships, helicopters, submarines--all for things \nfor which the Pentagon has not asked.\n  It is strange to me that after all of these months agonizing about \nthe debt and the deficit, and saying we must tighten our belts when it \ncomes to health care for seniors, education for kids from middle-income \nfamilies, nutrition for poor kids, all of a sudden, when this bill \ncomes to the floor of the Senate, not a word, not one word about the \nFederal deficit. In fact, just the opposite. We are told that we should \nspend money we do not have on things we do not need. We should spend $7 \nbillion more than the Secretary of Defense has asked this Congress for.\n  Now, why not a word about the Federal budget deficit? What is the \nbiggest threat to this country? In my judgment, debt and deficit. That \nis why I support the amendment offered by the Senator from Minnesota to \ncut $3.2 billion back to the President's request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired of the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The Senator from Alaska now has 2 minutes and 54 seconds.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I told the Senator from Minnesota if he \nneeded additional time I would be happy to \n\n[[Page S 12178]]\nyield to him. I will be happy to let him use the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska for his \ngraciousness. I think that we have had the debate and I do not need any \nmore time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to table the amendment under the same \narrangement--we have 2 minutes on each side before the vote.\n  I ask unanimous consent on that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask for the yeas and nays now, too.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I now ask the amendment be set aside until we vote on \namendments sometime around 9.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2403\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I earlier sent an amendment to the desk. \nI ask that it be called up at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment No. 2403.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2403.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me just state for my colleagues the \npurpose for this amendment, and it is stated here on the amendment that \nI submitted. The purpose is----\n  Let me first clarify, Mr. President. Is there any time agreement on \nthis?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time agreement at this time.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. There is no time agreement. I advise the Senator from \nAlaska it will take 10 to 15 minutes on my part and whatever time the \nSenator would ask. I do not need a time agreement.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is perfectly understandable. I would be pleased to \nput one down so people would know they should come in a period of time.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. We can indicate it will take no more than 30 minutes \nequally divided.\n  Is that reasonable? That would get us to 9.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator will have 15 minutes and we have 5 on this \nside; and a 20-minute time limit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the purpose, as it is stated here in the \namendment, is to reduce funding for the TOW 2B by $20 million; the \nHellfire II by $40 million; and the CBU-87 by $30 million, which are \nmunitions that have been determined by the inspector general of the \nDepartment of Defense as being excess to the requirements of the Armed \nForces.\n  Mr. President, this issue first came to our attention because Ed \nMcGaffigan, who works on defense issues for me, was reading Defense \nWeek, the July 17 edition of Defense Week. There is an article on the \nfront page of that publication. By way of compliment to them, I think \nthey do good work in keeping us apprised of defense issues.\n  This headline says, ``IG''--or inspector general--says ``Services \nMiscount Future Munitions Needs by $15 Billion.'' The first sentence of \nthe article says:\n\n       The Army, Navy and Air Force have overstated by $15.5 \n     billion their respective requirements for anti-armor \n     munitions planned for purchase between fiscal years 1996 and \n     beyond 2001, the Pentagon's Inspector General has concluded \n     in a new classified report.\n\n  Mr. President, obviously that report, since it is classified, I am \nnot in a position to go into the detail of that report, except to \nrecount what the press has reported.\n  But the simple fact is, we have got three types of munitions, two \ntypes of missiles, and then in addition to the two types of missiles, \nwe have got the bombs.\n  So let me just say very briefly the TOW 2B is a ground-to-ground \nmissile which is intended to target tanks. The Hellfire is an air-to-\nground missile that is shot from helicopters, again targeting tanks. \nAnd then the CBU-87, of course, is a bomb. It is a combined-effect \nmunitions bomb.\n  The simple fact is, Mr. President, that none of these items were \nrequested by the Department of Defense in the budget they sent to us. \nNone of these items are in the so-called future-year defense plan. \nAlways before in the earlier amendments that I have heard offered here \non this bill, people say, well, maybe it is not requested for next year \nbut it is requested for a future year. None of these are requested for \nany future year, even 6 years out. None of these are needed, according \nto the inspector general of the Department of Defense.\n  So, let me just briefly say that the inspector general has done a \nstudy of this in depth. Congress received that study on June 29. And \nthe report summarizes a whole series of ongoing work that the inspector \ngeneral has done. The report essentially says that each of the \nServices, especially the Army, but each of them, has or is planning to \nhave more munitions than it needs to carry out its responsibilities \nunder the two-major-regional-contingency scenario which is presently \nwhat we are planning for in the Bottom-Up Review.\n  The reason is that the Army was planning to fight the war by itself \nand planning to kill every piece of armor in both theaters in these two \nregional contingencies.\n  Other Services were also planning to fight the war essentially by \nthemselves. When the capabilities of the other Services are taken into \naccount, we are planning to buy much more in munitions than we need. \nBut even the Department of Defense is not planning to buy these. They \ndid not request them. Once we saw this article, we wrote a letter to \nthe inspector general, on July 27, to ask whether the add-ons in the \nbill, which, as I said before several times, were not requested, \nwhether those add-ons were consistent with the inspector general's \nfindings.\n  I received an answer on the 2d of August. Let me read the second \nparagraph of that letter to you, Mr. President. This is the inspector \ngeneral of the Department of Defense saying--this is a quotation:\n\n       Based on use of the fiscal year 1996 requirements data, the \n     Army and Air Force inventories of TOW 2B missiles and CBU-87 \n     bombs significantly exceed the amounts of those two munitions \n     that the Services project they would use in two major \n     regional contingencies. The Army inventory of Hellfire II \n     missiles will equal the amount of munitions that would be \n     expended in the contingencies after the Army received the \n     missiles currently on contract. Further, the Services have \n     significant quantities of previous configurations of the TOW \n     and Hellfire missile systems, as well as significant \n     quantities of cluster bombs that were replaced by CBU-87 \n     bombs. We are not aware of any compelling need to procure \n     more of those weapons than the Department requested for \n     fiscal year 1996.\n\n  Mr. President, the inspector general says they are not aware of any \ncompelling need to procure what is in this bill and what my amendment \nwould propose to delete.\n  Mr. President, I cannot think of a clearer example for this Senate to \ndeal with than the one that is presented by this amendment. It is a \nquestion of whether the Senate is willing to save $90 million of \ntaxpayer money by refusing to spend it on excess munitions that the \nPentagon says they do not need, that the inspector general of the \nPentagon says they do not need, that nobody has requested, and that \nhave been added into this bill by the subcommittee as they marked up \nthe bill.\n  I think the only responsible course is to adopt the amendment which I \nam offering here and to cancel the planned expenditure of this $90 \nmillion, Mr. President. The defense bill cannot be seen by the American \npeople as a jobs bill. We cannot just look to which Senator has some \ndefense contractor that they want to do a favor for. We do not need \nthese munitions. There is no justification for buying them. We should \nnot use hard-earned taxpayer dollars to purchase these munitions. And I \nknow of no argument to the contrary.\n  Mr. President, I ask how much of my time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 7 minutes 35 \nseconds.\n\n[[Page S 12179]]\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me reserve the remainder of my time \nand allow the Senator from Alaska, or anybody else, to respond, if they \nwould like.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska controls 5 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, in our meetings, and as the Senator from \nHawaii indicated, we met with each one of the Service chiefs. They \nhighlighted their priorities. Munitions was the top priority in terms \nof readiness. This has been proven to be a very effective munition. It \nwas vital in the gulf war. The systems were fully included in the \nauthorization bill from the Armed Services Committee, and we have \nfollowed precisely the authorization contained in that bill. The \nPentagon has not conveyed to us any objection to these items. To the \ncontrary, we understood that they were sought by the Service chiefs.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. President, the Senator is absolutely correct. We have been \ncontacted by the acquisition people in the Army, and they are fully \nsupportive--for one reason; they support $5 million of this request \nbecause of the need for what they call a cold weather fix.\n  Some of these weapons had been damaged as a result of storage and \ncold weather, and there is a retrofit required for that.\n  The other $15 million they believe is essential for the replenishment \nof those that eventually have to be retired. It is also important to \nnote that the Army will be providing TOW 2B's to the U.S. Marine Corps. \nWhile the focus is on the Army, we have to remember some of these \nmissiles will be going to the U.S. Marine Corps.\n  As the Senator from Alaska said, this is the premier tank killer in \nthe inventory. There is not anything like it. It is the best in the \nworld. Clearly, since it is the desire to use the $20 million as \nindicated, I believe the committee's position ought to be supported.\n  I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 3 minutes and 5 \nseconds.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I say to my friend, I am prepared to \nyield back the remainder of my time, but I leave it to the Senator to \nfinish his time if he wishes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me just take another few minutes to \nconclude my argument in favor of this amendment, which I do think is a \nvery straightforward amendment.\n  The Senator from Arizona says he has been contacted by acquisition \npeople in the Army who favor procurement of more of these weapons. I am \nnot familiar with who might have contacted him. All I know is the \nDepartment of Defense did not request them; the Inspector General of \nthe Department of Defense says they are not needed. There is no \nindication that we received in the Armed Services Committee that they \nare in any way needed. I grant you they are authorized in the \nauthorization bill, and that is just as egregious a mistake as \nappropriating the money for them is in this bill.\n  I think there is really no argument that I know of that any of the \nServices feel they have an insufficient quantity of the TOW 2B or the \nHellfire or this bomb. So I think, clearly, the need is not there.\n  Let me also say, I do not disagree with anything that the Senator \nfrom Alaska or the Senator from Arizona said about the value of these \nweapons. There is no dispute about that. They are excellent missiles. \nThey are excellent bombs. The only question is, when are we going to \nquit buying them? How many do we have to have in excess? How big does \nthe inventory have to be before we finally say, ``Fine, we have plenty, \nwe have enough to fight two regional conflicts at the same time,'' \nwhich is a fairly major statement in and of itself.\n  Mr. President, at some point, we have to be honest with the American \npeople and say, ``As stewards of your tax money, we are going to only \nspend that money on things that are needed.'' These are not needed. \nThat is the simple fact of it. They are not requested. They are not \nneeded. They are not anywhere in this 6-year defense plan that the \nDepartment of Defense has sent to us. As I say, I cannot go into much \nmore detail about what is in the classified report that we have on this \nissue from the Inspector General. Quite frankly, I think it is \nclassified because the facts contained in it would probably be an \nembarrassment to the Department. For whatever reason, it is classified.\n  We do have one page which is unclassified from the report. Let me \njust make reference to that. It says in here:\n\n       The Services' processes for determining quantitative \n     requirements for munitions to defeat armored targets needed \n     improvement.\n\n  There is a euphemism if you ever heard a euphemism, Mr. President. \nDefense Week says that the IG report says that they have overestimated \ntheir need by $15 billion. This unclassified page from the report says \nthat their ways of determining quantitative requirements needed \nimprovement.\n  I agree, they do need improvement.\n  They say here that the Services' processes needed improvement because\n\n       * * * the Services used incorrect quantities of threat \n     systems that were in the hands of potential enemies.\n\n  That is, they have misassessed potential threats. They say that their \nprocesses need improvement because of their uncoordinated shares of \nthreat systems that each Service would be responsible for defeating.\n  To put that in plain English, Mr. President, we had each of the \nServices preparing to fight the war by themselves. When the Department \nof Defense finally stepped in and said, ``Let's audit this situation, \nlet's look at what the whole inventory is,'' they said, ``We do not \nneed the Army to have enough to fight the next war, and the Air Force \nenough to fight the next war, and the Navy enough to fight the next \nwar. We just need enough to fight the next war.'' So that is basically \nthe conclusion.\n  I will cite one other statement in this unclassified page from the \nclassified report. It says:\n\n       As reported in our separate audit reports to the Army, the \n     Navy, the Air Force and the Marine Corps, the above \n     conditions resulted in the Services overstating their \n     quantitative requirements for antiarmor munitions by more \n     than $15.5 billion.\n\n  Mr. President, it is unconscionable for us to sit here and add more \nmoney for munitions that are not requested, that are not needed, that \nwe have excess inventories of already. And that is precisely what this \nbill calls for today.\n  My amendment will correct that. It will save the taxpayers of the \ncountry $90 million. I know $90 million does not sound like a lot of \nmoney in Washington, but it is a reasonable amount of money for most \nAmericans. And most Americans would say, ``If you don't need to spend \nthat $90 million for additional missiles and bombs of this type, then \nwhy should you spend it?'' And that is basically the point of my \namendment. I hope very much my colleagues will support the amendment.\n  If the Senator from Alaska is ready to yield back his time, then I \nwill yield back mine.\n  Mr. President, I address a question, if I can, to the Senator from \nAlaska and ask if we can have the same agreement with regard to the 2 \nminutes of explanation on both sides, once we do have a few Senators, \nif he is to stack the votes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That will be my request, and I am prepared to yield back \nthe remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I make the motion to table the amendment on the same \nbasis as before, 2 minutes on each side. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that that \namendment be set aside so we can proceed to Senator Harkin's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2410\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I call up amendment No. 2410 and ask for its \nconsideration. \n\n[[Page S 12180]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself and Mrs. \n     Boxer, proposes an amendment numbered 2410.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I say to the manager of the bill, this is \nthe one that was agreed upon.\n  Mr. STEVENS. If the Senator wishes to make a brief explanation, we \nare pleased to accept this amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN Mr. President, this amendment maintains for another year \nthe existing provision placed into law last year as a part of the \nfiscal year 1995 Defense appropriations bill. It provides that the \nFederal Government share of the cost of a company's operation should \nnot include its share of anyone's pay in excess of $250,000. It does \nnot stop a company from paying an executive more than $250,000. There \nare many costs that are not allowable: hunting lodges, alcoholic \nbeverages, et-cetera, perhaps 50 disallowable items.\n  This amendment says that in these difficult budget times, one of the \nlimits should be on employee compensation over $250,000.\n  In an analysis done by DOD several years ago, it showed that DOD \nalone very often paid more than a million dollars for just DOD's share \nof one executive's work.\n  Now, we see that the Pentagon may be picking up $31 million in \nbonuses and other benefits to top executives of Lockheed and Martin-\nMarietta because of the deals made regarding their merger. Why should \nthe Federal Government be paying $31 million of this $90 million cost. \nIf the stockholders are willing to make those payments, that is one \nthing. For the taxpayers to make them when we are cutting so many \nneeded programs would be outrageous.\n  Let me say it again. Children are not getting the basics and the \nDefense Department may pay millions in gold-laden gifts to the \nexecutives. That should not be a taxpayer's expenses\n  Our budget are getting tighter. I have often fought for fairly small \nsums for what I view as very necessary Government expenditures as we \nall have. And, our ability to fund programs needed to provide for needy \nchildren, the disabled and elderly is being cut to the bone.\n  I urge that the amendment be agreed to.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this amendment will cap taxpayer \nreimbursement for the salaries of defense contractor executives at \n$250,000 per year for contracts consummated in fiscal year 1996. It \nwill extend a similar provision contained in the fiscal year 1995 \nDefense Appropriation Act.\n  I began investigating this issue after hearing reports of \nmultimillion-dollar bonuses awarded as a result of the Lockheed-Martin \nMarietta merger. As a result of that merger, $92 million in bonuses \nwill be awarded--$31 million of which will be paid by the taxpayers.\n  I think it is wrong that corporate executives make so much money at a \ntime when their employees are struggling just to make ends meet. What \nmakes it even worse in this case is that these multimillion-dollar \nbonuses were given as a reward for a business deal resulting in 12,000 \nlayoffs nationwide.\n  So the taxpayers buy rich executives $31 million worth of champagne \nand caviar, while laid-off defense workers struggle just to feed their \nfamilies. I think the defense industry employees--in California and \nacross their Nation--are the ones who deserve a bonus. The CEO's and \nmultimillionaire executives are doing just fine.\n  As I investigated this issue further, I discovered that the problem \nwas not limited to mergers or bonuses. Top defense industry executives \nroutinely earn more than $1 million per year--sometimes even more than \n$5 million. And the taxpayers pick up most of the tab.\n  This amendment sets a $250,000 maximum for compensation that is \nreimbursable by the taxpayers. It applies to all forms of compensation \nincluding bonuses and salary.\n  It is important to understand that my bill sets no limit on the \ncompensation that an executive can receive. That is an issue best left \nto the stockholders and directors of each company. If the stockholders \nbelieve that the Lockheed-Martin merger was such a fine business \ndecision that they want to award their CEO a $9 million bonus--or for \nthat matter a $90 million bonus--that is fine with me. All my \nlegislation would do is stop them from passing the check to the \ntaxpayers.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this was the subject of the bill last \nyear. We had several comments at the time. I am not sure the House is \nwilling to accept it. We will take it to conference. I ask for a vote \non the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2410) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2401\n\n(Purpose: To strike $70,000,000 appropriated for Research, Development, \n Test and Evaluation, Defense-Wide, for support technologies/follow-on \ntechnologies advanced development, specifically provided for the Space-\n                          Based Laser Program)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2401.\n       On page 29, line 12, strike out ``$9,196,784,000'' and \n     insert in lieu thereof ``$9,126,784,000''.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Would the Senator consider a 20-minute time agreement, \nequally divided?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Make it 30. If I do not use it all, I will yield my time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that there be 15 minutes on the \nSenator's side and 5 minutes on our side on this amendment before we \nhave action on or in relation to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. If the Senator will yield, that means we should be \nvoting sometime around 5 minutes after 9. It will be my intention at \nthat time to proceed in order to call up the amendments that have been \nstacked.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield, I have one other amendment \nafter this. We can do it quickly. It will be shorter than this one.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will withdraw the request at this time, and we will \nsee what happens. We should vote around 9:15.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, well, it is back again, and I am not \ntalking about ``Freddy from Elm Street,'' I am talking about star wars. \nLet me point out that we had a $7 billion add-on on this, as you know, \nmore than what the Pentagon wanted. The amendment offered by Senator \nKohl, as you know, last week failed on a 51 to 48 vote to take out all \nof that $7 billion add-on. But it is my opinion that we should at least \ncut some of the most egregious add-ons, and perhaps the most egregious \nadd-on is the one that puts money in for a star wars weapons system \ncalled the space-based laser.\n  I am talking about star wars, Mr. President, a system of at least 12 \nspace stations upon each of which is mounted a huge laser weapon. This \nlaser is powered by combustion of hydrogen and fluorine. It is a \nchemical laser. It is not an x-ray laser, not a neutral particle-beam \nlaser, and it is not a space-based kinetic kill vehicle. It is a \nconcentrated beam of light.\n  This laser beam of concentrated light is designed to produce 2.2 \nmillion watts of energy. It is this Nation's most powerful and, by far, \nmost expensive military laser on the design mode. Yet, it is obviously \nnot completely developed, experts say. The needed power level for this \nweapon to work is somewhere between 5 and 10 million watts, or by a \nfactor of 5 over what the design is of this one.\n  The light produced by this laser is not visible to the human eye but \nis in the infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n  This infrared light is effective only in space. It can be used only \nin space because the infrared light can penetrate the Earth's \natmosphere in space only to a height of 5 or 6 miles above the ground.\n  You can think of it as a giant, deadly flashlight, able to zap up to \n100 missiles with the amount of fuel on board, or zap a maximum of 5 to \n10 theater-range \n\n[[Page S 12181]]\nmissiles launched simultaneously, or maybe zap 15 to 20 ICBM's launched \nsimultaneously. To collect the light from each laser, there is a \nreflective mirror of more than 35 feet in diameter. To give an idea of \nthe size of that, it would be just about the size perhaps to fit in \nthis Senate Chamber.\n  This mirror, which collects the laser beam and focuses, is flexible. \nSo you have to think of this laser as a flashlight held in one position \nsteadily, pointing into a large mirror. The mirror can pivot to reflect \nthe light from the laser toward the target. So the mirror collects the \nlight, focuses the light into a beam, and points the beam to a target \nhundreds or thousands of miles away and, of course, that target is \nmoving.\n  Originally, this mirror had very heavy systems of cooling water to \nprevent the extreme heat of the laser from shattering the reflective \nmaterial. But one item developed in the last few years was coatings \nthat make the mirrors so reflective that they need no cooling.\n  In fact, these reflective coatings for the mirror were actually \ntested almost exactly a year ago.\n  Daniel R. Wildt, an advanced systems manager at TRW, who works on the \nspace-based laser, was quoted in the New York Times as saying about the \nnew reflective coating, ``What this means is immense weight savings. It \nis a breakthrough.'' The Times article goes on to say that it would \ntake one or two large rockets to loft each laser battle station into \norbit. And a dozen or so of these would be needed. Experts say such a \ncomplex of 12 orbiting battle stations might cost about $30 billion to \n$48 billion.\n  Mr. President, if this all sounds kind of familiar, yes, we have \ntalked about it before, back during the time when President Reagan was \nin office. We talked about putting all of these battle stations up and \nall of these lasers and they are going to zap all these missiles. We \nfinally got off of that. But it is still alive. That snake has not been \nkilled yet, and it is coming back again. That is what this amendment \nseeks to do, to take out that $70 million.\n  Think about it as just the first step toward a $30 billion \nexpenditure of money--$30 billion that we do not have, to add to the \nnational debt.\n  Are we serious about committing this kind of money to a weapons \nsystem that may or may not work?\n  The Armed Services Committee in its report notes that of the Pentagon \nballistic missile requests, only 6 percent is allocated to advanced \nfollow-on technology development.\n  The committee then proceeds to recommend that every bit of this $70 \nmillion that goes to support technology should go into the space-based \nlaser program. I find it a little hard to believe that of all of the \nsupport technologies, all of it is shuffled into space-based laser. \nNothing for any other kind of program is given an increase--just this. \nConcerning the space-based laser, the committee directs the Secretary \nof Defense to ``reinvigorate this program and to ensure that sufficient \nfunds are provided in the outyears to continue a robust effort.''\n  To those who think this may be a little bit, this $70 million, for a \nlittle experiment, read the language. This is the first step, and next \nyear even more and more toward the very thing that this Congress said \nno to over 10 years ago, even during the height of the cold war. But \nnow that the Soviet Union is no threat, well, we are still going to go \nahead with it.\n  Well, my amendment would delete this $70 million. Again, I do not \nthink it is just $70 million we are talking about. If we proceed, we \nare talking about starting down that road of spending $30 billion for \nspace-based lasers.\n  Well, I have five reasons why I think this is a bad idea.\n  First, the $30 billion cost is way too much for us to afford. We \nsimply cannot afford it, given the kinds of threats that our country \nfaces today.\n  Second, space-based lasers are not cost effective. They are not cost \neffective, No. 1, because the threat from the Soviet Union has all but \ndisappeared. Long-range Chinese missiles are few in number and not \nconsidered threatening. Only rogue nations can constitute the present \nthreat. They may or may not have the capability of launching long-range \nweapons, but there are other ways to get nuclear warheads into the \nUnited States, such as smuggling them in, or by a cruise missile, or on \na submarine. That would be much more likely for a rogue nation than \nlaunching a long-range ballistic missile.\n  The intelligence community cannot identify threats of long-range \nballistic missiles to the continental United States within the next 10 \nto 15 years. A lot can be done in those years to provide other \nsafeguards.\n  The third reason this is a bad spending of money is that space-based \nlaser systems violate article V of the 1972 ABM Treaty. This article V \nspecifically bans any antiballistic weapon from being based in space, \nperiod. That is what doomed it before. And yet, I cannot imagine that \nright now we are going down that road one more time.\n  The fourth reason this is a bad expenditure of money is the space-\nbased laser just may not work. There are a lot of problems of great \ntechnological difficulty.\n  The tests of the chemical laser to date have consisted of only tests \non the ground, with the laser held in position and not free to move as \nin space. The laser has only been fired in very short bursts. \nComponents act differently in space. An enormous ground-based complex \nthat is used to fire the laser is yet to be packaged into a much \nsmaller space-based system.\n  The Large Aperture Mirror Program and the Large Obstacle Segment have \nbeen claimed to be easily built and assembled in space, but this is not \ntrue because the Hubble telescope has shown that large mirrors can have \nflaws and are not totally testable before operation in space.\n  After only a few seconds of firing of this chemical laser, the entire \nspace-based laser battle station will be so violently shaken by the \nchemical reaction used to make the laser beam that it would no longer \nbe aligned for multiple firings.\n  Again, this has been the dream of some Star Wars' enthusiasts for a \nlong time. I think they saw too many of the Star Wars movies. I like \nStar Wars movies. I happen to be a science fiction buff myself. I read \nscience fiction. I like those movies.\n  Somebody down there thinks we can build those things now that send \nout the beam of light and zaps things. Theoretically, it is possible \nand maybe sometime 200 or 300 years from now, God forbid, maybe the \nweapons will be used. Now it is a ridiculous waste of money to try to \nbuild this space-based laser system.\n  Using a much smaller system, the Pentagon has shown that missile \ntargets can be acquired and tracked from space, and that a small laser \ncan be fired accurately. The problem is complicated enormously by the \nsize and the multiplicity of targets in using this big mirror in space. \nMillions of lines of computer code must be written. One little mistake \nand that would spell the end.\n  The Star LITE option test has shown that the key components can fit \ntogether, but it does not compare with constructing and assembling, in \nspace, this huge system.\n  Mr. President, it is not worthy, not worth $70 million, to continue \ndown the road of building and trying to test a space-based laser \nsystem. It is too costly, violates the ABM Treaty, and it is not cost \neffective, considering the threats that face us in the next 10-15 \nyears.\n  Mr. President, there really is one final argument why this \nexpenditure is so ridiculous. In the beginning of my remarks I \nmentioned that there had been designed a reflective coating material \nthat they will put on this big mirror so you do not have to use all the \ncooling system, so when the laser beam hits the mirror and is \nreflected, this reflective mirror will not heat up as much.\n  They have designed that and tested it. They say now we have solved \nthe problems of all the weight that goes on in this big mirror in \nspace. Well, Mr. President, it is only a matter of time before anyone \nwho wishes to launch an ICBM will just coat that ICBM with the same \nreflective material so the laser hits the mirror--assuming they have it \nfixed up--that mirror, thousands of miles away, sends the beam down to \nthe missile with the same reflective material, and the beam just \nbounces. \n\n[[Page S 12182]]\n\n  It is the same old story. It has been true since time immemorial. \nBuild an offensive weapon system, costs a lot of money, and someone can \nusually build a deterrent or something to stop that at much less money. \nThat is true here.\n  So I think we ought to save the $70 million this year and save us \nfrom once again going down that road of spending $30 to $48 billion for \nthis space-based laser system.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. There are points to be made in a program that the United \nStates has invested over $1 billion over the last decade. It is one of \nthe most successful programs that has ever been run by the Defense \nDepartment in terms of meeting schedule and cost rules.\n  In fact, the GAO has indicated that it has met every one of the \ntechnical milestones. I really do not think anybody has criticized this \nprogram on technical grounds. In fact, the Senator from Iowa has \ndiscussed some of the really unique and highly technical aspects of the \nprogram.\n  I am sure he would agree that there have been great strides made in \nthe development of this kind of a program, although he has other \nobjections to the expenditure of this money.\n  In my view, Mr. President, it is important to have a very highly \nleveraged, highly technical kind of program like this. We will not \ndeploy this kind of a program, perhaps ever, but at least not in the \nforeseeable future.\n  It is important to have this kind of a program, the only one of its \nkind, the only directed energy program, that still exists in our \narsenal, as one of those hedges. That is frankly what this program is \nat this time.\n  The 70 million in funding here does not provide any kind of \ndeployment decision or anything of that sort. We are just in the \nresearch stage. It keeps that research alive. So it would be a tragedy \nto kill this program after the amount of money that has been spent and \nthe technology that has been developed.\n  Quickly, to respond to the arguments made by the Senator from Iowa. \nThe notion that it will cost $30 billion to deploy--of course, nobody \nis talking about deployment. We are not close to a deployment decision. \nThis is simply ongoing technology. I do not think that is an argument \nagainst the expenditure of this research money.\n  Second, it is not cost effective. It is too premature to evaluate \nthat. We all know that a boost phase intercept is the way to go. We \nwould like to have that. This is the only boost phase intercept program \nwe are talking about now, and it is not something that ought to be \neliminated. We would be left with nothing, in that event.\n  To the third argument that it is an ABM Treaty violation, I know the \nSenator from Iowa knows there is nothing in the ABM Treaty that \nprecludes us from developing or from researching, weapons of this sort. \nObviously, we would face that question if and when we got ready to \ndemonstrate or deploy it. We are not at that stage for many, many \nyears.\n  The fourth argument, it may not work. Again, Mr. President, no one \nhas ever criticized this program on technical grounds. The GAO, as I \nsaid, has said it is one of the best run programs, and we are a long \nway from having exactly what we need to actually deploy this kind of a \nprogram.\n  Finally, to the idea of the Senator from Iowa that the Russians or \nsomebody else could make the same kind of reflective material on their \nmissiles, their ICBM's, and defeat the laser, he indicated he was a \nreader of science fiction, and that is pretty good science fiction, but \nnobody figured how to do that.\n  You have weight considerations, heat considerations. The Russians \nhave not even discovered the same kind of material yet, so that is \nsomething, obviously, for the scientists to think about, but not a \nreason for us not to expend the money.\n  As a matter of fact, it is probably a reason to do continued \nresearch, to ensure that we could defeat any kind of similar research.\n  This is a very good program. We are only talking about research \nmoney. We are a long way from any decision to deploy. It is the kind of \nprogram we need as a hedge against the kind of presence that may exist \nnow or in the future. I hope the committee's position is supported.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I yield myself 1 minute.\n  Mr. President, I realize I cannot say much in a minute, but just to \nremind ourselves, about 30 years ago as a result of the debate of this \nnature the Congress appropriated a few dollars, a few million dollars, \nand as a result came up with this business called laser.\n  Up until then, lasers were just theory. Since then, the laser has \nbeen helpful in medicine, in mathematics--it has been a boon for \nmankind.\n  I just hope that we will not have to use this in warfare. As I have \nindicated, as others have, we have not arrived at the millennium, so \nsadly we must prepare ourselves that if such a time should come, we are \nprepared.\n  This is for research; it is not to build the systems. I hope that my \ncolleagues will oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Is there time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 47 seconds and the \nSenator from Iowa has 2 minutes and 27 seconds.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will use my 47 seconds by saying I hope everyone keeps \nin mind we are talking about a question of pursuing a promising \ntechnology.\n  This is strictly research. There is no money procurement. This is \nstrictly the use of a facility that costs us $1 billion, and this is \n$70 million to see if we can demonstrate some of the technology--\nnothing in space. It is all on the ground as far as this phase is \nconcerned.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will not take all my time. I will just \nask unanimous consent to have printed at this point an article from the \nNew York Times stating that, ``From fantasy to facts, space-based laser \nnearly ready to fly.'' It says:\n\n       ``Like it or hate it, this is reality,'' a weapons expert \n     says. ``This is not theoretical.''\n\n  I am telling you, they are going down the road. We are going to build \nthis. I have nothing bad to say about lasers. They are used in medicine \nand everything else. That is not what this is about. This is about \nbuilding a space-based laser. It is going to cost billions of dollars, \nputting battle stations in space. We have been through this debate in \nthe past and I do not think any more needs to be said about it. We \nshould put our money someplace else.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time, and I ask unanimous \nconsent to have the entire article printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      From Fantasy to Fact: Space-Based Laser Nearly Ready to Fly\n\n                         (By William J. Broad)\n\n       It's back. Adored by military contractors and lambasted by \n     civilian skeptics, fired into the political stratosphere by \n     President Ronald Reagan and dragged back to earth by the \n     Clinton Administration, ``Star Wars'' is prominent again as \n     the newly empowered Republicans began to push for deployment \n     of a national system of antimissile defense and gird for \n     ideological warfare with Democrats on the topic of placing \n     arms in the heavens.\n       Surprisingly, this turn in the nation's 35-year, love-hate \n     relationship with antimissile research finds the technology \n     less speculative than before. For the first time, it is \n     mature enough that one class of advanced weapons could be put \n     into space relatively quickly, a fact that is likely to \n     electrify this round of the antimissile debate.\n       The weapon is the chemical laser, which gets its energy \n     from the combustion of fuels similar to those in rocket \n     engines. Though much of its energy is lost as heat, \n     significant amounts can be extracted by mirrors and resonant \n     chambers, emerging as a concentrated beam of light that in \n     theory can flash across space to zap speeding missiles \n     thousands of miles away.\n       In particular, the new maturity centers on a chemical laser \n     known as Alpha, which the Federal Government has quietly been \n     developing for more than 15 years at a cost of about $1 \n     billion. In a scheduled valley near San Juan Capistrano, \n     Calif., the sprawling test site for Alpha includes a 50-foot \n     high chamber that mimics the vacuum of space.\n       Angelo M. Codevilla, a senior research fellow at the Hoover \n     Institution at Stanford University in California and a former \n     staffer on the Senate Intelligence Committee who helped get \n     Alpha started in 1978, said the device was all but ready for \n     deployment in orbit to defend the United States.\n       ``Like it or hate it, this is real,'' said Mr. Codevilla, \n     who would like to see a dozen or so laser battle stations \n     circling the earth. ``It's not theoretical. It's not some \n     scientist fantasizing about X-ray lasers.''\n       But critics deride the whole idea, saying a fleet\n        of Alpha type weapons in orbit would violate the \n     Antiballistic Missile Treaty \n\n[[Page S 12183]]\n     which was signed in 1972 by the United States and the Soviet Union and \n     bars the deployment of antimissile arms in space. The \n     treaty allows the orbital testing of research lasers as \n     long as they are too weak to shoot down long-range \n     missiles. But critics say Alpha, even as a research tool, \n     is so powerful it would fail this legal test and violate \n     the treaty, thus probably touching off a political storm \n     if testing were to advance into space.\n       And full-blown battle stations, critics assert, are dubious \n     since they would fail to protect the United States \n     completely.\n       ``It's either too much or not enough,'' said John E. Pike \n     who is in charge of space policy for the Federation of \n     American Scientists a private group based in Washington. \n     Ground-based interceptors are better for knocking out short-\n     range missiles, he said, and space lasers, at best would be \n     leaky shields against a concerted attack at long-range \n     missiles.\n       ``Imperfect defenses are worthless,'' Mr. Pike added, \n     because the destructiveness of a single nuclear blast is so \n     great.\n       Right or wrong, good or bad, Alpha is unique in the \n     antimissile world by virtue of its staying power and steady \n     evolution. It get started before the 1983 ``Star Wars'' \n     speech in which President Reagan called for work on a way of \n     rendering enemy missiles ``impotent and obsolete,'' and it \n     survived the program's subsequent ups and downs.\n       In 1993, the Clinton Administration declared Star Wars \n     dead, in a move that was largely symbolic. Some programs were \n     cut back, but the antimissile research is still being funded \n     at about $3 billion a year, bringing its total cost for the \n     decade to about $35 billion.\n       Alpha and allied programs, their budgets now tight, got \n     enough money to keep evolving and growing through the rise \n     and fall of a host of futuristic alternatives for space \n     armaments like X-ray lasers, neutral particle beams and \n     space-based kinetic kill vehicles. In short, Alpha is the \n     death ray that refused to die.\n       ``This program has survived lots and lots of turmoil \n     because it has a very high potential payoff,'' said Daniel R. \n     Wildt, an advanced systems manager at TRW Inc., Alpha's main \n     contractor, in an interview.\n       The principal allure of chemical lasers is that they \n     require no electricity drawing their power instead from \n     simple chemical reactions. Alpha's lasing action is produced \n     by the combustion of hydrogen and fluorine,\n      a toxic, corrosive, yellowish gas that is the most reactive \n     of the elements. To avoid handling problems, the fluorine \n     is made instants before combustion in a precursor reaction \n     of nitrogen triflouride, deuterium and helium.\n       Alpha got a slow start as Congress fought over its fate and \n     allowed only limited funding for design studies. Mr. Reagan's \n     1983 speech opened the budgetary floodgates, and contractors \n     broke ground for the Alpha test site in 1984.\n       The first full-scale ground tests of the lightweight laser \n     began under tight security in December 1987, when gas was \n     released into the combustion chamber but not ignited. An \n     accident delayed the first firing until April 1989. The \n     explosive zap came after a tense two-day countdown that \n     required synchronization among a maze of fuel tanks, pipes, \n     pumps, valves and switches, similar in some respects to a \n     space-shuttle countdown.\n       The laser's beam of concentrated light is designed to \n     produce 2.2 million watts of energy, making it the nation's \n     most powerful military laser, experts outside the Government \n     say. Officially, the power of the beam is secret, with \n     contractors saying only that it is not enough to melt metal \n     and that the energy intensity at the core of the laser is \n     several times that of the surface of the sun.\n       To date, Alpha has been fired 11 times, most recently in \n     August.\n       The main challenge with Alpha was to turn chemical-laser \n     technology that had been proven on the ground into a device \n     light enough to be launched into space. Thus, the laser is \n     largely aluminum.\n       Among the laser's heavier components were its mirrors, \n     which had ponderous systems of cooling water to prevent \n     extreme heat from shattering them. One item developed over \n     the past few years and tested during the August firing were \n     coatings that make mirrors so reflective they need no \n     cooling.\n       ``What that means is immense weight savings,'' said Mr. \n     Wildt. ``It's a breakthrough.'' Lots of uncooled mirrors are \n     now planned for Alpha and its affiliated systems.\n       Currently, the laser is being linked\n        to a system of mirrors known as LAMP, for Large Advanced \n     Mirror Program, its biggest circular mirror is 13-feet in \n     diameter and the LAMP apparatus is housed in a separate \n     vacuum chamber at the San Juan Capistrano site. LAMP is to \n     take the raw Alpha beam and simulate how it could be \n     focused and directed across space to hit enemy missiles.\n       Dr. Grant A. Hosack, who is in charge of laser programs at \n     TRW, said budget cuts would delay the first firing of the \n     integrated system until 1997. And retrenchments forced the \n     cancellation of plans to keep firing and testing Alpha in the \n     interim.\n       ``We've had to cut back on manpower, too,'' Dr. Hosack \n     said, ``We've a lot of blood and guts in this. When we see \n     the cuts so deep, it really hurts.\n       TRW officials said that if money were no impediment about \n     five years would be needed to prepare a laser weapon for \n     deployment in space. Power levels would have to rise to about \n     5 million to 10 million watts from the current 2 million \n     watts, private experts say. In theory, given the optic \n     breakthroughs and weight reductions, it would take one or two \n     large rockets to loft a laser battle station into orbit.\n       Operating at a wavelength of 2.7 microns, which is in the \n     infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum and invisible \n     to the human eye, an Alpha-type weapon would be effective \n     only in space and would be able to penetrate into the earth's \n     atmosphere no deeper than five or six miles above the ground.\n       ``We can't start fires,'' said Dr. Hosack, ``We kill the \n     missiles as soon as they penetrate the cloud tops.''\n       Promising to speed this kind of work is the resurgence of \n     the Republicans, who have vigorously backed Star Wars from \n     the start. Moreover, the Republican ``Contract With \n     America,'' a manifesto developed by Representative Newt \n     Gingrich of Georgia and signed by more than 300 Republican \n     House candidates before the election landslide in November, \n     explicitly calls for the rapid deployment of antimissile \n     arms.\n       The National Security Restoration Act, one of the \n     contract's ten proposals, says the Defense Department should \n     ``develop for deployment at the earliest possible date a \n     cost-effective, operational anti-ballistic missile defense \n     system to protect the U.S. against ballistic missile \n     threats.'' Republicans have pledged to bring the bills up for \n     a vote in the first 100 days of the new Congress, which \n     starts in January.\n       The contract does not specify\n        whether the defense should be based on the ground or in \n     space, but analysts note that the Republicans have always \n     tended to back space-based systems. And Star Wars \n     advocates argue that only a space-based system would be \n     ``cost effective,'' as called for in the contract.\n       ``There's not enough money in the budget for anything \n     else,'' said Frank J. Gaffney, Jr., a Pentagon official in \n     the Reagan Administration who now directs the Center for \n     Security Policy, a private Washington group.\n       Experts say a dozen or so space-based laser battle stations \n     might cost $50 billion or more.\n       Critics contend such huge expenditures are foolish since \n     antimissile systems are all but useless against many of the \n     kinds of attacks that might threaten the United States now \n     that the cold war has ended. For instance, terrorists armed \n     with nuclear weapons would never entrust a warhead to a \n     rocket but would most likely smuggle it into a major city, \n     following in the footsteps of the World Trade Center bombers.\n       ``Missiles and nuclear weapons are proliferating,'' Mr. \n     Codevilla said. ``It's best to defend ourselves as the \n     technology allows. As de Gaulle used to say, `The future \n     lasts a long time.' ''\n       Both foes and friends of space lasers agree that such \n     weapons run afoul of the Antiballistic Missile Treaty. \n     Boosters of the treaty say it is a bulwark against a renewal \n     of the nuclear arms race and should be preserved at all \n     costs, while its detractors say it has outlived its \n     usefulness.\n       ``If I'm right,'' said Mr. Gaffney, the former Pentagon \n     official, ``we've got a problem that's not going to be \n     resolved by arms-control agreements. We need to defend \n     ourselves.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, on the basis of the previous agreement, I \nask unanimous consent for 2 minutes on each side prior to the vote on \nthe motion to table the Harkin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to table the Harkin amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask that be set aside so we might hear \nfrom the Senator from Iowa.\n  Does the Senator have another amendment?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I have another amendment. This one will not be as long.\n  Mr. DOLE. How long?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Can I have 10 minutes on my side?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Which one is it?\n  Mr. HARKIN. This is the ASAT.\n  Mr. STEVENS. May we have an agreement, Mr. President, that the \nSenator can have 10 minutes on his side, 5 minutes on this side, prior \nto a motion to table?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2402\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I call up amendment 2402.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2402.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, my amendment will eliminate the $30 \nmillion added to the Pentagon request to fund the tactical \nantisatellite weapons program.\n\n[[Page S 12184]]\n\n  This is one of the most unnecessary programs that this committee has \never pulled from its pork barrel.\n  Mr. President, my amendment eliminates funding for the Army's kinetic \nenergy antisatellite [ASAT] weapon program.\n  The Army itself tried to cancel this cold war weapon for several \nyears.\n  The Bush administration continued the program, even though the \nPentagon did not want it.\n  The Clinton administration has zeroed the program. But the Senate \nArmed Services Committee has included $30 million to keep this cold war \nweapon alive.\n  My amendment would eliminate this wasteful spending on an unnecessary \nweapon, and save the taxpayer's money.\n  Proponents of ASAT weapons argue that if we build weapons to shoot \ndown airplanes, why not build a weapon to shoot down space satellites?\n  Mr. President, there is a big difference between battles in the air \nand battles in outer space.\n  The debris of the battle will fall to the ground immediately after an \nair battle, and commercial air liners can still fly after hostilities \nend.\n  Not so in outer space.\n  The collision of one ASAT kinetic kill vehicle with one enemy \nsatellite would create thousands of pieces of space junk.\n  The space battle debris continues to orbit the earth at speeds of \n17,000 miles per hour.\n  At lower altitudes, from 100 to 200 miles up, air molecules will \ngradually slow the debris until it falls and burns up on reentry to the \natmosphere.\n  Above 300 miles up, space debris will remain in orbit for many years.\n  At higher altitudes, debris can continue to orbit the Earth for \ndecades or centuries.\n  Every piece of space debris is a lethal weapon, traveling at speeds \nof 17,000 miles an hour.\n  This debris could damage any rocket or satellite crossing its path.\n  It would be uncharted, and give no warning.\n  If space debris were to hit an astronaut, it would probably be fatal.\n  If an ASAT weapon were to be used successfully, vast orbital bands of \nspace would be rendered unusable for years, decades, or even centuries.\n  This is not a theoretical conjecture.\n  We have examples of such debris creation from old Soviet ASAT space \ntests.\n  Several Soviet ASAT tests did create thousands of detectable pieces \nof junk that are still in orbit after 25 years.\n  The Soviet Union launched Cosmos 249 and detonated it as an ASAT \nweapons tests on October 29, 1968.\n  This explosion in space created 109 identifiable objects at the \nintercept altitude of 525 kilometers.\n  Because the Cosmos 249 ASAT was in a highly elliptical orbit, this \nlethal debris spends most of its time at higher altitudes.\n  As a result, this debris has survived longer than expected.\n  Today, 55 pieces of detectable junk are still orbiting the earth, 27 \nyears after the ASAT explosion in space.\n  In total, 371 detectable pieces of orbiting junk still survive today \nfrom various Soviet ASAT weapons tests.\n  Similarly, U.S. Air Force direct ascent ASAT tests in 1985 created \n285 pieces of orbiting space junk at an altitude of 350 miles.\n  Today, nine detectable pieces of this experiment are still in orbit, \nthreatening peaceful TV and telephone satellites of many commercial \nventures.\n  Near Earth space is too commercially valuable to even permit tests of \nASAT weapons.\n  However, I agree that the military has a need to deny a rogue nation \nthe use of a reconnaissance satellite.\n  Spy satellites in space can be effectively jammed, or, better yet, \nfalse information can be fed to the receiving stations.\n  We presently have the technology to jam and to feed false information \nto enemy satellite ground stations.\n  There is no need to shoot down a satellite in space, because it can \neasily be rendered ineffective or even turned to our advantage.\n  Jamming and spoofing an enemy satellite is certainly more cost \neffective than wasting money developing a cold war ASAT weapon.\n  Electronic counter-measures will not create the space junk that \nshooting down a satellite will create.\n  It is true that satellite reconnaissance is a vital capability in \nwar.\n  But Iraq, Iran, North Korea, and any other potential enemy do not \nhave, and will not have for many years, any satellite, much less a \nmilitary reconnaissance satellite.\n  If any potential enemy were to start making a reconnaissance \nsatellite, then perhaps there could be a need for an antisatellite \nweapon.\n  But the time needed for a rogue nation to make a satellite would give \nus the time to develop effective countermeasures.\n  We do not need to make this weapon now.\n  There is no threat, and no perceived threat.\n  There is a real question of just whose satellite we would be willing \nto destroy.\n  Only friendly countries have satellites in orbit now.\n  If time on a military reconnaissance satellite were leased to a rogue \nnation by a friendly country, would we really want to shoot that \nsatellite down?\n  We cannot afford to waste $30 million on such a remote possibility as \nIraq, Iran, or North Korea getting access to a military reconnaissance \nsatellite at some indefinite point in the future.\n  Only when the threat is apparent do we need to develop an \nantisatellite weapon.\n  So let us not waste our taxpayers' dollars on this unnecessary \nantisatellite weapons system. Let us save the taxpayers $30 million.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that all \namendments qualified by the 8:30 p.m. timeframe, as a result of the \nprevious agreement be debated tonight, and that any votes ordered or in \nrelation to the amendments or motions to occur beginning at 9:30 a.m. \ntomorrow, with 4 minutes equally divided for an explanation on each \namendment prior to the vote, and after the third consecutive vote, the \ntime for explanation be extended to 10 minutes equally divided on one \namendment that Senator Harkin will have--he will have 15 minutes and we \nwill have 5 minutes--and that all votes in the voting sequence after \nthe first vote be limited to 10 minutes in length.\n  That will wrap up this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I now yield to the Senator from Arizona for the reply to \nthe Harkin amendment.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you. I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  Mr. President, the first primary argument of the Senator from Iowa on \nthis is that we have an effective antisatellite weapon, and if we have \nto use this, it will create space junk.\n  Mr. STEVENS. If the Senator will yield, I do not want to take up \ntime. But this agreement will mean, however, that there will be four \nvotes as soon as we finish the debate on this. Following those four \nvotes, all other votes will occur tomorrow morning at 9:30 a.m.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, again, this is an amendment to eliminate some \nof the funding for research on an antisatellite program in the event \nthe United States should ever need that. It is a contingency program. \nWe are not talking about deploying anything.\n  But the primary argument of the Senator from Iowa was that if this \nwas ever utilized, obviously, these satellites might be blown apart and \nthat would create space junk. I suppose that might be true, but I find \nthat not to be a very persuasive argument that we should be denied a \nweapon that we would need in time of war. It is a little like lamenting \nthe rubble that may exist after the necessary bombing of downtown \nBaghdad. It may be too bad that there is some rubble there, but the \nfact of matter is, that is a consequence of war. If we needed an \nantisatellite weapon, obviously that would be the last of our concerns. \n\n\n[[Page S 12185]]\n\n  As the Armed Services Committee stated in its report, the United \nStates military has spent billions of dollars on the spectrum of multi-\nservice and joint war-fighting space requirements. We spent billions, \ntoo, on a broad mix of space and ground-based capabilities that will \nserve us both in time of peace and war. In the event of a conflict, the \nUnited States would be faced by a wide array of capabilities by our \npotential adversaries in space and with the access to space-derived \ndata that comes from that.\n  As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I am very concerned about \nthe ability of the United States to counter these technological gains \nby potential adversaries as a result of the massive decontrol of the \ntechnologies of satellite weaponry and satellite reconnaissance and \nsensing.\n  These products are being sold now commercially and are being \npurchased around the world. The sensing and reconnaissance space-based \ntechnologies will have proliferated by the time we may be faced by an \nadversary, which will require that we have some capability to counter \nit.\n  If we do not continue to do the research on this kind of a program, \nwe will be denied that capability when the time comes.\n  China, France, Italy, Spain, and Israel have satellite reconnaissance \ncapability, in addition, of course, to Russia and China. India, Japan, \nNorth Korea, and other countries are moving toward developing such a \ncapability.\n  As the reconnaissance and space-based technology spreads with the \nsale or lease to Third World countries of satellites over time, the \nsatellites will obviously spread as well.\n  The funds recommended by the committee for the tactical antisatellite \nprogram would provide the United States with a contingency capability. \nThat is all we are talking about. That would enable the United States, \nif necessary, to influence the use of these technologies in a conflict \nand to prevent the misuse or denial of space systems and access to \nspace by the United States.\n  During the Persian Gulf war, the U.S. and its coalition allies had \nalmost total domination of space and used unprecedented space-dependent \nmilitary capabilities to achieve victory. Preventing the misuse or \ndenial of space systems and access to space is vital to United States \nnational security.\n  The history of the space advantage enjoyed by the United States and \nits coalition allies I hope will not be forgotten. Future adversaries \nsuch as a rogue nation with access to a nuclear weapon or, for that \nmatter, a ballistic missile with a conventional payload could use space \nto generate a theater atmospheric disturbance, electromagnetic pulse, \ndisrupt signal propagation and, frankly, destroy much of our military \ncommunications system.\n  We have to have a hedge against potential adversaries from misusing \nspace and causing great harm to our satellites and our critical \nintelligence sensors. This $30 million in the defense bill for the \ntactical antisatellite contingency capability is that hedge.\n  So it is critical that we support the Armed Services Committee and \nthe committee's position on this by tabling the Harkin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes and 32 seconds, and \nthe Senator from Alaska has 32 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will respond to my friend from Arizona \nagain by saying first of all that the Army tried to handle this weapon \nseveral years ago. The Pentagon did not even want it during the Bush \nadministration. The Clinton administration zeroed it out. Nobody thinks \nthere is any necessity for this.\n  My friend from Arizona cannot name one rogue nation that even has a \nsatellite, let alone the means to get it up there and keep it in orbit. \nNo one has even the remotest possibility of doing this right now, No. \n1.\n  Second, it is much cheaper to jam them electronically than it is to \nbuild an antisatellite weapons system and go up there and blast it out \nof space. We have technology right now to jam any satellite and \nelectronically blind any of those satellites that are there. So it is \nmuch cheaper. We already have that technology.\n  Third, yes, I respond to my friend from Arizona by saying we have to \ndo whatever we can to keep antisatellite weapons from outer space. I do \nnot care who uses it. Even if we were to use them in the future, it \nwould deny us accessibility to space.\n  The Senator from Arizona said to use that argument is like saying we \nshould not bomb Baghdad, an enemy stronghold, because there would be \nrubble there. But that would not deny us access to a city or to an area \nbecause it all falls to the ground. But in outer space, with this junk \norbiting for hundreds of years, it denies us that access to space. So \nwhile it might blast that satellite out, it also keeps us from using \nthat availability in space either for military purposes or for domestic \npurposes.\n  So I just think this is $30 million that we ought to save for the \ntaxpayers.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield back our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask that this amendment be set aside \nand that we proceed to vote on the first amendment, the Wellstone \namendment, to reduce the proliferation level by $3.2 million.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The motion to table has already been made, and the yeas \nand nays have been ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I might ask the Senator from Alaska, I \nthought we would have 2 minutes. Is that correct?\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is correct. The Senator is entitled to his 2 \nminutes, if he asks for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I say to my colleagues that back in May we had a vote \nthat was an amendment to raise the DOD appropriations above the \nadministration's request. That amendment was voted down 60 to 40, a \nbipartisan vote. Then, a week ago we had a Kohl-Grassley amendment on \nthe authorization bill which essentially eliminated the $7 billion, \nwhich was over the administration's request. That was the amendment. \nThat amendment was defeated. So there were effectively 48 votes for the \nKohl-Grassley amendment.\n  What I have done is pegged the $6.4 billion in this appropriations \nbill over the administration's request, over the Chairman of Joint \nChiefs of Staff, over the Pentagon's request, and I have just simply \ncut this in half.\n  So this amendment just says the Senators who have voted for this \nbefore, really a reduction, $3.2 billion from the $6.4 billion over \nwhat the administration requested, and this $3.2 billion would be used \nsolely for deficit reduction.\n  Mr. President, as my colleague from North Dakota said, we do not need \nto spend money we do not have for things we do not need.\n And if we are going to be serious about deficit reduction, $3.2 \nbillion of the $6.4 billion over budget request is not too much to ask.\n\n  This is on behalf of myself, Senators Feingold, Harkin, Simon, \nBumpers, and Dorgan.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, regardless of what has been said, of the \nfour bills pertaining to defense, this has the least spending, I regret \nto say.\n  I have moved to table.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the motion to table the Wellstone amendment 2404. The yeas \nand nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Florida [Mr. Mack] is \nnecessarily absent.\n\n[[Page S 12186]]\n\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Bradley] \nis absent because of illness in the family.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2403\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the next amendment is a Bingaman \namendment. Once again, the Senator from New Mexico has 2 minutes to \nexplain this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this is a very straightforward amendment \nto cut $90 million from the bill. This was added to fund three \nantiarmor munitions. There is $20 million for the TOW 2B antiarmor \nmissile, $40 million for the Hellfire II, and $30 million for the CBU-\n87 combined-effect munitions bomb.\n  These three munitions have one thing in common, Mr. President. That \nis: There was no money requested for them in this 1996 defense budget; \nthere was no money requested for them in any of the next 6 years or any \ntime, to our knowledge. The inspector general has issued a report and \nsent us a letter indicating that they are not needed; and they are \nexcess.\n  Let me read one short paragraph from the report. It says:\n\n       Based on . . . the requirements data, the Army and Air \n     Force inventories of TOW 2B's missiles and CBU-87 bombs \n     significantly exceed the amounts of those two munitions that \n     the services project they would use in two major regional \n     contingencies.\n\n  The same thing is said down here about the Hellfire II.\n  Mr. President, this is a very clear choice. People are choosing \nbetween the taxpayers of the country and a few defense contractors. \nThere is no need for these weapons.\n  In some of the earlier amendments we have dealt with, the argument \nhas been made that maybe they are not asked for next year, but \nsometime, 5, 6 years from now, the Department would like to have them. \nThese are not requested at any time. They are excess. We do not need \nthem. We have enough. If there has ever been an amendment where people \nhave a clear choice between the taxpayer and a few defense contractors, \nthis is the amendment. I hope the Senate will not table this amendment \nand will vote to save this $90 million.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, these are the three most effective \nmunitions. The Chiefs of Staff, when they met with us, put these \nmunitions as their top priority. This is funding a specific \nauthorization in the authorization bill which we will approve in \nSeptember.\n  I already moved to table and have asked for the yeas and nays.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The \nquestion is on agreeing to the motion to lay on the table the amendment \nNo. 2403. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Florida [Mr. Mack] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD.

Mr. President, we are going to the Harkin amendment. The \nSenator has 2 minutes to explain his amendment. It is an amendment to \nstrike the theater missile defense money.\n  The Senator has his 2 minutes on this amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2401\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is amendment 2401 offered \nby the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I understand I have 2 minutes, is that \nright?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this is a $70 million add-on by the committee for the \nspace-based laser. This is the old star wars program. It goes back 10 \nyears or more.\n  We thought we had kind of killed this snake some time ago. Now it is \nback again. Basically, this is to build this big mirror in space with a \nlaser, a chemical laser.\n  Quite frankly, it violates the ABM Treaty. Article 5 of the ABM \nTreaty states specifically that we will not build space-based weapons \nsystems, and that is exactly what this is.\n  Second, it is not cost-effective. There are other ways of thwarting \nany other kind of missiles or nuclear warheads coming into this \ncountry. Most of the rogue nations we know about now would not build a \nballistic missile. They would smuggle it in.\n They bring it in on a submarine or something else like that rather \nthan building a big intercontinental ballistic missile.\n\n  Third, this laser can be countered by the very coating they are now \nputting on the mirror which they can put on the missiles themselves.\n  It is basically to save $70 million for the taxpayers of this country \nand to make us still compliant with the ABM Treaty.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I believe Senator Kyl will respond for 1 minute.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, this is an important program. According to \nthe GAO, the space-based laser program has met every technical \nmilestone. No one has criticized it on technical grounds.\n\n[[Page S 12187]]\n\n  The Senator from Iowa has asserted it is a violation of the ABM \nTreaty. That is not accurate. The ABM Treaty does not prohibit \nresearch. That is what this is. This is a research program, nowhere \nnear deployment. In fact, it may never be deployed.\n  It is important for our country to have a very highly leveraged, \nhighly technical program such as this. This is the last of the directed \nenergy programs, and it is the kind of program that we need to continue \nto do the research as a hedge against the kind of future threat that we \nmay have to face. It is not a threat anywhere near deployment--only \nresearch money. I hope the motion to table is agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, will the Senate be in order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will please be in order. The \nSenator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we are about ready to have the last vote \nof the evening. The Harkin amendment is next. We will have our first \nvote tomorrow morning at 9:30. We anticipate four to five votes at the \nmost tomorrow morning. We have a series of amendments we are going to \ntake this evening, and we believe the amendments that will be left for \nshort debate and vote will be four to five amendments at most.\n  The Senator from Iowa has 2 minutes on his amendment, if he wishes to \nuse it at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2402\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this is an amendment to, again, strike the \n$30 million. We could not get the $70 million out. There were 41 votes \non this. This is $30 million out of the space-based laser. This is $30 \nmillion the Pentagon did not want. No one wanted it. It was added on in \ncommittee for an antisatellite weapons testing.\n  Again, this is something this body has voted against in the past. It \nwas not requested by the Pentagon. Three things:\n  First, we know what will happen if we use antisatellite weapons to \nshoot down satellites. It will put a lot of space junk into orbit.\n  Second, there is a cheaper and more effective way and that is by \njamming electronically any satellites that are put up there to spy. We \ncan do that and do it a lot cheaper than building an antisatellite \nweapons system to shoot them down.\n  Third, there is not any nation out there today that has a satellite--\nwhose satellite are we going to shoot down? No country, whether it is \nNorth Korea, Iraq, Iran, or any other country has a satellite, let \nalone the delivery systems to get them in orbit. Our intelligence \ncommunity recognizes no threat of any nation like that having that \ncapability in the foreseeable future.\n  It is $30 million. It is not needed. We voted this down in the past. \nLet us save our taxpayers at least $30 million and save this money from \nresearch on the antisatellite weapons.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator will yield to the Senator from New Hampshire \nfor 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized \nfor 2 minutes.\n  This is the final 2 minutes before the vote. The Senate will please \ncome to order. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska for \nyielding me this time.\n  Numerous potentially hostile nations now do have indigenous satellite \ncapabilities, contrary to what has been said. Adversaries can use space \nassets for intelligence, communication, navigation, weather and, yes, \ntargeting.\n  U.S. military commanders, including General Horner, the man who ran \nthe air campaign in Desert Storm, have stated unequivocally ASAT \ncapability is essential to protect our forces in the field. It is a \ncontingency capability. And to say on the floor of the U.S. Senate we \nshould not use ASAT technology because it is going to create space \ndebris is simply incorrect. It does not create space debris. It \ndisables the satellite. It does not blow it up. That is simply wrong, I \nsay to the Senator from Iowa. It is totally wrong to make that kind of \nrepresentation on the floor of the Senate.\n  Beyond a shadow of a doubt, we have demonstrated in Desert Storm that \nspace will forever be an asset that is essential in military warfare. \nWe have to preserve it. This program is essential to preserving the \nsecurity of our forces and to say we would expose our forces, for the \nsake of not creating space debris--which it does not create in the \nfirst place--is really remarkable, that such a statement would be made.\n  That is exactly why the kinetic energy ASAT program is so important. \nIt is the capability to enable us to literally blind our adversaries, \nprotect our troops, and ensure we can decisively prevail in future \nconflicts.\n  I urge my colleagues to please pay very careful attention to what \nthey are doing and please table this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on the motion to table \namendment No. 2402.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \nmotion was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                     amendment no. 2391, withdrawn\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the amendment that I had offered in the \nChamber earlier, the NATO Participation Act, sent a strong signal of \nthis Nation of the determination to make sure that the countries of \nCentral Europe that want to be free, that want to stand beside us, and \nthat want to revitalize their economy along a free and democratic line \nhave an extended helping hand in the United States and of comradeship \nin terms of mutual defense. Those countries bring to NATO an enormous \npotential in terms of additional protection from the North Atlantic.\n  We have incorporated a number of amendments which I believe have \nstrengthened the measure. There have been other thoughtful suggestions \nmade by other Members in this Chamber and requests from the very \ndistinguished senior Senator from Georgia. He has some excellent ideas \nthat he wants to add to it, and has some thoughts that are appropriate \nto enter into the debate.\n  So to accommodate his request, and I think the potential of improving \nthe measure even further, it is my intention to have that measure \nconsidered by other appropriations subcommittees so that it may come \nbefore the Chamber at a later time allowing the Senator from Georgia \nand others who wish to make an issue to put into it to do that, and \nhave time to prepare for that measure.\n  So, Mr. President, I am heartened by the very strong bipartisan \nsupport that the NATO Participation Act has. I believe it will have \neven stronger support when it comes to the floor on a future bill.\n  At this point, to accommodate those who wish to add that additional \nconsideration, I will withdraw the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the right to withdraw his \namendment.\n  So the amendment (No. 2391) was withdrawn.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2421\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is our intention now to move to the \namendments that were in the managers' package, to explain them and to \nmake a record of why we are prepared to proceed with these amendments.\n  I call up amendment 2421.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on amendment 2421.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this amendment proposes to change section \n8024 based on consultations with the Department of Defense regarding \nthe procurement of M-11 9 millimeter handguns for naval aviators. In \naddition, this amendment proposes that the Armed Services be allowed to \nprocure .38 and .45 caliber ammunition until such time as the services \nhave converted to the 9 millimeter handgun.\n  I believe Senator Inouye is in agreement with me that this is an \namendment that we should accept. I ask for its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  The amendment (No. 2421) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2417\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2417 for Senator \nAbraham.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on amendment No. 2417.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, in further demonstration of our resolve \nto downsize the government and eliminate needless departments, \nagencies, commissions, boards, and councils, this amendment which I \noffer along with Senators Inhofe and Grams, will prohibit funding for \nthe Defense Policy Committee on Trade. This is the third such amendment \noffered by myself and the other GOP freshman Senators to the \nappropriations bills to eliminate unnecessary and wasteful functions of \ngovernment.\n  The Defense Policy Advisory Committee on Trade was established under \nthe Trade Act of 1974 to serve both the Department of Defense and the \nOffice of the U.S. Trade Representative by providing the Secretary and \nTrade Representative with policy advice and information regarding \ndefense trade policy issues and domestic industrial base uses, \nspecifically with regards to prohibitions on the transfer of dual-use \ntechnologies to the Soviet Union and its former client states. The \nthirty-five member committee meets twice each year. The committee \nreceived an estimated $4,405 in 1994.\n  The Office of Management and Budget has proposed repealing Section \n3151(c) of the National Defense Authorization Act of 1991, P.L. 101-\n510, which authorized the technical committee. The committee's report \nwas provided to Congress on October 7, 1991, thereby terminating the \nresponsibilities of the committee. This committee is a Cold War \nanachronism and is no longer applicable to our national security needs. \nFurthermore, the issues of arms control, disarmament, and dual-use \ntechnology have changed markedly since the establishment of this \ncommittee, and the thrust of verification techniques no longer is \ndirected toward mutually verifiable procedures.\n  This amendment promotes the type of reform which is supported by the \nGAO, the CBO, and in some cases the President. It terminates funding \nfor a committee, the job of which is complete. While it may not achieve \nsavings in the millions of dollars, it is an important step in \ncomplying with the demands of the American people who told us on \nNovember 8, 1994, to balance the budget and cut the size of the \nGovernment. It is important that we demonstrate that resolve by \nreviewing even the most insignificant or inexpensive programs as well \nas the more prominent ones. Let us show the public we are serious and \neliminate this useless panel.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. This is an amendment that is offered to eliminate \nneedless departments, agencies, reports and commissions. It deals with \nthe Defense Policy Committee on Trade. This amendment would eliminate \nthat advisory committee.\n  I am prepared to recommend adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. INOUYE. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2417) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n                          antitank ammunition\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Will the Chairman yield?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield to my friend, the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I congratulate the Chairman on the efforts of the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee which the Senator chairs, and those of the \nArmed Services Committee, in addressing the problems caused by \ninadequate funding of ammunition programs. Correcting the current \nshortages in modern, preferred munitions is key to ensuring military \nreadiness.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator, and I agree that these shortages \nmust be corrected.\n  Mr. GRAMS. There is one shortage in a modern, preferred munition used \nby our M1 tanks--the M830A1 high-explosive anti-tank round--which is \nnot addressed in your bill. Although the budgets of the Army and the \nMarine Corps contained no requests for this round because of overall \nfunding constraints, the Armed Services Committee has authorized M830A1 \nfor both Services.\n\n[[Page S 12189]]\n\n  Reports indicate that the total number of M830A1 rounds the Army has \non hand and on order is approximately one-half of its actual inventory \nobjective, and that absent continued funding our industrial capability \nto produce this kind of modern tank ammunition will rapidly disappear. \nIf that happens, filling the other half of the inventory at some point \nin the future will take much longer, be much more difficult, and cost \nmuch more than continuing production now at a modest level. Given this, \nI have strongly urged the Senate to consider funding for the M830A1, \nand I continue to do so.\n  I am sure that these issues are know to the Chairman, and I also \nrecognize the difficult task he faced in prioritizing many vital but \nunbudgeted programs. It would appear that a conference with the House \nof Representatives on the defense appropriations bill ies well in the \nfuture. In the interim, new information or changed circumstances may \ndevelop which may warrant assigning a higher priority to funding for \nthe M830A1.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is a possibility.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I ask that the Chairman remain open to that possibility, \nand that reconsideration in conference of funding for the M830A1 remain \nan option.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Should circumstances at the time warrant, such \nreconsideration will be an option.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I thank the chairman.\n                     maritime patrol aircraft force\n\n  Mr. COHEN. I would like to engage the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Defense regarding our Maritime Patrol \nAircraft [MPA] force. As my colleague knows, the P-3 squadrons which \ncomprise our Maritime Patrol force make an invaluable contribution to \nanti-submarine warfare missions.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am fully aware of the role our P-3 aircraft play in \nour national security and I would be happy to engage the senior Senator \nfrom Maine in a colloquy regarding this issue.\n  Mr. COHEN. I am very concerned about the loss in operational \ncapability of our Maritime Patrol Aircraft force. The services of P-3 \nsquadrons are historically in very high demand by the unified \ncommanders. In recent years, that demand has increased dramatically as \nthe ability of the P-3 aircraft to carry out littoral warfare missions \nhas become more apparent. Simultaneously, however, budget pressures \nhave forced the Navy to cut P-3 force structure in its budget request. \nThe current maritime patrol aircraft force structure consists of 22 \nsquadrons, 13 active and 9 reserve squadrons. The Navy has reduced the \nnumber of active and reserve P-3 squadrons from 24 active squadrons in \n1990 to 13 active and 9 reserve in 1994. The fiscal year 1996 budget \nrequest would support Navy plans to reduce MPA force structure to 20 \nsquadrons, 12 active and 8 reserve squadrons.\n  There is strong justification for maintaining no less than 13 active \nand 9 reserve squadrons. The Unified Commanders need to maintain at \nleast 22 squadrons. In a letter dated February 4, 1995, Navy Secretary \nDalton informed the Senate Armed Services Committee that, ``at the \nproposed fiscal year 1996 MPA aircraft force levels, it is not possible \nto meet the unified commanders' minimum maritime patrol forward \npresence requirement of 40 aircraft with only active Maritime Patrol \nAircraft assets.'' It is expected that the Unified Commanders' minimum \nMPA requirements will be met in 1999.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I understand that the Senate Armed Services Committee \nrecognized the contribution the P-3's make in meeting our maritime \npatrol mission.\n  Mr. COHEN. That is correct. The Armed Services Committee also \nrecognized that Maritime Patrol Aircraft are ideally suited to meet a \nvariety of mission requirements for littoral operations very \neffectively and efficiently and authorized an additional $35 million to \nsustain the MPA force structure at 13 active and 9 reserve squadrons in \nfiscal year 1996. The Secretary of the Navy, the Chief of Naval \nOperations, and the Unified Commanders have all expressed their support \nfor the action taken by the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I assure that I share his concerns and intend to raise \nthis issue in the Joint House/Senate Appropriations Conference.\n  Mr. COHEN. I thank the chairman of the Appropriation's Subcommittee \non Defense.\n                           amendment no. 2412\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I now call up amendment 2412. I ask the \nSenator from Hawaii if he wishes to present this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on amendment No. 2412.\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, this amendment denies pay and allowances \nfor military prisoners and provides authority for the Department of \nDefense to provide for their dependents.\n  We have discussed this matter. There are no objections.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2412) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. FORD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2420\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I call up amendment 2420 for Mr. Lugar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on amendment No. 2420.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, on behalf of the committee, we recommend \nthat funds in relation to the procurement of ammunition for the Army be \nwithheld unless the acquisition fully complies with the Competition and \nContracting Act.\n  This is the effect of this amendment. I ask for adoption of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nno, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2420) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. FORD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2413\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we now call up amendment 2413. I ask the \nSenator from Hawaii if he would like to explain this for Mr. Feingold.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, this is an amendment to eliminate the \nProject ELF.\n  Mr. STEVENS. This is an amendment which was accepted on the \nauthorization bill, and we accept it on this bill.\n                              project elf\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, This amendment, for myself and Senator \nKohl, will terminate a military program in our own state. I understand \nthe amendment will be accepted by the managers and I appreciate their \ncooperation on this matter. The amendment involves Project ELF, the \nNavy's Extremely Low Frequency communications project located in Clam \nLake, Wisconsin, and Republic, Michigan. This is a program that is \nineffective, out of date, and unwanted by most residents in my state, \neven though it does employ Wisconsinites.\n  The members of the Wisconsin delegation have fought hard for years to \nclose down Project ELF; I have introduced legislation three times to \nterminate it; and I have recommended it for closure to the Defense Base \nClosure and Realignment Commission.\n  This time, I am offering an amendment which would limit funds \nappropriated in this bill to termination costs to mothball Project ELF. \nThe Navy has estimated that it will cost $12.2 million to shut down and \ndeactivate the ELF system.\n  For a Congress supposedly in hot pursuit of spending cuts, one would \nthink Project ELF could be eliminated. Instead, as if it were some kind \nof pet project of a home state Senator, it lingers like a blot in our \nbudget.\n\n                           Description of ELF\n\n  Project ELF is a one-way, primitive messenger system designed to \nsignal to--not communicate with--deeply submerged Trident submarines. \nIt is a ``bell ringer,'' a pricey ``beeper'' system, used to tell the \nsubmarine when to rise to the surface to get a more detailed message \nthrough real communications systems. It was designed at a \n\n[[Page S 12190]]\ntime when the threat of detection to our submarines was real. But ELF \nwas never developed to an effective capacity, and the demise of the \nSoviet threat has certainly rendered it unnecessary.\n  The concept of extremely low frequency was first introduced when \nsubmarines started going so far beneath the surface ordinary radios \ncould not reach them. In its first incarnation, in the mid-1960's, \nProject ELF was Project Sanguine: an elaborate--and vulnerable--network \nof 6200 miles of cable and over 100 ELF transmitter towers spread over \n40 percent of northern Wisconsin. It was abandoned when it proved too \nexpensive, too susceptible, and too controversial in the community. \nYears later, after much debate, false starts, budget constrictions, and \nresident antagonism, Project ELF was whittled down to a total of 84 \nmiles of cable and two transmitters over two states. It was hoped that \nonce it was started, it could grow: a typical bureaucratic ``let's-get-\nour-foot-in-the-door'' program.\n\n                           Strategic argument\n\n  But the project has had a hard time gaining momentum exactly because \nit is impractical. Even in its optimum construction, it has no nuclear \nsurvivability or dependability, and therefore little wartime efficacy.\n  In 1979, the General Accounting Office had recommended ``that the \nSecretary of Defense terminate any plans to construct an\n extremely low frequency transmitter system * * * since it is not \nneeded * * * [the system] enhances communications capability only \nmarginally at best.''\n\n  In 1980, the Navy agreed, stating that there was no threat that \nrequired the development of ELF. It was only in 1981, when Secretary of \nDefense Casper Weinberger overruled the Navy and declared that Project \nELF should proceed.\n  It was a bad plan then, and an obsolete one today.\n  The Navy's recent brief on ELF also acknowledges that there is no \ncurrent threat precipitating ELF's continuation: it says, ``Even though \nour submarines are currently, to the best of our knowledge, virtually \ninvulnerable to the present anti-submarine threat, the ELF system is a \nhedge against future developments by our potential enemies.'' That is, \nMr. President, ELF is only operating in case of a future development, \nbut not for current protection.\n  That is why my amendment provides for the mothballing of project ELF. \nFor example, in the unlikely event that a threat emerges in 5 years, we \ncould restart ELF, but have saved the $60 million plus in the interim \nin which it was unnecessary.\n\n                           ELF is inefficient\n\n  In actuality, if ELF served a strategic purpose, this would not be a \nburdensome investment. But Project ELF does not serve such a strategic \npurpose. Even at its best, ELF has been a weapon in search of a mission \nat the right time--but that time has yet to come.\n\n                         Health and environment\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me add a word about the health and \nenvironmental effects of ELF as well, because if you are a resident of \nnorthern Wisconsin, this is something which has been of concern. The \nNavy continues to insist that there are no environmental effect or \nhealth hazards associated with the electromagnetic fields ELF emits: \nit's just that after $25 million\n of study, there has been no conclusive evidence one way or the other. \nI certainly understand any fears the Wisconsin residents must have.\n\n  In fact, in 1984 a U.S. District Court, ruling on State of Wisconsin \nvs. Weinberger ordered Project ELF closed because the Navy paid \ninadequate attention to ELF's possible health effects and violated the \nNational Environmental Policy Act. Interestingly, an appeals court \nthrew out the ruling arguing that the national security threat from the \nSoviets at the time was more important. The premise of that ruling \ntoday is obviously outdated. It should be reconsidered in light of \nrealities in 1995.\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  ELF is not worth any money because it doesn't have a mission.\n  If it is a first-strike weapon, then it is de-stabilizing and \nthreatening, which hardly increases our security. If it is merely a \ncommunications system, it is inadequate. A weapon or a communications \ndevice designed to keep deeply submerged submarines submerged is no \nlonger necessary. It is not protecting us against any capable enemy, \nbut it is using money that could be.\n  As columnist Jack Anderson noted earlier this year, this is an \nexemple of a cut that the delegation wants the Congress to make. We are \nasking the Congress to take our program.\n  We came very close to it earlier this year with the rescissions bill. \nThe Senate Appropriations Committee had recommended it for a cut, and \nthe full Senate had agreed.\n  During conference, there seemed to be a concern that the Navy had \ncome up with a newly invented ``highly classified'' justification for \nELF. There appears to have been some confusion about this project and I \nhave been told there is no new justification for ELF.\n  So, I would urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and fund \nELF's termination this year, not its continuation.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of this amendment to try \nyet again to cut a cold war relic located in Wisconsin: the Extremely \nLow Frequency or ELF system.\n  I thank my colleague from Alaska for his willingness to offer this \namendment.\n  It is astonishing to me that we must continue to come forward to \noffer up this program for the chopping block. We are well aware that \nthis may have a negative impact in our state, but we are willing to \nmake the tough decision to eliminate a program we no longer need and \ncan no longer afford.\n  If we truly want to reduce the deficit, we must start somewhere and \nmake the necessary cuts.\n  As Senator Feingold has detailed, ELF contributes little to our \nnational security. All it can do is signal submarines to come to the \nsurface, thus, it is not a particularly useful or effective \ncommunications system.\n  Even if one could make the case that it might have some strategic \nvalue down the road--something I sincerely doubt--it is such a \ncumbersome obvious system that it would be an easy target. I cannot \nsupport putting citizens of the region at risk for no good reason.\n  Earlier this year, the Senate passed a Defense supplemental bill \nwhich eliminated the ELF program. However, during the conference on the \nDefense supplemental, the Senate position to eliminate ELF was \ndefeated. During the conference, the House brandished new and \nclassified information from an eleventh hour Navy briefing that \nsupposedly revealed that ELF is essential to our national security.\n  When the defense supplemental came back from conference, Senator \nFeingold and I decided not to go forward with a planned amendment to \ncut the program and he sought this highly classified briefing by the \nNavy. To our surprise, the Navy said that it had no highly classified \nbriefing on ELF. Perhaps there was some confusion, they said, and \nopponents of cutting ELF were confusing it with EHF?\n  Mr. President, the Navy has to do better than this. Last minute \nsecret justifications for creaky low technology projects are just not \nenough to justify millions of dollars in spending. I am certain that my \ncolleagues in the Senate will agree.\n  Our amendment mothballs the ELF system so that it could be started up \nagain if necessary. We don't think it ever will be necessary, but this \namendment should address the concerns of our colleagues who take a more \ncautious approach to these matters.\n  Mr. President, I urge the Senate to cut this program in our state of \nWisconsin. It is not often that Senators try to kill a $12 million \nprogram in their own state, and I want to commend my colleague from \nWisconsin, Senator Feingold, for his work on this issue. The Senate has \ncut ELF before. I urge my colleagues to do so again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2413.\n  The amendment (No. 2413) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  \n[[Page S 12191]]\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2419\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I now call up amendment No. 2419 for Mr. \nMcConnell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on amendment No. 2419.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the \nGeneral Accounting Office reports to the Congress on any proposed \nchanges to the Department of Defense commissary access policy and \naddress the financial impact of the commissaries as a result of any \nproposed policy changes.\n  We agree to accept the amendment. I ask for its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2419) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2411\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I now call up amendment No. 2411.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on amendment 2411.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, has the amendment been adopted?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has not.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We ask for adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  So the amendment (No. 2411) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n                ELECTRONIC COMBAT MASTER PLAN AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, my good friend and fellow Senator from \nFlorida [Mr. Mack] and I would like to engage in a colloquy with the \ndistinguished chairman regarding a matter of fiscal and military \nimportance. In 1994, the House Armed Services Committee directed the \nDepartment of Defense to develop a master plan for future \nconsolidations of DOD-wide electronic combat [EC] test and evaluation \nassets in the interest of reducing infrastructure costs. Unfortunately, \nto date, such a report has not been developed nor forwarded to \nCongress. The BRAC Commission, recognizing the delay by DOD to issue \nthis report, recommended acceptance of the Air Force proposal to \nrealign some of its electronic combat assets, and recommended that the \nmaster plan be used to establish the infrastructure for optimum asset \nutilization.\n  In fact, during the June deliberations of the BRAC Commission, this \nissue was carefully considered by the Commission. The Commission's \nanalysis demonstrated that the move would ``never net a return on \ninvestment,'' nor was it a part of a master plan to consolidate EC \nassets in a cost-effective manner. The Commission, in desiring to see a \nmaster plan developed, felt that by endorsing the Air Force proposal, \nthey would prompt DOD to finally move ahead with the master plan.\n  Mr. President, during any discussion of downsizing and consolidation \nthere is no disagreement regarding the fact that all such decisions \nmust be made in an intelligent and cost-efficient fashion. It is my, \nand my fellow Florida colleague's hope that the early completion of the \nmaster plan will allow DOD and the Congress to proceed according to \nthese considerations.\n  In that light, we would like to direct a few questions to the \nchairman to ensure that the committee's intent is clear with regards to \nthe master plan and EC asset consolidation.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would be happy to respond to the questions that my \nfriends from Florida wish to ask.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Is it the committee's desire to see that the master plan \nis completed so that the services can go forward with optimum and cost-\nefficient asset utilization?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The senior Senator from Florida is correct. The \ncommittee has long supported such planning which saves taxpayers' \ndollars. This is even more important in our current fiscal climate in \nwhich we struggle to meet our military requirements.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, it is my understanding that no funds have \nbeen requested nor provided in fiscal year 1996 for the realignment of \nEC equipment. I ask, is this the chairman's understanding?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes, this is, in fact, the case. If a formal \nreprogramming request would be necessary, I would be pleased to work \nwith the Senators from Florida at that time.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Given the chairman's response, I ask that he send to the \ndesk an amendment on my behalf, cosponsored by my colleague from \nFlorida, which requires DOD to complete and submit to the congressional \ndefense committees an EC master plan no later than March 31, 1996.\n  We thank the chairman for his cooperation, and look forward to \nworking with him in the future on this matter.\n           radio communications systems for the LPD-17 class\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I would like to call to the attention of \nmy distinguished colleague, the Chairman of the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee, Senator Stevens, an issue that I know is of mutual \ninterest.\n  I note that our colleagues in the other body have included in the \nHouse Defense Appropriations Bill, funding for a new class of \nAmphibious Transport Dock ships, the so called LPD-17 class of \nAmphibious ships. In our own deliberations, while recognizing the need \nfor replacing the aging Austin class of such ships, other priorities, \nand allocation constraints did not allow us to fund this vessel.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, my colleague is correct. While we \nrecognize the need to modernize our amphibious capabilities by \nreplacing the older LPD's now in service, funding constraints did not \nallow us to do that this year.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I have a related concern that I want to \nbring to my colleague's attention, should the conferees or any future \ndeliberations determine that funding for the LPD-17 can be made \navailable. As my colleagues may remember, the FY 93 Base Realignment \nand Closure Commission recommended, and the Congress approved, the \nconsolidation of all Department of Navy in service engineering support \nfor Command, Control and Ocean Surveillance systems at the Navy \nfacility in Charleston, South Carolina. In reorganizing to carry out \nthis action, the Navy has developed a mission statement for this \nfacility in Charleston, called NISE-EAST, identifying it as the lead \nfacility for all engineering, analysis, design, testing, installing, \nupgrading, and training support for all shore based, mobile, and afloat \nNavy communications systems. I want to insure that should the \nconferees, or any future deliberations result in funding being made \navailable for the LPD-17, that the NISE-East facility in Charleston be \ndesignated as the appropriate facility to perform in service \nengineering support for the radio communications systems associated \nwith that class of vessels. Any attempt to divert that workloading \nelsewhere would be an unwarranted intrusion into internal workloading \nprocesses in the Navy, and would seriously undermine the Base Closure \nand Realignment process.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I believe my colleague from South \nCarolina has expressed an appropriate concern. All of us have a shared \ninterest in insuring that our actions do not either directly or \nindirectly undermine the Base Closure process. While I cannot determine \nat this time if funding might be made available for the LPD-17, I will \nrequest that the Conferees endorse the Senator from South Carolina's \nproposal, if the Conference funds the LPD-17.\n                           amendment no. 2418\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I now call up amendment No. 2418.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on amendment No. 2418.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The committee provided $45,458,000 for the intercooled \nrecouperative turbine, the ICR project, of the Advanced Surface \nMachinery Program. The funds were provided for development and testing \nof the ICR. This is an amendment for Senator Specter and Senator \nSantorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? Without objection, \nthe amendment is agreed to.\n\n[[Page S 12192]]\n\n  So the amendment (No. 2418) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2405\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I call up amendment No. 2405.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on amendment No. 2405.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to the \nFiscal Year 1996 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill. My \namendment requires the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the \nArmy to review the need for the Selected Reserve Incentive Program \n(SRIP) for infantry reservists.\n  Due to the Army's agreement which placed all CONUS-based infantry \nunits in the National Guard system, the famed 100th Battalion in Hawaii \nis the only remaining infantry unit in the Army Reserves. The 100th \nBattalion has been designated as a round-out unit--one of the units \nthat constitutes the 29th Infantry Enhanced Brigade. As part of the \nenhanced brigade, the 100th Battalion is required to recruit and retain \n125 percent of the required personnel end-strength. Currently, the \n100th Battalion is 157 enlisted soldiers short of their required \nstrength. The lack of the SRIP for reservists in the Career Management \nField (CMF) 11 has contributed to this shortfall. As a result, the \n100th Battalion has been placed at a disadvantage in competing for \nqualified personnel.\n  Mr. President, my amendment directs the Secretary of Defense and the \nSecretary of the Army to review this situation to ensure that the only \ninfantry reserve unit left in the Army Reserves is treated fairly. I \nappreciate the support of the managers of this bill, Senator Stevens \nand Senator Inouye, and their staffs, particularly Mr. Charlie Houy and \nMs. Sid Ashworth, for their assistance.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I ask unanimous consent that this amendment be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  I not, without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  So the amendment (No. 2405) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2414\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I call up amendment 2414.\n  This is an amendment for Senator Inouye and Senator Domenici dealing \nwith the strategic targeting system.\n  Doe the Senator wish to explain?\n  Mr. INOUYE. I have an explanation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. This has been approved.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It provides $10 million, the budget request amount, for \nthe strategic target system program, known as Stars. The amendment \ndirects that these funds are available only to continue the Stars \nprogram. The Stars program can provide critical test support to theater \nand national missile defense programs. The committee endorses \ncontinuation of this important program.\n  I ask for the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the amendment is agreed to.\n  So this amendment (No. 2414) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2409\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I call up amendment No. 2409 for Mr. Pryor.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I this is an amendment to eliminate an obstacle to the \nquick redevelopment of closing military bases.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to help \neliminate a current obstacle to the quick redevelopment of closing \nmilitary bases.\n  My amendment will give the military services greater flexibility to \nnegotiate longer interim leases for the reuse of base property where \nthe military is preparing for its departure. It will do so in a \nresponsible way that does not eliminate vital environmental safeguards.\n  This amendment will hopefully solve many interim leasing problems \nthat are occurring at closing bases nationwide.\n  At Eaker Air Force Base in Blytheville, Arkansas, Cotton Growers Inc. \napproached the local redevelopment authority about storing cotton in an \nold B-52 hanger until cotton prices improved. Upon learning from the \nAir Force that they could receive only a one year lease with a 30 day \ncancellation clause, Cotton Growers Inc. decided not to locate at \nEaker.\n  At Alameda Naval base in Alameda, California, AEG Transportation is \nseeking a ten year lease to obtain use of base property to refurbish \nrail cars for the San Francisco-based BART public transit company. The \nBART contract is for ten years, and AEG desires a ten year commitment \nbefore spending millions of dollars on capital improvements to Alameda \nproperty. Unfortunately, the Department of the Navy is thus far \nunwilling to enter into a lease agreement longer than five years. This \nstalemate could result in the loss of an attractive tenant for Alameda.\n  The military services have informed my office that the inability to \noffer longer interim leases is due primarily to their fear of a lawsuit \nover requirements from the National Environmental Protection Act of \n1969, the so-called NEPA. This amendment attempts to address this \nproblem without degrading the environment or fully exempting interim \nleases from NEPA.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of this amendment be placed in \nthe Record immediately following my remarks.\n  In recent years, Congress and the Clinton Administration have made \nsubstantial progress in removing the obstacles that have blocked past \nefforts to redevelop bases. This amendment will help remove yet another \nbarrier.\n  It will give the military services greater flexibility to negotiate \nwith interested tenants. It also ensures that our effort to create jobs \nand economic activity on base does not come at the expense of the \nenvironment.\n  I thank the distinguished chairman and the ranking member for \naccepting this amendment.\n  I also thank the Department of Defense, the Departments of Army, Navy \nand Air Force, the Council on Environmental Quality, the Environmental \nProtection Agency, Senators Chafee, Baucus, Lautenberg, and Boxer from \nthe Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and Senators Nunn and \nThurmond from the Senate Armed Services Committee who contributed \ngreatly to the adoption of this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask for the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  So the amendment (No. 2409) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2416\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2416.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on amendment No. 2416.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this was offered by Senator Warner, for \nhimself, Senator Lieberman, Senator Dodd, and Senator Robb, to ensure \nessential elements of a nuclear attack submarine agreement, which was \nincluded in the defense authorization bill, are included in this \nappropriations bill.\n  They have offered this amendment to ensure fair, equitable treatment \nand maintenance of both nuclear-capable shipyards.\n  I ask for the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, without \nobjection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  So the amendment (No. 2416) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S 12193]]\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2415\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask for consideration now of amendment \nNo. 2415.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on amendment No. 2415.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, this amendment appeared in the \nauthorization bill. There is no opposition.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this is a zero sum transfer of $40 \nmillion from O, defensewide, to the humanitarian assistance program. \nThis amendment would provide a total of $60 million for humanitarian \nassistance in the bill and subject to conference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, without \nobjection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  So the amendment (No. 2415) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2397\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I now call up amendment No. 2397.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on amendment No. 2397.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this is the amendment that was offered by \nSenator Simon, for himself and Mr. Bumpers, to modify the loan \nguarantee provision which was previously subject to debate.\n  This amendment requires that the exposure fees charged and collected \nby the Secretary of Defense for each defense export loan guarantee be \npaid by the country involved and not be financed as part of the \nguaranteed loan on the part of the United States.\n  We are prepared to accept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  So the amendment (No. 2397) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. INOUYE.

Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2407 for Senator \nKyl.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on amendment No. 2407.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this amendment fences all but $52 million \nof the funds provided for the former Soviet Union threat reduction, \nwhich was $365 million, until three conditions are certified by the \nPresident as having been met:\n  First, United States-Russia completed joint LAB study regarding \nRussian proposal to neutralize CW and United States agrees with \nproposal;\n  Second, Russia has prepared plan to manage dismantlement-destructions \nof Russia CW stockpile;\n  Third, United States-Russia committed to resolving outstanding issues \nregarding 1989 Wyoming MOU and 1990 bilateral destruction agreement.\n                    amendment no. 2407, as modified\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I send to the desk a modification of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a right to modify the \namendment.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 82, between lines 11 and 12, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 8087. LIMITATION ON USE OF FUNDS FOR COOPERATIVE THREAT \n                   REDUCTION.\n\n       (a) Limitations.--Of the funds available under title II \n     under the heading ``Former Soviet Union Threat Reduction'' \n     for dismantlement and destruction of chemical weapons, not \n     more than $52,000,000 may be obligated or expended for that \n     purpose until the President certifies to Congress the \n     following:\n       (1) That the United States and Russia have completed a \n     joint laboratory study evaluating the proposal of Russia to \n     neutralize its chemical weapons and the United States agrees \n     with the proposal.\n       (2) That Russia is in the process of preparing, with the \n     assistance of the United States as necessary, a comprehensive \n     plan to manage the dismantlement and destruction of the \n     Russia chemical weapons stockpile.\n       (3) That the United States and Russia are committed to \n     resolving outstanding issues under the 1989 Wyoming \n     Memorandum of Understanding and the 1990 Bilateral \n     Destruction Agreement.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) The term ``1989 Wyoming Memorandum of Understanding'' \n     means the Memorandum of Understanding between the Government \n     of the United States of America and the Government of the \n     Union of Soviet Socialist Republics Regarding a Bilateral \n     Verification Experiment and Data Exchange Related to \n     Prohibition on Chemical Weapons, signed at Jackson Hole, \n     Wyoming, on September 23, 1989.\n       (2) The term ``1990 Bilateral Destruction Agreement'' means \n     the Agreement between the United States of America and the \n     Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on destruction and non-\n     production of chemical weapons and on measures to facilitate \n     the multilateral convention on banning chemical weapons \n     signed on June 1, 1990.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask for the adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. INOUYE. No objection.\n  Mr. STEVENS. This was cleared personally by me with Senator Nunn and \nSenator Kyl.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, without objection, the amendment, as modified, is agreed to.\n  So the amendment (No. 2407), as modified, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator wish to reconsider the vote?\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2406\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2406.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on amendment No. 2406.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, my amendment to the Defense appropriations \nbill is similar to a sense of the Senate resolution I introduced last \nmonth regarding France's decision to conduct a series of eight \nunderground nuclear explosions in the South Pacific. This action by \nFrance is in contravention of the current international moratorium on \nnuclear testing. The amendment I offer today expresses the sense of the \nSenate that the Republic of France should abide by the current \ninternational moratorium on underground nuclear testing.\n  I am offering this amendment to S. 1087 because I believe it is \nimperative that the Senate go on record on this issue before the August \nrecess. News reports over the past few days indicate that France has \nreadied four of the eight nuclear devices to be exploded in the \nPacific, and it is likely that the first device will be detonated later \nthis month.\n  My original resolution, Senate Resolution 149, is cosponsored by \nSenators Inouye, Kerry, Jeffords, Feinstein, Levin, Simon, Harkin, \nLeahy, Lautenberg, Moseley-Braun, Kassebaum, Bumpers, Exon, Bingaman, \nDaschle, Thomas, Murray, Wellstone, Stevens, Hatfield, and Graham. I am \ngrateful for the positive response I have received in a short period of \ntime from so many of my colleagues.\n  I would like to thank the distinguished chairman and ranking member \nof the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee for their courtesy in \nentertaining this amendment. I would note that they are both cosponsors \nof Senate Resolution 149, and I appreciate their support on this issue. \nI would also like to acknowledge the Members of the other body who have \ntaken the lead on this issue, including Congressmen Eni Faleomavaega, \nBen Gilman, chairman of the International Relations Committee, \nCongressman Ed Markey, and Congressman Jim Leach.\n  To briefly review events, on June 13, 1995, French President Jacques \nChirac announced that the Republic of France planned to resume nuclear \ntesting in the South Pacific. A series of eight underground tests are \nplanned, ending in May, 1996, at Mururoa Atoll in French Polynesia.\n  Following the French announcement, I contacted the White House to \nurge President Clinton to convey the concerns of the United States and \nthe Pacific island nations to France over its \n\n[[Page S 12194]]\nresumption of nuclear testing. We in the Pacific, more than any other \nregion in the world, know the ramifications of nuclear testing. We only \nhave to look at what happened to Bikini, Enewetak, or Rongelap Atolls \nin the Marshall Islands to understand the long-term damage to humans \nand the environment that can occur as a result of nuclear testing.\n  Earlier last week, the 19-nation ASEAN Regional Forum, which includes \nthe United States as a dialogue partner, called for an immediate end to \nnuclear testing during its security conference in Brunei. The \ngovernments of Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and other Asian and \nPacific rim nations have strongly condemned the resumption of nuclear \ntesting. International protests by government, business, civic and \ncommunity groups continue to accelerate and proliferate as the first \ntesting date approaches. France is reaping the whirlwind of \ninternational indignation, extending far beyond the nations and people \nof the Pacific and Asia, for it decision. Governments and world opinion \nrecognize how the continuation or resumption of nuclear testing \njeopardizes international efforts to curb the proliferation of nuclear \nweapons.\n  Mr. President, this past May, the world's five declared nuclear \npowers--the United States, France, Russia, China, and Britain--\npersuaded all NPT-member nations to extend indefinitely the Treaty of \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, NPT. To win that consensus, the \nfive countries promised to sign a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty by the \nend of next year. Yet, less than 2 months after pledging to exercise \nutmost restraint, the French Government reneged on its commitment to \nthe NPT.\n  The French decision to resume testing seriously undermines the \ncredibility of the NPT and complicates international efforts to \nnegotiate a comprehensive test ban treaty. The United States, \nrecognizing that the benefit of nuclear testing is outweighed by the \nharm it would cause our leadership on nonproliferation issues, has \nextended or ban on testing through September of 1996.\n  We cannot ignore the resumption of nuclear testing by France. By \nadopting this resolution, the Senate will strongly encourage France to \nabide by the current international moratorium on nuclear testing and \nrefrain from proceeding with its announced intention of conducting a \nseries of nuclear tests in advance of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, this has been cleared on both sides. There \nare no objections to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  So the amendment (No. 2406) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Are there any amendments we have dealt with that we have \nfailed to reconsider?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Are there any amendments adopted today that were not \nreconsidered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Are there any amendments voted on today that were not \nreconsidered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No.\n                      life sciences equipment lab\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I thank my friend the chairman, Senator \nStevens for offering an amendment on my behalf. The amendment sets \naside $500,000 for the Air Force's Life Sciences Equipment Lab.\n  The Lab is a unique facility within the Department of Defense, and is \nprobably the only facility of its kind anywhere. Established in 1983, \nit meets three primary functions: (1) provide scientific support to \naircraft mishap investigation boards; (2) train personnel in life \nsciences equipment investigation; and (3) process the everyday \ntechnical problems on such equipment, while also conducting related \ndesign work and test programs.\n  Additionally, the Lab has assisted Joint Task Force--Full Accounting \n(JTF-FA) as it endeavors to determine the status of air crew personnel \nin South East Asia, providing JTF-FA with technical support--involving \nresearch into the formal identification of suspected life sciences \nequipment; artifact analysis to indicated the survival outcome of \nindividuals involved with the equipment; and technical training of \npersonnel being assigned to JTF-FA, to familiarize them with South East \nAsia era equipment and how to conduct scientific investigations.\n  In short, Mr. President, this funding will help ensure the fullest \npossible accounting of those lost in South East Asia, while also \nensuring the lab's continued attention to investigating military \naircraft mishaps and ensuring the effectiveness of the equipment \ndesigned to help ensure the safety of our military's air crews.\n  I believe the amendment has been cleared by both sides, and I thank \nboth Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye for their assistance in this \nmatter.\n                                  b-52\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am very concerned about the national \nsecurity implications of the Administration's decisions with regard to \nstrategic bombers under the Nuclear Posture Review. The Nuclear Posture \nReview recommends retiring 28 B-52H bombers during the coming fiscal \nyear. I believe it would be a serious mistake to unilaterally send a \nlarge number of dual capable bombers to the boneyard. B-52s provide \ncombat-proven conventional capability and a credible nuclear \ndeterrent--something no other weapon system can now match.\n  I understand that the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee was working \nunder very tight budgetary constraints this year. Nonetheless, I am \nvery concerned that the bill before us does not contain additional \nfunding above the Administration's request to ensure that we maintain \nfour combat squadrons of B-52s. At a time when bombers have become \nincreasingly important to our conventional warfighting strategy, we \nneed every bomber we have. A strong B-52 force helps us retain a ready \ndefense that can quickly project power around an increasingly uncertain \nworld, and has been vigorously supported by senior military officers.\n  It is my understanding that the House bill contains an additional \n$180 million to meet B-52 mission requirements. Consequently, I expect \nthat this issue will be addressed in conference. I know my friend from \nHawaii, the distinguished ranking member of the subcommittee, shares my \nview that a strong bomber force is essential to our national security. \nI was wondering whether he would be willing to discuss his view of how \nfunding for B-52s should be resolved in the conference?\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his remarks on \nthis important issue. I want to assure him that I continue to support a \nstrong bomber force. A strong bomber force is vital in today's world, \nand we should not unnecessarily give up the highly cost-effective \ncombat capability of our B-52 force. As the Senator for North Dakota \nnoted, the subcommittee this year was working under tight budgetary \nrestrictions and was unable to provide funding in the Senate bill for \nadditional B-52s. I am pleased that the House was able to do so, and I \ncan assure the Senator from North Dakota that I will work hard in \nconference to make sure that the final bill that goes to the President \nhas sufficient funding to maintain a highly capable B-52 bomber force \nwhich can accomplish its assigned missions.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the distinguished ranking member for that \nassurance.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. 1087, the \n1996 Department of Defense appropriations bill.\n  I commend the distinguished chairman and ranking member for bringing \nthe Senate a bill that meets the most critical needs of the U.S. \nmilitary for the defense of our Nation.\n  The committee has achieved this significant accomplishment even \nthough the Defense Subcommittee contributed additional defense spending \nauthority to both the Energy and Water Development Appropriations \nSubcommittee, which I chair, and the Military Construction \nSubcommittee. These subcommittees also fund vital programs related to \nour national defense.\n\n[[Page S 12195]]\n\n  Mr. President, the Senate version of the Defense appropriations bill \nprovides a total of $242.7 billion in budget authority and $163.6 \nbillion in new outlays for the programs of the Department of Defense in \nfiscal year 1996.\n  When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other completed \nactions are taken into account, the Senate-reported Defense \nappropriations bill totals $242.7 billion in budget authority and \n$243.3 billion in outlays for fiscal year 1996.\n  The Senate bill is within its section 602(b) allocation for both \nbudget authority and outlays. Any significant funding amendments would \nnecessarily have to be offset with savings from within the bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table showing the \nrelationship of the pending bill to the subcommittee's 602(b) \nallocation pursuant to the 1996 budget resolution be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       DEFENSE SUBCOMMITTEE SPENDING TOTALS--SENATE-REPORTED BILL       \n                     [Fiscal year 1996, in millions]                    \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                    Budget              \n                                                   Authority    Outlays \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDefense discretionary:                                                  \n    Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                        \n     completed..................................        -$50     $79,678\n    S. 1087, as reported to the Senate..........     242,534     163,350\n    Scorekeeping adjustment.....................          --          --\n                                                 -----------------------\n      Subtotal defense discretionary............     242,484     243,029\nNondefense discretionary:                                               \n    Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                        \n     completed..................................          --          40\n    S. 1087, as reported to the Senate..........          --          --\n    Scorekeeping adjustment.....................          --          --\n                                                 -----------------------\n      Subtotal nondefense discretionary.........          --          40\nMandatory:                                                              \n    Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                        \n     completed..................................          --          --\n    S. 1087, as reported to the Senate..........         214         214\n    Adjustment to conform mandatory programs                            \n     with budget resolution assumptions.........           0           0\n                                                 -----------------------\n      Subtotal mandatory........................         214         214\n                                                 =======================\n        Adjusted bill total.....................     242,698     243,282\nSenate Subcommittee 602(b) allocation:                                  \n    Defense discretionary.......................     242,486     243,029\n    Nondefense discretionary....................          --          40\n    Violent crime reduction trust fund..........          --          --\n    Mandatory...................................         214         214\n                                                 -----------------------\n        Total allocation........................     242,700     243,283\n                                                 =======================\nAdjusted bill total compared to Senate                                  \n Subcommittee 602(b) allocation:                                        \n    Defense discretionary.......................          -2          -0\n    Nondefense discretionary....................          --          -0\n    Violent crime reduction trust fund..........

Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman and \nranking member for their consideration of several important items that \nI brought to the subcommittee's attention.\n  I urge my colleagues to expedite action on this bill. I urge the \nSenate to adopt the bill.\n                                  fasa\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, last Congress we passed and the \nPresident signed into law the Federal Acquisition Standards Act, or \nFASA. That Act generally seeks to promote efficiencies and cost savings \nthrough competition in contracting services. It provides, among other \nthings, that contracts for Advisory or Assistance Services above \ncertain thresholds must have multiple awards. The theory was that a \nseries of smaller contract awards would generally be more cost \neffective that one large contract.\n  At the same time, we recognized that not all contracts would benefit \nby multiple awards. This could result either because of the specialized \nsubject matter of the contract itself, or because the nature of the \ncontract indicates that a single award would be more efficient. For \nthat reason, we put in place a specific provision for a waiver from the \nmultiple contract award provision.\n  Mr. President, just last week, the Department of the Army issued its \nfirst solicitation for Contractor Advisory and Assistance Services \nsince FASA was passed. This particular solicitation was for a series of \nsupport and integration services for the Chemical Weapons \nDemilitarization program. It would take the current integration and \nsupport contract and divide it into five component parts in an effort \nto comply with FASA.\n  The Chemical Weapons Demilitarization program has been slow to show \nprogress since we first directed Disposal of those weapons in 1986. \nNevertheless, progress is beginning to make itself apparent. Facility \ntesting has begun at Tooele, UT, and the next facility at Anniston, AL \nis scheduled to begin construction in 1996.\n  Mr. President, disposing of our chemical weapons stockpile is a high-\npriority mission, and one which is very highly specialized. I question \nwhether this particular mission lends itself to multiple integration \ncontract awards. I am concerned that because this is the first contract \nto be let for Contractor Advisory and Assistance Services since FASA \nwas passed, the Army might have felt compelled to call for multiple \ncontract awards rather than seeking the exemption.\n  I would like to ask the distinguished bill managers whether they \nshare my opinion that Chemical Weapons Demilitarization is precisely \nthe kind of specialized contract which led to our including the \nexemption provisions in FASA.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I absolutely share the opinion of the Senator from \nLouisiana. As the Senator knows, the subcommittee indicated strong \nsupport for the Army's decision to transfer oversight responsibilities \nfor this program to the Assistant Secretary for Research Development \nand Acquisition. Our specific interest in this transfer was the cost \naccounting and control which would be put in place by treating this \nprogram more as an acquisition program than as a construction program. \nHowever, Chemical Weapons Demilitarization is not an acquisition \nprogram in the traditional sense. Rather, it is a very highly \nspecialized program which places a premium on integration and \ncommunication. By indicating our support for additional cost accounting \nand controls we by no mans meant to indicate that the FASA exemption \nfrom multiple contract awards was not available to the Army in this \ninstance.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I share the opinion of the Senator from \nAlaska in response to the question from the Senator from Louisiana. The \nChemical Weapons Demilitarization Program is a sequential construction \nprogram which depends very heavily on transmitting what is learned at \none facility to the rest of those facilities in the complex. Program \nintegration, environmental permitting, facility oversight and public \noutreach are all integral parts of that mission. Given that fact, the \nArmy has every right to avail itself of the waiver provisions of FASA.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I take it that both of the distinguished managers of \nthis bill agree with me that the Army should consider the waiver \nprovisions of FASA as being completely available in the case of this \nparticular contract award. Is it the intention of the managers to make \nthat clear in the Statement of Managers which would accompany the \nConference report on this legislation?\n  Mr. STEVENS. That would certainly be my intention.\n  Mr. INOUYE. It would be mine as well.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I thank the distinguished managers and yield the floor.\n                   marine corps reserve end strength\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Senator Hutchison and I had intended to \noffer an amendment to add $12.8 million to the Marine Corps Reserve \npersonnel end strength account. The Senate Defense Authorization bill \nincludes authorization for this purpose. It is our understanding that a \nsignificant number of the 274 additional authorized personnel would be \nused to stand up two F/A18 squadrons in Texas and Georgia.\n  Last year, the Chairman assisted me by including report language that \ndirected that the deactivation of the Marine Reserve jet squadrons be \ndelayed until a formal review and report is received by the Committees \non Appropriations. That report has not been received. Am I correct?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I assisted the Senator from New Mexico with this \nlanguage and he is correct that we have not received a copy of the \nreport.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I understand that when the report is released it may \nsay that rather than having two F/A18 squadrons, the Marine Corps \nReserve is considering a squad with a different mix of Harriers, Cobras \nand Hueys. The problem is, Mr. President, there remains a question of \nfunding the nearly $280 million necessary to implement this new mix.\n  Furthermore, I understand that even if they were able to find $280 \nmillion to pay for these aircraft, they still have not addressed the \nincreased training costs that would be caused by basing \n\n[[Page S 12196]]\nthese aircraft in North Carolina, as some have suggested.\n  When the F/A18 squadrons are activated they will be based in major \nmetropolitan areas where the demographic pool for potential reservists \nis larger. Standing up two F/A18 squadrons in the Marine Corps Reserves \nachieves two objectives. First, it assures that Marine Expeditionary \nForces have enough dedicated airborne firepower. Second, it achieves \nthis necessary goal at the least cost possible.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And for myself and Mrs. Hutchison, let me ask the \nChairman--this is a very important issue to the Marine Corps Reserves \nand to us--would he join us in the conference on this bill in fully \naddressing this issue?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I appreciate the Senators' concerns and I will join them \nin the conference on this bill in addressing this issue.\n        strategic environmental research and development program\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished \nmanager of the bill in a brief colloquy regarding the Strategic \nEnvironmental Research and Development Program [SERDP]. As he knows, \nthese funds have been and continue to be used for investigating and \ndemonstrating innovative environmental clean-up technologies. He may \nalso know that the U.S. Army Corps on Engineers Research Laboratory \n[USACERL] has been a very active component of DOD's efforts in this \narea. Through USACERL's work, many of these private/public sector \ntechnologies are now available for commercialization, stimulating small \ncompany creation, economic development and environmental protection.\n  I would urge that the committee support continuation of USACERL's \nexcellent work, particularly remediation activities at the army \nproduction plants.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am aware of the application of innovative remediation \ntechnologies at numerous DOD sites throughout the country. I appreciate \nthe Senator from Michigan's thoughtful comments on the Army Corps' work \nand bringing it to my attention.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Very briefly, I would like to provide the Senator from \nAlaska with two specific examples that demonstrate just how effective \nUSACERL has been.\n  The first example is an innovative air control technology being \nimplemented at the Lake City Army Ammunition Plant in Independence, MO. \nA full-scale demonstration biofilter is being installed that will \nreduce air emissions my more than 80 percent. This will allow the plant \nto double production and continue to emit less than its current air \nquality control requirements.\n  The second example is a manufactured wastewater treatment project at \nthe Radford Army Ammunitions Plant in Radford, VA. This is a full-scale \ndemonstration of granular activated carbon-fluidized scale \ndemonstration of granular activated carbon-fluidized bed technology for \ntreating DNT by-products in wastewater. This type of wastewater has \nproven resistant to any other type of treatment technology available \ntoday.\n  I hope the committee will continue to support the development of \ncost-effective technologies, such as these, for treating DOD wastes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The technologies the Senator has mentioned sound \npromising. I commend DOD and USACERL for their work in this area and \nencourage the Department to continue such innovative work.\n                     hispanic serving institutions\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to commend the Chairman for the \nleadership he has displayed in bringing the fiscal year 1996 Department \nof Defense Appropriations bill to the floor. I particularly want to \nbring attention to the historically black colleges and universities and \nminority institutions program element.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would say to my friend from New Mexico that I am \nfamiliar with the HBCU/MI program and the important contribution that \nthese schools make to the research efforts and capabilities of the \nDepartment of Defense. The bill before us includes $14,800,000 to \ncontinue these activities in fiscal year 1996.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chairman. I addition to the language \nalready included by the Committee, I would like to ask that your \ncommittee, during conference, include report language recognizing \nhispanic serving institutions ability to make relevant contributions to \nDepartment of Defense missions. There are several hispanic academic \ncenters for research and education that have developed exemplary \nprograms related to science and technology.\n  With the hispanic population being the fastest growing minority \npopulation in the country, persons from this community undoubtedly will \nbe called upon to provide the leadership and expertise needed for the \nnext century. More importantly, hispanic serving institutions that are \nleading our nation's efforts to educate and train persons from this \npopulation can provide invaluable assistance and opportunities for \nadvanced collaborations to meet these challenges. With this in mind, we \nneed to send a strong signal to the Department to take advantage of the \nhuman and academic resources available at these institutions, and to \nprovide resources needed for enhanced collaborations related to \nnational security interests.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I know of the efforts underway at many of the hispanic \nserving institutions and agree with you in acknowledging the critical \nrole they can play in helping the Department of Defense address \nemerging national security interests. I would ask that you share the \nrecommended report language with me or my committee staff, and I will \nwork to address this matter during the conference on this bill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n                 the casting emission reduction program\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to engage the Senator from \nAlaska in a colloquy.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am happy to engage in a colloquy with the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. As the Senator knows, the Casting Emission Reduction \nProgram is a vital part of the dual-use-reuse process at McClellan Air \nForce Base. The CERP Program uses a new casting process developed to \nmeet Clean Air Act requirements; $12 million is needed to fund the 3d \nyear of this 5-year program. Would the Senator agree that the Defense \nDepartment should consider the importance of this program when making \nfunding decisions regarding this program?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would agree with the Senator and note that she makes a \nvery strong case for funding of the CERP Program. I do understand the \nimportance of funding the program and am happy to recognize the \nSenator's interest in CERP.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the distinguished Senator from Alaska.\n         funding impact aid in the defense appropriations bill\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Jeffords amendment No. 2393 would \nfund $400 million of the Impact Aid Program from the Defense \nappropriations bill. It would breach the firewalls between defense and \nnondefense.\n  I do not rise in opposition to the Impact Aid Program. It is an \nimportant program and Congress should provide sufficient funding to \nmeet the Federal Government's responsibilities in this area.\n  Since impact aid is classified as nondefense discretionary spending, \nthis amendment would be scored as affecting nondefense discretionary \nbudget authority and outlays and would be subject to a budget point of \norder because it would cause this subcommittee to exceed its budget \nallocation for nondefense spending.\n  The Impact Aid Program has been classified as a nondefense \nexpenditure since 1990. The conference report on the 1990 Budget \nEnforcement Act clearly lists this program in the nondefense category \nin the jurisdiction of the Labor, HHS Subcommittee.\n  The 1996 budget resolution's caps on defense and nondefense spending \nwere based on the 1990 classification. The budget resolution assumed \nfunding for the Impact Aid Program as a nondefense program.\n  If scored as defense funding, the effect of this amendment will be to \npenalize the Defense subcommittee for $400 million and to free up $400 \nmillion in spending for the Labor, HHS Subcommittee.\n  I fear that scoring this amendment as defense spending would make the \nfirewalls between defense and nondefense spending meaningless. The \ndefense budget would be eroded by efforts to fund popular nondefense \nitems. \n\n[[Page S 12197]]\n\n  Maybe impact aid was improperly classified. If this is the case, and \nI am not suggesting it is, then we should consider reclassifying this \nprogram to the defense category.\n  If we reclassify impact aid, however, we need to make sure the caps \nare held harmless. Such a reclassification would involve shifting $400 \nmillion associated with a portion of the impact aid account to the \ndefense category. Next, we would increase the defense cap by $400 \nmillion and reduce the nondefense category by the same amount.\n  Absent such a reclassification, funding for impact aid will be scored \nas nondefense expenditure regardless of which bill funds the program.\n                  Marine Corps MPS Enhancement Program\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I wonder if I might engage the \ndistinguished chairman and ranking member of the Defense Subcommittee \nin a brief colloquy.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Certainly, the Senator from New Hampshire may proceed.\n  Mr. SMITH. First of all I want to commend the Senators from Alaska \nand Hawaii for their fine work in formulating this appropriations bill. \nI know that the subcommittee was confronted by some significant fiscal \nchallenges, and I appreciate their outstanding work in balancing \nresources with our military requirements.\n  One issue that I am concerned with, however, is the Marine Corps \nmaritime preposition ship [MPS] enhancement program. As my colleagues \nknow, the MPS enhancement program would add an additional ship to each \nof three Marine Corps preposition squadrons. These ships would be \nloaded with an expeditionary airfield, two M1A1 tank companies, a fleet \nhospital, Navy mobile construction equipment, a command element \npackage, and additional statement. These assets will provide tremendous \nflexibility for crisis response and contingency operations.\n  Last year, under the leadership of the Senators from Alaska and \nHawaii, the committee appropriated $110 million for the first ship in \nthe MPS enhancement program. This was an important statement of support \nfor the preposition concept in general, and the Marine Corps program in \nparticular. The Armed Services Committee has sustained the momentum on \nthe MPS Enhancement program by authorizing $110 million in fiscal year \n1996 for the second ship in the program.\n  In reviewing the legislation before us, I am unclear as to what the \nrecommendation of the committee was with respect to the second MPS \nenhancement ship. I wonder if the Senators from Alaska and Hawaii could \ncomment on this issue.\n  Mr. Stevens. The Senator from New Hampshire is correct in his review \nof the legislative record on this issue. The Appropriations Committee \ndid fund the first ship last year, and is supportive of the Marine \nCorps MPS enhancement program. At the time the committee marked up its \nlegislation for fiscal year 1996, it was unclear whether the Navy was \nmoving forward with the program established in the fiscal year 1995 \nauthorization and appropriations bills. The committee was concerned \nover the lack of noticeable progress in acquiring and converting the \nfirst ship under the program. The committee was also confronted by some \nsignificant funding shortfalls in the shipbuilding and conversion \naccounts.\n  However, the committee did direct that the Secretary of the Navy may \nobligate appropriations up to $110 million for the procurement of a \nsecond MPS ship in fiscal year 1996.\n  Mr. Inouye. Let me assure the Senator from New Hampshire that the \ncommittee did carefully consider this matter. It is the view of Senator \nStevens and myself that the language in our legislation provides \nauthority to move forward with the second ship in the MPS enhancement \nprogram. I expect this issue will be further explored during \nconference, as well.\n  Mr. Smith. I thank the distinguished chairman and ranking member for \ntheir comments. I gather from their statements that the Appropriations \nCommittee continues to support the Marine Corps maritime preposition \nship enhancement program, but is concerned over delays by the Navy in \nmoving forward to implement the program established last year in the \nauthorization and appropriations bills. Is it fair to say that if the \nNavy can convince the committee that their program is sound, and that \nthey can demonstrate that they are fully exploring means to reduce \noverall program costs, such as multiple ship contracts, that the \ncommittee would be inclined to support a second ship in fiscal year \n1996?\n  Mr. Stevens. I think that is an accurate description.\n  Mr. Inouye. Yes. That is correct.\n  Mr. Smith. I thank my colleagues for their comments, and fine work on \nthis bill. I look forward to working with them on this important \nprogram.\nrevise the availability of funds for defense conversion loan guarantees\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, my amendment would make statutory \nchanges to the Defense Conversion Loan Guarantee Program authorized \nlast year. These revisions are necessary to optimize the program's task \nof providing financial and technical assistance to small, defense-\ndependent firms adversely impacted by defense downsizing.\n  The Defense Conversion Loan Guarantee Program is a joint Small \nBusiness Administration/Department of Defense program which provides \nloan guarantees and technical assistance to small firms adversely \naffected by defense reductions. This program would provide SBA \nguaranteed businesses and communities adversely affected by defense \ndownsizing and base closures.\n  In order to fully maximize this important program, there are three \nareas in the existing law which need to be modified:\n  First, the portion of DOD funds used for salaries and expenses;\n  Second, the current restrictive eligibility requirements which limit \nthe number of participants in the program; and\n  Third, the duration of the program.\n  My amendment would implement these statutory changes without \nrequiring any new appropriation of funds.\n  In the wake of extensive U.S. Defense downsizing and military base \nclosures, this program is both necessary and vital to helping small \nbusinesses retain the jobs of Defense workers and create new employment \nopportunities in communities affected by economic dislocation. I am \npleased to offer this amendment and thank my colleagues for their \nsupport.\n     the defense department's financial management training program\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I want to take this opportunity to commend the chairman \nand ranking member of the Subcommittee on Defense for their support for \nthe Defense Department's Financial Management Training and Education \nProgram.\n  This program, strongly supported by the Department of Defense, will \nestablish urgently needed programs to give the Department's financial \nmanagers and accountants the necessary training that their private \nsector counterparts take for granted. This program will provide the \neducational resources to make these workers more effective and \nefficient and thereby help the Defense Department save millions of \ntaxpayers' dollars.\n  In its report, the committee provides for full funding of the \ntraining program operations in fiscal year 1996. It also states that \nthe committee expects the Defense Department to accommodate any long-\nterm leasing costs for the planned facility within the amounts \nappropriated in the account for operations and maintenance, \ndefensewide.\n  I believe that the Department will accommodate these costs in the \nmanner suggested. I would like, therefore, to clarify the view of the \nAppropriations Committee. Is it the understanding of the committee that \nonce the Department meets the reporting requirements contained in the \nDefense authorization bill for fiscal year 1996 on the necessity for \nestablishing a center for financial management training and education, \nthe Department will be free to enter into a capital lease for the \nestablishment of the center without seeking further appropriation of \nfunds or reprogramming authority?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes, that is my understanding. The committee \nacknowledges the justification for the training and education program, \nto ensure that the Defense Department's financial managers receive the \nnecessary professional training. As stated in its report, the committee \nintends the Department have the authority to enter into a capital lease \nfor the center for financial management, education, and training, using \nfunds appropriated in the operations and maintenance account.\n\n[[Page S 12198]]\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. I concur with my colleague, the chairman of the Defense \nSubcommittee. The Defense Department has the authority to proceed with \nthis worthwhile project, once the requirements contained in the fiscal \nyear 1996 Defense Authorization Act are met.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senators for their comments.\n                        Surplus DOD Helicopters\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this amendment will set aside $5 \nmillion for the conversion of surplus Defense Department helicopters \nfor counter-drug activities. This funding is needed to upgrade these \nhelicopters with new radio and avionics equipment, search lights, \nupgraded landing gear and other improvements.\n  There is currently a program at DOD that provides surplus military \nequipment to local law enforcement agencies for counter-drug purposes. \nHowever, no funding is currently available to convert the military \nequipment for use by local law enforcement. Localities simply do not \nhave the funds necessary to implement this important program.\n  This funding is critical to allow local law enforcement agencies to \nrespond to increased drug trafficking. For example, in Sacramento, \nthere have been several large arrests made of drug transporting \nthousands of pounds of marijuana and heroin. The city plans to use the \nsurplus helicopters for interdiction of traffickers through their area.\n  This $5 million appropriation will make a huge difference in the \nability of localities to utilize these surplus helicopters. I thank my \ncolleagues for their support in adopting this very important amendment.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, before we conclude consideration of the \nFiscal Year 1996 Defense Appropriations Bill, I want to commend \nChairman Stevens and Senator Inouye for all of their work in preparing \nthis bill. This is perhaps one of the most important appropriations \nbills we pass each year. With the largest share of defense spending, \nthis bill funds such critical accounts as operation & maintenance, \nprocurement, research & development, and military pay and personnel. \nMr. President, I am pleased to support this bill.\n  This year, again, the President submitted to Congress a defense \nbudget which was woefully inadequate. As I am sure most of my \ncolleagues know, long-term readiness is funded through the Procurement \nand R accounts, but under the President's budget, the procurement \naccounts were down 67.4 percent from their fiscal year 1985 peak. \nAdditionally, the Research, Development Test & Evaluation accounts had \nfallen every year since hitting an FY 1988 high. Under the President's \nbudget, these accounts would continue to plummet for the next 5 years. \nFor all the administration's rhetoric, procurement spending and \nprocurement rates are at their lowest levels in 45 years. Despite the \nadministration's promises to enhance force capabilities, modernization \nhas come to a virtual standstill. The bottom line is that under the \nClinton administration, our forces have simply become smaller, but not \nmore capable.\n  However, the Republican controlled Congress has kept faith with our \npromise to the American people to restore our national security. We \nrefuse to continue down the path which would lead us back to a hollow \nmilitary. We have added $7 billion in overall defense spending, turning \nthe corner on defense spending. The Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee, under the direction of Senator Stevens has worked to \nensure that these additional funds were allocated to ensure not only \nour near-term readiness, but also to ensure that our forces were \nprepared to prevail in any future battle. This bill not only increases \nfunding for accounts such as operation and maintenance but also for the \nProcurement and Research & Development accounts.\n  Let me be clear. This year's increase does not fix all of the \nDepartment's funding problems. In fact, the burden for ensuring the \nreadiness of our military again shifts back to the administration and \nthe Department of Defense. In preparing next year's defense budget, the \nadministration should follow the lead of this Congress.\n  In closing, I again thank the chairman and ranking member for their \nhard work in shaping this defense bill and I am pleased to support it.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I know that the Senator from Nebraska is \nhere to speak, and I am sorry to delay him.\n  I want the clerk to clear with me, and see if the desk is in \nagreement with me, that we now have pending before the Senate under the \nprocedure adopted for amendments filed by 8:30. I have the Bumpers \namendment No. 2398, Harkin amendment No. 2400, and the Kerry motion to \nrecommit; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. But there are \nadditional amendments beyond those.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask the clerk provide us with a copy of those \namendments.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am in error. I forgot to list the Hutchison amendment \nNo. 2396. I know that is pending.\n\n\n                      amendment no. 2399 withdrawn\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Amendment No. 2399 is a duplicative amendment, Mr. \nPresident. That was already considered in another form as an amendment \nsubmitted by Mr. Harkin.\n  I withdraw this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  The amendment is withdrawn.\n  So the amendment (No. 2399) was withdrawn.\n\n\n                amendments nos. 2422 and 2423 withdrawn\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I withdraw amendments Nos. 2422 and 2423, \nwhich were proposed by me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendments are withdrawn.\n  So the amendments (Nos. 2422 and 2423) were withdrawn.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2408\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2408 for Mr. \nPryor.\n  This is an amendment offered by Senator Pryor dealing with certain \ncertification requirements and approval beyond low-rate initial \nproduction for the theater missile defense interceptors.\n  We have discussed this matter with the Senator from Arkansas and are \nprepared to accept it. It may have to be modified in conference, but we \nwish to accept it in its present form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  So the amendment (No. 2408) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, if I might have the attention of the \nmanagers of the bill, I must make a statement that I had not intended \nto make, but because of a very recent development I have a \nresponsibility to advise the Senate that I have just been advised that \nthe junior Senator from the State of Texas has filed an amendment to \nthe Defense appropriations bill before the Senate that would duplicate \nthe provisions in the Defense authorization bill allocating up to $50 \nmillion for hydronuclear testing.\n  It has not been generally known, I guess, but it should be \nestablished now that this Senator has been the principle proponent of a \nmove to block passage of the Defense authorization bill until after the \nrecess, primarily because the authorization for such tests that are \nalso in the authorization bill on which we had a debate last week was a \nvery close vote.\n  I had agreed after many people on this side of the aisle in talking \nto me, I had agreed not to press this issue and thereby to not delay \npassage of the Defense appropriations bill that is now before the \nSenate and is generally thought to be ready for passage sometime \ntomorrow.\n  If the Senator from Texas persists with her amendment in that regard, \nI withdraw my understanding not to interrupt passage of the \nappropriations bill.\n  Mr. President, earlier in the day I had written some thoughts that I \nam going to deliver now that were aimed primarily at the Defense \nauthorization bill, but much of my objection to the Defense \nauthorization bill is also incorporated in the appropriations bill that \nI had not intended, until the action by the Senator from Texas, to \nbring up until some other time.\n  To fully explain this to the Senate, and I have been under a lot of \npressure from those on this side to not take the stand that I must take \nbecause I think a very important principle is involved, \n\n[[Page S 12199]]\nand I might say that there are many Senators on this side of the aisle \nand some, including the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, who \nagreed with me.\n  Mr. President, I am advising the Senate that I will do everything \nreasonably within my power to block passage of the Department of \nDefense authorization bill that is still before the Senate and under \nthe new action by the Senator from Texas that has now expanded to \ninclude the Defense appropriations bill, as well.\n  This is, indeed, a sharp departure from the norm by this Senator. For \nthe first time in my 17 years here, I am diametrically opposed to the \npackage of a Department of Defense authorization bill and the \nappropriations bill, as well.\n  There is still time to make some significant changes necessary that \nmay allow for passage of the appropriations bill, but time is wasting. \nMy remarks apply to both the defense authorization and the \nappropriations bills.\n  There are many specific provisions in the Defense authorization bill \nand the appropriations bill that are, in my opinion, absurd and fraught \nwith deficiencies with regard to the legitimate national security \ninterests of the United States of America.\n  Equally appalling are the parts of this bill that clearly rebuke our \nNation's stated policies, our treaty obligations, and our \nresponsibilities as a leader of the free world. In many respects this \nbill is an abomination from the standpoint of our Nation's thoughtful \npolicies concerning the security of mankind tomorrow and well into the \nnext century.\n  If ever there was a clear example of the United States sticking its \nhead in the sand to escape reality in the most thoughtless manner, this \nis it.\n  Obviously, Defense policy and foreign affairs go hand and hand. The \nnet result of the Defense authorization and to a considerable extent, \nthe appropriations bill, as presently written, is that we are simply \nthrowing up our hands in applause of short-sighted isolationism.\n  For the purpose of this discussion, allow me to concentrate on only \ntwo of the most glaring potential disasters in the legislation as it \nhas come out of committee, each of which has been affirmed by \nrelatively close votes on the floor of the Senate last week.\n  They both have to do with nuclear weapons initiative. They both \ndramatically reverse existing national policies. I speak of the \nprovisions in the Defense authorization bill concerning the violation \nof the antiballistic missile ABM Treaty and the related matter that the \nUnited States resume nuclear weapons testing which would likely end any \nchance of successfully concluding a comprehensive test ban treaty \nagreement.\n  Mr. President, this Senator has been pressing the administration for \na firm statement on this policy. This is necessary more than ever \nbecause of the recent announcements by the French that they are \ncontinuing nuclear testing again, and now that is causing great \npolitical unrest against the Government in France because of that \naction as has been quite prominently displayed in the press.\n  Likewise, the Chinese are doing additional nuclear testing. If the \nUnited States of America begins any kind of nuclear testing, and I \nemphasize any kind, it is going to eliminate any chance that we could \nhave a real comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty.\n  The unilateral break out of the ABM Treaty was thoroughly debated on \nthe floor last week and the Senate's final disposition of the issue \nremains unresolved. There can be no question that the President will \nveto this bill as it is written. There has been some progress towards \ncorrecting some of the most onerous provisions with regard to the \nballistic missile treaty.\n  I am studying those at the present time, but I wish to focus tonight \non a controversy that is in the long run maybe even more damaging to \nworld peace. That is the resumption of nuclear testing and its affect \non the comprehensive test ban negotiations.\n  While both arms control matters are extremely important, the ABM \nTreaty issue involves only two countries: The United States and Russia.\n  On the other hand, the comprehensive test ban treaty involves almost \nevery country in the world, regardless of their size or nuclear \ncapability today and in the future.\n  I have reason to believe that in the very immediate future the \nClinton administration is going to take a very strong stand on this \nmatter that will clearly indicate that the Senate did the right thing 3 \nyears ago, when the Hatfield-Exon-Mitchell amendment was agreed to. And \nthe Senate did the wrong thing when it reported out of the Armed \nServices Committee the beginning of tests all over again.\n  In Friday's debate on the nuclear testing issue, there were gross \nmisstatements about the Exon-Hatfield et al amendment to delete the $50 \nmillion funding authorization to resume testing reported out by the \nArmed Services Committee. This proposal would violate the carefully \ncrafted Hatfield-Exon-Mitchell nuclear testing law of 3 years ago.\n  The gross distortion of facts I refer to, possibly unwittingly but \nnevertheless untrue, contributed to the narrow vote overturning our \nNation's nuclear testing policy. I refer primarily to the series of \nfalse statements made by the opposition to our amendment on the recent \nreport of the Jasons group. The Jasons group is a collection of the \nmost renowned and best informed scientists from our three national \nlaboratories, including noted physicist Sidney Drell, regarding the \nresumption of so-called small nuclear tests at our Nevada test site.\n  While I inserted the complete text of the JASON report--the executive \nsummary of the JASON report into the Congressional Record on Friday, I \nask unanimous consent that the Washington Post article be printed in \nthe Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. EXON. Whether intentional or not, what the opponents of our \namendment did was distort, for their own purpose, the latest report \nfrom the JASON group. I quote briefly from the article from the \nWashington Post that I just referenced. The story opens with this \nstatement:\n\n       A group of eminent U.S. physicists and nuclear weapons \n     designers has concluded that the military has neither ``a \n     present nor anticipated'' need for small nuclear weapons \n     tests that a Senate majority voted last week to spend $50 \n     million to prepare for.\n\n  Mr. President, it goes on in the next paragraph:\n\n       The scientific group concluded after a six-week study for \n     the Department of Energy that conducting the small explosives \n     would not add measurably to the safety and reliability of the \n     U.S. nuclear arsenal, which the scientists said has been \n     solidly established by more than 1,000 nuclear explosions.\n\n  Then, Mr. President, I go to the last paragraph of the story which \nsums it up.\n\n       This summary [that I have been referencing] stated that the \n     group's detailed findings ``are consistent with [a] U.S. \n     agreement to enter into a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty of \n     unending duration'' provided that the treaty allows the \n     country to withdraw if warranted by ``supreme national \n     interests.''\n       I believe that this study represents the views of a very \n     diverse and experienced scientific community,\n\n  said Drell, the Panel's chairman.\n  Now, Mr. President, I hope and I expect that the Members of the \nUnited States Senate will study very carefully this whole issue, before \nwe rush ahead. That is why I strenuously object to the inclusion of \nthis matter in the appropriations bill, where it was left out during \nthe considerations of that committee.\n  So I repeat, whether intentional or not, these false statements that \nthe opponents used against our amendment distorted for their own \npurposes the latest report of the JASON group, by confusing the \njustification for nonnuclear ``hydro-dynamic'' testing with that of \nlow-yield nuclear detonations associated with ``hydro-nuclear tests,'' \nwhich is what is authorized in the defense authorization bill.\n  By generally falsifying the report's conclusions and selectively \nlifting statements, the opponents of the Exon-Hatfield amendment were \nable to buttress their ill-advised and false arguments.\n  Mr. President, I hope this statement and the following report from \nthe Washington Post and other events that are likely to occur in the \nimmediate future will make it clear to all Senators who may have been \nunfortunately misled by the debate on the \n\n[[Page S 12200]]\nExon-Hatfield amendment by the opponents that what the true findings of \nthe JASON report are might study it, might change their minds.\n  I hope certain Members will reconsider their positions in light of \nthis clarification and vote to overturn the committee provisions at \nsome time in the future.\n  To protect that possibility I must reemphasize once again that I will \ndo everything reasonably within my power to make certain that that is \nnot authorized, the $50 million is not authorized as the JASON \ncommittee and others say it is not necessary. It is a waste of money.\n  So I thought I had the obligation tonight, since I just found out \nabout this, to advise the Senate and especially the two leaders of the \nAppropriations Committee, whom I have great respect for, because I did \nnot want to blindside them.\n  I yield the floor.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Aug. 9, 1995]\n\n  Physicists Say Small Nuclear Tests Backed by Senate Are Unnecessary\n\n                         (By R. Jeffrey Smith)\n\n       A group of eminent U.S. physicists and nuclear weapons \n     designers has concluded that the military has neither a \n     ``present nor anticipated'' need for the small nuclear \n     weapons tests that a Senate majority voted last week to spend \n     $50 million to prepare for.\n       The scientific group concluded after a six-week study for \n     the Department of Energy that conducting the small explosions \n     would not add measurably to the safety and reliability of the \n     U.S. nuclear arsenal, which the scientists said has been \n     solidly established by more than 1,000 test nuclear \n     explosions.\n       ``The United States can, today, have high confidence in the \n     safety, reliability, and performance margins of the nuclear \n     weapons that are designated to remain in the enduring \n     stockpile,'' said a summary of the group's report. It was \n     signed by several of the country's veteran bomb designers \n     under the auspices of JASONS, a group of academic scientists \n     who consult for the government on national problems.\n       The report, which has been presented to Secretary of \n     Defense William J. Perry, Secretary of Energy Hazel R. \n     O'Leary and other top administration officials, was issued \n     during a growing debate in Congress and within the \n     administration over the merits of additional nuclear testing.\n       The Clinton administration has been unable for months to \n     decide whether to propose additional nuclear tests, due to \n     disagreement between testing proponents at the Pentagon and \n     opponents at the Energy Department, Arms Control and \n     Disarmament Agency, and the office of the White House science \n     adviser.\n       On Friday, the Senate voted 56 to 44 to keep $50 million to \n     prepare for so-called hydronuclear tests, even though the \n     administration has said it does not plan to conduct any \n     during 1996.\n       Proponents of additional nuclear testing, largely from the \n     Republican majority, have argued that more explosions are \n     needed to ensure that weapons remain safe and reliable. The \n     administration, in negotiations being conducted in Geneva on \n     a global accord barring all nuclear testing, has similarly \n     insisted on the right to continue setting off extremely \n     small-scale nuclear explosions for the purpose of maintaining \n     the U.S. arsenal.\n       The group's report was endorsed by four of the principal \n     designers of the U.S. nuclear arsenal: John Kammerdiener and \n     John Richter of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New \n     Mexico, Robert Peurifoy of the Sandia National Laboratories \n     in New Mexico, and Seymour Sack of the Livermore National \n     Laboratory in California.\n       The 14-member group also included noted Princeton physicist \n     Freeman Dyson, IBM scientist Richard Garwin, University of \n     California physicist Marshal Rosenbluth and Stanford \n     physicist Sidney Drell, each of whom has worked on aspects of \n     U.S. nuclear weaponry for more than three decades.\n       Besides challenging the merits of the hydronuclear tests, \n     which would have an explosive yield equivalent to about 4 \n     pounds of TNT, the report also challenges the prevailing \n     Pentagon view that conducting larger nuclear explosions is \n     also essential to ensuring that U.S. nuclear weapons will \n     continue to operate.\n       It states that while such tests would doubtless provide \n     interesting data, the country should pursue other, better \n     routes to maintaining the nuclear arsenal, such as supporting \n     an extensive program of weapons surveillance and a \n     ``significant industrial infrastructure'' to maintain aging \n     weapons components.\n       The summary stated that the group's detailed findings ``are \n     consistent with [a] U.S. agreement to enter into a \n     Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) of unending duration'' \n     provided that the treaty allows the country to withdraw if \n     warranted by ``supreme national interest.''\n       ``I believe that this study represents the views of a very \n     diverse and experienced scientific community,'' said Drell, \n     the panel's chairman.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. We are awaiting temporarily for what we would call the \nwrap-up.\n  So I ask, as in morning business, Mr. President, to make this \nstatement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/10/senate-section/article/S12166-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  (During today's session of the Senate, the following morning business \nwas transacted.)\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/10/senate-section/article/S12200-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      COMMUNITY INVESTMENT PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, while efforts to address the needs of our \nless-developed communities have often come up short, innovation from \nthe private sector has been instrumental in locating problems and \nproviding successful solutions. Past experience shows that successful \ncommunity development can only be achieved through an equal partnership \nbetween the public and private sector.\n  Each year, on behalf of the Federal Housing Finance Board [FHFB] and \nFederal Home Loan Bank System [FHLBS], 12 financial institutions from \naround the country are recognized for exemplary efforts in the \nrevitalization of America's communities. I am pleased to announce that \nthree financial institutions in Montana that are part of Glacier \nBancorp, Inc. have been chosen by the Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle \nto receive the Community Partnership Award for 1995. They include \nGlacier Bank, F.S.B. of Kalispell, the First National Bank of \nWhitefish, and the First National Bank of Eureka.\n  Glacier Bank and its two affiliates were recognized for developing \ninnovative ways of using the Affordable Housing Program [AHP] and the \nCommunity Investment Program [CIP] funds to create homeownership \nopportunities for low- and moderate-income families, and for working \nwith numerous nonprofit partners and local governments to help meet \ncommunity needs.\n  These institutions hold $84 million in regular advances and have used \nFederal Home Loan Bank funding programs to assemble a full range of \nsingle and multifamily loan products, many of which would not have been \npossible without FHLB funding. In addition, they also used advances to \nmatch fund their FHA/VA loans and developed a portfolio loan product \ncalled BOB that is also funded with advances.\n  While using the Affordable Housing Program, Glacier Bancorp, Inc., \nand its institutions have sponsored three successful AHP projects \nreceiving $301,000 in targeted grants. Glacier Bank and the city of \nKalispell are responsible for devising an innovative financing package \nto preserve an apartment complex in downtown Kalispell for very low-\nincome and homeless individuals. Under the same program, Glacier Bank \nwas awarded AHP funds for a homeownership project to help low- and \nmoderate-income households purchase homes in distressed neighborhoods. \nWithout Glacier's commitment to relax their underwriting standards for \nthese homes, the project would not have been possible. These projects \nwill create affordable housing for 64 households.\n  Under the Community Investment Program, the institutions have used \n$17 million in CIP funds for homeowner programs benefiting 3000 \nhouseholds.\n  These examples of civic responsibility and the spirit of community \nare only a few of Glacier Bancorp, Inc. efforts to create affordable \nhousing for less developed communities. This institutions' achievements \nshould serve as a reminder of what is possible when the private sector \nacts locally in an innovative alliance with the Government.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/10/senate-section/article/S12200-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12200-S12201]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          INCOME TAX TREATIES\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I rise to share my thoughts about \nseveral income tax treaties now pending before the Senate. I'm very \nmust opposed to the income tax treaties that are now awaiting action in \nthe Senate. But my opposition stems more from the Treasury Department's \nstated interpretation of the pending treaties than the actual language \nin the treaties themselves.\n  Treasury Department officials interpret one article in each of these \ntreaties as preventing the United States from scrapping its outdated \narm's length enforcement approach on corporate income tax and replacing \nit \n\n[[Page S 12201]]\nwith the simple and time-proven formula method, which is now the norm \nbetween the States. In my judgment, this interpretation by the Treasury \nDepartment is wrong-headed and is ill-advised.\n  I believe that the Federal Government is losing billions of dollars \nin revenues because the IRS uses the so-called arm's-length method to \nenforce our corporate tax laws. In my judgment, this IRS enforcement \ntool is unworkable and results in massive tax avoidance by \ninternational firms operating here. It keeps our tax officials in the \nDark Ages as they work to ensure that multinational firms doing \nbusiness here pay their fair share of U.S. taxes.\n  There is evidence to suggest a massive hemorrhaging of tax revenues \nbecause of transfer pricing abuses and because of the flawed arm's-\nlength pricing method employed by the IRS. The General Accounting \nOffice [GAO] has reported that more than 73 percent of the foreign \nfirms doing business in this country pay no U.S. taxes, despite \ngenerating hundreds of billions of dollars in revenues every year.\n  There are also several independent studies of the problem that \nestimate U.S. revenue losses ranging from $2 billion to $40 billion a \nyear. I happen to think that this country is losing between $10 and $15 \nbillion in revenues from foreign-based firms alone. But I recognize \nthat there hasn't been a comprehensive and official government study \nthat attempts to pinpoint the true size of the U.S. tax gap caused by \ntransfer pricing abuses and to map out the best approach to plug the \ngap.\n  I have in recent days been working with Treasury officials on this \nmatter. In response to my request, Treasury Department has now agreed \nto formally conduct a joint conference and study with the State \ngovernments to evaluate the U.S. tax revenues lost due to transfer \npricing abuses, especially from foreign firms doing business in the \nUnited States. In addition, this initiative will examine the issue of \nimplementing a Federal formulary apportionment system to enforce our \ninternational tax laws.\n  This joint Treasury/State initiative will, I hope, finally answer the \nquestions of how much money we are now losing from transfer pricing \nabuses, and how we can take steps to prevent it.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/10/senate-section/article/S12200-3", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12201]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  COSPONSORSHIP OF S. 1120, AS AMENDED\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask that my name be added as a \ncosponsor to S. 1120, the Work Opportunity Act of 1995. I want to \ncongratulate the distinguished Republican leader and his chief of staff \nfor all the hard work and effort they have devoted to producing a \nwelfare reform bill this year.\n  Many years ago a distinguished professor wrote a book entitled: ``Why \nWelfare is so Hard to Reform.'' That was nearly 25 years ago. Reforming \nour welfare system has not gotten any easier over that time period as \nthe Republican leader has surely discovered.\n  Let me be clear, I know that there are issues that still have not \nbeen fully resolved in Leader Dole's bill. I continue to be concerned \nabout some of those issues and during the upcoming recess I will meet \nwith New Mexicans who have, like I, concerns about child care and other \nprovisions in the bill. I reserve the right to recommend further \nchanges to the bill and offer amendments to it when we begin \nconsideration in September.\n  But I support the major principles embodied in the leader's proposal \nand therefore am pleased to cosponsor the legislation today. I support \nfirst and foremost the principle that we must break the cycle of \ndependency in our current welfare system, and we should strive to help \nthose who are trapped in this system break the bonds of dependency.\n  I support the principle that States should be provided flexibility in \ndesigning programs that best serve needy individuals and families in \ntheir individual States.\n  I support the principle that those who receive assistance should seek \nwork and that employment of welfare recipients should increase \nsignificantly from the low levels that now exist in many States. I \nsupport the principle that States should be allowed to terminate \nbenefits when those who are required to work--refuse work.\n  I support the principle that single parents with young children \nshould not be penalized if they are unable to find work and \nparticularly if affordable child care services are not available to \nthem. I support the principle that individuals seeking to better their \nlives through vocational education and training should be encouraged in \ntheir vocation in order to avoid dependency later in their lives.\n  I support the principle that the Federal Food Stamp Program and \nSchool Lunch Program should continue as Federal entitlement programs so \nas to provide a basic nutrition safety net to all low-income families \nand their children.\n  Finally, I believe that we can reform our welfare system based on \nthese principles, protect those most in need of assistance, and at the \nsame time do this while achieving some savings to hard-pressed State \nand Federal budgets. The Dole bill does all these things and at the \nsame time begins a down payment on the Federal deficit. A Federal \ndeficit that is the biggest sign of dependency and the biggest threat \nto the creation of jobs for all Americans--particularly the poor. We \nwill not turn our backs on those down on their luck, but we will not \ngive a handout when what is needed is a hand-up.\n  Welfare reform is a contentious issue. What we do here needs to be \ndone carefully, and that is why I have made recommendations to the \nleader and others to modify S. 1120 in ways that I think will improve \nit. I may have other recommendations once I meet with people in my \nState. But for today I congratulate the Republican leader and offer my \nsupport to reform the welfare system based on the broad principles \nencompassed in the Work Opportunity Act of 1995.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/10/senate-section/article/S12201-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12201-S12207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n        SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, in June, we passed S. 240, the Private \nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 by a 69-to-30 margin. It \nstarted out as a Domenici-Dodd bill with 51 cosponsors and then \nChairman D'Amato and the Banking Committee worked hard to improve it. \nIt is a bill supported by Senators with vastly differing political \nphilosophies. Senators Kennedy, Mikulski, Harkin, Helms, Gramm, and \nLott were among the 69 Senators voting for the Senate bill.\n  Mr. President, I am going to spend time discussing some of the \nmisstatements about this bill, but first I want to tell you that 69 \nSenators voted for this bill because it is good for our economy and job \ncreation, for our capital markets and all investors.\n  Mr. President, S. 240 creates a better system for investors 12 ways:\n  First, S. 240 requires that investors be notified when a lawsuit has \nbeen filed so that all investors can decide if they really want to \nbring a lawsuit. Frivolous shareholder suits hurt companies by \ndiverting resources from productive purposes, and thus, harm \nshareholders. The shareholder-owners of the company, not some \nentrepreneurial lawyer, should decide if a lawsuit is necessary. Most \ninvestors know that stock volatility is not stock fraud, yet a stock \nprice fluctuation is all that lawyers need to file a case.\n  Second, the bill puts lawyers and clients on the same side. By \nchanging the economic incentives behind bringing and settling these \nsuits, investors will benefit.\n  Third, it reforms an oppressive liability so that companies can \nattract capable board members, and hire the best accountants, \nunderwriters, and other professionals. The two-tier liability system \ncontained in the bill is perhaps the most misunderstood provision of \nthe bill. I will go through the details later in my speech.\n  Fourth, the bill prohibits special $15,000 to $20,000 bonus payments \nto named plaintiffs. These side-agreements between lawyers and their \nprofessional plaintiffs are unfair to shareholders not afforded the \nopportunity to act as the pet plaintiff. By prohibiting bonus payments, \nthe bill will put more money in the pockets of all aggrieved investors. \nIt stops brokers from selling investors' names to plaintiffs' lawyers. \nThis practice is at least unethical, and should not be part of our \njudicial system.\n\n[[Page S 12202]]\n\n  Fifth, S. 240 contains several provisions which will put the \ninvestors with a real financial stake in the company, and not the \nlawyers, in control of these cases in an effort to restore the \ntraditional lawyer-client relationship that currently does not exist in \nsecurities class actions.\n  Under the current system lawyers hire individual professional \nplaintiffs who own a few shares of stock to act as the lead plaintiff \nin these cases. These individuals own a few shares in every company \npublicly traded on the various stock exchanges so they can always be a \nplaintiff. These individuals sell their names of the class action \nlawyer in exchange for a $15,000 or $20,000 bonus payment. These pet \nplaintiffs then allow the attorneys to exercise complete control over \nthe litigation. Because there is no real plaintiff-client to exercise \ncontrol over the lawyer, settlements in these cases are often\n extremely generous to the lawyers. According to SEC Chairman Levitt, \nthe current system is characterized as one where ``class counsel may \nhave incentives that differ from those of the underlying class \nmembers.'' According to Chairman Levitt, this means that class action \nlawyers ``may have a greater incentive than the members of the class to \naccept a settlement that provides a significant fee and eliminates any \nrisk of failure to recoup funds already invested in the case.'' \nChairman Levitt is absolutely correct, and S. 240 will realign the \ninterests of the lawyers with those of their clients, the class of \ninvestors.\n\n  In these multimillion dollar class action cases, S. 240 requires the \ncourt to appoint a willing investor with a significant financial \ninterest in the outcome of the litigation as the lead plaintiff. The \nobjective is to have real clients with real financial interests making \nthe decisions about these cases. I view this as a little adult \nsupervision over these entrepreneurial lawyers.\n  As such, S. 240 encourages institutional investors--the people who we \ntrust to mange pension funds and mutual funds on behalf of thousands of \nretirees and small investors--to take charge of these multimillion \ndollar cases. This doesn't mean that the small investor will not be \nable to file a securities suit on their own behalf. Under S. 240, \nanyone still may file a securities class action. However, if a case is \ngoing to be a class action suit, the people we trust to manage the \npension funds will be encouraged to take a more active role in these \ncases, instead of the plaintiffs' lawyers. Why? Because they have a \nfiduciary duty--a very high level of trust--to look out for the best \ninterest of all the investors and retirees. Because they have the \ngreatest responsibility in these cases,\n institutional investors will be in a position to maximize the amount \nof money made available to compensate the group of investors. Because \nthey can negotiate fees up front, attorneys' fees will be reasonable, \nleaving more money for the people who should benefit from these cases--\nthe investors. Because they have the greatest interest in the outcome, \ninstitutional investors will closely scrutinize settlement offers and \nthey will reject the ones that benefit lawyers to the detriment of \nshareholders. This will lead to larger awards for investors when a case \nhas merits.\n\n  Sixth, the bill provides for simpler disclosure of settlement terms \nto investors, including how much investors will receive on a per share \nbasis, and how much the lawyers have requested in attorneys' fees and \ncosts. Currently settlement disclosures are shrouded in boilerplate \nlegalese, making them difficult for investors to understand.\n  Seventh, the bill prohibits settlements under seal, where attorneys \ncan keep their fees a secret. Investors should know how much they have \npaid for legal services, and should be able to challenge them if they \nare excessive.\n  Eighth, the bill also limits attorneys' fees to a reasonable \npercentage of the settlement fund as a result of the attorneys' \nefforts. Currently, courts and attorneys use a confusing formula called \nthe lodestar.\n  Ninth, S. 240 creates an environment where CEO's or chairmen of the \nboard can, and will, speak freely about their company's future without \nfear of lawsuits if their predictions do not materialize. This will put \nmore information in the hands of investors, who seek forward-looking \nprojections in order to make informed investment decisions.\n This is another provision that has been misunderstood.\n\n  Tenth, S. 240 provides a uniform rule about what constitutes a \nlegitimate lawsuit. The pleading reforms will ensure that cases filed \nin different parts of the country will be subject to the same rules. \nPredictability and uniformity are two hallmarks of an effective justice \nsystem, and the pleading reforms make the system more effective and \npredictable.\n  The bill includes litigation cost containment provisions. A typical \ntactic of plaintiff lawyers is to request an extensive list of \ndocuments and to schedule an ambitious agenda of sworn testimony-taking \nthat distracts the company CEO and other key officers and directors. \nThese discovery costs comprise 80 percent of the expense of defending a \nsecurities class action lawsuit. To minimize the in terrorem impact of \nthe frivolous cases, the bill would require the court to limit requests \nfor documents during the pendency of any motion to dismiss unless \nfactfinding is needed to preserve evidence or prevent undue prejudice. \nA stay of discovery puts such requests for documents and deposition \ntaking on hold until the judge rules on whether the case should be \nkicked out of court.\n  Eleventh, S. 240 will weed out frivolous cases while giving lawyers \nand judges more time to protect truly defrauded investors. By ending \nthe race to the courthouse, cases are often filed within hours of when \na company's stock price falls, this bill will ensure that the frivolous \ncases are dismissed quickly, giving companies more time and resources \nto focus on running the company. Investors will get higher stock prices \nand bigger dividends.\n  The bill's attorney sanctions for filing frivolous securities fraud \nsuits builds upon the existing rules of the Federal courts. Frivolous \nsecurities suits filed with little or no research into their merits can \ncost companies millions of dollars in legal fees and company time. \nAccording to a sample of cases provided by the National Association of \nSecurities and Commercial Law Attorneys [NASCAT], 21 percent of the \nclass action securities cases were filed within 48 hours of a \ntriggering event, usually the announcement of a missed earnings \nprojection.\n  Innocent companies pay millions of dollars defending these frivolous \ncases. Even when firms are exonerated they have large defense \nattorney's bills to pay. Our current system is a winner pays system.\n  Attorneys should be required to exercise due diligence before they \nfile these expensive lawsuits. They should be sanctioned if they fail \nto exercise proper care. Accordingly, the Senate bill requires the \njudge, at the end of the case, to make specific findings regarding \nwhether attorneys complied with the Court's rules, specifically, rule \n11(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 11 provides \nsanctions for filing frivolous lawsuits. The bill requires the judge to \ndiscipline lawyers if the judge finds that the lawyer violated the \nrule. Under the bill, the judge would require an offending attorney to \npay all the reasonable attorney's fees and costs of the innocent party \nas the consequence for filing a frivolous lawsuit if the case is kicked \nout of court on a motion to dismiss. This is the first step a defendant \ncould take when he things the lawsuit is frivolous. For the defendant \nto win, the judge must rule that: first, the complaint failed to\n state a claim upon which relief can be granted and second, the \ncomplaint is frivolous on its face. The judge can sanction a defense \nlawyer who files frivolous motions.\n\n  Twelfth, the bill will make the merits matter so that strong cases \nrecover more than weak cases. It will ensure that people committing \nfraud compensate victims. It will ensure greater detection of fraud by \nrequiring that professional advisors report corporate crime.\n  By constructing a system which put investors, not the lawyers, in \ncontrol of these cases and by making a greater share of the settlement \nfund available to defrauded investors, S. 240 will put an end to the \ncurrent class action system that consumer rights advocates have called \na joke and the Wall Street Journal called a Class Action Shakedown.\n  I would like to talk about some of the stories that appeared about \nthis \n\n[[Page S 12203]]\nbill and set the record straight. The press has a very important role \nin reporting. As Justice Brandeis once said:\n\n       The function of the press is very high. It is almost holy. \n     It ought to serve as a forum for the people, through which \n     the people may know freely what is going on. To misstate or \n     suppress the news is a breach of trust.\n\n  As this bill moves to conference, I hope that the press will take a \nmore careful look at this bill so that the people can know freely what \nis going on with securities litigation reform. This bill will benefit \ninvestors, and they ought to know it.\n  If some press accounts about the bill were true no Senator would have\n   cosponsored it. But 51 Senators did cosponsor S. 240, and 69 \nSenators voted for it. These numbers are evidence that some press \naccounts must have missed the point on S. 240.\n\n  In fact, during the debate on the floor my colleague, the chairman of \nthe Banking Committee Senator D'Amato noted with some consternation \nthat if we held the press to the same recklessness standard that we \nhold participants in our capital markets, then the press would not be \nable to print anything about our bill.\n  If you read some of the articles printed during the floor debate on \nS. 240, you would think that the bill completely repealed the Federal \nsecurities laws. In actuality, the bill's primary focus is changes to a \ntotally court-created type of lawsuit--the implied private right of \naction under section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act. The \ncourts created the private lawsuit under section 10(b) and yet \nrecently, every time the Supreme Court has had a section 10(b) issue \nbefore it, the Court has scaled back the amount and scope of litigation \nthat could be brought. I read the recent Supreme Court cases to be \nsaying, ``Congress, we, the Supreme Court, created this type of \nlawsuit, but after several decades of experience we don't like how our \ncourt-created law is being abused, so fix it, Congress.'' That is what \nS. 240 does. It stops some of the abuses.\n  On June 23, a Denver Post editorial said: ``Senate bill would give \nfree ride to securities fraud.'' This editorial also stated that ``If \nS. 240 goes into effect, Americans will no longer have the option of \nsuing cheats who run sophisticated investment schemes.'' S. 240 neither \nalters who can sue nor the standard of liability under the\n Federal securities laws. None of the 69 Senators who voted for this \nbill would give a free ride to securities fraud. The Sacramento Bee \nmade a similar mistake in its July 13 editorial, and the Baltimore Sun \nrepeated the mistake on June 26.\n\n  Under current law, people who engage in securities fraud are jointly \nand severally liable. If a person is 1 percent responsible he can be \nrequired to pay for 100 percent of the damages. Former SEC Chairman \nRichard Breeden called joint and several liability inverted \ndisproportionate liability. Former SEC Commissioner Carter Beese said \nthat joint and several liability is unfair. The bill creates a two-tier \nliability system. It retains joint and several liability for people \nwhose conduct is knowing. The bill goes a step further and requires \nthat small investors be made whole.\n  Those individuals found incidentally involved, are proportionately \nliable. For example, if a person is fond to be incidentally involved \nand 5 percent liable, he/she must pay 5 percent of the damages. This is \ncalled proportionate liability. Every former SEC Commissioner who \ntestified at our hearings supported the concept of proportionate \nliability. Breeden testified, ``Paying your fair share, but no more \nthan your fair share, of liability is hardly a radical proposal.''\n  We created the two-tier system to stop plaintiffs' lawyers from \nnaming people as defendants merely because they are deep pockets. We \nlearned at our hearings that if a professional, like an accountant or \nunderwriter is named as a defendant it adds one-third to the settlement \nvalue of the case regardless of whether or not the professional did \nanything wrong. Naming a lawyer, or an outside director also adds to \nthe settlement\n value regardless of their role.\n\n  A lot was said about Charles Keating. His name was mentioned over and \nover and over on the Senate floor and in the media during the debate on \nS. 240.\n  On July 28 a St. Louis Post-Dispatch editorialized that under S. 240, \nKeating and his advisors would have gone free while investors would get \nno relief. The Post-Dispatch printed that under S. 240, ``joint and \nseveral liability would be abolished, which means that if the deceiving \ncompany has gone bankrupt, investors can't recover damages from the \naccounting firms, lawyers or stockbrokers who helped perpetrate the \nfraud.'' This is one statement with three errors. Error 1, the two-tier \nliability system does not abolish joint and several liability for \npeople who commit knowing fraud. Error 2, accounting firms, lawyers, \nand others who are incidentally involved in the fraud will have to pay \ntheir share of the losses that their conduct caused--proportionate \nliability--the second tier of S. 240's liability scheme. Error 3, \ninvolves bankrupt codefendants. The bill provides that in the case of a \nbankrupt codefendant, the other codefendants are required to contribute \nan extra amount up to an additional 50 percent of their share to make \nup the uncollectible share. The bill also makes small investors whole.\n  The St. Louis Dispatch editorial also states that ``accountants who \ndetect fraud and keep quiet about it also would be helped'' by S. 240. \nThe opposite is true. S. 240 requires auditors to speak up and expose \ncorporate fraud. The bill requires accountants to report corporate \nfraud to the top management of the companies they audit. If management \nfails to expose and correct the fraud, the bill requires auditors to \nreport the\n fraud to the Securities and Exchange Commission of face liability.\n\n  This bill has nothing to do with Keating. No one in the Senate would \nsupport a bill that would allow an individual like Keating to get away \nwith fraud. Keating knowingly lied and told investors that the junk \nbonds he sold were backed by the Federal Government. He should have \nbeen punished, and he was punished. Nothing in S. 240 would prevent \nthat from happening. It is also important to note that Keating was sued \nunder many provisions of both Federal and State law--laws untouched by \nS. 240.\n  Instead, this bill has everything to do with a small coterie of \nsecurities class action attorneys who have become very rich by filing \nsecurities lawsuits against high-technology and other high-growth \ncompanies whenever their stock price drops or the company announces \nthat it will be unable to meet analysis' earnings projections. \nInformation provided during the 12 congressional hearings on this issue \nshowed that there are approximately 300 securities lawsuits filed each \nyear and that these suits normally settle for around $8.6 million each. \nCurrently, the lawsuits take at least one-third of the settlement fund \nin the typical case, making the securities class action business a $2.4 \nbillion industry for these entrepreneurial lawyers.\n  If you don't believe in that these lawyers are entrepreneurs, just \nlook at how the typical securities class action suit gets started. \nUnlike the typical lawyer-client relationship, the lawyers hire their \nclients. These lawyers maintain a list of professional plaintiffs or \npet plaintiffs who own a couple of shares of every stock traded on our \nstock exchanges. The lawyer agrees to pay the pet plaintiff a bonus of \n$10,000 or\n $15,000 if the person agrees to let the lawyer file the case on his/\nher behalf. Often within hours after a stock's price drops as a result \nof a missed earnings projection, these lawyers file a lawsuit on behalf \nof a pet plaintiff. Some of these pet plaintiffs have appeared over and \nover again in these cases. By using these professional plaintiffs, the \nlawyers, not the investors, maintain control of the case. The lawyers \ndecide who to sue, when to sue and when to settle. No wonder one of the \nmost prominent securities class action attorneys told Forbes magazine \n``I have the greatest practice of law in the world, I have no \nclients.''\n\n  Despite the fact that these lawyers admit that they have no clients, \nwhenever Congress attempts to address the abuses the class action \nlawyers claim that if Congress enacts any legal reform, future Keatings \ncould not be sued for damages. But as one plaintiff told us, she felt \nripped off twice--once by the company and again by the class action \nlawyer.\n  In the typical case, the real victims receive around 6 cents on the \ndollar of their claimed loss, while the lawyers \n\n[[Page S 12204]]\ntake the lion's share of the settlement fund as their fee award.\n  In an interview with ``CNN,'' a prominent class action attorney, the \nsame one who said he had no clients, settled a case for $12 million and \nasked for the entire amount as his share. When asked whether he had a \nresponsibility to his clients to justify his fee request, he responded \n``no.'' Instead, he said that he has a responsibility to the court to \njustify the request.\n  The Boston Globe stated that ``S. 240 requires that plaintiffs pick \nup the costs of the defendant companies if a suit fails.'' S. 240 \ncontains no such English rule, no loser pays provision, or no fee \nshifting provision. Under the Senate bill, no investor could be \nrequired to pay the legal fees of an innocent company in the event that \nthe judge determines that the suit lacked merit. Instead, the bill, as \npassed by the Senate, builds on the existing rules of the court, in \nparticular rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The bill \nrequires judges to sanction attorneys who bring frivolous cases. In the \nmost egregious situations the judge could require the attorney to pay \nthe companies fees. This incrementally addresses the current winner \npays system, which requires innocent companies to spend millions of \ndollars to get frivolous cases dismissed. At one point in legal history \nit was against the law for lawyers to promote unnecessary litigation \nand this attorney sanction provision takes a step toward ensuring that \nlawyers will only file cases which possess some merit.\n  The Las Cruces Bulletin in my home State of New Mexico stated that \nDomenici's bill contains a provision which restricts the rights of \nsmall investors by setting financial standards for who may or may not \nfile class action suits. Nothing in S. 240 as introduced, or as passed \nby the Senate limits the right of anyone to bring a securities lawsuit. \nUnder S. 240, as under current law, anyone may bring a securities suit.\n  Most small investors are senior citizens and support the reforms \ncontained in S. 240. A National Investor Relations Institute Study, in \nMarch 1995, found that 81 percent of senior citizens would like to see \nmandatory penalties for lawyers who bring frivolous\n lawsuits. The bill does this. Seventy-nine percent say defendants \nshould only pay damage awards according to their percentage of fault. \nThe bill does this, but retains joint and several liability for fraud \ninstigators and if necessary to fully compensate small investors; 87 \npercent are concerned that companies are spending millions of dollars \ndefending themselves in lawsuits--money that could be spent on further \nresearch of new products. The current system does this, but the bill \nshould weed out the cases lacking merit. And 88 percent are concerned \nthat even when the lawsuits are settled, it is not the consumers who \nbenefit but the attorneys. S. 240 seems to be on the same waive length \nas these senior citizen investors.\n\n  On June 26, during the floor debate, the Miami Herald charged that S. \n240 grants a safe harbor to all statements of a forward-looking nature \nand essentially tells companies and brokers: Go ahead, lie about the \nfuture. As long as you're not misrepresenting the past, you can fleece \ninvestors in any way that your imagination allows. This statement is \ngood prose but bad reporting. Nothing in S. 240 gives executives, \nbrokers or anyone else connected to publicly traded companies safe \nharbor protection if they intentionally lie about the corporation's \nfuture prospects.\n  There is, however, a problem with the flow of information in the \nmarketplace particularly information in the form of predictions about \nthe future. CEO's who make predictions about the future get sued if \ntheir predictions don't materialize--regardless of the reason. After \nnews that an earnings projection won't be met, the stock price drops \nfor a couple of weeks and the lawsuit gets filed. Consequently, CEO's \nare making fewer\n and fewer predictions. This is a very serious problem--not only for \nhigh-technology company CEO's, but also for our securities markets. Our \nsecurities laws are based on disclosure of information, yet the chill \non information about the future caused by these lawsuits is undermining \nthe efficiency of our markets.\n\n  These lawsuits divert resources from companies' research and \ndevelopment budgets to their legal departments. One of these lawsuits \ncosts as much as developing and bringing to market a high-technology \nproduct line. Jobs that should have been created aren't created, and we \nlose out to our international competitors. The race to innovate becomes \na race to the courthouse. It is a costly detour increasing the cost of \ncapital, professional services, and officers and directors' liability \ninsurance. Some have called it a litigation tax.\n  S. 240 restores the ability of CEO's to make available information \nabout their companies' future. It protects from lawsuit abuse \npredictions about the future made by the company as long as the \nstatements are clearly identified as forward-looking projections--a \nMiranda warning to investors: ``This is a prediction about the future \nand because the future is uncertain it may not come true''--and were \nnot made with the purpose and intent to deceive investors. Simply put, \nthe Senate bill's safe harbor protects only the good guys and \nencourages disclosure. It is neither a license to lie, nor a license to \nsteal. It is an opportunity to disclose for the company and restores \nthe investors right-to-know. The bill does recognize that a projection \nabout the future is a prediction, not a promise, or an adequate basis \nupon which to bring a multimillion\n dollar lawsuit. The bill does take away the class action lawyers' \nlicense to extort a settlement when a prediction about the future \ndoesn't quite materialize.\n\n  My good friend and fellow Democratic sponsor of this bill, Senator \nDodd, recently had to endure an op-ed in his home State's Hartford \nCourant in which a well-known consumer advocate condemned him for \nsupporting securities lawsuit reform. The same piece alleged that the \nbill changed the standard of liability, when, in fact, the Senator had \nbeen the champion for retaining the current law standard.\n  Mr. President, people can disagree on whether we need more lawsuits \nor more investors but we can all agree that we need more good \nreporting. I hope I have clarified what this bill does and does not do.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that op-eds written by Carter \nBeese, Ed McCracken, Jonathan Dickey, Robert Gilbertson, and J. Kenneth \nBlackwell appear in the Record following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 27, 1995]\n\n                        Stop Choking Wall Street\n\n                          (By J. Carter Beese)\n\n       Washington.--A bill to reform the nation's securities \n     litigation system is moving toward a vote in the Senate. \n     Critics argue that it will allow corporate America to take \n     small investors to the cleaners. Nothing could be further \n     from the truth.\n       As a former commissioner of the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission, I believe that strict enforcement of securities \n     laws is vital for investors and the integrity of the market. \n     But today's litigation machine harms the very investors that \n     opponents of reform profess to help.\n       A majority of the high-tech firms in the Silicon Valley \n     have been sued at least once by vociferous plaintiffs' \n     lawyers in class-action fraud lawsuits. One of the every \n     eight companies on the New York Stock Exchange is sued for \n     securities fraud every five years. Is fraud really that \n     rampant among our most successful public companies? Or is the \n     system allowing, even encouraging, the initiation of \n     litigation, even when there is no evidence of wrongdoing?\n       Under current law, there is little downside to frivolous \n     litigation, while the potential rewards are enormous--the \n     deep pockets of corporations and their advisers.\n       The prevailing legal doctrine of joint and several \n     liability, which makes all defendants fully liable for what \n     may or may not have been their wrongdoing, adds to the \n     potential pot.\n       Meanwhile, the huge costs of litigation give defendants an \n     equally powerful incentive to settle. Though there may be a \n     high probability of winning in court, settling is often a \n     bottom-line business decision made in the best interest of \n     investors.\n       As a result, most cases are settled on a formulaic basis, \n     with plaintiffs collecting a small fraction of their alleged \n     loss and with legal fees consuming the remainder of the \n     settlement account.\n       The ultimate costs are passed on to all investors in lower \n     earnings and lower share prices. These costs also weigh \n     heavily on productivity and competitiveness. Every dollar \n     spent on frivolous litigation is a dollar less for research, \n     innovation, capital investment and jobs.\n\n[[Page S 12205]]\n\n       The critics of this bill claim that its main purpose is to \n     protect corporate officials who peddle overly optimistic \n     predictions of profitability. Under today's rules, however, \n     any positive forecast that does not materialize can and will \n     be held against you in court. Companies have thus become \n     reluctant to disseminate forward-looking projections crucial \n     to investment decision-making.\n       The changes in securities law before the Senate would not \n     prevent defrauded investors from seeking redress. They would \n     simply require any action involving misleading statements to \n     specify each such statement, thereby eliminating the vague, \n     sweeping claims that characterize so many meritless cases.\n       They would begin to hold plaintiffs' lawyers accountable \n     for the lawyers' actions by requiring the court to make \n     specific findings about whether the suit was frivolous.\n       Finally, they would establish legal protections for \n     forward-looking information unless that information was \n     misleading or fraudulent.\n       These measured reforms are surely a better deal for \n     investors and the economy. By addressing the imbalance in our \n     system, separating the serious from the frivolous, we will \n     have a tort system that provides protection from fraud \n     without subverting fairness and free enterprise.\n                                                                    ____\n\n           [From the San Francisco Chronicle, June 28, 1995]\n\n                   The New Threat to High-Tech Firms\n\n                           (By Ed McCracken)\n\n       William Weinberger looked like any other retiree in Pompano \n     Beach, Fla. No one would have guessed that he was part of an \n     effort to undermine California's high-tech industry.\n       But by the time he died in 1992, he had set a remarkable \n     record: He had been the plaintiff in an astounding 90 \n     lawsuits in just under three years. Weinberger was what is \n     known as a ``professional plaintiff,'' merely a consenting \n     name on a lawsuit instigated and filed by a law firm chasing \n     dollar signs rather than principle. The pieces of litigation \n     filed in his name were securities or ``strike'' suits, in \n     which one profits from a company's misfortune--that is, a \n     down-turn in the stock market.\n        This new breed of corporate raider claims stock fraud when \n     there is little or no evidence of wrongdoing--that is, \n     deliberate false or misleading statements by the company \n     about its potential--then tied a company up in litigation \n     long enough to force a profitable settlement. It is a \n     practice that costs people jobs and divert millions from \n     research and development, and California has felt the impact \n     more than any other state.\n       The high-tech firms of Silicon Valley and the Bay Area's \n     bio-tech companies are the No. 1 target of these schemes, \n     because cutting-edge research and the risks inherent in \n     development make their stock prices volatile.\n       The facts speak for themselves: More than one-third of the \n     state's computer companies have been sued at least once. And \n     while the list of victims reads like a who's who of \n     California's high-tech industry--Intel, Hewlett Packard, Sun \n     Microsystems, Apple, Silicon Graphics Computers--some of the \n     smaller, startup firms that are the growth companies of \n     tomorrow are being driven into bankruptey.\n       Silicon Graphics has over the years been the subject of no \n     less than four securities class-action lawsuits. None of \n     these suits had merit. Of the four, two were dismissed one \n     resulted in summary judgment in Silicon Graphics favor after \n     years of litigation, and one was settled for a nominal amount \n     after having been initially dismissed. By way of example, the \n     last suit was trigged by a disappointing quarter caused by \n     the short-tem economic upheaval arising from the Gulf War.\n       These cases have cost Silicon Graphics well above $5 \n     million in expenses, and countless hours of management time \n     has been diverted. The wasted time and money could have been \n     devoted to increasing business and adding jobs at a faster \n     pace.\n       To end this kind of abuse, the U.S. Senate has stepped \n     forward with a bipartisan bill, The Securities Litigation \n     Reform Act. John Kerry, Democrat-Mass., has declared that \n     ``speculative suits based on no evidence of wrongdoing are an \n     unwarranted threat to young growth companies.''\n       Congress recently heard testimony stating that only a \n     handful of strike suits ever actually come to trial because \n     most companies cannot spend the time and money to defend \n     their innocence, and are ultimately forced to settle instead. \n     The people behind the suits know this, and are happy to walk \n     off with unfair bounty. It is what one prominent CEO has \n     called ``legalized extortion.''\n       The new bill, if passed, would make it more difficult to \n     bring such suits without just cause. We applaud the efforts \n     of the senators and others who have worked to bring this bill \n     forward, and we urge California Senators Dianne Feinstein and \n     Barbara Boxer to join in supporting it.\n       If the bill passes, attorneys filing securities suits \n     without proper evidence would be subject to sanctions, their \n     fees would be limited and profit-seeking plaintiffs would be \n     discouraged. Still, some have voiced concern over the bill \n     and worry that it limits the ability of investors to bring \n     suit in the event of actual stock fraud. It does not. The \n     bill makes any and all who engage in securities fraud fully \n     liable. It also explicitly protects the small investor--\n     anyone with a net worth under $200,000--leaving intact the \n     full range of options for seeking damages from fraudulent \n     companies. What this bill takes away, however, is the \n     incentive for a greedy few to launch frivolous lawsuits.\n       Meanwhile, the bill's passage will enable California's \n     high-tech companies to freely pursue the ground-breaking \n     technologies and new products that launched them to the \n     forefront of the industry. Our entrepreneurs will have one \n     less worry as they make their way in the marketplace. And the \n     money saved could be put into the jobs and opportunities \n     Californians so desperately need, which is far better than \n     losing millions to the wallets of a wealthy few.\n                                                                    ____\n\n     [From the San Francisco Examiner and Chronicle, July 23, 1995]\n\n                   Final Inning for ``Strike Suits''?\n\n                          (By Jonathan Dickey)\n\n       Securities fraud ``strike suits'' have overrun Silicon \n     Valley in the past decade--and for the past two years, \n     Silicon Valley has been fighting back. Now, legal reforms \n     curtailing these ``strike suits'' are about to become a \n     reality.\n       Late last month, 70 members of the United States Senate \n     joined a broad coalition of industry trade groups, Silicon \n     Valley CEO's, securities industry representatives, and \n     institutional investors to finally bring sanity back to our \n     federal securities laws. The reform of those laws is aimed at \n     preventing further proliferation of ``strike suits'' alleging \n     securities fraud against public companies.\n       In these suits, plaintiffs' lawyers make millions by \n     bringing frivolous securities claims with a high ``ransom'' \n     value to the companies forced to defend them. In just two \n     years, these strike suits have generated settlements totaling \n     over $1.3 billion, a huge percentage of which was paid by \n     California-based high-tech companies.\n       The action in the Senate followed a lopsided vote earlier \n     this year in the House of Representatives approving a similar \n     reform bill, where Republicans and Democrats joined together \n     in large numbers to reject amendments offered by lobbyists \n     for plaintiffs' lawyers designed to weaken the bill, or kill \n     it altogether. Similar eleventh-hour lobbying efforts \n     occurred during the Senate debate.\n       Contrary to many stories circulating in the business press, \n     the securities law reform legislation will not open the \n     floodgates to fraud, or deprive investors of their day in \n     court in cases of real fraud. In fact, the legislation passed \n     by the Senate contains several ``proinvestor'' provisions, \n     including:\n       Restoring SEC authority to pursue ``aiders and abettors.'' \n     It used to be common practice to sue individuals, \n     accountants, and legal and financial advisors whose indirect \n     involvement in a company's securities offerings was alleged \n     to have made the company's ``fraud'' possible. Last year, the \n     U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the SEC did not have the power \n     to bring such claims under the main statute of the Securities \n     Exchange Act. The Senate bill would expressly authorize such \n     suits.\n       Authorizing auditors to report accounting irregularities to \n     the SEC. Under existing accounting rules, auditors who \n     discover irregularities in a company's financial statements \n     are required to report such items to the company's audit \n     committee, but not to the public. The Senate bill would allow \n     auditors to ``blow the whistle'' to the SEC if the company's \n     board of directors fails to take corrective action when \n     irregularities are reported.\n       Preventing companies from destroying critical evidence. The \n     Senate bill includes a ``preservation of evidence'' provision \n     which would make it a violation of federal law if a company \n     that is sued subsequently fails to preserve company records \n     relevant to the suit.\n       Allowing courts to sanction lawyers who engage in bad faith \n     tactics in litigation. Investors sometimes complain about the \n     long wait for a case to be resolved. Defense lawyers who \n     engage in conduct which is found by the court to \n     unnecessarily delay or needlessly increase the cost of the \n     litigation may be forced to pay the plaintiffs' lawyers' \n     legal fees.\n       Giving investors the right to determine who should \n     represent their interests in any litigation. Currently, \n     plaintiffs' lawyers engage in an unseemly ``race to the \n     courthouse'' to be the first to sue a company which reports \n     an earnings surprise. The first lawyer to sue normally gets \n     the ``lead counsel'' position, and the lion's share of the \n     fees. The Senate bill would abolish this practice, and \n     authorize investors to decide who their legal representative \n     should be.\n       Protecting small investors by requiring ``joint and \n     several'' liability if the target defendant is bankrupt. The \n     Senate bill adopts a ``proportionate fault'' standard of \n     liability, which says that where multiple defendants are \n     sued, each will pay according to his or its share of the \n     blame. But the Senate bill will protect small investors if \n     the main ``bad guy'' is bankrupt, and will require the \n     solvent defendants to make up the difference.\n\n[[Page S 12206]]\n\n       Likewise, the House bill passed earlier this year--part of \n     the ``Contract with America''--contained several ``pro-\n     investor'' provisions, including:\n       Establishing plaintiff ``steering committees'' to supervise \n     litigation. The House bill allows shareholders with a \n     significant financial stake in the company to form a \n     committee, and make decisions on the conduct of the case. \n     Right now, plaintiffs' lawyers make all these decisions by \n     themselves.\n       Eliminating any legal requirement that investors need to \n     prove reliance on fraudulent statements. The House bill would \n     codify the so-called ``fraud on the market'' doctrine, which \n     presumes that everything a company says is absorbed by the \n     market, and reflected in the stock price. Investors can't be \n     thrown out of court because they haven't read a company's \n     press releases, analyst reports, and the like.\n       Setting a standard of liability which requires only proof \n     of recklessness, not actual intent to defraud. The House bill \n     also codifies a rule that investors don't have to prove \n     actual fraud. They only have to establish that a company \n     departed from ``standards of ordinary care'' in some extreme \n     way.\n       What is it, then, that makes business groups, and Silicon \n     Valley in particular, so happy about the reform legislation? \n     As a lawyer who defends technology companies in these suits, \n     I see three major benefits to the legislation:\n       Stronger protection to companies which issue earnings \n     projections or other ``forward looking'' statements.\n       A higher standard for pleading fraud claims in court, \n     requiring courts to give more careful scrutiny to borderline \n     cases, and to dismiss those that are clearly frivolous.\n       A more national standard for determining damages in these \n     cases, instead of the wide-open, ``anything goes'' manner in \n     which losses are currently computed.\n       Will the legislation end securities strike suits? Not \n     entirely. What the legislation hopefully will do is level the \n     playing field, and allow companies to litigate appropriate \n     cases, instead of settling cases out of fear of catastrophic, \n     runaway jury verdicts.\n       Ironically, some of the stronger criticisms of the reform \n     legislation have come from lawyers who defend companies in \n     these suits. Nationally, technology companies wonder about \n     this. In their view, lawyers who defend public companies \n     should embrace these reforms.\n       Personally, I support any reform which will change the \n     current litigation climate, which forces many boards of \n     directors to spend millions of dollars to settle these cases \n     rather than gamble with a jury. The current laws foster this \n     climate by allowing too many meritless cases to be brought. \n     Although the legislation now pending in Congress is far from \n     perfect. I am convinced it will substantially reduce the \n     number of strike suits brought against technology companies \n     which experience momentary--and innocent--stock price \n     declines. At the same time, the legislation still will allow \n     legitimate fraud cases to be brought.\n       Although the plaintiffs' lawyers so far have struck out in \n     Congress, the game isn't over. The Senate and House still \n     have to work out a compromise bill to send to President \n     Clinton for signature. No one should underestimate the \n     possibility that back-room politics will undo some of the \n     more important reforms before they reach the president's \n     desk. The next few months will see plaintiff's lawyers \n     ``swinging for the seats'' as the strike suit game heads into \n     the final innings.\n                                                                    ____\n\n            [From the Hartford Currant (CT), July 13, 1995]\n\n               Yes: Bill Would Protect Growing Companies\n\n                       (By Robert G. Gilbertson)\n\n       For investors and businesses, the Senate's overwhelming 69-\n     30 vote for the Domenici-Dodd bill to crack down on frivolous \n     securities lawsuits is a light at the end of the tunnel.\n       For too long, baseless lawsuits have eroded earnings \n     potential and restricted business expansion by diverting \n     money from productive resources to legal fees and by cutting \n     off options for raising capital.\n       Too many publicly traded companies have been sued for no \n     greater offense than that their stock price dropped. \n     Virtually all these lawsuits were filed by a small group of \n     law firms. Virtually none of the lawsuits came to trial, but \n     fighting such lawsuits distracted managers and cost millions \n     of dollars in legal fees.\n       The threat of frivolous securities lawsuits has been one of \n     the biggest obstacles to growth for many ambitious companies.\n       At a time when Connecticut has lost so many jobs, we need \n     to encourage companies to expand jobs and opportunities. The \n     legal system has the exact opposite effect. Many companies \n     have even decided to forgo the capital that could be raised \n     by selling stock to the public for fear of being caught in a \n     senseless legal system that can bankrupt emerging companies \n     even though they have done nothing wrong.\n       Now--thanks to U.S. Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, the initial \n     cosponsor of the Senate bill, and his colleagues in both \n     parties--our economy may soon be free from meritless \n     securities lawsuits. That means businesses such as mine can \n     again consider selling stock to the public to finance \n     expansion. It also means shareholders' investments will rise \n     and fall on their own merits--without fear that a frivolous \n     lawsuit will cramp growth.\n       I know. I am chief executive officer of CMX Systems, a \n     small high-tech company in Wallingford that manufactures \n     precision measuring devices for the disk drive and \n     semiconductor industry. By any objective measure, CMX has \n     been ripe for expansion for some time.\n       We grew more than 2,000 percent in the four years from 1990 \n     through 1993, and our sales exceeded $8.6 million in 1993. To \n     continue this extraordinary growth, CMX needed to sell stock \n     to the public in early 1994 to finance a $4 million research-\n     and-development plan. However, we were deterred from this \n     option after watching other small companies get whiplashed by \n     frivolous securities lawsuits.\n       Therefore, we were forced to scale back in 1994. This cost \n     jobs, profits and taxes to Connecticut and the U.S. \n     government.\n       Most new public companies, especially in the volatile high-\n     tech industry, experience wide swings in profitability. The \n     sharp moves in revenues and earnings often lead to similar \n     volatility in stock prices.\n       Under the existing securities litigation system, those \n     stock-price movements have been the signal for a small group \n     of specialized lawyers to file class-action lawsuits alleging \n     fraud. Filed without any evidence of wrongdoing other than \n     stock-price movements, these lawsuits expose the companies to \n     millions of dollars impossible damages. In addition, fighting \n     even the weakest lawsuit requires staggering legal fees that \n     can themselves reach or exceed the $1 million mark.\n       Pursued to trial, such lawsuits can run for years--drawing \n     hundreds of thousands of dollars from the corporate treasury \n     and thousands of hours of management time. Faced with that \n     reality, most companies find it cheaper to pay large \n     settlements to make the lawyers go away.\n       The Domenici (Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M.)-Dodd bill, \n     approved by the Senate on June 28, would greatly reduce the \n     probability of such frivolous lawsuits--and free companies \n     such as mine to enter the equity markets for needed \n     investment capital. That means economic growth and more jobs \n     in Connecticut and throughout the United States.\n       The bill bans the bounty payments that some lawyers use to \n     entice shareholders to file lawsuits. It requires lawsuits to \n     include specific evidence of fraud. It empowers judges to \n     terminate frivolous lawsuits before enormous legal fees \n     exhaust the resources of small companies. Finally, it \n     restores vital investor protection by giving control of \n     class-action lawsuits to shareholders.\n       Where real fraud exists, shareholders will retain the \n     ability to pursue legal redress. But where the only winners \n     are likely to be plaintiffs' lawyers (who have taken in as \n     much as $250 million a year in questionable securities \n     lawsuits), the Senate bill gives shareholders the power to \n     pull the plug on that kind of frivolous litigation.\n       Connecticut business leaders and investors owe a debt to \n     Dodd for having the courage to consider the merits of \n     securities litigation reform--and not discard it for solely \n     partisan reasons. All Americans owe thanks to the senators of \n     both parties who put common sense ahead of partisanship and \n     voted to restore sanity to the securities litigation systems.\n                                                                    ____\n\n               [From the Washington Times, June 28, 1995]\n\n                  The Urgency of Securities Law Reform\n\n                       (By J. Kenneth Blackwell)\n\n       Orange County's recent bankruptcy is making the nation's \n     public funds and pension-fund managers mighty concerned about \n     the riskiness of their investments. I know; I'm one of them. \n     In 1988, I was a trustee for the $800 million Cincinnati \n     Employees Retirement System Fund. And today I'm Ohio's State \n     Treasurer with custodial responsibilities covering five state \n     pension funds valued at more than $105 billion.\n       But the kind of bad investments that devastated Orange \n     County isn't what keeps me up at night. What worries me--and \n     what should worry the millions of retirees who have money in \n     stock funds--is what might happen to the good investments of \n     public-pension-fund managers. Those stocks, and the sound, \n     well-managed companies they represent, are increasingly \n     vulnerable to frivolous and baseless lawsuits. Which is why \n     the Senate is now debating securities litigation reform: to \n     protect such companies--and their ordinary investors. It's \n     good, necessary legislation. I hope it passes.\n       The securities litigation system was initially designed to \n     protect investors from corporate fraud. In percentage terms, \n     it produces only a small fraction of the nation's multi-\n     million-dollar lawsuit annual federal caseload. But as a \n     financial and administrative matter, securities class-action \n     suits filed against public companies are a monster. One of \n     every eight stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange has \n     been subject to class-action challenge. Most high-tech firms \n     in California's Silicon Valley--companies that produce a \n     disproportionate share of America's job and profit growth, \n     making them obviously attractive pension fund investments--\n     have been targets of such lawsuits.\n       Defending such a lawsuit is often a nightmare. Securities \n     litigation is unusually complicated. The discovery process it \n     involves is long and arduous. Individual cases can take \n\n[[Page S 12207]]\n     years to resolve in court, and even when a sued company wins, its \n     liability insurance premiums generally go up--a lot. So it's \n     become standard practice for securities class-action \n     defendants to settle these lawsuits pre-emptively, in a \n     struggle to avoid massive legal expenses and business \n     distractions.\n       Settlement still hurts, of course. A study by the National \n     Venture Capital Association found that companies embroiled in \n     securities litigation--whether they settle or go to court--\n     must spend an average of nearly $700,000 and 1,055 hours of \n     management time. But they really have no choice, because the \n     merits of an individual securities class-action suit are, at \n     least under current law, essentially irrelevant. Innocence is \n     no protection against a lawsuit. And real fraud too often \n     goes unpunished; genuinely guilty companies are encouraged to \n     settle, too.\n       Rules of legal standing in the securities field are very \n     broad--and very thin. Acceptable evidence of corporate \n     wrongdoing barely extends beyond an unexpected stock price \n     change; roughly 20 percent of securities suits are filed \n     within 48 hours of a major stock decline. Or a stock \n     increase, for that matter--since it's not unknown for lawyers \n     to file suite against a company whose market position has \n     improved, claiming that information about a merger or \n     expansion has been fraudulently withheld.\n       Given such juicy opportunities for standing, it's no \n     surprise that speculative securities litigation has become a \n     lucrative sub-specialty in the American plaintiffs' bar. The \n     small group of lawyers who concentrate on such law made a \n     1994 average of $1.4 million in fees and expenses on every \n     case. But America's pension funds who are shareholders in \n     these companies and in whose interest our securities laws are \n     intended to protect, get stuck with the short end of the \n     stick.\n       Lead attorneys--usually the first lawyer to sign up a \n     single ``defrauded'' shareholder and rush his papers to the \n     courthouse--are generally granted wide latitude over pretrial \n     procedure. They're allowed to set settlement terms and \n     establish their own contingency fee rates with minimal \n     consultation and judicial supervision. After all expenses are \n     accounted for, plaintiff shareholders, even ``successful'' \n     ones, generally receive just a tiny fraction of the market \n     loss their lawyers claim for them: pennies on the dollar, in \n     fact. And when the process is concluded, shareholder \n     investments are very often in worse shape then when it began. \n     The companies involved are out big money, and their business \n     plans have been distorted by a tortuous legal entanglement.\n       The life of a careful fund manager is seriously complicated \n     by the frivolous securities lawsuit phenomenon. If lawyers \n     are so broadly encouraged to seize on predictive corporate \n     earnings statements as ``evidence'' of an intention to \n     mislead, corporate officers will have a huge incentive to \n     dumb those statements down--or stop talking about future \n     profits at all. In Silicon Valley in particular, for example, \n     the trend is minimal disclosure. But intelligent investment \n     strategy requires maximum possible disclosure. And if I'm not \n     offered frank assessments of various companies' future \n     potential how can I rest assured that Ohio's pensioners' \n     hard-earned money is being invested wisely?\n       My fiduciary responsibility compels me to act. And the U.S. \n     Senate also should act. As the final days of this debate wind \n     down, trial lawyers are digging in their heels and calling in \n     old chits. Securities litigation remains a fat chunk of their \n     practice, one they dearly want to protect. But Congress is \n     charged with protection of the public interest generally. And \n     the public interest, in this case, is best advanced in simple \n     and straightforward fashion.\n       We must make deliberate acts of corporate fraud clearly \n     illegal, and easier and less costly to pursue. And we must \n     make high-dollar, meritless securities lawsuits--legal \n     devices that are threatening the retirement savings of \n     millions of ordinary Americans, and acting as a brake on the \n     engine of American economic growth--vastly more difficult to \n     pursue.\n       The American system of law should be our country's greatest \n     treasure.

Mr. President, as the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee \non East Asian and Pacific Affairs, I come to the floor today to respond \nbriefly to French President Jacques Chirac's decision to conduct a \nseries of underground nuclear test explosions in the South Pacific \nbetween September of this year and May 1996.\n  I strongly believe that President Chirac's decision to conduct these \ntests will be damaging to international efforts to curb the \nproliferation of nuclear weapons. The Soviet Union began a test \nmoratorium in October 1990; France initiated its own in April 1992, \nalthough it had not exploded a device since 1991, and the United States \nand Great Britain have similarly observed a moratorium since 1992. \nContinuing the trend toward minimizing the nuclear threat, in May of \nthis year the world's five declared nuclear powers extended \nindefinitely the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT].\n  On June 13 of this year, however, President Chirac--citing the need \nto check the reliability and safety of France's existing nuclear \narsenal--announced that country would conduct eight nuclear tests at \nits site at Mururoa Atoll in the South Pacific. That decision is \nunfortunate for three principal reasons. First, it is likely that a \nresumption of testing by France will result in the disintegration of \nthe current testing moratorium and a renewal of underground testing by \nother states. Moratoria are like truces--they are only good as long as \nall the parties to them observe their provisions. Second, it calls into \nserious question France's commitment to the NPT extension. In May, the \nworld's five nuclear powers--the United States, France, Russia, China, \nand Britain--persuaded the rest of the world to extend indefinitely the \nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. To win that consensus, the five \ncountries promised to sign a comprehensive test ban treaty by the end \nof next year. The resumption of French nuclear testing though, only 4 \nmonths after France signed this agreement, I believe calls into \nquestion France's commitment to the CTBT and consequently undermines \nthese international efforts to curb the proliferation of nuclear \nweapons. Japan's Prime Minister, Murayama Tomiichi, has accused France \nof betraying nonnuclear countries, while Minister of Science and \nTechnology Tanaka has stated that ``Nations that possess nuclear \nweapons must show their wisdom and set an example to countries that do \nnot have nuclear weapons.''\n  Third, Mr. President, the French decision to test is vehemently \nopposed by most, if not all, of the countries along the Pacific rim, \nmost of which have publicly condemned the decision. I have been visited \nby the Ambassadors of Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, \nMicronesia, among others, all of whom have conveyed their Governments' \nopposition to nuclear testing in their ``backyards.'' Australia's Prime \nMinister recently summed up his country's position in an article in the \nGerman daily Die Welt:\n\n       Australia and its citizens, and the peoples and governments \n     of many other countries, are outraged about the French \n     Government's announcement that it intends to resume nuclear \n     testing in Mururoa. I believe the French people will \n     understand such feelings very well.\n       The mood in the South Pacific countries is general: If \n     France has to test these weapons, it should do so on its \n     internal territory. Whatever the French Government intends to \n     achieve with these actions, they are seen by the overwhelming \n     majority of the people in this region as a big nation's \n     attack on the rights of smaller ones. The decision to resume \n     the tests is inevitably regarded as a return to old colonial \n     attitudes. This is all the more tragic since most recently \n     France's relations with the countries in the region have \n     become much more positive and fruitful.\n       Neither Australia nor the other countries in the region \n     want France to withdraw from the Pacific. On the contrary, we \n     want to cooperate closely and well with it. However, it is \n     one of the lamentable consequences of this decision that many \n     people in the region now doubt the legitimacy of France's \n     role.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Australia's concern is increased further by the additional \n     responsibility that arises this year from our role as \n     chairman of the 15 members in the South Pacific Forum. In \n     this function we speak on behalf of all countries in the \n     region; many of them are small and economically vulnerable \n     and all of them have a deep material and spiritual \n     relationship with the Pacific Ocean.\n       I am convinced that I speak for the members of the Forum \n     when I continue to urge France to rescind its decision and \n     when I stress that in this case it would gain considerable \n     prestige not only in the South Pacific countries but among \n     all the peoples in the world.\n       The French Government has mentioned the safety of the \n     environment with regard to the tests in Mururoa. However, we \n     are most deeply concerned about the possibility of accidents. \n     And no one can foresee the long-term dangers that arise from \n     a potential destruction of the sensitive atoll structures \n     during the tests.\n       Australia's reaction is neither precipitate nor a mere \n     reflex. Australia can point to a long history of responsible \n     diplomatic efforts with regard to nuclear issues. Together \n     with the other South Pacific countries, in the 1970's \n     Australia opposed France's atmospheric tests and, upon our \n     initiative, the South Pacific nuclear-free zone was \n     established in 1985.\n       Australia has also been active regarding nuclear issues in \n     the United Nations and in \n\n[[Page S 12208]]\n     other international forums. Often, we acted in close cooperation with \n     France, in particular since President Mitterrand's highly \n     welcome decision to declare a nuclear test moratorium in \n     1992. These efforts were combined on 11 May with the decision \n     by the international community to extend the Nuclear \n     Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] for an unlimited period--an \n     important element for the safety of our two countries.\n       Neither Australia nor any other country has the right to \n     define France's security; however, given the circumstances, \n     the French will certainly permit me to explain why, in our \n     view, France's action is not good for France or for the \n     world.\n       We believe that these tests endanger our efforts to \n     preserve the effectiveness of the NPT and to achieve \n     universal membership. For the unlimited extension of this \n     treaty it was decisive that a ``declaration of principles and \n     goals on nonproliferation and disarmament'' was \n     simultaneously negotiated and adopted by all states involved, \n     including the nuclear states.\n       This declaration announced the speedy conclusion by 1996 at \n     the latest--of a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. And \n     until such a treaty comes into effect the nuclear states have \n     committed themselves to ``extreme restraint.''\n       However, ``extreme restraint'' regarding nuclear tests \n     hardly applies to a program of eight tests. France's decision \n     will certainly make many non-nuclear states wonder about the \n     honesty of all nuclear states.\n       This will harm the treaty's credibility, which must be \n     preserved if some states, which have not yet signed it, are \n     to be persuaded to do so.\n       The decision will also increase the problems in the \n     negotiations on a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. \n     Despite President Chirac's gratifying statement that France \n     will sign such a treaty, there is the serious danger that the \n     very difficult treaty negotiations that we are facing in \n     Geneva will become even more difficult.\n       In particular France's position as a responsible and \n     leading power in the world means that any new French test \n     will play into the hands of potential arms dealers and that \n     any test will make many of those countries hesitate whose \n     support we need to conclude a comprehensive treaty.\n       We know the arguments for France's nuclear capacity and the \n     strategic dimensions of a nuclear power very well. We argue \n     not merely on the basis of emotions when we say that the \n     biggest responsibility for us all is the one to keep alive \n     the hope for a nuclear-free world, which was born when the \n     Cold War ended. The burden of this responsibility rests most \n     heavily on the nuclear states, particularly after the \n     unlimited extension of the NPT.\n       And in view of the nuclear experiences in Europe, the \n     biggest challenge for leadership certainly is right in front \n     of Europe's own door. The damaged Chernobyl reactor may have \n     been encased in a sarcophagus, but there are still another 20 \n     reactors with similar design flaws on the territory of the \n     former Soviet Union. Dozens of nuclear powered submarines of \n     the former Soviet fleet are now idle. Nuclear material and \n     nuclear expert knowledge are leaking from the former Soviet \n     Union into illegal markets.\n       These dangers, as well as the stocks of dismantled nuclear \n     weapons and contaminated areas, are not precisely banished by \n     the development of further nuclear weapons capacities. But \n     France's top international skills in nuclear science and \n     technology could help. How much more respect would France \n     gain and how much more useful would it be if the country were \n     not to concentrate its skills and energy on countering a \n     purely hypothetical threat but on meeting a real threat!\n       I do not doubt that the Australians want to make it known \n     in France that their attitude is in no way determined by \n     hostility toward the French people or the French nation. Our \n     opposition specifically refers to the French Government's \n     decision to resume the nuclear tests in the Pacific.\n       In the past Australia's attitude was sometimes understood \n     as an expression of some kind of Anglo-Saxon hostility toward \n     France. However, Australia is certainly not an Anglo-Saxon \n     enclave in the Asia-Pacific region. As the many French who \n     live in Australia can confirm, Australia is a rich \n     multicultural society, in which half of the immigrants come \n     from Asian countries. It is clear that many of these French \n     inhabitants of Australia think that the French Government \n     should rescind its decision.\n       If they live on Australia's east coast, they know that \n     there is an enormous difference between studying a map of the \n     Pacific in Europe and actually living on the shores of the \n     ocean in Sydney or Brisbane or Auckland. The map shows these \n     places to be far away from Mururoa. However, if one lives in \n     these places, one knows that the South Pacific--no matter how \n     gigantic it is constitutes a single environment and links \n     everyone who participates in it.\n       The community spirit that the Pacific Ocean gives us is \n     similar to the one given to France by the idea of ``Europe.'' \n     It is the fundamental reason for our opposition to France's \n     decision to resume the tests and for the fact that Australia \n     and its partners in the South Pacific Forum will not stop \n     emphatically presenting our views to the French Government \n     and conveying to the French people, if we can, the depth of \n     our feelings.\n\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding that Senator Akaka intends to \nintroduce an amendment to the Department of Defense authorization bill \nthis week expressing the sense of the Senate that France must abide by \nthe current international moratorium on nuclear test explosions, and \nrefrain from proceeding with its announced intention of conducting a \nseries of nuclear tests in advance of a comprehensive test ban treaty. \nI support that amendment, and hope that the French will reconsider \ntheir position on conducting these tests and that the CTBT will be \nsigned by the end of next year.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/10/senate-section/article/S12207-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          DEFECTIONS FROM IRAQ\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, as many of my colleagues may have heard, \nthere have been dramatic developments in the Middle East today.\n  Two major Iraqi government figures--both members of Saddam Hussein's \ncircle of power--have defected from Iraq and are now in Jordan.\n  One of the defectors, Lt. Gen. Hussein Kamel Hassan, was in charge of \nmilitary industrialization in Iraq. The other, Lt. Col. Saddam Kamel \nHassan, was in charge of Saddam Hussein's guards. Both--this is really \nthe curious thing--coincidentally, are married to daughters of Saddam \nHussein and are thus his sons-in-law.\n  The development is significant for a number of reasons. Just last \nweek, Ambassador Madeleine Albright testified to the Foreign Relations \nCommittee that Saddam's base of support has been shrinking. Today's \nevents illustrate that point in an extraordinary way. On a more \nfundamental level, the defections demonstrate the soundness of United \nStates containment policy toward Iraq, which is designed in part to \nencourage internal change. It is still too early to assess how the \ndefections will affect Saddam's grip on power; it is clear, however, \nthat there is considerable turmoil in Baghdad's inner sanctum.\n  As a final note, Mr. President, I would like to add a word of \nappreciation for Jordan's King Hussein. It is no small gesture for King \nHussein to welcome the defectors and provide them safe haven. As \nunpredictable as Saddam Hussein can be, the King's actions could well \nprovoke an Iraqi response.\n  President Clinton has said that the United States stands ready to \nsupport the King, who by today's actions has shown true courage in \ndefiance of Saddam. I support the President's statement and join him in \nexpressing gratitude to King Hussein.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/10/senate-section/article/S12208-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the skyrocketing Federal debt, which long \nago soared into the stratosphere, fueled by bureaucratic hot air, is \nsort of like the weather--everybody talks about it but almost nobody \ndid much about it until immediately after the elections last November.\n  But when the new 104th Congress convened in January, the U.S. House \nof Representatives quickly approved a balanced budget amendment to the \nU.S. Constitution.

Mr. President, there's been a lot of hype recently about \nthe so-called V-chip.\n  President Clinton has endorsed the chip, touting it as an antidote to \nthe gratuitous violence and sexual innuendo that now permeate prime-\ntime television. A majority of the Senate has voted to require that \nevery new television set contain the V-chip. And the House of \nRepresentatives has joined the V-chip bandwagon, by including a V-chip \nmandate in the recently passed telecommunications bill.\n\n[[Page S 12209]]\n\n  With all this support, one would think that the V-chip has been \ntested and tested in laboratories throughout the country. But guess \nwhat? The V-chip doesn't even exist--and it may never exist. It is \npurely a drawing-board scheme that may make sense in theory--but it's \nanybody's guess whether it will ever work in practice. We've never seen \none.\n  According to an article appearing in USA Today, ``There Is No Such \nThing as a V-chip. And There Probably Never Will Be.'' The San \nFrancisco Chronicle reports that--\n\n       No company makes--the V-chip, nor has any company expressed \n     an interest in doing so. In fact, the chip isn't a chip at \n     all. It's really an idea for special circuitry for \n     television, but ``V-circuitry'' doesn't sound quite as \n     omnipotent as V-chip.\n\n  Is development of V-chip technology just around the hi-tech corner? \nWell, perhaps not. According to experts cited in the USA Today article, \nit--\n\n       Could take 10 years before a V-chip TV is designed, built, \n     marketed, and sold into enough homes to make a difference.\n\n  And, in fact, it's likely that the so-called V-chip technology will \nbe overtaken by existing software systems--developed as a direct result \nof consumer demand--that will give parents more control over what their \nchildren watch on television.\n  So, Mr. President, seeing is believing--and perhaps, just perhaps, \nthe White House may want to reconsider its threat to veto any \ntelecommunications bill that fails to include a V-chip mandate. After \nall, this bill is the key to our Nation's future economic success.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the USA Today and San \nFrancisco Chronicle articles be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             One Teensy Little Problem With This New V-Chip\n\n                            (By Kevin Maney)\n\n       There is no such thing as a v-chip. And there probably \n     never will be.\n       ``I don't think Intel's doing it,'' says Howard High at \n     computer chipmaker Intel. ``Our plate's full.''\n       ``Not at TI,'' says Neil McGlone at Texas Instruments. ``If \n     our customers tell us it's important, we'll take a look at \n     it.''\n       Congress is demanding that every new TV set contain a v-\n     chip. The provision is in a telecommunications bill passed \n     Friday by the House and in June by the Senate. Computerized \n     chips installed in TVs would have to be able to detect shows \n     that are violent by reading a signal carried along with each \n     show. The signal would tell the chip the rating of the show--\n     similar to movie ratings. Parents could program the chip to \n     block out shows with certain ratings, keeping those shows \n     from their children's eyes.\n       Great, except nobody's ever made a v-chip. It's like \n     passing a law requiring cars to have air bags before air bags \n     were even invented.\n       ``The v-chip is a theory and a warning flag'' to makers of \n     violent TV programs, says Rob Agee, editor of Interactive \n     Television Report. ``But it doesn't exist.''\n       In fact, Agee and others say a v-chip for TVs will be \n     overtaken by parental control software built into cable \n     systems or interactive TV networks. It could take 10 years \n     before a v-chip TV is designed, built, marketed and sold into \n     enough homes to make a difference. Some of the software \n     controls already are on the market or being tested. Among \n     them:\n       TV Guide On Screen, an interactive on-screen version of the \n     magazine, lets parents lock out channels or individual shows. \n     It also could lock out programs by time--say, no TV until \n     after homework is done. The software will be loaded into \n     upgraded 500-channel cable TV systems starting this fall. \n     ``It's parental control as opposed to governmental control,'' \n     says Larry Miller, vice president of marketing.\n       The Sega Channel, which lets users play Sega games over \n     cable TV lines, gives parents the option of blocking out \n     games that carry certain ratings. The channel is available on \n     some cable systems.\n       In Bell Atlantic's tests of TV over phone lines, the viewer \n     has to enter a personal identification number to order \n     movies, games or items from home-shopping channels. The \n     programming can be blocked by rating.\n       Those companies and others are pushing parental control \n     into their systems because consumers are demanding it, Agee \n     says. ``The v-chip is a moot point.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n           [From the San Francisco Chronicle, July 28, 1995]\n\n   V-Chip Still Only a Vision--Despite All the Talk, It Doesn't Exist\n\n                          (By Michelle Quinn)\n\n       The V-chip seems like the perfect use of one technology to \n     solve a problem caused by another--children watching \n     television shows that serve up violence and sex.\n       In coming weeks, the House of Representatives will consider \n     making the V-chip mandatory in all television sets over 13 \n     inches. Last month, the Senate voted to do so in an amendment \n     to the Telecommunications Act.\n       But those with a tool belt eager to install the chip into a \n     television set will be disappointed. The chip doesn't exist. \n     No company makes it, nor has any company expressed an \n     interest in doing so. In fact, the chip isn't a chip at all. \n     It's really an idea for special circuitry for television, but \n     ``V-Circuitry'' doesn't sound quite as omnipotent as V-chip.\n       All technology starts with ideas. But unlike the creation \n     of the food processor, the electric shaver or the Macintosh \n     computer, the V-chip has sprung mostly from the brow of \n     political imagination and is gaining momentum in an election \n     year.\n       It started when Representative Edward Markey, D-Mass., \n     asked the Electronic Industries Association, a trade \n     association based in Arlington, Va., that represents \n     electronics equipment manufacturers, to come up with ideas \n     for putting captioning on television sets for people who are \n     deaf or hard of hearing. In 1990, Markey's legislation \n     passed, making it mandatory for television sets to have \n     captioning.\n       Two years later, Markey asked the trade association to come \n     up with another technology idea, this time for screening out \n     television violence, said Gary Shapiro, group vice president \n     with the association.\n       Again, the trade association obliged, coming up with a \n     laundry list of how a violence screener might work. Markey \n     dubbed the idea ``V-chip'' and a political football was born.\n       The rough plans were that parents should consult a ratings \n     guidebook, and with a remote control, block certain shows. \n     The television industry would come up with the ratings.\n       The electronics trade association began to work on how the \n     technology might work--and began to take heat from its \n     members, such as television set\n      manufacturers, who said it would be too expensive to \n     rejigger televisions.\n       Markey attempted to introduce a bill about the V-chip last \n     year but the electronics trade association said the idea \n     wasn't ready. The association occasionally seems ready to \n     drop the V-chip idea, said David Moulton, Markey's chief of \n     staff, perhaps buckling under pressure from members who say \n     it would be too expensive.\n       ``Even now, I can no longer get a firm grasp on when the \n     standards will be done,'' Moulton said.\n       So while the V-chip languished on the drawing board, \n     politics took over.\n       Last month, Senate majority leader Bob Dole took on \n     Hollywood as part of his presidential campaign and denounced \n     movies and television shows with ``mindless violence and \n     loveless sex.''\n       Soon after, Senator Kent Conrad, D-N.D., introduced the V-\n     chip as an amendment to the Telecommunications Act. A \n     political stampede took place, with the majority of the \n     Senate shifting its vote at the last minute to pass the \n     amendment 73 to 26.\n       Even President Clinton got in on the V-chip, telling a \n     Nashville conference on families and the media this month \n     that he supported the new technology.\n       Broadcasters and cable operators began denouncing the V-\n     chip, saying it would be impossible to agree on a rating \n     system that the chips could read.\n       Capital Cities/ABC Inc. said it was censorship. ``A chip \n     takes choice out of parents' hands and puts it in the hands \n     of government,'' said a company press release.\n       Next week, Markey intends to introduce an amendment to the \n     Telecommunications Act in the House making it mandatory for \n     televisions over 13 inches. The industry association contends \n     Markey is breaking a promise by making the V-chip \n     mandatory.'' There were no promises, no letters,'' Moulton \n     said.\n       Once TV set manufacturers have to include the V-chip, they \n     will be glad for it, Moulton said.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Chairman Hatch as an \noriginal cosponsor of the ``Anticounterfeiting Consumer Protection Act \nof 1995.'' We are seeking to give law enforcement additional tools to \ncombat counterfeiting crimes that cost our Nation's companies billions \nof dollars each year.\n  Increasingly, we suspect that the lost revenue to legitimate U.S. \ncompanies is going into the pockets of international crime syndicates \nand organized criminals, who manufacture, import and distribute \ncounterfeited goods \n\n[[Page S 12210]]\nto fund their criminal enterprises. No enterprise is safe from \ncounterfeiters.\n  We are a nation of innovators. We lead the world when it comes to \nintellectual property and high technology. Our companies trademarks \nindicate quality around the world. Domestic and international \ncounterfeiters are ripping off these companies, picking their pockets, \nand defrauding the consuming public.\n  Vermont, with one of the lowest violent crime rates in the Nation, is \nhome to businesses that benefit from a strong work ethic and dedication \nto quality. That is part of the reason that Vermont products are \ntrusted and respected across the nation and around the world.\n  Vermont maple syrup producers comply with stringent standards so that \nsyrup lovers around the world are not disappointed. They have to be \nconstantly vigilant against counterfeiters who use the Vermont label to \nget a free ride on the reputation for excellence syrup from my State \nenjoys.\n  Burton Snowboards of Burlington faces the same problem. This company \nis the world leader in making snowboard equipment, but loses an \nestimated $1 million annually to copycat boots made in Korea.\n  The IBM facility in Essex Junction makes 16 and 64 megabyte memory \nchips, known as DRAM [dynamic random access memory chips]. These memory \nchips, which can be used in medical equipment and computers, are \nlikewise the subject of counterfeiting.\n  This bill takes important steps to address the problem of \ncounterfeiting in several ways. It seeks to expand our existing \nracketeering law to cover crimes involving counterfeiting and copyright \ninfringement and to give our law enforcement officers additional, \nneeded authority to seize counterfeit merchandise and impose fines on \ncounterfeiters. As a former prosecutor, I know that penalties and \npunishment can deter crime and this bill moves in the right direction.\n  We must make our laws more effective in combatting counterfeiting \ncrimes here at home and also confront the international nature of the \nproblem. Copycat goods with the labels of legitimate, American \ncompanies are manufactured, distributed and sold in foreign cities \naround the globe. We should insist that our trading partners take \naction against all kinds of intellectual property violations: Whether \ncounterfeiting or copyright piracy, it amounts to theft and fraud on \nthe consuming public. We cannot tolerate our trading partners and \ninternational allies acting as safe havens for pirates.\n  Trademark counterfeiting is not a joke. It costs in jobs, tax \nrevenue, markets, and credibility. Many products being counterfeited \ncan lead to health and safety hazards and even cost lives.\n  I look forward to our proceeding with prompt hearing on this \nimportant measure and to its early consideration and passage.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/10/senate-section/article/S12209-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               THE AMERICAN FAMILY TAX RELIEF ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of \nthe American Family Tax Relief Act of 1995.\n  The American Family Tax Relief Act would provide tax cuts where they \nare needed most--to families with dependent children. These families \nhave seen their Federal tax burden skyrocket over the years--from 3% of \ntheir income in 1948 to well over 20 percent today.\n  The current tax law is designed to counter a rising tax burden on \nfamilies with automatic increases in the personal exemption to account \nfor inflation. These inflation adjustments have not been enough, \nthough, to counter the growing tax burden on families.\n  The American Family Tax Relief Act addresses this concern by \nproviding a $500 tax credit for each dependent child up to age 18. The \nact will provide substantial and valuable benefits to thousands of \nfamilies with children in each State. There are an average of 117,000 \nchildren in each congressional district whose families would be \neligible for a $500 family tax credit under this bill. That is an \naverage tax benefit of $59 million for each congressional district.\n  Of course, the benefits to each State are substantially larger. In \nKansas alone, there are over 650,000 eligible children whose families \nwould receive more than $325 million in family tax credits each year \nunder this bill.\n  Enacting pro-family tax relief, together with balancing the Federal \nbudget, are critical to the well-being of the family and the country. \nOne of the most important things we can do for our children is to stop \nmortgaging their future--and balancing the budget will do just that. We \nwill cease deficit spending and shrink the size of the government, so \nthe tax burden on Americans can be reduced.\n  When we pass budget reconciliation legislation this year, we will \nsubstantially reduce the tax burden on families. We will provide tax \ncredits for families with children, tax credits to defray the costs to \nadopt a child, and other pro-family measures to increase the amount of \nafter-tax dollars in the pockets of American families.\n  The introduction of the American Family Tax Relief Act of 1995 is an \nimportant step forward toward reducing the tax burden on American \nfamilies. I urge my colleagues to join in cosponsoring this bill to \nshow their support for children and family. And I thank the groups that \nare promoting this effort, including Concerned Women For America, \nChristian Coalition, Eagle Forum, Family Research Council, and \nTraditional Values Coalition.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/10/senate-section/article/S12210-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12210-S12211]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n  U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY EXTERNAL RESEARCH GRANTS PROGRAM RELATED TO \n                   EARTHQUAKE HAZARDS AND MITIGATION\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. As every Member of this body knows, earthquakes represent \na severe threat and devastating reality to my State of California. \nCalifornia is by no means alone in facing this danger. The U.S. \nGeological Survey has identified 41 States and U.S. territories in the \nmoderate, high or very high categories of seismic risk. While \nearthquakes can not be prevented, there are important steps that we can \ntake to minimize the damage caused by these disasters and to improve \nour ability to respond to them. Through the multi-agency National \nEarthquake Hazards Reduction Program [NEHRP], several Federal agencies \nare involved in precisely such efforts.\n  The Interior appropriations bill provides the funding for one of the \nagencies engaged in this work, the U.S. Geological Survey [USGS]. \nUnfortunately, as passed by the Senate Appropriations Committee, the \nbill sends a conflicting message with regard to one vitally important \naspect of the USGS contribution to earthquake hazard reduction--\nuniversity earthquake research. In fiscal year 1995, USGS provided $8 \nmillion in funding for external grants related to earthquake hazards \nand mitigation. The university program provides the knowledge base on \nwhich the broader NEHRP program rests. It plays a critical role in \namplifying USGS resources and manpower by leveraging additional funds \nfrom States, universities and foundations. It also provides USGS with \naccess to the leading researchers and state-of-the-art facilities and \nequipment in which to conduct earthquake research.\n  Unfortunately, as I have already noted, the report accompanying the \nSenate version of this legislation takes two conflicting directions \nwith regard to university funded research. While the committee notes \nthe unique role that university research plays in the NEHRP program, it \nalso specifically cuts $4,000,000 from the funding available for this \npurpose--a 50-percent reduction. I should note that this is an \nimprovement from the House bill, which eliminated such university \nresearch altogether.\n  Mr. President, I would like to ask my distinguished colleague, \nSenator Gorton, who is chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee on \nInterior and Related Agencies, whether he would be willing to answer a \nquestion regarding the report language on this issue?\n  Mr. GORTON. I would be pleased to respond to the Senator's question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Committee which you chair has clearly recognized the \ntremendously valuable contribution that university earthquake research \nmakes to the NEHRP program. I would therefore ask my colleague from \nWashington whether it would not be more \n\n[[Page S 12211]]\nreasonable to direct the USGS to distribute a cut in funding across its \nentire program rather than specifically from the university earthquake \nresearch component?\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank my colleague from California for bringing this \nissue to my attention. I would support spreading the $4 million cut \ncurrently called for in earthquake research grants to universities \nacross the entire USGS Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator for his willingness to address this \nimportant issue. I am hopeful that the bill that emerges from \nconference will contain the smallest possible cut in the USGS \nEarthquake Hazards Reduction Program and that funding reductions will \nnot target university research.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/10/senate-section/article/S12210-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12211]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR. JOHN M. LONG\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to pay tribute today to an \noutstanding leader in the musical field--Dr. John M. Long. Dr. Long, \ndirector of bands at Troy State University in Troy Alabama for 30 \nyears, is one of the most distinguished and influential figures in the \nhistory of this university. The school will be honoring him on \nSaturday, October 28, at its homecoming football game against the \nUniversity of Alabama at Birmingham with a celebration entitled ``All \nThat Jazz: a Salute to Dr. John M. Long.'' In reflecting upon just a \nfew of the highlights of his illustrious career, one can easily see why \nhe is so appreciated by those who know him best and why he is so \ndeserving of this special honor.\n  Dr. John Long is a nationally known guest conductor, clinician, and \nadjudicator who has served throughout North America and Europe. In \n1969, he was named by School Musician magazine as one of the top ten \noutstanding band directors in the United States and Canada. He is past \nstate chairman of the Alabama School Band Directors Association and in \n1977, became the first active bandmaster elected to the Alabama \nBandmasters' Hall of Fame. In 1972, he was presented the Citation of \nExcellence by the National Band Association. He is a past president of \nthe prestigious American Bandmasters Association.\n  Dr. Long's service to Troy State University has extended far beyond \nits music program. He is dean of the School of Fine Arts and for 20 \nyears was dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. In addition to \ncurrently serving as the director of bands, he is a distinguished \nprofessor of music.\n  John Long was born in Guntersville, Alabama on December 28, 1925. He \nreceived his bachelor's degree from Jacksonville State University in \nJacksonville, Alabama and his master's from the University of Alabama. \nJacksonville State awarded him an honorary doctor of laws degree.\n  Today, over 200 former students of Dr. Long's are active high school \nband directors or college music educators throughout the nation. One of \nhis former students, Colonel John R. Bourgeois, is currently the \ndirector of the well-known United States Marine Corps Band based here \nin Washington.\n  I am pleased to commend and congratulate Dr. John Long on his many \nyears of service to his community, state, and nation. William \nShakespeare wrote in ``The Merchant of Venice'':\n\n     The man that hath no music in himself,\n     Nor is not mov'd with concord of sweet sounds,\n     Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils;\n     The motions of his spirit are dull as night,\n     And his affections dark as Erebus:\n\nI join his many friends in saying ``thanks'' to Dr. Long for all the \nsweet sounds with which he has filled our lives and brightened our \nspirits.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/10/senate-section/article/S12211-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12211]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO ROBERT V. SELTZER\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Robert \nV. Seltzer, my legislative director, who is leaving the Senate after \nmany years of distinguished service.\n  Mr. President, there are few people more knowledgeable about the \nSenate, or more committed to this great institution, than Bob Seltzer. \nI have benefitted greatly from his special expertise and commitment, \nand his contributions to my office will be felt for many years to come.\n  Bob's roots in the United States Senate are deep and long-lasting. He \ncame to the Senate in 1979 to work with Senator Carl Levin after \nserving as his campaign manager and after leaving his post of ten years \nas professor of Rhetoric at Detroit University. Bob served as Senator \nLevin's Chief of Staff and helped to lay the groundwork for many \nlegislative accomplishments by my friend from Michigan.\n  After a brief period off the Hill, Bob returned to the Senate to \nserve as legislative director to former Senator Brock Adams. When \nSenator Kohl was elected to his Senate seat in 1989, he wisely chose \nBob to head up his legislative department as his legislative director. \nIn 1993, Bob came to work for me and for the people of the State in \nwhich he was born, New Jersey.\n  Mr. President, Bob has provided invaluable service to me, to the \npeople of New Jersey, and to the Senate. He has an impressive work \nethic, and his commitment to public service is unmatched.\n  Along with his hard work and dedication, Bob has a great sense of \nhumor and an ability to lift the spirits and morale of others. His \ndaily summaries of floor action almost invariably provided our staffers \nwith a quick chuckle. Bob's humor helped the staff tolerate numerous \nlate night sessions and the inevitable chaos of life in the Senate. His \nquick wit and lighthearted nature will be missed by this Senator, his \ncoworkers and his colleagues around the Hill.\n  Mr. President, Bob's departure from the Senate will allow him more \ntime to pursue his love of literature and music, while permitting him \nto spend more time with his wife, Helen. I am sure that as he pursues \nnew horizons beyond the Senate, he will continue to excel, just as he \nhas in my office.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I want to express my sincere thanks to \nBob for his contribution to my office and to the Senate. I know my \ncolleagues who know him will join me in wishing him the best of luck in \nall of his future endeavors.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/10/senate-section/article/S12211-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12211-S12212]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n   FISCAL YEAR 1996 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Senate Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation, I wish to discuss several \nprovisions included in the Fiscal Year 1995 Department of \nTransportation Appropriations bill of significant importance to the \nCommittee. A number of the authorizing provisions in this bill are \nwithin the jurisdiction of our Committee which is the proper forum for \ntheir consideration.\n  Mr. President, I raised jurisdictional concerns with the Chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee last week prior to the Transportation \nSubcommittee's markup of this legislation. I understand other members \nof my Committee also raised similar concerns and objections. In fact, \nthe very afternoon this legislation was marked up by the Subcommittee, \nthe Commerce Committee's Aviation Subcommittee held a three and one-\nhalf hour hearing on the issue of reform of the Federal Aviation \nAdministration (FAA) and the Air Traffic Control (ATC) System.\n  Several of the authorizing provisions in H.R. 2002 which I objected \nto related to FAA and ATC reform. Other objectional provisions related \nto matters such as airport funding which my Committee is also \nconsidering. As shown by the lengthy debate relating to the Roth \namendment to strike several provisions in the legislation dealing with \nFAA procurement and personnel reform, these are very complex issues \nwhich require the careful and thoughtful consideration that my \nCommittee has been undertaking.\n  The importance of the FAA and ATC reform debate is very significant. \nThe safety of the air traveling public is at stake. Also, the \nefficiency of our air transportation system, which is the envy of the \nworld, should not be put at risk by hasty actions of the Congress. For \nthese reasons, the steady and careful pace which my Committee has taken \nin developing legislative solutions to adequately address these \nproblems is appropriate.\n  The Subcommittee Chairman on Aviation, Senator McCain, and other \nmembers of the committee plan to introduce comprehensive reform \nlegislation to safeguard the traveling public \n\n[[Page S 12212]]\nand improve the FAA and its activities. In fact, Senator McCain worked \nnonstop to try to bring a bill for the Committee's consideration during \nour mark up session of today, August 10. Unfortunately, negotiations \nwith the Administration and the FAA to develop bipartisan legislation \nwhich the Administration could endorse was not achievable prior to \ntoday's session. However, our Committee continues to work diligently \nwith Administration officials to craft this legislation.\n  Therefore, I am pleased the managers of the bill agreed to postpone \nthe effective date on the FAA procurement and personnel reforms \nincluded in the bill until April 1, 1996. This will give the Senate \nnecessary time to achieve a consensus on how best to proceed in this \nmost important area.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to clarify for the record another \nmatter regarding action by the Commerce Committee that was brought up \nduring the Senate's consideration on this bill.\n  During the short debate earlier today regarding my amendment to fund \nthe Local Rail Freight Assistance (LRFA) program and the Section 511 \nloan guarantee program, the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee \nargued against my amendment, opposing it because the Commerce Committee \nhas not reported a bill to the Senate to authorize funding for LRFA. I \nwant to explain to my colleagues why this bill, which we approved on \nJuly 20th, has not been filed since. I did not have an opportunity to \nrebut the opposition prior to the vote.\n  On July 20th, the Commerce Committee approved a measure to \nreauthorize Amtrak and to permanently authorize LRFA. This approved \nbill has been available to the public since the Committee's approval. \nThe Committee's authorization levels for Amtrak and LRFA have been \nreadily available. To date, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has \nnot provided a budget estimate to our Committee which must be included \nin the report. It is my understanding CBO has been inundated with \nscoring requests because of the on-going work on the appropriations \nbills.\n  Again, the Committee approved the measure three weeks ago today. The \nreport is ready to go as soon as we receive this information from CBO.\n  I should reiterate that the LRFA reauthorization included in a bill \nthat also reauthorizes Amtrak. A great deal of funding was provided for \nAmtrak in this appropriations bill, even though the bill has not been \nreported. Further, the 511 program is permanently authorized, but no \nfunding was allocated.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/10/senate-section/article/S12211-3", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12212-S12213]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 2390\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the Senator \nfrom New Mexico in offering this amendment. The amendment itself is \nsimple: it would appropriate the funds that the Pentagon will need to \ncover the costs of ongoing operations in Iraq, Bosnia, and Guantanamo \nfor fiscal year 1996.\n  This amendment is offered to deal fiscally responsibly with existing \ncommitments and to address a vital readiness issue.\n  Now some may be surprised by the omission of such an appropriation in \nthis bill. It is, after all, a bill to appropriate funds for fiscal \nyear 1996 for military activities of the Department of Defense.\n  The operations in Iraq, Bosnia, and Guantanamo are certainly \n``military activities.'' They are activities which we know will be \nconducted in fiscal year 1996. Yet the bill before us does not provide \nfunding for those operations.\n  There is, unfortunately, a precedent for such omissions. For several \nyears, the Congress and Presidents from both parties have gotten into \nthe habit of paying for these continuing military operations by going \noutside the regular budget process. Although the Department of Defense \nknew that it would have to pay the bills for these existing operations, \nit did not budget for them as I believe it should. Consequently, the \nCongress did not step up to the problem either. We did not include \nfunding for them in our authorization and appropriations bills. \nInstead, typically, a few months after the fiscal year began, \nadministrations would come to Congress and ask for supplemental funding \nfor the operations. And Congress would provide the funds.\n  In the past, that was an easier decision to make. Supplemental \nspending was often added to the deficit. But the rules have changed, \nMr. President. Supplemental requests, we have decided, ought not just \nbe added to the tab. They have to be offset by reductions elsewhere. \nSimply put, they have to be paid for.\n  So, within the context of the Budget Resolution and the 602(b) \nallocations which flow from it, the Pentagon must pay for these ongoing \noperations in Iraq, Bosnia, and Guantanamo. They can plan to pay for it \nnow, in an orderly fashion in this bill. Or it will be paid for later, \nby reprogramming or rescinding DOD funds.\n  Senator Bingaman and I are proposing that it makes better fiscal and \nmilitary sense to plan to pay for it now.\n  Delaying a decision will be, as it has been in the past, confusing, \npainful and costly.\n  Identifying lower priority programs to eliminate in the middle of the \nyear as an alternative to deficit spending has been contentious, time \nconsuming, and problematic.\n  The result is that the Congress and the administration have wrung \ntheir hands and quibbled over which ``low priority'' programs can be \nsacrificed at that time to pay these bills. The Department of Defense \nhas been forced, at times, to dip into precious readiness accounts. As \na result, the readiness of our troops has been compromised.\n  We can and should do better.\n  This year, the Defense Department is asking the Congress to do \nbetter. It is asking us to provide funding to cover the costs of these \nongoing operations as part of the fiscal year 1996 Department of \nDefense Authorization bill and the fiscal year 1996 DOD Appropriations \nbill.\n  Rather than deferring a decision about how to pay bills we already \nknow will come due later in the year, the Pentagon is asking us to be \nfiscally responsible and include them in the fiscal year 1996 budget \nnow. We should do that. And this amendment will do it.\n  It is true, Mr. President, that the Administration did not request \nthis funding in its official budget request for fiscal year 1996. \nHowever, before the Senate Armed Services Committee considered the \nAuthorization bill for fiscal year 1996 and before the Senate \nAppropriations Subcommittee acted, Secretary Perry wrote a letter to \nthe Chairman asking the Committee to provide funding for these \noperations if the defense budget was increased above the President's \nrequest.\n  Secretary Perry's letter is clear. Regarding ongoing operations in \nBosnia, Iraq, and on Guantanamo, it says ``I suggest that you fund \nthese contingencies first if you decide to increase the DOD budget this \nyear.''\n  In a subsequent letter, Secretary Perry said ``the importance of \navoiding any negative effect on readiness of U.S. forces argues for \nfunding them earlier than can be accomplished if we wait for \nsupplemental funding next year.'' I ask unanimous consent that copies \nof Secretary Perry's letters be included in the Record.\n  To its credit, Mr. President, the Senate Armed Services Committee did \nauthorize $125 million for these ongoing operations as part of the $7 \nbillion it added to the President's budget for defense. But that won't \ndo the trick. The Pentagon estimates that it will need $1.2 billion to \ncover the cost of ongoing operations in fiscal year 1996. The \nappropriations bill provides nothing for the ongoing operations, \nalthough it increases defense spending by $6.4 billion above the \nPresident's budget request.\n  We will still have more than a billion dollars worth of bills to pay \nlater--bills which will need to be paid then, as we suggest they should \nbe paid now, by finding other defense offsets.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment in the \nname of fiscal responsibility. We know now that we have more than a \nbillion dollars worth of bills to pay this year for ongoing operations \nand we should include those funds in the fiscal year 1996 budget.\n  In addition to being fiscally irresponsible, deferring a decision \nabout how to pay these bills until later in the year runs the risk of \nputting the readiness of our troops in danger. Our service men and \nwomen, as well as the American people, expect and deserve better. \n\n[[Page S 12213]]\n\n  For their sake, we should fix our priorities now--as this amendment \nattempts to do--and include funding for contingency operations in the \nfiscal year 1996 budget now.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/10/senate-section/article/S12212-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12213]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/10/senate-section/article/S12213-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12213]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/10/senate-section/article/S12213-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12213]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. D'AMATO, from the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \n     Urban Affairs, without amendment:\n       S. 1147.

A bill to reform and enhance the management of the National \nPark System, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n               the national park service enhancement act\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the National \nPark Service Enhancement Act.\n  This legislation, when enacted, will revamp the National Park \nConcession Policy Act by creating a true and equal private/public \npartnership while offering more competition, less regulation, \nconsistent inter- and intra-agency policies and at the same time \nincrease returns to the Federal Government.\n  This legislation also addresses fee increases to our national parks, \nneeded improvements to land management employee housing, and the \nestablishment of strict criteria by which areas are considered for \nnational park status.\n  Finally, the bill sets forth a simplified and cost-saving mechanism \nby which the Federal Government determines the fee schedules for ski \noperators who use portions of lands under the jurisdiction of the \nNational Forest System.\n  The 1916 Organic Act creating the National Park Service gave the \nagency a dual mission--to care for the Nation's parks in such a way as \nto preserve the resources for future generations while at the same time \nproviding for public use and enjoyment of the same resources. I must \nsay, Mr. President, that after hearing the General Accounting Office \nreport on the current state of the National Park System, the Service \nneeds major assistance in meeting their legislative mandate and they \nneed to improve their accountability as well. I offer the National Park \nService Enhancement Act as a way to help the National Park Service to: \nFirst, reap the benefits of viable partnerships with the private \n\n[[Page S 12216]]\nsector; second, become more user-friendly; and third, begin the long \nroad back to being the flagship conservation system that was once the \nenvy of the world.\n  Mr. President, on March 7 of this year, the General Accounting Office \ntestified at a hearing before the Subcommittee on Parks, Historic \nPreservation and Recreation that the National Park System is in failing \nhealth. The addition of numerous new areas to the System, increased \nvisitation, and unfunded mandates have stretched the financial \nresources of the Service so far that basic visitor services are being \ncut, infrastructure maintenance is deferred, and accountability is \nsorely lacking.\n  In addition, the National Park Service has other problems it cannot \nsolve under existing law. Many park employees live in Government \nhousing that most of us, even those with Spartan tastes, would find \nunacceptable as decent living quarters. Yet these employees are afraid \nthat if their housing is brought up to standard, their rent will go \nbeyond the range of their ability to pay. Private companies acting as \npartners with the National Park Service and other land management \nagencies to provide needed accommodations, facilities and services to \npark visitors are subject to ridiculous regulation and redtape under \nexisting laws. With this legislation, I propose to correct this \nproblem. Simply put, if we can't afford to take care of the caretakers, \nhow can we hope to take care of the resources under their charge?\n  The current park admission and special use fee systems need revamping \nso that fees are fair for all types of visitors, whether they bring \ntheir own car into the parks or arrive by commercial bus.\n  Mr. President, I would like to give a brief outline of provisions of \nthe National Park Service Enhancement Act, which I believe will solve \nthe problems I just described.\n  Title I of the bill reforms National Park Service concessions policy. \nIt provides clear definitions of concessioners and commercial use \ncontractors and establishes similar procedures for awarding and \nmanaging contracts with both types of businesses. An example of how \nridiculous the existing system is comes from my home State of Alaska. \nAt Glacier Bay National Park, commercial cruise ships that come into \nthe bay between June and August operate under 100-page concession \ncontracts; the rest of the year they operate under 2-page commercial \nuse licenses. Two sets of paperwork for one kind of service. The \nproblem is further exacerbated from region to region and from park to \npark. There is no consistency for the issuance of a simple permit. This \nlegislation, when enacted, provides uniformity and user-friendly \nsystems.\n  In addition, this title will relieve the National Park Service of \nhaving to approve a concessioner's rates and charges for every single \nsales item and service where nearby competition will allow market \nforces to set a reasonable price. This alone should free National Park \nService concessions specialists from spending weeks deciding what a hot \ndog should cost at Padre Island National Seashore, only to reach a \ndetermination that there is no hot dog to compare it to. My bill, when \nenacted, will correct this sort of overregulation.\n  Other key provisions in title I include possessory interest, probably \nthe most controversial\n aspect of concessions reform. Other legislation introduced would do \naway with possessory interest. As a former banker, I have to wonder \nwhat financial institution is going to loan funds to a business for \nreal estate improvements which are not expected to hold their value? \nWhat sense does it make to amortize possessory interest so that all \nassets constructed or improved by concessioners would eventually be \nowned by the Government? The National Park Service, by its own \nadmission, has billions of dollars in infrastructure maintenance \nbacklog. Why would we want to add to the backlog when everyone on this \nfloor knows the National Park Service cannot afford to maintain what it \nalready has?\n\n  On the issue of competition, discussion has focused on the current \npreferential right of renewal. I feel very strongly that it is in the \nbest interest of both the National Park Service and the visiting public \nto maintain continuity where existing concessioners have a track record \nof good service. My bill creates incentive for high quality service by \nawarding good concessioners with a credit of extra points to apply \ntoward the total points that the Secretary may award proposals \nsubmitted by bidders. There is no reason to have turnover for the sake \nof turnover--continuation of high quality service only makes sense, and \nit is good business.\n  The combination of provisions in title I of this bill should result \nin higher franchise fees offered by bidders because they know that \ntheir investment in improvements will not be depreciated to zero for \nnon-tax purposes, and that they will have incentive to provide superior \nservices to the public. Commercial use contractors will be less subject \nto inconsistent application of Park Service policy and enjoy the \nbenefits of a binding contract, just as concessioners do.\n  These provisions add up to good business sense for the private \nsector, the public, and the National Park Service. Ultimately, they \nwill add up to good sense for the U.S. Forest Service, the Bureau of \nLand Management, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as they are \ndirected to adopt consistent regulations for substantially similar \ncommercial and non-recreational uses on lands within their \njurisdiction.\n  Title II amends the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act sections \nrelating to admission, recreation, and special use fees. It is only \nrealistic that actual park users shoulder more responsibility for \nmaintaining the national parks and visitor services provided in the \nparks than those who are not users. This bill raises fees to a \nreasonable level for the Golden Eagle Passport, the annual park pass, \nand establishes a uniform per-visit fee at parks that charge admission \nfees.\n  Commercial tour use fees will be set solely according to vehicle \ncapacity, without the addition of a per person charge. This flat fee \nrate relieves the ranger at the gate to Yosemite National Park from \nholding up a commercial motor coach for 15 minutes in order to see \nwhich riders have Golden Age, Access or Eagle Passports exempting them \nfrom additional entrance fees. Multipassenger commerical vehicles will \nno longer be penalized for what should be recognized as an \nenvironmentally sound practice--providing a national park experience to \nmany people at one time while using only a single vehicle. The results \nare less pollution and less congestion in our busier parks.\n  Reforming National Park Service fee programs will not make the agency \nself-supporting. That is not the intent of my legislation. However, \ncurrent admission fees are below what anyone would reasonably expect. \nFees should be more uniformly applied across the System and should \ncontribute to offset diminished appropriations. To that end this bill \nremoves many of the prohibitions on collecting admission fees at \ncertain types of National Park System units. If we are to restore the \nSystem, everyone must contribute. Exceptions must be extremely limited \nor eliminated. What is fair is fair for everyone.\n  Title III of the National Park Service Enhancement Act relates to ski \narea permits on national forest lands. It would establish a ski area \npermit fee that returns fair value to the United States. The fee \nformula outlined in the bill is simple, equitable and consistent, and \nwill simplify the administrative burdens on both the ski area \npermittees and the Forest Service personnel who administer the permits.\n  Title IV will make it much more difficult to add units to the \nNational Park System without careful consideration. The National Park \nSystem should be a collection of the finest and most fitting examples \nof our national heritage, maintained accordingly. Dilution of the \nSystem by less than suitable sites threatens to bring the National Park \nSystem down to the lowest common denominator.\n  The National Park Service will develop a comprehensive plan to guide \nthe direction of the National Park System into the next century. The \nplan will include clarification of the Park Service role and mission in \npreserving our national heritage in concert with other such efforts by \nFederal, State, and local entities. New criteria for inclusion of areas \nin the System will be \n\n[[Page S 12217]]\ndeveloped. Topics and themes not represented in the System will be \nidentified and a priority list for representation developed.\n  I mentioned the need for housing reform earlier. Title V of the bill \nwill give the Secretaries of Interior and Agriculture greater authority \nto provide housing for their employees, both within and outside of \nnational park boundaries.\n  For employees at Dry Tortugas National Park, who live for 8 days at a \ntime on a tiny island, the bill will enable the National Park Service \nto rent housing on the Florida mainland for them to use when they come \noff the island for their days off. In the past, rangers and other \nemployees were forced to rent motel rooms at tourist season rates or \nsleep in their cars just to be able to wash their clothes and buy \ngroceries before going back out to their remote duty stations.\n  Agencies will be able to work with the private sector to construct, \ndevelop, rehabilitate, manage, and lease housing for their employees. \nThis proposal has the potential to remove huge financial and \nadministrative burdens from those agencies. In addition, employees will \nbe assured that their rent, as paid to their Government landlords, will \nnot be more than a reasonable percentage of their pay.\n  Title VI establishes a system for disposition of receipts collected \nby the National Park Service as admission, recreation, special use, and \nfranchise fees. As allowed now, parks collecting admission and \nrecreation fees may retain amounts equal to their direct costs of \ncollecting such fees to cover those costs. Receipts equal to those \ncurrently going into the general Treasury will continue to be deposited \nthere, as well as half the additional receipts. The other 50 percent of \nadditional receipts will go into a newly established National Park \nService account in the Treasury, known as the park improvement fund.\n  Moneys in the park improvement fund will go back to the national \nparks to take care of operational and project needs. Seventy-five \npercent of fund receipts collected at a specific park as part of a \nparticular fee program will go back to that park. The remaining 25 \npercent will be distributed among other parks that may not collect that \ntype of fee. To ensure accountability, parks must submit requests for \nspending their returned funds for approval by the Secretary of the \nInterior, who in turn forwards them to Congress for review.\n  The final title of the bill renews the recently expired authority for \nthe National Park System Advisory Board and charges it with conducting \ntwo important studies. Within a year of enactment of this legislation, \nthe advisory board, working in consultation with the National Park \nService, must review most units of the National Park System to \ndetermine whether greater or equal resource protection and visitor use \ncould be achieved through alternative management of those areas. \nAdditionally, as part of this study, the advisory board will use the \norganic legislation of the National Park Service and of its units to \ndevelop criteria to guide the Congress and the Secretary of Interior in \nestablishing and supporting new additions to the National Park System. \nThe second task of the advisory board is to review existing visitor \nservices at each unit of the National Park System for adequacy and to \nidentify specific park needs for new or additional services.\n  Mr. President, I offer this legislation as a way to help the National \nPark Service, other land management agencies, and even Congress to do \nthe right thing. The National Park System is strained to the breaking \npoint by poorly conceived additions. We must reexamine the definition \nof a worthy unit and ensure that any additions to the System meet the \nnew definition.\n  We must assist the National Park Service and other agencies in \nestablishing businesslike, and mutually beneficial relationships with \npartners in the private sector, including park concessioners and others \nwho provide needed commerical services on public lands. Often these \nagencies operate with a rather one-sided view of what partnership \nmeans. A partnership is a two-way street--this legislation takes us \ndown that road.\n  Mr. President, the National Park Service Enhancement Act is a course \ncorrection which will help the National Park Service get back on track \nin preserving and protecting our national heritage and allowing and \nencouraging opportunities for people to enjoy that heritage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na section-by-section analysis appear in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                S. 1144\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Such appraisal \n     must be performed by an appraiser with significant \n     experience in the appraisal of assets similar to those \n     valued thereunder, and be conducted and dated as of a date \n     not earlier than eighteen months before the expiration of \n     the concession contract or as of the date of taking, if \n     earlier. In determining the fair market value of any such \n     structure, fixture or improvement which is primarily used \n     for the production of income, such appraiser shall employ \n     the income approach to valuation in a manner consistent \n     with the procedures and assumptions then generally \n     employed for similar income-producing assets by appraisers \n     who are members of the American Institute of Real Estate \n     Appraisers or the Society of Real Estate Appraisers: \n     Provided, That such appraisal shall assume a future \n     franchise fee equal to the average annual franchise fee \n     payable by the concessioner during the term of such \n     concessioner's existing contract. With respect to any \n     structure, fixture or improvement which is not primarily \n     used for the production of income, the fair market value \n     shall be equal to the reconstruction cost of such \n     structure, fixture, or improvement, less depreciation \n     evidenced by its condition and prospective serviceability \n     in comparison with a new unit of like kind. Any \n     structures, fixtures, or improvements acquired or \n     constructed after the date of such appraisal in which the \n     concessioner holds an investment interest shall be deemed \n     to have sound values as of the date of such acquisition or \n     construction equal to the concessioner's original cost. \n     The amount to be paid to the concessioner for the \n     concessioner's investment interest on the date of taking \n     by the United States or at the expiration of the contract \n     shall equal the appraised sound value or the \n     concessioner's original cost for newly-constructed or \n     acquired structures, fixtures or improvements, as \n     applicable, increased by the percentage increase in the \n     Consumer Price Index--All Urban Consumers reported by the \n     United States Department of Labor from the month including \n     the date of such appraisal (or the date of construction or \n     acquisition of structures, fixtures or improvements \n     acquired or constructed after the date of such appraisal) \n     to and including the month prior to the date of taking by \n     the United States or expiration of the contract. If the \n     Secretary disagrees with the appraisal submitted by the \n     concessioner, he may present the concessioner with an \n     independent appraisal performed by an appraiser with \n     significant experience in the appraisal of assets similar \n     to those valued thereunder, dated as of the same date as \n     the concessioner's appraisal and prepared in a manner \n     consistent with the manner of preparation of the \n     concessioner's appraisal, as specified above, not less \n     than three months after receipt of the concessioner's \n     appraisal. If the concessioner and the Secretary are \n     unable to agree on the sound value of the concessioner's \n     possessory interest, the Secretary and the concessioner \n     may agree to direct the Secretary's appraiser and the \n     concessioner's appraiser to choose a third appraiser, who \n     shall recommend either the concessioner's appraisal or the \n     Secretary's appraisal as the more accurate appraisal of \n     such sound value to the Secretary. The concessioner shall \n     pay the cost of the concessioner's appraiser and the \n     United States shall pay the cost of the Secretary's \n     appraiser, if any. If a third appraiser is selected as \n     provided above, the cost of such appraiser shall be shared \n     equally by the concessioner and the United States.''.\n       (j) Technical Amendments.--The 1965 Act (P.L. 89-249 (79 \n     Stat. 969); 16 U.S.C. 20) is amended by renumbering existing \n     sections 7 through 9 as sections 11 through 13 accordingly.\n       (k) Competitive Selection Process, Contracts, and \n     Performance Evaluation.--The 1965 Act (P.L. 89-249 (79 Stat. \n     969); 16 U.S.C. 20) is amended by adding a new section 7, 8, \n     9, and 10 as follows:\n       ``Sec. 7. (a) Except as provided in subsections (b) and \n     (c), and consistent with the provisions of subsection (h), \n     any contract entered in to pursuant to the National Park \n     Service Enhancement Act shall be awarded to the person, \n     corporation or other entity submitting the best proposal as \n     determined by the Secretary, through a competitive selection \n     process. Within 180 days after the date of enactment of the \n     National Park Service Enhancement Act, the Secretary shall \n     promulgate appropriate regulations establishing such process. \n     The regulations shall include provisions for establishing a \n     method or procedure for the resolution of disputes between \n     the Secretary and a concessioner or commercial use contractor \n     in those instances where the Secretary has been unable to \n     meet conditions or requirements or provide such services, if \n     any, as set forth in a prospectus as described below.\n       ``Sec. 7. (b) The provisions in this Act shall be subject \n     to any limitation or special provision contained in the \n     Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. \n     3101 et seq.). Subject to the provisions of section 1307 of \n     the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (16 \n     U.S.C. 3197), a priority shall be given to commercial use \n     contractors operating cruise ships (defined as motor vessels \n     at or over 6,000 gross tonnage [International Convention \n     System], providing overnight accommodations for all \n     passengers, and operating with itineraries of 3 or more days) \n     who provide tours in Glacier Bay national park which \n     originate in Southeast Alaska.\n       ``(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a), the \n     Secretary may award on a noncompetitive basis: (1) a \n     temporary contract for a term of not more than two years if \n     the Secretary determines such an award to be necessary in \n     order to avoid interruption of services to the public at a \n     park or (2) a contract which the Secretary estimates will \n     result in annual gross receipts of no more than $2,000,000, \n     if the Secretary determines that continuity and quality of \n     service, administrative savings, or the lack of potential \n     bidders do not require the solicitation of proposals. Prior \n     to making a determination to award a temporary contract, the \n     Secretary shall take all reasonable and appropriate steps to \n     consider alternative actions to avoid interruption of \n     services.\n       ``(d) Prior to making a solicitation for a contract, other \n     than a contract subject to the provisions of subsection (c) \n     of this section, the Secretary shall prepare a prospectus for \n     such solicitation, shall publish a notice of its availability \n     at least once in such local or national newspapers or trade \n     publications as the Secretary determines appropriate, and \n     shall make such prospectus available upon request to all \n     interested parties. The prospectus shall include, but need \n     not be limited to, the following information: the \n\n[[Page S 12219]]\n     suggested minimum requirements for such contract, including the minimum \n     suggested fee, which shall provide the selected bidder with a \n     reasonable opportunity to realize a profit on the selected \n     bidder's operation under the contract; the terms and \n     conditions of the existing contract awarded for such park, if \n     any, including all fees and other forms of compensation \n     provided to the United States by the concessioner or \n     commercial use contractor; other authorized facilities or \n     services which may be included in the proposal; facilities \n     and services to be provided by the Secretary to the \n     concessioner or commercial use contractor, if any, including \n     but not limited to, public access, utilities, and buildings; \n     minimum public services to be offered within a park by the \n     Secretary, including but not limited to, interpretive \n     programs, campsites, and visitor centers; and such other \n     information related to the concession operation or commercial \n     use activity available to the Secretary which is not \n     privileged or otherwise exempt from disclosure under Federal \n     law, as the Secretary determines is necessary to allow for \n     the submission of competitive proposals.\n       ``(e) The Secretary may reject any proposal, \n     notwithstanding the amount of fees offered, even if such \n     proposal meets the minimum requirements established by the \n     Secretary, if he determines that the person, corporation, or \n     entity making such proposal is not qualified, or is likely to \n     provide unsatisfactory services, or that the proposal is not \n     sufficiently responsive to the objectives of protecting and \n     preserving park resources and of providing necessary and \n     appropriate facilities or services to the public at \n     reasonable rates. The Secretary may consider a proposal made \n     by a bidder which fails to meet the suggested minimum \n     requirements included in the prospectus, but shall not award \n     a contract to such a bidder if one or more other proposals \n     have met such minimum requirements unless all such other \n     proposals are rejected.

In order to receive this \n     renewal incentive, the concessioner or commercial use \n     contractor must have received a performance rating of \n     ``good'' pursuant to section 9(a) for at least fifty percent \n     of the years of the contract term and must not have received \n     an unsatisfactory rating under such contract during any of \n     the five years prior to the renewal thereof. Concessioners \n     and commercial use contractors operating under temporary \n     contract, license or permit extensions granted by the \n     Secretary after expiration of their original contract, \n     license or permit term at the time of enactment of this \n     section shall retain any renewal incentive described above \n     earned under the original contract.\n       ``(i) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (h), the \n     Secretary shall grant a preferential right of renewal to a \n     commercial use contractor for a contract which primarily \n     authorizes a such contractor to provide outfitting, guide, \n     river running, or other similar services within a park, and \n     which the Secretary estimates will have annual gross revenues \n     of no more than $1,000,000: Provided; That the commercial use \n     contractor has received a performance rating of ``good'' \n     pursuant to section 9(a) for at least fifty percent of the \n     years of the contract term and must not have received an \n     unsatisfactory rating under such contract during the any of \n     the five years prior to the renewal thereof. Commercial use \n     contractors operating under temporary contract, license or \n     permit extensions granted by the Secretary after expiration \n     of their original contract, license or permit term at the \n     time of enactment of this section shall retain any \n     preferential right of renewal described above earned under \n     the original contract.\n       ``Sec. 8.

Where a concessioner or commercial use \n     contractor is required to make substantial investments in \n     structures, fixtures, or improvements in the park, the \n     Secretary shall provide for a contract term that is \n     commensurate with such investments.\n       ``(b) No contract may be transferred, assigned, sold, or \n     otherwise conveyed by a concessioner or commercial use \n     contractor without prior written notification to, and \n     approval of, the Secretary, who shall not unreasonably \n     withhold or delay such approval but shall not approve the \n     transfer, assignment, sale, or conveyance of a contract to \n     any individual, corporation or other entity if the Secretary \n     determines that: (1) such individual, corporation or entity \n     is, or is likely to be, unable to completely satisfy all of \n     the requirements, terms, and conditions of the contract or \n     (2) such transfer, assignment, sale, or conveyance is not \n     consistent with the objectives of protecting and preserving \n     park resources, providing high quality service to the public, \n     and of providing necessary and appropriate facilities or \n     services to the public at reasonable rates.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) Although ski areas occupy less than one-twentieth of \n     one percent of National Forest System lands nationwide, in \n     many rural areas of the United States, ski areas and \n     investments by ski area permittees on National Forest System \n     lands form the backbone of the local economy and a \n     preponderance of the employment base.\n       (2) Ski area operations and their attendant communities \n     provide revenues to the United States in the form of permit \n     fees, income taxes, and other revenues which are extremely \n     significant in proportion to the limited Federal acreage and \n     Forest Service administration and contractual obligations \n     required to support such operations.\n       (3) In addition to alpine skiing, many ski area permittees \n     provide multiseason facilities and enhanced access to \n     National Forest System lands, that result in greater public \n     use and enjoyment of such lands than would otherwise occur;\n       (4) Unlike many other private sector users of Federal \n     Lands, ski areas in almost all cases assume the risk to \n     finance, construct, maintain, and market all recreational \n     facilities and improvements on such lands.\n       (5) Many ski areas on National Forest System lands operate \n     in an extremely competitive environment with similar \n     facilities located on private or State lands, which requires \n     ski area permittees to maintain a high level of capital \n     investment to upgrade existing facilities and install new \n     facilities (such as lifts, trails, snowmaking and trail \n     grooming equipment, restaurants, and day care centers) to \n     serve the public.\n       (6) Despite an outward appearance of economic well-being \n     resulting from an intensive capital infrastructure, many ski \n     area operations are marginally profitable due to the \n     competition and capital investments referred to in paragraph \n     (5), weather conditions, insurance premiums, the national \n     economy, and other factors beyond the control of the ski area \n     permittee.\n       (7) Because of the contributions of ski areas to the \n     economies of the United States and the rural communities in \n     which they are located, and the enhanced use and enjoyment of \n     National Forest System lands resulting from ski areas, it is \n     in the national interest for the United States, where \n     consistent with national forest management objectives, to \n     take actions to promote the long-term economic health and \n     stability of ski areas and associated communities.\n       (8) The National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986 (U.S.C. \n     497b) has been of assistance to ski area operations on \n     National Forest System lands by providing longer term lease \n     tenure and contractual stability to ski area permittees, but \n     further adjustments and policy direction and warranted to \n     address problems related to permit fees and fee calculations \n     and conflicts with certain mineral activities.\n       (b) Purpose.--In light of the findings of subsection (a), \n     it is the purpose of this title--\n       (1) To legislate a ski area permit fee that returns fair \n     market value to the United States and at the same time--\n       (A) provides ski area permittees and the United States with \n     a simplified, consistent, predictable, and equitable fee \n     formula that is commensurate with long-term planning, \n     financing, and operational needs of ski areas; and\n       (B) simplifies bookkeeping and other administrative burdens \n     on ski area permittees and Forest Service personnel; and\n       (2) to prevent future conflicts between ski area operations \n     and mining and mineral leasing programs by withdrawing lands \n     within ski area permit boundaries from the operation of \n     mining and mineral leasing laws.\n\n     SEC. 302.

Each study under this section shall be prepared \n     with appropriate opportunity for public involvement, \n     including at least one public meeting in the vicinity of the \n     area under study, and reasonable efforts to notify \n     potentially affected landowners and State and local \n     governments. In conducting the study, the Secretary shall \n     consider whether the area under study--\n       ``(1) possesses nationally significant natural or cultural \n     resources, or outstanding recreational opportunities, and \n     that it represents one of the most important examples of a \n     particular resource type in the country; and\n       ``(2) is a suitable and feasible addition to the system; \n     and\n       ``(3) what the additional fiscal and personnel costs will \n     be if the area were added to the system.\n       ``Each study shall consider the following factors with \n     regard to the area being studied: the rarity and integrity; \n     whether similar resources are already protected in the \n     National Park System or in other Federal, state or private \n     ownership; the public use potential; the interpretive and \n     educational potential; costs associated with acquisition, \n     development and operation; the socioeconomic impacts of any \n     designation; the level of local and general public support; \n     and whether the unit is of appropriate configuration to \n     ensure long term resource protection and visitor use. Each \n     study shall also consider whether direct National Park \n     Service management or alternative protection by other \n     agencies or the private sector is appropriate for the area. \n     Each such study shall identify what alternative or \n     combination of alternatives would, in the professional \n     judgment of the Director of the National Park Service, be \n     most effective and efficient in protecting significant \n     resources and providing for public enjoyment. The letter \n     transmitting each completed study to Congress shall contain a \n     recommendation regarding the Administration's preferred \n     management option for the area and detail the fiscal and \n     personnel costs if the preferred option is federal \n     management.\n       ``(d) List of Areas.--At the beginning of each calendar \n     year, along with the annual budget submission, the Secretary \n     shall submit to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources \n     of the United States Senate and the Committee on Natural \n     Resources of the House of Representatives a list of areas \n     which have been previously studied which contain primarily \n     cultural or historical resources and a list of areas which \n     have been previously studied which contain primarily natural \n     resources in numerical order of priority for addition to the \n     National Park System.

Board \n     members shall be selected to represent various geographic \n     regions, including each of the seven administrative regions \n     of the National Park Service, and to ensure that the Board \n     contains expertise in natural or cultural resource \n     management, recreation use management, land use planning, \n     financial management, and business management. The Board \n     shall include one individual who is a locally elected \n     official representing an area adjacent to a national park \n     system unit, and one individual who owns land inside the \n     boundary of a national park system unit. The Board shall hold \n     its first meeting by no later than the date that is 30 days \n     after the date on which all members of the Advisory\n      Board who are to be appointed have been appointed. Any \n     vacancy in the Board shall not affect its powers, but \n     shall be filled in the same manner in which the original \n     appointment was made. The Board may adopt such rules as \n     may be necessary to establish its procedures and to govern \n     the manner of its operations, organization, and personnel. \n     All members of the Board shall be reimbursed for travel \n     and per diem in lieu of subsistence expenses during the \n     performance of duties of the Board while away from home or \n     their regular place of business, in accordance with \n     chapter 1 of chapter 57 of title 5, United States Code. \n     With the exception of travel and per diem as noted above, \n     a member of the Board who is otherwise an officer or \n     employee of the United States Government shall serve on \n     the Board without additional compensation.''.\n       (2) By renumbering section 3(b) as 3(f) and by striking \n     from the first sentence thereof, ``1995'' and inserting in \n     lieu thereof, ``2006''.\n       (3) By renumbering section 3(c) as 3(g).\n       (4) By adding the following new sections 3(b) through (e):\n       ``Sec. 3.

The \n     Advisory Board shall review the organic legislation, and \n     history of the National Park Service and its units and shall \n     develop criteria to guide the Congress and the Secretary in \n     the addition of new units to the National Park System. The \n     Advisory Board shall complete its review within one year from \n     the date of enactment of this title and shall transmit its \n     report and recommendations to the Secretary, the Committee on \n     Energy and Natural Resources of the United States Senate and \n     the Committee on Resources of the United States House of \n     Representatives.\n       (b) Visitor Services Study.--The Advisory Board, in \n     consultation with the National Park Service, shall conduct an \n     analysis and evaluation of the current conditions and future \n     needs of each unit of the National Park System for adequate \n     visitor service programs.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated to the National \n     Park System Advisory Board $700,000 per year to carry out the \n     provisions of this title, in addition to $275,000 for the \n     preparation of the management systems study referred to in \n     section 702(a) of this title and $275,000 for preparation of \n     the visitor services study referred to in section 702(b) of \n     this title.\n                                                                    ____\n\n   National Park Service Enhancement Act--Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n\n               title i--national park concessions reform\n\n       Section 101 sets forth Congressional findings.\n       Section 102 amends sections of Public Law 89-249 (79 Stat. \n     969; 16 U.S.C. 20-20g), entitled ``An Act relating to the \n     establishment of concession policies administered in the \n     areas administered by the National Park Service and for other \n     purposes''.\n       Subsection (a) renumbers section 2 of the 1965 Act as \n     section 3 and inserts a new section 2 into the 1965 Act which \n     defines terms used in the Act.\n       Subsection (b) amends section 3 to conform with the \n     definitions in the previous subsection.\n       Subsection (c) renumbers existing subsection 3(a) as 4(a) \n     and directs the Secretary of the Interior to include certain \n     terms and conditions in contracts.\n       Subsection (d) renumbers existing subsection 3(b) as 4(b).\n       Subsection (e) renumbers existing subsection 3(c) as 4(c) \n     and amends it to allow concessioners and commercial use \n     contractors to set their own rates and charges to the public \n     in national parks where sufficient competition for provided \n     facilities and services exists either within or near the park \n     in which the concessioner or commercial use contractor \n     operates. If the Secretary determines that such competition \n     does not exist, the contract will include the mechanism \n     included in the existing law that rates and charges will be \n     compared to those for the nearest comparable facilities and \n     services.\n       Subsection (f) renumbers existing subsection 3(d) as 4(d) \n     and amends it to fix the franchise fees at the amount stated \n     in the selected proposal at the commencement of the contract \n     and authorizes the Secretary to reduce the franchise fee \n     during the contract term if deemed necessary. The suggested \n     minimum franchise fee will be included by the Secretary in \n     the bid solicitation prospectus, as indicated in subsection \n     102(k).\n       Subsection (g) renumbers existing section 4 as section 5 \n     and removes the reference to the renewal preference under \n     prior law which is deleted from this title.\n       Subsection (h) repeals existing section 5 of the 1965 Act, \n     thereby eliminating preferential right of renewal with the \n     exception of contracts entered into prior to enactment of \n     this title.\n       Subsection (i) amends section 6 by removing the definition \n     of ``sound value'' as redundant with new text, requires that \n     compensation be paid based on sound value, deletes the last \n     sentence, designates the existing text of the section as \n     subsection (a) and adds a subsection (b). The new subsection \n     outlines the process for determining the value of the \n     concessioner's possessor interest if the value of such \n     interest was not previously agreed upon by the concessioner \n     and the Secretary. The concessioner is directed to submit an \n     independent appraisal of the sound value of the structures, \n     fixtures, or improvements in which the concessioner has an \n     investment interest. If the Secretary disagrees with the \n     appraisal submitted by the concessioner, he may present the\n      concessioner with an independent appraisal. For the \n     concessioner's income-producing structures, fixture, or \n     improvement, the method to be used by the concessioner's \n     appraiser and the Secretary's appraiser, when necessary, \n     shall be the income approach to valuation as is generally \n     used by real estate appraisers; for any structure, fixture \n     or improvement not primarily used for the production of \n     income, the fair market value is calculated as \n     reconstruction cost less depreciation to tie it to the \n     sound value definition, since an income approach is not \n     applicable. If in disagreement over the sound value, the \n     Secretary and the concessioner may direct their appraisers \n     to choose a third appraiser, who will recommend to the \n     Secretary one of the two appraisals as the more accurate. \n     A CPI adjustment is made to cover the period between the \n     date of the appraisal and the date of payment.\n       Subsection (j) renumbers sections 7 through 9 as sections \n     11 through 13, respectively.\n       Subsection (k) adds four new sections, numbered 7 through \n     10. The new section 7 establishes the selection process for \n     concessioners and commercial use contractors.\n       Section 7(a) states that a contract shall be awarded to the \n     bidder submitting the best proposal as determined by the \n     Secretary, through a competitive selection process. The \n     Secretary is required to develop regulations establishing the \n     selection process as well as a dispute resolution process \n     where the Secretary has been unable to meet certain \n     conditions or requirements.\n       Subsection (b) preserves the provisions of the Alaska \n     National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA), such as \n     those granting preference to Native Corporations and locals \n     for the provision of commercial visitor services in National \n     Park System units in Alaska, and states that subject to \n     rights of operation guaranteed by Section 1307 of ANILCA, a \n     priority shall be given to commercial use contractors \n     operating cruise ships who provide tours in Glacier Bay \n     National Park which originate in Southeast Alaska.\n       Subsection (c) authorizes the Secretary to award small and \n     temporary contracts noncompetitively.\n       Subsection (d) outlines the steps used by the Secretary to \n     distribute a prospectus and lists the minimum information to \n     be included in such prospectus, including the minimum \n     suggested franchise fee.\n       Subsection (e) authorizes the Secretary to consider a \n     proposal which does not meet the suggested minimum \n     requirements but requires that certain conditions be met for \n     the Secretary to award a contract to a bidder submitting such \n     a proposal. The Secretary is authorized to reject proposals \n     which meet the requirements if it is determined that the \n     bidder is not qualified, or is likely to provide \n     unsatisfactory services. If all proposals are rejected, the \n     Secretary must establish new minimum suggested requirements \n     and reinitiate the competitive selection process.\n       Subsection (f) outlines primary factors for the Secretary's \n     consideration in selecting the best proposal. The proposed \n     franchise fee shall be considered a secondary factor in \n     selecting a bidder.\n       Subsection (g) requires Congressional notification for any \n     proposed contract over 10 years in length or with projected \n     annual gross receipts greater than $5 million.\n       Subsection (h) establishes a renewal incentive for \n     concessioners and commercial use contractors who receive \n     performance evaluations, as conducted annually by the \n     Secretary, exceeding the satisfactory level for at least 50% \n     of the years of the contract's terms. Under these\n      provisions, such renewal incentive consists of an automatic \n     credit of an additional 10% of the maximum points that the \n     Secretary may award to a proposal submitted for renewal \n     for a contract.\n       Subsection (i) provides a preferential right of renewal for \n     commercial use contractors for contracts which primarily \n     provide outfitting, guide, river running, or other similar \n     services and which are expected to produce gross revenues of \n     no more than $1,000,000. In order to receive this \n     preferential right of renewal, such commercial use \n     contractors must receive performance evaluations, as \n     conducted annually by the Secretary, exceeding the \n     satisfactory level for at least 50% of the years of the \n     contract's term, with no unsatisfactory ratings received for \n     any of the five years prior to contract renewal.\n       The new section 8 relates to length and transferability of \n     contracts. Subsection 8(a) establishes the basic contract \n     term as ten years but authorizes longer terms if the \n     Secretary finds it to be in the public interest. For \n     concessioners required to make substantial investments in \n     structure, fixtures and improvements in a park, the Secretary \n     is required to award a contract term commensurate with the \n     investments made.\n       Subsection (b) describes the Secretary's reasonable right \n     to approve transfers of contracts, based on the competence \n     and financial capability of the transferee. Congressional \n     notification is required for certain transfers.\n       Subsection (c) states that in cases of transfer or other \n     contract conveyance, successor concessioners and commercial \n     use contractors are entitled to any ``good'' performance \n     ratings received by the prior holder of the contract.\n       The new section 9 establishes an annual performance \n     appraisal system for concessioners and commercial use \n     contractors. Subsection 9(a) directs the Secretary to publish \n     regulations for developing reasonable general standards and \n     criteria for evaluating concessioners and commercial use \n     contractors. Performance categories will consist of \n     ``unsatisfactory'', ``satisfactory'', and ``good''. The \n     Secretary and selected bidder will jointly develop specific \n     rating criteria and standards for the contract prior to \n     finalizing the contract.\n       Subsection (b) directs the Secretary to conduct annual \n     performance evaluations. The Secretary must provide \n     concessioners or commercial use contractors receiving \n     unsatisfactory ratings with written notification, including \n     requirements for improving performance. Contracts may be \n     terminated by the Secretary if a concessioner or commercial \n     use contractor fails to improve performance to the \n     satisfactory level. Should a contract be terminated for \n     continued poor performance, the outgoing concessioner may be \n     required to pay for the cost to the Secretary for a new bid \n     solicitation and evaluation, plus the difference between the \n     old and new franchise fees, if the new fee is lower.\n       Subsection (c) requires Congressional notification by the \n     Secretary for each unsatisfactory rating and each terminated \n     contract.\n       The new section 10 directs the Secretary to include local \n     hiring preference provisions in contracts to provide visitor \n     services in noncontiguous states which have unemployment \n     rates exceeding the national average.\n       Section 103 states that within two years of enacting this \n     title, the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior will \n     establish uniform procedures for issuing contracts and \n     nonrecurring commercial/non-recreational use permits for \n     substantially similar activities on\n      Federal lands managed by the U.S. \n\n[[Page S 12226]]\n     Forest Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Bureau of Land \n     Management which are consistent with this title.\n\n\n                      Title II--National Park Fees\n\n       Section 201 amends the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act \n     of 1965 (P.L. 88-578; 16 U.S.C. 460l) to make several \n     modifications to the fee program.\n       Subsection (a) amends Section 4(a) of the LWCF Act relating \n     to admission fees.\n       Subparagraph (1) deletes ``fee-free travel areas'' and \n     ``lifetime admission permit'' from the section title as they \n     were previously stricken from the text.\n       Subparagraph (2) increases the maximum cost the Golden \n     Eagle Passport from $25 to $50;.\n       Subparagraph (3) authorizes the use of Golden Eagle \n     Passport receipts for authorized protection, rehabilitation, \n     and conservation projects and notes authorization for their \n     use by the Youth Conservation Corps and others.\n       Subparagraph (4) increases the maximum cost of an annual \n     pass for entry into a single park from $15 to $25;\n       Subparagraph (5) sets a maximum entrance fee into a park at \n     $6 per person, instead of the present system of charging on a \n     per car basis;\n       Subparagraph (6) corrects the name of Great Smoky Mountains \n     National Park and removes the prohibition on collection \n     entrance fees at urban units of the National Park System that \n     provide significant outdoor recreational opportunities and \n     have multiple access points.\n       Subparagraph (7) limits use of the Golden Age Passport, \n     which allows a person 62 years of age or older lifetime free \n     admission into all parks, to the passport holder only, \n     instead of allowing free admission for all persons \n     accompanying the passport holder in a non-commercial vehicle.\n       Subparagraph (8) prohibits collection of fees from persons \n     with right of access for fishing and hunting privileges under \n     a specific law or treaty or who are engaged in official \n     Federal, State, or local government business.\n       Subparagraph (9) limits coverage under the Golden Access \n     Passport for the disabled to the individual and one \n     companion, regardless of method of travel.\n       Subparagraph (10) directs the Secretary to provide to \n     Congress within 18 months after enactment a report outlining \n     the changes to be implemented.\n       Subparagraph (11) deletes (a)(9), which states specific \n     areas where fees will not be charged. This provides an \n     opportunity to review those areas for possible collection of \n     fees, but does not guarantee that fees will be established.\n       Subparagraph (12) deletes that portion of (a)(11) which \n     established special rates for Grand Teton, Yellowstone, and \n     Grand Canyon National Parks.\n       Subparagraph (13) renumbers remaining sections accordingly.\n       Subsection (b) amends section 4(b) of the LWCF Act to \n     remove personal collection of fees by an employee or agent of \n     the Federal agency from the list of criteria used in \n     determining whether a fee can be charged at a campground, and \n     removes the 50% discount in use fees for those 62 and over, \n     but retains that discount for the disabled.\n       Subsection (c) amends section 4(d) of the LWCF Act to \n     include comparable recreation fees charged by other public \n     and private entities in the list of criteria for setting \n     recreation fees at Federally managed areas.\n       Subsection (d) amends section 4(e) of the LWCF Act to \n     change the $100 cap on fines to comply with the Criminal Fine \n     Improvement Act of 1987 (P.L. 100-185), which established \n     maximum fine levels for all Federal petty offenses.\n       Subsection (e) amends section 4(h) of the LWCF Act to \n     change committee and bureau names to reflect current titles \n     and conditions.\n       Subsection (f) amends section 4(k) of the LWCF Act to \n     clarify that the non-Federal sale of Golden Eagle Passports \n     may be conducted on a consignment basis.\n       Subsection (g) amends section 4(l) of the LWCF Act by \n     changing the term ``viewing'' to ``visiting''.\n       Subsection (h) amends section 4(n) of the LWCF Act by \n     directing the Secretary to establish a per vehicle admission \n     fee, based on vehicle occupancy, in lieu of a per person \n     charge for commercial tours and by requiring the Secretary to \n     notify commercial tour operators of changes in the per \n     vehicle fee one year in advance.\n       Subsection (i) amends section 4 of the LWCF Act to add a \n     new subsection (o). The subsection directs the Secretary to \n     establish reasonable fees for uses of park areas that require \n     special arrangements, such as the filming of movies of \n     television shows. The fee shall at least cover the costs of \n     providing necessary services associated with such use, and \n     the amount covering such costs will remain in the park where \n     such use occurs. The Secretary may reduce or waive the fee \n     for organizations whose activities further the goals of the \n     National Park Service.\n       Subsection (j) amends a number of Public Laws to lift \n     prohibitions on admission fees at the following units of the \n     National Park System: War in the Pacific National Historical \n     Park; Virgin Islands National Park; Golden Gate National \n     Recreation Area; Statute of Liberty National Monument; Martin \n     Luther King National Historic Site; Point Reyes National \n     Seashore; Biscayne National Park; Dry Tortugas National Park; \n     Channel Islands National Park; and Mount Rushmore National \n     Memorial.\n       Section 202 authorizes the Secretary to negotiate and enter \n     into challenge cost-share agreements.\n       Section 203 amends Public Law 101-337, the National Park \n     System Resource Protection Act, to provide for cost recovery \n     for damages at additional units of the National Park System. \n     Public Law 101-337 limited recovery for such damages to \n     marine resources. As amended by section 203, that Act would \n     allow for cost recovery for damages to any living or non-\n     living resource within any park unit.\n\n\n          Title III--Ski Area Permits on National Forest Lands\n       Section 301 sets forth Congressional findings and purpose. \n     The purpose of the title is to legislate a ski area permit \n     fee that returns fair market value to the United States and \n     to prevent future conflicts between ski area operations and \n     mining and mineral leasing programs.\n       Section 302 amends the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act \n     of 1986 (P.L. 99-522, 100 Stat. 3000; 16 U.S.C. 497b) by \n     adding the following new sections as described below.\n       Section 4(a), as added to Public Law 99-522, states that \n     ski area permit fees shall be calculated, charged, and paid \n     as described in subsection (b) in order to return fair market \n     value to the United States, provide ski area permittees with \n     a simplified, consistent, predictable and equitable permit \n     fee, simplify administrative, bookkeeping and other \n     requirements currently imposed on the Secretary of \n     Agriculture (``Secretary'' in this title) and ski area \n     permittees, and to save costs associated with the calculation \n     of ski area permit fees.\n       Subsection (b), as added to Public Law 99-522, outlines the \n     method of calculating the ski area permit fee.\n       Subparagraph (b)(1) directs the Secretary to calculate the \n     ski area permit fee by first determining the permittee's \n     adjusted gross revenue (AGR) to be subject to the fee. The \n     adjusted gross revenue is equal to the sum of the following: \n     The permittee's gross revenues from alpine lift tickets and \n     alpine season pass sales plus alpine ski school operations \n     (LTA+SSA), which are multiplied by the permittee's slope \n     transport fee percentage (STFP) on National Forest System \n     lands where a ski area is partially on federal land and \n     partially on private land. To that, add the sum of gross \n     revenues from Nordic ski use pass sales and Nordic ski school \n     operations (LTN+SSN), which have been multiplied by the \n     percentage of the Nordic trails on National Forest System \n     lands where operations are partially on federal land and \n     partially on private land. To that total, add the permittee's \n     gross revenues from ancillary facilities (GRAF) physically \n     located on National Forest System lands.\n       Subparagraph (b)(2) uses the previous abbreviations to \n     depict the formula as follows: AGR=((LTA+SSA) x \n     STFP)+((LTN+SSN) x NR)+GRAF.\n       Subparagraph (b)(3) directs the Secretary to determine the \n     ski area permit fee (SAPF) to be charged a ski area permittee \n     by multiplying the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) as determined \n     above, by percentages based on the ranges in which the AGR \n     falls and by adding the total for each revenue range.\n       Subparagraph (b)(4) outlines the procedure for calculating \n     the fee for ski areas that are only partially located on \n     National Forest System lands.\n       Subparagraph (b)(5) directs the Secretary to annually \n     adjust the adjusted gross revenue figures for each revenue \n     bracket by the percent increase or decrease in the national \n     Consumer Price Index for the preceding calendar year.\n       Subsection (c), as added to Public Law 99-522, states that \n     in cases where an area of National Forest System land is \n     under a ski area permit, but the permittee does not have \n     revenue or sales qualifying for fee payment as outlined \n     above, the permittee shall pay an annual rental fee of $2 for \n     each acre of National Forest System land under permit. \n     Payment shall be made in accordance with the following \n     subsection.\n       Subsection (d), as added to Public Law 99-522, states that \n     unless otherwise arranged with the Secretary, the ski area \n     permittee shall pay the permit fee by August 31 of each year \n     and cover all applicable revenues received during the 12-\n     month period ending on June 30 of that year. The\n      Secretary is directed to provide each ski area permittee \n     with a standardized form, worksheets, and annual fee \n     calculation brackets and rates.\n       Subsection (e), as added to Public Law 99-522, excludes ski \n     area permittee or subpermittee revenue generated by \n     operations not located on National Forest System lands from \n     the permit fee calculation.\n       Subsection (f), as added to Public Law 99-522, defines \n     ``revenue'' and ``sales'' as actual income from sales, \n     excluding sales of operating equipment, refunds, rent paid by \n     sublessees, sponsor contributions, or any amounts \n     attributable to employee gratuities, discounts, complimentary \n     lift tickets, or other goods or services (except for bartered \n     goods) for which the permittee does not receive money.\n       Subsection (g), as added to Public Law 99-522, establishes \n     July 1, 1995 as the effective date for ski area permit fees \n     as described by this section, to cover receipts retroactive \n     to July 1, 1994. If a ski area permittee has paid fees for \n     the period ending June 30, 1995 under the prior graduated \n     rate fee system formula, such fees will be credited toward \n     the new permit fee due for that period under this section.\n\n[[Page S 12227]]\n\n       Subsection (h), as added to Public Law 99-522, describes \n     transitional ski area permit fees.\n       Subparagraph (h)(1) states that to minimize the effect of \n     converting individual ski areas from the existing fee system \n     to the one described in this title, each permittee subject to \n     the new fee shall determine their average existing fees (AEF) \n     for each year of the three-year period ending on June 30, \n     1994, and the permittee's proforma average ski area permit \n     fee (ASF) under subparagraph (a) for each of the three years. \n     Both shall be determined by adding the fee payment made by \n     the ski area or the estimated payment that would have been \n     made under subparagraph (a) for each year of that period and \n     dividing by three.\n       Subparagraph (h)(2) states that to calculate the ski area \n     permit fee required by subparagraph (a) for each year in the \n     five-year period ending on June 30, 1999, the Secretary shall \n     divide the ski area permit fee required by subparagraph (a) \n     by the ASF and then multiply by the AEF. The resulting fee is \n     called the Adjusted Base Fee (ABF). After June 30, 1999, \n     permittees shall pay the permit fee required by subparagraph \n     (a) without regard to previous fees or rates paid.\n       Subparagraph (h)(3) states that if the ABF is less than the \n     ski area permit fee required by subparagraph (a), the \n     permittee shall pay the lesser of the fee required by \n     subparagraph (a) or the ABF as adjusted using provided \n     multipliers ranging from 1.1 to 1.5.\n       Subparagraph (h)(4) states that if the ABF is greater than \n     the fee required by subparagraph (a) or the ABF as adjusted \n     using provided multipliers ranging from 0.5 to 0.9.\n       Section 5, as added to Public Law 99-522, withdraws all \n     lands located within the boundaries of ski area permits from \n     all forms of appropriation under the mining laws and from \n     disposition under laws pertaining to mineral and geothermal \n     leasing. Withdrawal continues for the full term of the \n     permit, as well as reissuance and renewal. Termination or \n     expiration of the permit shall cancel such withdrawal and \n     restore the land to all appropriation not otherwise \n     restricted under other public land laws.\n       Section 303 directs the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct \n     a study of ski areas on National Forest System lands to \n     determine the feasibility and suitability of selling all or a\n      portion of such lands to permittees or other interested \n     parties. The study is to include a determination and \n     identification of continuing need for Federal retention of \n     such lands, cost savings, revenues, and other benefits \n     from their sale or disposal, and criteria to be used if \n     the sale of such lands is considered. The Secretary is \n     directed to provide a report to the Senate Committee on \n     Energy and Natural Resources and House Committee on \n     Resources within one year of enactment of this title.\n\n\n                 title iv--national park system reform\n\n       Section 401 describes the preparation of a National Park \n     System Plan (the ``plan'' as referred to in this title).\n       Subsection (a) directs the Secretary of the Interior \n     (``Secretary'' in this title) to prepare a National Park \n     System Plan to guide the future direction of the National \n     Park System (``System'' as referred to in this title). The \n     plan shall include the following: (1) detailed criteria to \n     determine which natural and cultural resources are \n     appropriate for inclusion as units in the System; (2) \n     identification of what constitutes adequate representation of \n     a particular resource type and which aspects of the national \n     heritage are adequately represented as System units or other \n     protected areas; (3) identification of aspects of the \n     national heritage not represented in the system; (4) \n     priorities of themes and resources which would provide more \n     complete representation of the national heritage if added to \n     the System; (5) a statement of the role of the National Park \n     Service in preserving natural and cultural resources and \n     providing outdoor recreation opportunities; and (6) a \n     statement of what areas constitute units of the National Park \n     System and a distinction between such units, affiliated \n     areas, and other areas within the System.\n       Subsection (b) directs the Secretary to consult with other \n     Federal agencies, State and local officials, the National \n     Park System Advisory Board, resource management, recreation \n     and scholarly organization and other interested parties as \n     deemed appropriate by the Secretary in preparing the plan, \n     and to include appropriate opportunities for public review \n     and comment.\n       Subsection (c) directs the Secretary to transmit the plan \n     to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and \n     the House Committee on Resources prior to the end of the \n     second complete fiscal year after enactment of this title.\n       Section 402 amends Public Law 91-383 (16 U.S.C. 1a-1 and \n     following), ``An Act to improve the Administration of the \n     National Park System by the Secretary of the Interior, and to \n     clarify the authorities applicable to the system, and for \n     other purposes'' (the ``1970 Act'' as referred to in this \n     title) by modifying existing subsections (a) and (b) and \n     adding new sections (c) through (e).\n       Subparagraph (1) inserts the heading ``GENERAL AUTHORITY'' \n     after (a).\n       Subparagraph (2) strikes the second through sixth sentences \n     of subsection (8)(a) of the 1970 Act regarding reports made \n     to Congress by the Secretary on new area studies.\n       Subparagraph (3) corrects the name of the Committee on \n     Resources of the United States House of Representatives.\n       Subparagraph (4) redesignates the last two sentences of \n     subsection (a) and (e) and provides a heading, \n     ``AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS'' for (e).\n       Subparagraph (4) strikes subsection (8)(b) of the 1970 Act \n     and replaces it. New subsection (8)(b) directs the Secretary \n     to submit annually to the Senate Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources and the Committee on Resources of the House \n     a list of areas recommended for study for potential inclusion \n     in the System. The subsection further directs the Secretary \n     to give consideration to areas meeting established criteria \n     of national significance, suitability, and feasibility and to \n     themes, sites, and resources not already represented in the \n     National Park System, as noted in section 401 of this Act. \n     Following enactment of this title, studies of potential areas \n     to be included in the System must be authorized by Congress. \n     The National Park Service will retain authority to conduct \n     preliminary assessments, gather data on potential study \n     areas, provide technical and planning assistance, prepare or \n     process nominations for administrative designations, update \n     previous studies, or complete reconnaissance surveys of \n     individuals requiring a total expenditure of less than \n     $25,000. This subsection does not apply to or affect studies \n     on potential additions to the wild and scenic rivers system \n     or the national trails system.\n       New subsection (8)(c) requires the Secretary to complete \n     each new area study authorized by Congress within three \n     fiscal years of authorization. Public involvement is required \n     during preparation of each study. The Secretary is directed \n     to consider an area's national significance of resources or \n     outstanding recreational opportunities, suitability, \n     feasibility, and costs to administer such an area if added to \n     the System. Additional considerations include: rarity and \n     integrity; existing representation in the System or \n     protection by other agencies or entities; public use, \n     educational, and interpretive potential; acquisition, \n     development and operational costs; socioeconomic impact of \n     any designation; level of public support; and appropriate \n     configuration to ensure long term protection and enjoyment. \n     Each study will also consider whether such area should be \n     managed by the National Park Service or another agency or \n     entity, with a recommendation for protecting resources and \n     providing public use of the area. Each study transmitted to \n     Congress shall include the Administration's preferred \n     management option and projected fiscal and personnel costs if \n     managed by the Federal government.\n       New subsection (8)(d) directs the Secretary to submit \n     annually to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources and the House Resources Committee two prioritized \n     lists of areas previously studied, one for areas with \n     primarily natural resources, and one with primarily cultural \n     resources, for possible addition to the National Park System. \n     The Secretary is directed to consider threats to resource \n     values, cost escalation factors and those listed in \n     subsection (c) in developing the lists.\n\n\n                Title V--Land Management Agency Housing\n\n       Section 501 defines certain terms used in the bill.\n       Section 502(a)(1) authorizes the Secretary of the Interior \n     and the Secretary of Agriculture (the ``Secretaries'') to \n     make employee housing available, subject to the limitations \n     in set forth in paragraph (2) on or off public lands (defined \n     as lands administered by either Secretary), and to rent or \n     lease such housing to employees of the respective Department \n     at a reasonable value.\n       Paragraph (a)(2) provides that housing made available on \n     public lands shall be limited to those areas designated for \n     administrative use and that no private lands or interests \n     therein outside the boundaries of Federally administered \n     areas may be acquired for the purposes of this title without \n     the consent of the owner.\n       Subsection (b) directs the Secretaries to provide such \n     housing in accordance with this title and section 5911 of \n     Title 5, United States Code, except that the terms \n     ``availability of quarters,'' ``contract,'' and ``reasonable \n     value'' shall have the meanings set forth in this subsection. \n     Significantly, ``reasonable value'' is defined to mean the \n     base rental rate comparable to private rental rates for \n     comparable housing facilities and associated amenities, so \n     long as the rate (as a percentage of the employee's annual \n     gross income) shall not exceed the median monthly housing \n     cost for renters as a percentage of current income, listed in \n     the Census Bureau's American Housing Survey.\n       Subsection (c) authorizes the Secretaries, subject to \n     appropriation, to enter into contracts and agreements with \n     public and private entities to provide employee housing on or \n     off public lands.\n       Subsection (d) permits the Secretaries to enter into \n     cooperative agreements or joint ventures with local \n     governmental and private entities, on or off public lands, to \n     provide appropriate and necessary utility and other \n     infrastructure facilities in support of employee housing.\n       Section 503 directs the Secretaries to conduct a survey of \n     the availability of quarters at field units under each \n     Secretary's jurisdiction at least every five years. If such \n     survey indicates that government-owned or suitable privately-\n     owned quarters are not available (as that term is defined in \n     section \n\n[[Page S 12228]]\n     502(b)(1) for the personnel assigned to a specific duty station, the \n     Secretaries are authorized to provide suitable quarters in \n     accordance with the provisions of this title.\n       As used in this section, the term ``fields units'' includes \n     administrative units that are located in national parks, \n     national wildlife refuges, national forest districts, BLM \n     resource areas, and other similar field areas. Specifically \n     excluded from the definition are central offices, such as \n     Washington, D.C. headquarters offices and regional and state \n     offices.\n       Section 504(a) authorizes the Secretaries to make secondary \n     quarters available to employees who are permanently stationed \n     at remote locations and are regularly required to relocate \n     for temporary periods (such as at Channel Islands National \n     Park or Dry Tortugas National Park).\n       Subsection (b) states that rental rates for such secondary \n     facilities shall be established so that the aggregate rental \n     rate paid by the employee for both primary and secondary \n     quarters as a percentage of the employee's annual gross \n     income shall not exceed the median monthly housing cost for \n     renters as a percentage of current income, listed in the \n     Census Bureau's American Housing Survey.\n       Section 505(a) requires the Secretaries, within two years \n     after the date of enactment of this title, to survey all \n     existing government-owned employee housing facilities under \n     the jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior and the \n     Department of Agriculture to assess the physical condition of \n     such housing and the suitability of such housing for the \n     effective prosecution of the agency mission. The Secretaries \n     are required to develop an agency-wide priority listing, by \n     structure, identifying those units in greatest need for \n     repair, rehabilitation,\n      replacement or initial construction. The survey is to be \n     transmitted to the appropriate Congressional Committees.\n       Subsection (b) provides that expenditures of any funds \n     appropriated for construction, repair or rehabilitation shall \n     follow in sequential order the priority listing established \n     in subsection (a), unless otherwise provided by law.\n       Section 506 authorizes $3,000,000 each year for fiscal \n     years 1996-2001.\n\n\n                     title vi--disposition of fees\n\n       Section 601 establishes a special account in the Treasury \n     called the Park Improvement Fund (``the fund'' as used in \n     this title).\n       Section 602 states that beginning in fiscal year 1996 and \n     in each following fiscal year, 50% of all revenues received \n     by the Federal government over the amount that would have \n     been received in 1995 without enactment of this Act from \n     franchise fees, admission, special recreation, commercial \n     tour use, and commercial/non-recreation use fees shall be \n     covered into the fund. The Secretary of the Interior \n     (``Secretary'' as used in this title) is authorized to \n     withhold from the fund the portion of fees equal to fee \n     collection costs for the previous fiscal year, not to exceed \n     15% of the total fees collected in accordance with title I \n     and II of this Act.\n       Section 603(a) states that receipts in the fund from the \n     previous fiscal year shall be available to the Secretary \n     without further appropriation. The allocation is a 75/25% \n     split, with 75% of the total receipts deposited from each \n     unit of the National Park System collecting the types of fees \n     noted above made available to that unit for expenditure. The \n     remaining 25% may be allocated among all units of the \n     National Park System, including those not collecting such \n     fees.\n       Subsection (b) states that fund expenditures shall only be \n     for infrastructure and operational needs of units of the \n     National Park System, and directs the Secretary to compile a \n     list of proposed expenditures from the fund for each unit \n     that fiscal year by January 1 of each year. Such list and a \n     report of expenditures for the previous fiscal year, by unit, \n     shall be provided to the Senate Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources and the House Committee on Resources.\n\n\n             title vii--national park system advisory board\n\n       Section 701 amends section 3 of Public Law 74-292 (44 Stat. \n     666; 16 U.S.C. 463) as amended, to establish National Park \n     System Advisory Board, as described below.\n       Amended section 3(a) establishes a National Park System \n     Advisory Board, with 9 members selected by the Secretary for \n     terms not to exceed 4 years. The section outlines the general \n     composition of the Board, and authorizes the Board to \n     establish rules and procedures. Board members shall not \n     receive compensation except for travel and per diem \n     reimbursement when traveling to perform Board-related duties.\n       Existing section 3(b) is renumbered as 3(f) and changed to \n     reflect January 1, 2006 as the termination date for the \n     Board.\n       Existing section 3(c) is renumbered as 3(g).\n       The new section 3(b) outlines the powers of the Board which \n     include authorization to appoint an executive director and \n     other staff as needed to carry out the duties of the Board.\n       The new section 3(c) authorizes the Board to hold hearings, \n     enter into contracts, make such expenditures, and establish \n     task forces.\n       The new section 3(d) exempts the Board from the provisions \n     of the Federal Advisory Committee Act.\n       The new section 3(e) authorizes the Board to secure \n     information from any office, department, agency, \n     establishment or instrumentality of the Federal government \n     and directs such Federal entities to provide such requested \n     information to the extent permitted by law. This subsection \n     also authorizes the head of any Federal department, agency or \n     instrumentality to make facilities, services, and personnel \n     of such department, agency or instrumentality available to \n     the Board on a nonreimbursable basis, and authorizes the \n     Board to use the United States mails in conducting its \n     duties.\n       Section 702 outlines studies and annual reports that the \n     Board is charged with conducting and providing to Congress \n     and the Secretary of the Interior.\n       Subsection (a) directs the Board in consultation with the \n     National Park Service, to conduct a management system study, \n     to be completed one year from enactment of this title and \n     transmitted to the Secretary, the Senate Committee on Energy \n     and Natural Resources, and the House Resources Committee. The \n     study shall consist of a review of each unit of the National \n     Park System, excepting units designated as national parks to \n     determine if alternative management would result in equal or \n     better visitor services and resource protection. The Board is \n     also directed to review the organic legislation and history \n     of the National Park Service and its units and to develop \n     criteria to guide the Congress and the Secretary in adding \n     new units to the National Park System.\n       Subsection (b) directs the Board, in consultation with the \n     National Park Service, to analyze and evaluate the current \n     conditions and future needs of each unit of the National Park \n     System for adequate visitor services. The Board is also \n     directed to identify units where new or additional services \n     should be provided. This evaluation is to be completed and \n     referred to the Secretary, the Senate Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources, and the House Committee on Resources \n     within one year after the enactment of this section.\n       Subsection (c) directs the Board to monitor the \n     effectiveness and objectivity of the Secretary's program of \n     annual performance evaluations for concessioners and \n     commercial use contractors operating under contracts in units \n     of the National Park System and to provide their summarized \n     findings to the Secretary, the Senate Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources, and the House Committee on Resources on an \n     annual basis.\n       Section 703 authorizes an annual appropriation of $700,000, \n     in addition to $275,000 to conduct the management system \n     study and $275,000 to conduct the visitor services study.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. FAIRCLOTH (for himself, Mr. Dole, and Mr. Abraham):\n  S. 1145. A bill to abolish the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment and provide for reducing Federal spending for housing and \ncommunity development activities by consolidating and eliminating \nprograms, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n\n\n             THE HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES AND EMPOWERMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH.\n   Mr. President, on this day 30 years ago, the Department of Housing \nand Urban Development was created. Today, however, I have introduced \nlegislation, along with Senators Dole and Abraham that will \ndramatically reform our Nation's housing policy and in the process, \neliminate the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\n  Mr. President, HUD was created in 1965. When it was created, the \npurpose of this Department was to revitalize our urban areas and \nprovide safe, decent housing for all Americans.\n  Mr. President, in short, HUD has been an enormous failure. Since \n1965, HUD has spent hundreds of billions of dollars. Yet today, despite \nthis massive spending, we are no better off.\n  Mr. President, when considering whether we should reinvent HUD or end \nit, each of us has to ask ourselves these questions: Are our inner \ncities better off than they were 30 years ago?\n  Is the state of public housing better today than it was 30 years ago?\n  Is housing more affordable today?\n  Has homelessness been reduced? In my view it was not even a problem \n30 years ago.\n  The answers to these questions is no--absolutely no to all of them.\n  In fact our cities are more decayed and more dangerous today than \never.\n  Solving these problems was supposed to be HUD's mission. In each, it \nhas failed miserably.\n  Imagine if we applied a performance standard like this in the private \nsector. Would any business that had not met its goals in 30 years still \nbe in business. No, of course not, it would have gone out of business \nlong ago, and HUD should have gone.\n  HUD is a massive bureaucracy with over 11,000 employees. It has over \n240 housing programs--so many that the Secretary of HUD did not even \nknow he had that many. HUD has over $192 billion in unused budget \nauthority.\n  HUD has even entangled the American taxpayer in 23,000 long-term \ncontracts that run until the year 2020. \n\n[[Page S 12229]]\nThese are contingent liabilities that will have to be met by the \ntaxpayers of this country.\n  HUD's spending is increasing so rapidly that by the year 2000, \nhousing assistance will be the largest discretionary spending function \nin our budget.\n  Frankly, knowing all of this, I do not think we can afford not to \nabolish HUD. We have to stop it and soon. We have to end it and we need \nto do it soon.\n  The bill I am introducing today will save $17 billion in budget \nauthority over the next 5 years. We need these kind of real savings if \nwe have any hope of reducing this deficit. When compared to the \nCisneros budget figures, I am told by the Congressional Budget Office \nthat this bill will save $88 billion as compared to its reinvention.\n  Mr. President, beyond eliminating HUD, this bill reforms housing \npolicy that, in my opinion, will dramatically improve the state of \nhousing in the United States.\n  This bill ends subsidies to public housing, but provides housing \nvouchers to individuals. This way, people will no longer be trapped in \nsubstandard public housing, instead they can choose to live where they \nwant--in the kind of housing they want.\n  They will, for the first time, have the freedom to choose, and this \nis what the vouchers will do.\n  The legislation will also create block grants for housing, community \ndevelopment, and special populations. The critical element here is that \nthere will not be a HUD in Washington that will micromanage everything \nthe States and localities do with the funds. Because of this, the money \nwill be better spent.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the bill will reform FHA so that it must risk \nshare with the private sector. This will avoid FHA problems of the \npast, like fraud, and putting people in homes they cannot afford, \nknowing they cannot afford them when they put them in those houses, but \nthat are 100-percent insured by the taxpayers.\n  Now, the private sector's money will be at stake, and because of \nthis, FHA will function better.\n  Mr. President, on this day, 30 years ago, August 10, 1965, President \nJohnson signed the bill creating HUD.\n  When he signed the bill, he said the new HUD ``would defeat the enemy \nof decay that exists in our inner cities.''\n  Thirty years later, this much we know--the enemy of decay is not a \n$26 billion bureaucracy in Washington, which is what HUD is.\n  To end decay in our cities we need hard work, traditional values, and \ntwo-parent families and not government handouts. These things will \nfight decay in our Nation's cities--not HUD.\n  I want to thank my colleagues, especially Senator Dole who has been a \nleader on this issue, and Senator Abraham. I would urge my colleagues \nto join us on this bill so that we can really reform housing policy--\nnot just tinker with it on the margins. This bill will do it, and I ask \nfor the support of my colleagues.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Cohen, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Jeffords, \n        Mr. Kerry, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Moynihan):\n  S. 1146. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify \nthe excise tax treatment of draft cider; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                         excise tax legislation\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am introducing tax legislation \ndesigned to stimulate the apple industry in the United States. I am \npleased that Senators Cohen, D'Amato, Jeffords, Kerry, Lieberman, and \nMoynihan are joining me as original cosponsors of this bill. This \nlegislation contains a couple of technical changes to a bill I \nintroduced earlier this year, S. 401.\n  This bill will revise the Federal excise tax on hard apple cider, \nmore commonly known as draft cider, to beer tax rates. As the ranking \nmember of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I believe this small tax \nchange will be of great benefit to cider makers and apple growers \nacross the country.\n  Draft cider is one of the oldest categories of alcoholic beverages in \nNorth America. Back in colonial times, nearly every innkeeper served \ndraft cider to his or her patrons during the long winter. In fact, \nthrough the 19th century, beer and draft cider sold equally in the \nUnited States.\n  Recently, draft cider has made a comeback in the United States and \naround the world. Our tax law, however, unfairly taxes draft cider at a \nmuch higher rate than beer despite the two beverages sharing the same \nalcohol level and consumer market. This tax treatment, I believes, \ncreates an artificial barrier to the growth of draft cider. My \nlegislation will correct this inequity.\n  Present law taxes draft cider, regardless of its alcohol level, as a \nwine at a rate of $1.07 per gallon. My bill would clarify that draft \ncider containing not more than 7 percent alcohol would be taxed at the \nbeer rate of 22.6 cents per gallon.\n  I believe this tax change would allow draft cider producers to \ncompete fairly with comparable beverage makers. As draft cider grows in \npopularity, apple growers around the Nation should prosper because \ndraft cider is made from culled apples, the least marketable apples.\n  The growth of draft cider should convert these least marketable \napples, which account for about 20 percent of the entire U.S. apple \nproduction, into a high value product, helping our struggling apple \ngrowers. Indeed, I have received letters from officials at 10 State \nagriculture departments--Arizona, Connecticut, Georgia, Maine, \nMassachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont and \nVirginia--supporting the taxing of draft cider at the beer rate because \nthis change would allow apple farmers in their States to reap the \nbenefits of an expanded culled apple market.\n  I have also heard from the Northeast McIntosh Apple Growers \nAssociation, the New York Apple Association, the New England Apple \nCouncil and many apple farmers, processors and cider producers that \nsupport revising the excise tax on draft cider.\n  I believe this small tax change will have a large positive impact on \nthe Nation's apple industry. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1146\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CLARIFICATION OF TAX TREATMENT OF DRAFT CIDER.\n\n       (a) Draft Cider Containing Not More Than 7 Percent Alcohol \n     Taxed as Wine.--Subsection (b) of section 5041 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to imposition and \n     rate of tax) is amended by adding at the end the following \n     new paragraph:\n       ``(6) On draft cider derived primarily from apples or apple \n     concentrate and water, containing no other fruit product, and \n     containing at least one-half of 1 percent and not more than 7 \n     percent of alcohol by volume, 22.6 cents per wine gallon.''\n       (b) Excluded From Small Producer Credit.--Paragraph (1) of \n     section 5041(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \n     (relating to credit for small domestic producers) is amended \n     by striking ``subsection (b)(4)'' and inserting ``paragraphs \n     (4) and (6) of subsection (b)''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply on and after the date of the enactment of this \n     Act.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HOLLINGS:\n  S. 1148. A bill to revitalize the American economy and improve \nenforcement of the trade laws of the United States, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                the economic revitalization act of 1995\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \nrevive the economy and restore our preeminence in manufacturing. During \nthe cold war, this Nation willingly subordinated its economic interests \nin order to maintain the Western alliance against communism. Forty-five \nyears of commitment and sacrifice paid off when the Berlin Wall \ncollapsed and democracy triumphed over totalitarianism.\n  Now we have entered a new era of global competition in which power \nand influence will be derived from economic strength, not through the \nbarrel of a gun or the tip of a missile. This Nation now faces fierce \ncompetition for market share in the international economy. To compete \nin the global marketplace, we must devote the same degree of commitment \nand sacrifice to restoring our economic strength as we devoted to the \ncold war.\n\n[[Page S 12230]]\n\n  At the beginning of the cold war, President Truman had the vision and \nforesight to create the institutions that would unify the West and \nstand as a bulwark for freedom. To coordinate policy, the National \nSecurity Council would serve as the broker between the Departments of \nState and Defense.\n  Now in the post-cold war era where economic competition is \npreeminent, we need to have the same coordination as our economic \npolicy. That is why this legislation creates an Economic Security \nCouncil to set the course for U.S. economic policy.\n  Mr. President, restoring our economic strength will also require that \nwe rethink the failed policies of the past. Last week, the last \nAmerican manufacturer of television sets was sold to South Korea's LG \nIndustries. The sale was the culmination of two decades of failed trade \npolicy. To no avail, Zenith tried to use our anti-dumping laws to half \nthe predatory pricing by their competition. They tried to use the \nantitrust laws and faced the unseemly specter of the Justice Department \nappearing on behalf of the foreign manufacturer. Despite promising \ndevelopments in high definition television, Zenith succumbed after 6 \nstraight years of losses. Now HDTV will be produced by the Koreans. In \nthis new era of economic competition, we can no longer afford to sit \nidly by while American industry withers under the relentless assault of \nforeign predatory trade practices.\n  Mr. President, a cost structure revolution has taken place in the \ninternational marketplace. In industry after industry, markets have \nbeen cartelized. By controlling distribution networks and reaping \nmonopoly rewards in home markets, foreign companies have engaged in \nrelentless dumping into our market. By holding down their fixed costs, \nthese companies have been driving\n American companies out of business.\n\n  To attack these predatory trade practices, this bill class on us to \nimprove our antidumping laws to prevent the circumvention of dumping \norders and to make it easer for industries to prevail in threat cases. \nit also updates the enforcement of the antitrust laws. The antitrust \nlaws were written to prevent the Carnegies, Morgans and Mellons from \ndominating the economy. In a global economy, the concentration of \neconomic power stretches across borders. My bill amended the antitrust \nlaws to enable U.S. companies to attack the anti-competitive practices \nthat keep them out of foreign markets.\n  Mr. President, not all the problems that afflict our economy are the \nproduct of foreign competition. Many of our wounds are self-inflicted. \nOur securities laws need to be updated to emphasize the creation of \npatient capital--long-term shareholders who will stick with a company \nover the long haul. With that in mind, my bill calls for the \nelimination of quarterly reporting requirements which force U.S. \ncompanies to focus on short-term investments to enhance shareholder \nvalue rather than long-term investment to improve competitiveness.\n  Furthermore, this bill attacks the enemy within--those former U.S. \nGovernment officials who turn around and represent foreign interests at \nthe expense of U.S. workers. As a remedy, this bill places a 5-year ban \non lobbying by former officials who work for foreign interests. And to \njumpstart research and development spending which now lags behind our \ncompetitors, the bill reestablishes the permanent research and \ndevelopment tax credit. It is paid for by imposing an import surcharge \nto eliminate our enormous trade deficits.\n  Finally, I need to say a word about reorganization of Government. \nSome have come to Washington with one goal in mind--to tear down the \nGovernment. Our mission should not be to tear it down but to make it \nwork. For example, there are those who advocate eliminating the \nCommerce Department. But in this new era of global competition, that \nwould be the same as eliminating the Department of Defense during the \ncold war.\n  Instead of destroying the Commerce Department, we should be \nstrengthening the Department and turn it into a real Department of \nTrade and Industry. We should move the Export-Import Bank and the \nOverseas Private Investment Corporation into the Department to provide \nexporters with one-stop shopping. This would create a powerful export \npromotion agency to compete with the economic powerhouses on the \nPacific rim.\n  Mr. President, for 20 years real wages have stagnated in America. We \nhave lost 2 million manufacturing jobs and lost an edge in critical \ntechnologies. Once the land of opportunity, America is now a country \nwith the worst income distribution in the industrial world.\n  Unless we wake up from our economic daydream, we will find ourselves \na two-tiered society divided between rich and poor. Let's go to work to \nrebuild our economy and renew the American dream.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

CHILD LABOR.\n\n       (a) Findings; Purpose; Policy.--\n       (1) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (A) Principle 9 of the Declaration of the Rights of the \n     Child proclaimed by the General Assembly of the United \n     Nations on November 20, 1959, states that ``* * * the child \n     shall not be admitted to employment before an appropriate \n     minimum age; he shall in no case be caused or permitted to \n     engage in any occupation or employment which would prejudice \n     his health or education, or interfere with his physical, \n     mental, or moral development * * *''.\n       (B) According to the International Labor Organization, \n     worldwide an estimated 200,000,000 children under age 15 are \n     working, many of them in dangerous industries like mining and \n     fireworks.\n       (C) Children under age 15 constitute approximately 11 \n     percent of the workforce in some Asian countries, 17 percent \n     in parts of Africa, and a reported 12-to-26 percent in many \n     countries in Latin America.\n       (D) The number of children under age 15 who are working, \n     and the scale of their suffering, increase every year, \n     despite the existence of more than 20 International Labor \n     Organization conventions on child labor and laws in many \n     countries which purportedly prohibit the employment of \n     underage children.\n       (E) In many countries, children under age 15 lack either \n     the legal standing or means to protect themselves from \n     exploitation in the workplace.\n       (F) The employment of children under age 15 commonly \n     deprives the children of the opportunity for basic education \n     and also denies gainful employment to millions of adults.\n       (G) The prevalence of child labor in many developing \n     countries is rooted in widespread poverty that is \n     attributable to unemployment and underemployment, precarious \n     incomes, low living standards, and insufficient education and \n     training opportunities.\n       (H) The employment of children under age 15, often at \n     pitifully low wages, undermines the stability of families and \n     ignores the importance of increasing jobs, aggregate demand, \n     and purchasing power among adults as a catalyst to the \n     development of internal markets and the achievement of broad-\n     based, self-reliant economic development in many developing \n     countries.\n       (I) Adult workers in the United States and other developed \n     countries should not have their jobs imperiled by imports \n     produced by child labor in developing countries.\n       (2) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to curtail \n     worldwide employment of children under age 15 by--\n       (A) eliminating the role of the United States in providing \n     a market for foreign products made by underage children; and\n       (B) encouraging other nations to join in a ban on trade in \n     such products.\n       (3) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States--\n       (A) to discourage actively the employment of children under \n     age 15 in the production of goods for export or domestic \n     consumption;\n       (B) to strengthen and supplement international trading \n     rules with a view to renouncing the use of underage children \n     in production as a means of competing in international trade;\n       (C) to amend United States law to prohibit the entry into \n     commerce of products resulting from the labor of underage \n     children;

A bill to establish a National Land and Resources Management \nCommission to review and make recommendation for reforming management \nof the public land, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n\n\n                THE FEDERAL LANDS MANAGEMENT ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator Craig of \nIdaho, I rise to introduce legislation to help solve a problem that has \nincreasingly plagued public lands States such as my own State of \nMontana and Senator Craig's State of Idaho.\n  For over the past 100 years the Congress has passed many laws \nregarding the use and management of our public lands. These lands were \ncritical to the development of our country, and especially to the \ndevelopment of the West. Therefore, early legislation focused on the \nproduction of commodities from these lands. And they did produce; they \nproduced much of the minerals, timber, food products, and energy that \nenabled our ancestors to build this great Nation. They provided the \nlands and materials to develop our transportation and communications \nsystems. And they provided lands for homesteading and for building our \ncommunities. Very special areas were also set aside in perpetuity as \nnational parks, national monuments, and wildlife refuges.\n  For the last 30 years the emphasis has been on environmental \nprotection, conservation, and nonconsumptive uses. We have greatly \nexpanded our national park and refuge systems from these lands. We have \npreserved millions of acres under special designations such as \nwilderness, wild and scenic rivers, and conservation areas. We have \nprotected additional millions of acres for conservation purposes under \nspecial designations such as withdrawals, exclosures, and areas of \ncritical environmental concern. We have enacted numerous pieces of \nlegislation that require these lands be managed to protect \nenvironmental values in general, such as the National Environmental \nProtection Act, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, the \nNational Forest Management Act, and the Forest Management Practices \nAct. We have enacted legislation which protects individual \nenvironmental values such as air and water quality, soil stability, \nfish and wildlife, and endangered species. We have passed legislation \nwhich requires public land managers to control hazardous and toxic \nmaterials and protect the public health and safety. And we have passed \nlegislation which subjects these lands to State law and oversight. In \nmany instances these laws are not well-crafted, and conflict with one \nanother.\n  We have been one busy group of legislators. These laws were developed \nand passed with very good intentions--to serve the public interest. \nAfter we completed our efforts, the Federal agencies went to work. And \nthey\n have been busy too. The regulatory agencies have created a morasse of \nregulations, some of which attempt to establish their authorities as \nthe ultimate priority for management of the public lands. Some of which \nabuse their authority by extending the interpretation of the laws \nbeyond anything that Congress intended.\n\n  During our debates on Federal agency abuse of regulation under \nregulatory reform, and other proposals, we have heard seemingly \nunending examples of such regulatory abuse. I need mention only a few \nof these laws to bring images of such abuse to mind--the Endangered \nSpecies Act, Superfund, and the Clean Water Act. These laws, and the \nregulations developed to implement them, have been used by the \nregulatory agencies and others to styme or prevent the legitimate use \nof our public lands for purposes that are supported by the public and \napproved by the Congress. Even where the intention of the laws were \nfulfilled in regulation, agencies often found conflicting requirements \nwhen attempting to implement them. Let me give you just one example. \nThe Federal land management agencies find themselves gridlocked by the \nClean Water Act and hazardous materials requirements in trying to \nmitigate environmental problems on old, abandoned mine sites. They \nwould like to correct the water quality problems on these sites, which \nis their responsibility under the Clean Water Act. Up until now they \nhave resisted, and rightly so. To do this would expose them, and thus \nthe taxpayer, to liability for hazardous waste cleanup. Under the \nhazardous materials laws, that is the responsibility of the mine \noperator.\n  Land management agencies complain of confused priorities and \ncolliding mandates under their own authorities. This situation is the \nsame as with the regulatory agencies--there is some justification for \nthis claim, but in part it is a monster of their own creation. For \nexample, land management agencies have had considerable trouble \nmanaging tracts of land for uses such as grazing and timber production \nwhile at the same time providing recreational opportunities. The \nreasons for this are many. To some extent it results from external \nfactors such as conflicts, or perceived conflicts, between competing \nuses. To some extent it is the result of agency procedures, such as a \ncomplex, expensive, time-consuming planning process. These agencies go \nthrough the planning effort, which frequently results in an atmosphere \nof confrontation and deviseness among the user and interest \ncommunities, and usually find their efforts subject to further \nsuccessful challenge. In many cases the plans are never implemented as \nwritten.\n  Even though the agencies have similar mandates, unless otherwise \ndirected these agencies have usually created their regulations \nindependently. Their interpretations\n of the same piece of legislation may be different, and their \nrequirements under a given act well may be entirely different if not in \nconflict. Such problems have become so widely recognized that multiple \nuse of public lands is under legitimate challenge as a viable \nmanagement concept.\n\n  Because of all of this we see a public that is understandably \ndisenchanted over complex and conflicting laws and regulations. And \nthey are increasingly vocal in their frustration over their inability \nto make reasonable use of their \n\n[[Page S 12242]]\nown lands and natural resources. Instead of fulfilling a widely \nsupported and legally established goal of providing products and \nservices from our public lands under the reasonable requirements of \nsustained yield and multiple use, we have natural resource management \ngridlock. And in this era of restructuring of government to improve our \nperformance, there is a wide recognition of duplication of effort, \ninefficiency, and ineffectiveness of the multiple-use agencies in \nmanaging our natural resources.\n  With this in mind, I am offering today, legislation which proposes to \nrevamp the way the public's multiple-use lands are managed. This bill, \nif approved, will create a commission to evaluate and report to the \nCongress and the President changes to be made to improve the management \nof these lands to better meet the public's needs, desires, and \nexpectations. The commission is directed to evaluate and make \nrecommendations in three general areas of land management. They will \nlook into improving the efficiency and effectiveness of current \nmanagement practices. They are to evaluate the land ownership patterns \nand make recommendations to consolidate Federal holdings into a more \nrational pattern. And they are to propose how multiple-use agencies \nmight be combined into one agency for the management of Federal \nmultiple-use lands.\n  In looking at ways to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of \nmanagement practices the commission will evaluate several areas in \nparticular. They will address ways to reduce costs of administrative \noverhead by 50 percent, and to reduce the cost of managing the lands \noverall by at least 30 percent. They are to evaluate ways to dedicate \nmore agency resources to providing service to the public, and to \nimprove the services which they offer to the public. They will propose \nways to simplify the planning and appeals processes. They will review \nand recommend changes to improve the withdrawal process. And they will \nrecommend ways to consolidate the laws under which the agencies \noperate. These are all areas that we have attempted to deal with in the \npast. We address the budget and service items in almost every \nappropriations bill.\n This bill provides us an opportunity to take a consolidated approach \nto dealing with these issues. And the time to do it has arrived.\n\n  The commission will review and recommend rational changes to land \nownership and jurisdiction patterns. They will make recommendations as \nto lands which more properly belong in private ownership or under State \njurisdiction. Land ownership patterns alone have been the source of \nmany of the problems and controversies, and much of the unnecessary \nexpense, associated with the management of public lands. With the \nexception of administrative sites, these agencies have little reason to \nhold lands within city limits, but it is the situation in many western \ncommunities. Federal requirements for such lands are frequently in \nconflict with community development plans and desires. This causes \nneedless problems for the management agencies and the communities \ninvolved.\n  Similarly, there are many areas in the West where Federal holdings \nare intermingled with other ownerships. One good example of this is the \ncheckerboard ownership patterns along the old railroad grant corridors. \nThe ownership changes hands every other square mile. For a Federal \nagency or private landowner trying to manage their holdings this is an \nimpossible situation, and we can and must do something to correct it.\n  The commission will evaluate and recommend the actions needed to \ncombine multiple-use management of public lands under one agency. The \nCongress has recognized the need, and has made unsuccessful attempts, \nto do this in the past. The reasons for previous failure are many. But \nthe timing for this has never been more appropriate. We are seeing the \npublic adamantly demand the elimination of waste, and improved \nefficiency, from their Federal Government. We in the Congress are \nmaking a wide-reaching attempt to find rational, reasonable ways to \nbalance the budget and reduce regulatory burden. And the administration \nis restructuring the bureaucracy to reduce it's size and improve it's \nservices to the public. This proposal will serve all of these goals.\n  Finally, the commission is charged to prepare the report and \nlegislation to implement their recommendations, for the consideration \nof the President and the Congress.\n  The bill contains a fast-track provision. If the Congress can agree \nto the need to create this commission, and to the substance of the \nreport and legislation that the commission is to prepare, then there \nshould be little reason to delay consideration of the legislation \nneeded to get this job done. To delay would only result in continuing \nthe present inefficiencies, costs, conflicts, and duplication that we \nnow see in the management of these public lands and resources.\n  A plan is needed to bring these agencies within budget constraints. \nWe have the opportunity to provide the public with efficiently managed \nlands while doing so. The recent election was a clear message that the \npublic is ready for these changes. I hope that you will join me in \napproving this legislation to fulfill that public demand.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BURNS (for himself and Mr. Murkowski):\n  S. 1152. A bill to amend the Endangered Species Act of 1973 with \ncommonsense amendments to strengthen the act, enhance wildlife \nconservation and management, augment funding, and protect fishing, \nhunting, and trapping; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n\n\n       the common sense amendments for all endangered species act\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Common Sense \nAmendments for All Endangered Species Act.\n  The purpose of the bill is to change specific features of the statute \nso that the ESA cannot be used to attack and diminish wildlife \nconservation programs, sport hunting opportunities, and traditional \nwildlife management. A better ESA and enhanced support for endangered \nspecies protection from America's traditional conservationists--hunters \nand anglers--will be the result of these amendments.\n  Current law does not require that the consequences of listing and \nother actions on hunting and wildlife management be specifically \nexamined. The National Environmental Policy Act mandates review of \ngeneral environmental effects via environmental impact statements, but \nno specific review of effects on hunting is directed.\n  This bill directs the U.S. Fish and Wildlife or Marine Fisheries \nService to review the impacts on hunting, fishing, and fish and \nwildlife management. Simply put, ESA actions must consider effects on \nhunters.\n  In addition, the current law prohibits the taking of protected \nspecies. Taking means harass, harm, et cetera. Harm is defined by FWS \nto prohibit any unintentional acts, including habitat modification, \nwhich annoys protected species. FWS determined that under this \ndefinition, alterations of habitat can be prohibited even if no listed \nanimal suffers harm. This definition can result in the criminalization \nof innocent activities.\n  My commonsense bill amends the Endangered Species Act to ensure \nwildlife management programs and operators are protected from \nunwarranted prosecution.\n  Another aspect to the ESA which needs to be addressed is CITES \n[Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species]. The role \nthat sport hunting plays in conservation is not recognized in CITES. \nFWS has failed to accept the determinations of countries of origin of \nwhich the animals are properly available for hunting and exporting or \nimporting.\n  The bill I am introducing today provides direction to FWS for the \nadministration of the ESA and CITES. The bill reflects the positive \nrole of hunting. The bill also requires that the United States will \naccept the determination of other countries.\n  Section 5 of the bill addresses how other countries' laws interact \nwith U.S. law. It is unclear whether an individual must comply with a \ncountry's Federal and provincial requirements to be in\n compliance with U.S. law. Under present law, all foreign violations \ncan be treated as criminal acts in the United States--even if the \nAmerican doesn't have knowledge of the violation.\n\n  The commonsense bill provides only those laws which are related to \nwildlife \n\n[[Page S 12243]]\nconservation, and can be clearly understood, should carry criminal \nconsequences within the United States.\n  One issue which must be addressed in the authorization is subspecies \nand population criteria. The ESA directs that species which are \nthreatened or endangered be listed as protected under the terms of this \nact. The term ``species '' includes any subspecies and, in the case of \nvertebrate species, any distinct population segment which interbreeds \nwhen mature. This license to list subspecies and population segments is \nproblematic, because it can result in protection of subspecies and \npopulations that are still abundant generally. This splitting of the \nterm ``species'' into a virtually infinite number of subclassifications \noften results in the application of the ESA to situations in which it \noriginally was not intended to apply. This coupled with the look alike \nrules could severely diminish domestic hunting opportunities.\n  This bill amends the ESA to direct the Department of the Interior to \nestablish specific criteria to determine when a group of animals is \nsufficiently distinct to qualify as a subspecies or population.\n  If we really want decisions related to the ESA to be made on sound \nscience, peer review must be included. Under the current listing \nprocess, the Secretary of the Interior may decide to list a species as \nthreatened or endangered, or any interested person can petition the \nSecretary to do so. In either case, the Secretary makes the decision on \nwhether or not to list a species based upon determinations generated \ninternally by the FWS. There are often no public hearings in this \ndecisionmaking process wherein the FWS data is open to scrutiny and \nchallenge.\n  There is also no provision for peer review of the FWS data by \nqualified outside experts. Because the guts of the listing process is \neffectively closed to the public and to scientific peer review, its \ncredibility can be suspect. The lack of genuine public scrutiny and \nscientific evaluation can undermine public support for listing \ndecisions. The Department is also limited by this process. In very \ndifficult issues, the lack of any adjudicative procedures or peer \nreview process makes it hard to get the best scientific data available.\n  The bill I am introducing today authorizes the Secretary to employ, \nat his discretion, an adjudicative process wherein the public has an \nopportunity to scrutinize, evaluate, and challenge the decision to list \na species. Public participation can ensure that all relevant factors \nare considered, proper weight is given to each factor, and the impact \nof listing or not listing is given due consideration and effect.\n  Finally, this bill begins to address the funding problem we face. \nWith more environmental awareness, there has been an increasing cry for \nmore funding of the Federal endangered species program. The hunting and \nfishing sector has traditionally developed its own mechanisms, such as \nexcise taxes to fund such programs. The lion's share of the funding is \nderived from license sales, hunting and fishing stamps, and other \nsportsmen financed measures. Efforts should be made to develop similar \nprograms which ensure that other wildlife supporters, including \nnonhunters, can financially support an enhanced ESA.\n  The commonsense bill directs a study toward developing a funding \nprogram patterned after those supported by sportsmen. The policy would \nprovide that augmented ESA funding would not draw on moneys generated \nby hunting and fishing activities.\n  This bill is designed for sportsmen. These are the true \nconservationists. I believe we need to consider hunting and fishing \nactivities when we discuss the reauthorization of the ESA.\n  Also, I am a cosponsor of S. 768 which was introduced by Senator \nGorton and others earlier this month. I believe S. 768 is a good bill. \nI think the commonsense bill I am introducing today, in conjunction \nwith S. 768, should be considered as the reauthorization of the \nEndangered Species Act moves forward.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BURNS:\n  S. 1154.

In \naddition, the Fort Peck Indian Reservation lacks potable water.\n  This bill would allow for the construction of a water system that \nwill meet many of the water needs of that part of my State.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. COCHRAN (for himself, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Helms, \n        Mr. Warner, Mr. Craig, Mr. Nunn, Mr. Lott, Mr. Johnston, Mr. \n        Breaux, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Mack, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Akaka, Mr. \n        Bumpers, and Mr. McConnell):\n  S. 1155. A bill to extend and revise agricultural price support and \nrelated programs for certain commodities, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n              THE AGRICULTURAL COMPETITIVENESS ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the \nAgricultural Competitiveness Act of 1995.\n  The future of U.S. agriculture depends upon its ability to compete in \nthe world market. This year, U.S. agricultural exports are expected to \nhave a value of nearly $50 billion. Agricultural exports will account \nfor more than 1 million American jobs. By carefully balancing our \npolicy concerns with fiscal restraint, this bill should enhance our \noverall economic health, ensure that U.S. agriculture remains \ncompetitive, and contribute to the elimination of the deficit of the \nFederal Government.\n  The Agricultural Competitiveness Act makes substantial changes in \ncurrent farm programs while dramatically increasing flexibility for \nfarmers.\n  This bill extends and seeks to improve farm policy including the \nmarketing loan, which has allowed U.S. agriculture to remain \ncompetitive in the face of heavily subsidized foreign competition. \nThose foreign subsidies can be expected to continue under terms of the \nGATT Uruguay Round.\n  This legislation also make significant changes in commodity programs \nthat will ensure the American public of a continued source of \naffordable, safe and high quality food and fiber. Farmers will have \ngreatly expanded cropping flexibility--through the modification and \nexpansion of provisions first incorporated in the 1990 Farm Bill.\n  Farmers and agriculture related businesses face new and complex \nuncertainties in the international marketplace, due in part to foreign \ngovernment subsidies. To ensure fair play and to counteract the effect \nof unfair trade practices and governmental actions that put our farmers \nand national interests at a disadvantage, the U.S. Government must \ncontinue to play a partnership role with U.S. farmers.\n  Senators should appreciate that previous reforms have caused \nCommodity Credit Corporation outlays for farm programs to decline from \na high of $26 billion in fiscal year 1986 to less than $9 billion in \nfiscal year 1995, a reduction of 65 percent. According to the \nCongressional Budget Office, farm program outlays are projected to \nremain below this level for the next 7 years, even if no changes are \nmade in current law. In considering changes in farm policies, Congress \nmust consider: the high level of productivity that currently exists in \nU.S. agriculture, the narrowing profit margins faced by farmers and \nprocessors, the precarious nature of land values, the interdependence \nof rural economies and agriculture and the absolute necessity that a \nfarm must secure financing to stay in business.\n  The bill expands cropping flexibility from 25 percent to 100 percent. \nIt allows farmers to respond to market conditions and grow virtually \nany crop they choose on their farms--without providing unnecessary \nfinancial incentives for production shifts. This bill \n\n[[Page S 12244]]\ngoes beyond traditional flexibility. Farmers will have the opportunity \nto expand their production of program crops beyond their historical \nplanting area through the use of traditional soybean acres. This \ninnovative proposal not only will enhance market responsiveness, but \nwill help farmers implement crop rotations, yielding conservation and \nother environmental benefits. Modified acreage reduction requirements \nincluded in this Act will also enhance crop rotation by removing \ndisincentives currently limiting double-cropping.\n  This legislation requires that agriculture will again contribute its \nshare of the savings necessary to achieve a balanced budget through \nmodifications of existing programs, and it increases non-paid base \nprogram crop acres from 15 percent to 25 percent, significantly \nreducing outlays over the next 7 years, according to the Congressional \nBudget Office.\n  The peanut program is substantially revised. It further opens the \nprogram to new producers and more closely ties production limits to \nmarket demand. The sugar program is also reformed to allow U.S. sugar \npolicy to continue to operate at ``no cost'' to the U.S. sugar policy \nto continue to operate at ``no cost'' to the U.S. Treasury. In order to \nmeet the new minimum import obligations require by the GATT and remain \nno cost, a system requiring private industry to equitably carry surplus \nstocks is proposed which is more market oriented and more reliable than \ncurrent policy.\n  The Agricultural Competitiveness Act of 1995 represents cost \neffective and comprehensive reform. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record. \n  There being on objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n   The Agricultural Competitiveness Act of 1995--Section-by-Section \n                                Summary\n\n\n                 sec. 1. short title; table of contents\n\n       Section 1 provides that this act may be cited as the \n     Agricultural Competitiveness Act of 1995 and sets out a table \n     of contents for the bill.\n\n\n                  sec. 2. findings, policy and purpose\n\n       Section 2 sets out certain findings of Congress and states \n     the purpose of the bill, namely to establish agricultural \n     price support and production adjustment programs for the 1996 \n     through 2002 crop years that provide a structure for a sound \n     agricultural economy.\n\n\n        sec. 3. sense of congress on ending the federal deficit\n\n       Section 3 provides that it is the Sense of Congress that \n     significant Federal budget deficits harm the economic well-\n     being of the United States and are detrimental to effective \n     agricultural policy. The section states that agricultural \n     programs should be implemented in a manner that is consistent \n     with the goals of ending Federal budget deficits and should \n     be modified as necessary to ensure that the programs comply \n     with applicable budget reconciliation instructions. Such \n     modifications should adhere to the policy set out in section \n     306 of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal \n     year 1996.\n\n                             Title I--Wheat\n\n\nsec. 101.

Deficiency payments received by \n     producers are the product of a national payment rate, the \n     producer's program payment yield, and the producer's payment \n     acres. The established (target) price for wheat shall not be \n     less than $4.00 per bushel. Deficiency payments are to be \n     made on the higher of the difference between the average \n     market price for the crop year, or the average price for the \n     first 5 months plus 10 cents per bushel, or the loan level.\n\n\n                             payment acres\n\n       Deficiency payments are made available with respect to \n     payment acres.

Under the ARP, the Secretary may require \n     producers to idle up to 25% of the crop acreage base for \n     upland cotton in any one crop year. The Secretary shall \n     implement an ARP program in such a way as to achieve a stocks \n     to use ratio of 29.5% for the 1996 crop and 29% for each of \n     the 1997-2000 crops.

Further, no upland\n      cotton acreage base may be increased for any year the farm \n     is enrolled in the upland cotton program.\n\n\n                  acreage devoted to conservation uses\n\n       Under the ARP, producers must agree to devote a number of \n     acres on the farm to conservation uses (``reduced acres''), \n     in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary. Such \n     regulations shall ensure protection of the acreage from weeds \n     and wind and water erosion. The Secretary may also authorize \n     the planting of approved crops on up to \\1/2\\ of such acres. \n     If such approved crops are planted, the Secretary shall \n     adjust the producer's level of deficiency payments.

If a producer is allowed to adjust \n     the applicable ARP under this program, the producer's \n     applicable established price shall be adjusted by the \n     Secretary in order to ensure this program is operated in a \n     budget neutral manner.\n\n\n                        land diversion payments\n\n       The Secretary may make land diversion payments available to \n     upland cotton producers if it is determined that such \n     payments are necessary to adjust the total national acreage \n     planted to upland cotton to desirable goals. The land \n     diversion program is a voluntary program. In return for a \n     payment offered by the Secretary, producers would agree to \n     idle a specified amount of their upland cotton base. The land \n     diversion payment rates may not be less than 35 cents per \n     pound if ending stocks are projected to be above 8 million \n     bales.

Payment acres are the lesser of the acreage \n     planted to rice or 75% of the rice acreage base less any \n     reduced acreage (the ARP). This has been reduced from 85% in \n     current law.\n\n\n                             50/85 program\n\n       The section also provides for a continuation of the 50/85 \n     program if there is an acreage limitation program in effect. \n     If producers devote more than 15% of their maximum payment \n     acres to conservation uses, the amount so devoted in excess \n     of 15% is considered planted to rice and eligible for \n     payment. To be eligible, the producer must plant at least 50% \n     of the maximum payment acres to rice unless there is a \n     quarantine on the planting of rice or unless the producer is \n     prevented from planting or has a reduced yield because of a \n     natural disaster.\n       In the event the producer is prevented from planting or has \n     a reduced yield, he may devote to conservation uses or to \n     certain alternative crops more than 8 percent of the maximum \n     payment acres and receive a payment as if the acreage were \n     planted to rice. This program is familiarly known as the 0/92 \n     program. The alternative crops are limited to crops for \n     industrial use for which there is no substantial domestic \n     production or market.\n\n\n                             crop insurance\n\n       It is also provided that producers on the farm must obtain \n     catastrophic risk protection insurance coverage as a \n     condition of eligibility for loans and payments.\n                             payment yields\n\n       Section 101B(d) of the 1949 Act provides that farm program \n     yields shall be determined under title V, in the same manner \n     as in current law.\n\n\n                       acreage reduction programs\n\n       Amended section 101B(e) provides authority for a rice \n     acreage reduction program if the supply of rice will likely \n     be excessive, and requires the Secretary to conduct an \n     acreage reduction program so as to result in carry-over \n     stocks being equal to 16.5-20 percent of the average of the \n     total disappearance of rice for the 3 preceding marketing \n     years. If there is an acreage reduction program, a \n     preliminary announcement of the program, including the \n     uniform percentage reduction of the rice acreage base \n     (between 0 and 35%) must be made by December 1 of the year \n     preceding the year in which the crop is harvested, and a \n     final announcement must be made by the following January 31. \n     If there is an acreage reduction program in effect, producers \n     who exceed their permitted acreage of rice are not eligible \n     for loans or payments.\n       The reduction in the base required by the acreage reduction \n     program must be devoted to conservation uses or up to \\1/2\\ \n     of the reduced acres may be devoted to certain designated \n     crops as specified in section 504(b)(1) in which event the \n     deficiency payment received by the producer must be reduced \n     accordingly.\n\n\n                        targeted option payments\n\n       The subsection also proves authority for targeted option \n     payments if there is in effect an acreage reduction program \n     of 20% or less. Under this option, producers may receive an \n     increase in the target price if they increase the acreage \n     limitation percentage (up to 5%) or a decrease in the target \n     price if they decrease the acreage limitation percentage (up \n     to \\1/2\\ the acreage limitation percentage. If offered, the \n     option may not result in any additional program outlays.\n\n\n                          conserving use acres\n\n       The acreage required to be devoted to conservation uses \n     must be protected from weeds and water erosion. Haying and \n     grazing is permitted on the conservation use acreage except \n     during a five consecutive month period between April and \n     October unless there is a natural disaster. Conservation use \n     acreage may also be converted to water storage uses, subject \n     to specified terms and conditions. The reduced acreage and \n     any additional diverted acreage may be devoted to wildlife \n     habitat.\n\n\n                         land diversion program\n\n       The Secretary is also authorized to provide for a land \n     diversion program to assist in adjusting the acreage of rice \n     to desirable goals. Payments may be determined through the \n     submission of bids or other means the Secretary deems \n     appropriate.\n\n\n                      inventory reduction payments\n\n       Amended section 101B(f) provides authority for the \n     Secretary to make inventory reduction payments available to \n     producers in the form of marketing certificates if they forgo \n     obtaining a loan and deficiency payment and reduce their rice \n     acreage by \\1/2\\ the acreage required to be diverted.\n\n\n                             miscellaneous\n\n       Amended sections 101B (g) to (n) contain the same \n     miscellaneous provisions as in current law. They provide \n     authority for equitable relief to producers who fail fully to \n     comply with the program, as well as for assignment of \n     payments, protection of tenants and sharecroppers, the \n     sharing of payments, and prohibits cross-compliance non-\n     recourse, among others.\n\n                           Title V--Oilseeds\n\n\n  sec. 501. price support program for the 1996-2002 crops of oilseeds.\n\n       Section 501 amends section 205 of the Agricultural Act of \n     1949 (the ``1949 Act'') to provide for a price support \n     program for the 1996-2002 crops of oilseeds as follows:\n\n\n                                 loans\n\n       Section 205 of the 1949 Act is amended to require the \n     Secretary to make available loans and purchases to producers \n     of soybeans, sunflower seed, canola, rapeseed, safflower, \n     flaxseed, mustard seed, and other oilseeds for the 1996 \n     through 2002 crops.\n       Loan and purchase levels shall be not less than the greater \n     of either 85% of average prices received by producers in \n     three of the previous five years (disregarding the high and \n     low years) or $5.50 per bushel for soybeans and $9.75 \n     hundredweight for sunflower seed, canola, rapeseed, and \n     flaxseed. Loan and purchase levels for other oilseeds are \n     required to be established in relation to the level for \n     soybeans, except that the level for cottonseed may not be \n     lower than the level for soybeans on a per-pound basis.\n\n\n                        adjustment in loan level\n\n       If the Secretary determines that the loan and purchase \n     level for an oilseed crop will result in outlays in the form \n     of loan deficiency payments, the Secretary is required to \n     reduce the loan and purchase level for the crop in that year \n     to a level that will result in payments not being made. \n     However,\n      the loan and purchase levels may not be established at less \n     than $5.00 per bushel for soybeans and $8.90 per \n     hundredweight for sunflower seed, canola, rapeseed, and \n     flaxseed.\n       If the Secretary adjusts the level of loan and purchases \n     from an oilseed, the Secretary \n\n[[Page S 12247]]\n     is required to submit a report to the House Committee on Agriculture \n     and the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \n     Forestry certifying that the adjustment is necessary to \n     reduce outlays in the form of loan deficiency payments and \n     describing the production, stocks, and price circumstances \n     under which the adjustment is needed. Any reduction in the \n     loan and purchase level for an oilseed crop will not be \n     considered in determining the loan and purchase level for a \n     future crop of that oilseed.\n\n\n                            marketing loans\n\n       Section 205(d) of the 1949 Act provides that the Secretary \n     shall permit producers to repay loans at the lesser of the \n     loan and purchase level for the crop and either the \n     prevailing world price for the oilseed, adjusted to United \n     States quality and location, as determined by the Secretary, \n     or such other level not in excess of the loan and purchase \n     level that the Secretary determines will minimize potential \n     loan forfeitures, accumulation of oilseed stocks by the \n     Federal Government, and the cost of storing oilseeds by the \n     Federal Government, and allow oilseeds produced in the United \n     States to be marketed freely and competitively, both \n     domestically and internationally. The Secretary is required \n     to prescribe by regulation a formula for determining, and a \n     mechanism for periodically announcing, the world market price \n     for oilseeds.\n\n\n                        loan deficiency payments\n\n       The Secretary is required to offer eligible producers who \n     agree to forgo obtaining loans and purchases the option to \n     receive loan deficiency payments. Payments shall be \n     determined by multiplying the loan and purchase payment rate \n     by the quantity of oilseeds for which an eligible producer \n     forgoes the option to place under loan. The loan and purchase \n     rate shall be the difference between the loan and purchase \n     level for the crop and the level at which the loan may be \n     repaid. Payments may be made in the form of certificates \n     redeemable for agricultural commodities owned by the \n     Commodity Credit Corporation. Certificates shall be made \n     available to the extent necessary to minimize the \n     accumulation of oilseed stocks by the CCC.\n\n\n                             marketing year\n\n       The marketing year for soybeans shall be the one-year \n     period beginning on September 1 and ending on August 31. The \n     marketing years for other oilseeds shall be prescribed by the \n     Secretary by regulation. The Secretary shall announce the \n     loan and purchase level for a crop of oilseeds not later than \n     [15 days prior to the first day of the marketing year] in the \n     calendar year in which the crop is harvested.\n\n\n                             loan maturity\n\n       A loan made for a crop of oilseeds shall mature on the last \n     day of the 9th month following the month in which application \n     for the loan is made, except that the loan may not mature \n     later than the last day of the fiscal year in which the \n     application is made.\n\n\n                        miscellaneous provisions\n\n       The Secretary shall not require participation in any \n     production adjustment program for oilseeds or any other \n     commodity as a condition of eligibility for loans and \n     purchases for oilseeds. The Secretary may not authorize \n     payments to producers to cover the cost of storing oilseeds. \n     Oilseeds may not be considered an eligible commodity for any \n     reserve program.\n       The Secretary is authorized to issue such regulations as \n     determined necessary to carry out this section, and shall \n     carry out the program authorized by this section through the \n     Commodity Credit Corporation.\n       Section 205, as amended, shall be effective only for the \n     1996 through 2002 crop of oilseeds.\n\n                           TITLE VI--PEANUTS\n\n\n    sec. 601. suspension of marketing quotas and acreage allotments\n\n       Section 601 of the bill makes section 358(a) through \n     (j)\\1\\, section 358a(a) through (j)\\2\\ section 359(a), (b), \n     (d), and (e), section 371\\3\\, and Part I of subtitle C of \n     title III\\4\\, of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 \n     inapplicable to the 1996 through 2002 crops of peanuts.\n\n\n       sec. 602. national poundage quotas and acreage allotments\n\n       Section 602 of the bill makes various changes to the \n     current provisions of section 358-1 of the Agricultural \n     Adjustment Act of 1938 as follows:\n       The bill directs the Secretary to estimate the quantity of \n     peanuts and peanut products to be imported into the United \n     States for the marketing year as part of the required annual \n     estimate of domestic consumption.\n       The bill repeals the current floor (minimum level) at which \n     the national poundage quota may be established for any \n     marketing year.\n       The bill repeals the authority to increase farm poundage \n     quotas based on undermarketings (the quantity by which a farm \n     poundage quota for a marketing year exceeds the actual \n     peanuts produced and marketed on the farm) from previous \n     years.\n       The bill repeals the provisions authorizing a special \n     poundage quota allocation process for Texas.\n       The bill authorizes the Secretary to annually allocate \n     temporary quota to each peanut producer for purposes of \n     acquiring seed for planting the producer's crop of peanuts \n     for that year.\n       The bill tightens the eligibility criteria for the purposes \n     of determining if a farm's poundage quota should be \n     ``considered produced'' by allowing quota to either be \n     voluntarily released or leased (but not both) \\6\\ during 1 of \n     the 3 previous years.\n       The bill repeals the current limitation \\7\\ on the \n     allocation of farm poundage quota that has been reduced or \n     voluntarily released to farms with no quota. The amended \n     provision requires the reallocation to farms without quota to \n     be limited only by the average production history of the \n     farms.\n\n\n       sec. 603. sale, lease, or transfer of farm poundage quota\n\n       Section 603 of the bill makes various changes to the \n     current quota transfer provisions of section 358b of the \n     Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 as follows:\n       The bill allows farm poundage quota to be transferred to \n     another farm across county lines but within the same State if \n     both farms have been in common ownership or control for the 3 \n     previous years or if both farms are located in a State with \n     10,000 tons or more quota (subject to an annual and an \n     overall limitation on the amount of quota that is eligible \n     for an out of county transfer).\n       The bill allows farm poundage quota to be transferred after \n     the normal planting season (fall lease transfer) to another \n     farm across county lines but within the same State.\n\n\n    sec. 604. marketing penalties; disposition of additional peanuts\n\n       Section 604 of the bill extends the effective period of the \n     current provisions of section 358e of the Agricultural \n     Adjustment Act of 1938 \\8\\ to include the 1996 through 2002 \n     crops and expands the application of the current penalty for \n     reentry of exported additional peanuts to include peanut \n     products.\n\n\n              sec. 605. experimental and research programs\n\n       Section 605 of the bill extends the effective period of \n     section 358c of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 \\9\\ \n     to include the 1996 through 2002 crops.\n\n\n                    sec. 606. price support program\n\n       Section 606 amends section 108B of the 1949 Act to extend \n     for 7 years the current law requirements for the Secretary to \n     provide price support to producers of peanuts through loans, \n     purchases, and other operations through the 2002 crop of \n     peanuts.\n       The bill limits the allowable amount of decrease (as well \n     as increase) that may be made in the national average quota \n     support rate for a crop of peanuts to not more than 5 percent \n     of the rate for the preceding crop.\n       The bill limits the eligibility for entry into or \n     participation in the New Mexico area marketing association \n     established pools to peanuts produced within the State of New \n     Mexico.\n       The bill repeals the provision of current law that require \n     losses in one production area quota pool to be offset by \n     gains or profits from pools in other production areas (area \n     cross compliance). The bill adds a requirement that losses in \n     an area quota pool must be offset by any gains from the sale \n     of additional peanuts by any producer that is in the quota \n     pool.\n       The bill adds a provision to clarify that all peanuts in \n     the domestic market, including imported peanuts, must comply \n     with all quality standards, and that importers must comply \n     with inspection, handling, storage, and processing \n     requirements, under Marketing Agreement No. 146. The bill \n     also adds a provision to require peanuts produced for export \n     to comply with inspection, handling, storage, and processing \n     requirements under Marketing Agreement No. 146.\n       The bill extends the requirement for the Secretary to \n     provide for the collection of a marketing assessment, \n     applicable to each of the 1996 through\n      2002 crops of peanuts, equal to 1.2 percent of the national \n     average support rate.\n\n                            Title VII--Sugar\n\n       Title VII of the bill amends section 206 of the Agriculture \n     Act of 1949 to authorize and direct the Secretary to provide \n     price support for the 1996 through 2002 crops of sugar beets \n     and sugar cane. Section 902 of the Food Security Act of 1985 \n     provides that such sugar programs are to be operated in a \n     manner so as to be no cost to the U.S. Government; this \n     provision continues unamended. Title VII also provides for \n     the amendment of part VII of the Agricultural Adjustment Act \n     of 1938 to establish marketing assessment bases for sugarcane \n     and sugar beet processors and cane sugar refiners.\n\n\n                     sec. 701. sugar price support\n\n       Section 701 of the bill amends section 206 of the \n     Agriculture Act of 1949 as follows:\n\n\n                         loan and price support\n\n       Section 206, as amended, provides that the price of each of \n     the 1996 through 2002 crops of sugar beets and sugarcane must \n     be supported by the Secretary of Agriculture and fixes the \n     support level for the price of domestically grown sugarcane \n     for this period at 18 cents per pound for raw cane sugar, and \n     for domestically grown sugar beets at the basic loan rate \n     level for the 1994 crop of sugar beets. The price support is \n     implemented through nonrecourse loans provided by the \n     Commodity Credit Corporation. Section 206, as amended, \n     provides the Secretary with authority to adjust these fixed \n     price support levels for each of the 1997 through 2002 crops \n     of sugarcane and sugar beets when the Secretary deems it \n     appropriate, taking into account such factors as changes in \n     the cost of sugar products, the cost of domestic sugar \n     production, and other circumstances that may adversely affect \n     domestic sugar production.\n     \n[[Page S 12248]]\n\n\n\n                           market assessments\n\n       Section 206, as amended, also establishes market \n     assessments for raw cane sugar, beet sugar, and imported \n     sugar. Two tiers of assessment are established in subsection \n     206(i). The tier 1 assessment is applicable to the first \n     processor of sugarcane and sugar beets for raw cane sugar and \n     beet sugar which fall within the processor's base as \n     established by the Secretary under the Agricultural \n     Adjustment Act of 1938, as amended by this bill, and to \n     imported raw cane sugar. The assessment rate in tier 1 for \n     marketings of raw cane sugar processed from domestically \n     produced sugarcane or sugarcane molasses marketed during the \n     1997 through 2003 fiscal years is equal to 1.1% of the loan \n     level established by the Secretary to support the price of \n     domestically grown sugar cane (but not more than 0.198 cents \n     per pound of raw cane sugar); the tier 1 assessment for beet \n     sugar processed from domestically produced sugar beets or \n     sugar beet molasses marketed during the 1997 through 2003 \n     fiscal years is equal to 1.1794% of the loan level \n     established by the Secretary to support the price of \n     domestically grown sugar beets (but not more than 0.2123 \n     cents per pound of beet sugar). These tier 1 assessments \n     apply only to marketed beet sugar and raw cane sugar within \n     the processor's base. For imported raw cane sugar, the tier 1 \n     assessment which must be paid by each holder of a certificate \n     of quota eligibility for such sugar imported into the United \n     States is the same amount that would be applicable to the \n     first processor of U.S. produced sugarcane during the fiscal \n     year. For refined sugar, whether from sugar beets or \n     sugarcane, imported into the United States, each holder of a \n     certificate of quota eligibility must pay a tier 1 assessment \n     in the amount applicable to the first processor of U.S. \n     produced sugar beets during the fiscal year. In all cases, \n     the assessment is paid to the Commodity Credit Corporation, \n     and the assessment is nonrefundable.\n       The tier 2 non-refundable marketing assessment established \n     under subsection 206(i) is applicable to marketings of raw \n     cane sugar or beet sugar during the 1997 through 2003 fiscal \n     years which are in excess of the processor's or the cane \n     sugar refiner's assessment base as established by the \n     Secretary under the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, as \n     amended by this bill. The tier 2 assessment for fiscal 1997 \n     is an amount equal to 100% of the loan level established for \n     marketings of raw cane sugar or beet sugar in fiscal 1997. \n     For each fiscal year thereafter through fiscal year 2001, the \n     assessment rate is reduced by three percentage points per \n     year, so that the assessment rate is 97% of the applicable \n     loan level for marketings for the 1998 fiscal year, 94% for \n     the 1999 fiscal year, 91% for the 2000 fiscal year, and 88% \n     for the fiscal years 2001 through 2003. The first processor \n     of sugarcane or sugar beets, or the refiner of cane sugar, as \n     the cane may be, must remit the assessment to the Commodity \n     Credit Corporation.\n\n\n                        supply of raw cane sugar\n\n       Subsection 206(j) of the 1949 Act, as amended, authorizes \n     the Secretary to assure the U.S. supply of raw cane sugar. It \n     provides that whenever for 7 consecutive market days the \n     price for raw cane sugar for the nearest future contract \n     month averages more than 128 percent of the loan rate \n     specified for raw cane sugar, the Secretary must, within 3 \n     market days, use all available authorities to increase the \n     supply of raw cane sugar, in increments of not less than \n     50,000 tons, to a level sufficient to reduce the average \n     price for raw cane sugar to equal to or less than 128 percent \n     of the loan rate.\n       There is an exception to the authority of the Secretary to \n     take this action. The Secretary must not take any action if, \n     for the same 7 consecutive market days in which the price for \n     raw cane sugar for the nearest future contract month averages \n     more than 128 percent of the loan rate for raw cane sugar, \n     the average bulk, FOB factory net price for refined beet \n     sugar reported by all sellers is more than 128 percent of \n     such average price for raw cane sugar for such nearest future \n     contract month.\n\n\n    sec. 702. marketing assessment bases for processors and refiners\n\n       Section 702 of the bill amends part VII of subtitle B of \n     title III of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 (7 \n     U.S.C. 1359aa et seq.) (the ``1938 Act''), effective October \n     1, 1996, to provide for marketing assessment bases for sugar \n     processors and refiners as follows:\n\n\n              establishment of marketing assessment bases\n\n       Section 359b of the 1938 Act, as amended, requires that the \n     Secretary impose, for each of the fiscal years 1997 through \n     2003, marketing assessment bases for processors of sugar \n     processed from domestically produced sugarcane and sugar \n     beets and for cane sugar refiners. The marketing assessment \n     bases are to be based on the Secretary's estimate of sugar \n     consumption in the United States for such fiscal year.\n\n\n               calculation of marketing assessment bases\n\n       Section 359c of the 1938 Act, as amended, provides for the \n     calculation of marketing assessment bases and requires the \n     Secretary to establish marketing assessment bases for sugar \n     in each of the fiscal years 1997 through 2003. The Secretary \n     must first establish the overall quantity of sugar to be \n     distributed for the fiscal year, referred to as the overall \n     base. This overall base is to be set on the basis of the \n     Secretary's estimate of sugar consumption for the fiscal \n     year, and must be adjusted to the maximum extent practicable \n     to prevent the acquisition of sugar by the Commodity Credit \n     Corporation.\n       Section 359c requires that once the overall base quantity \n     is established for a fiscal year, it must be distributed \n     among sugar derived from sugar beets and sugar derived from \n     sugarcane in the proportion of 47% for sugar derived from \n     sugar beets; and 53% sugar derived from sugarcane, including \n     raw cane sugar imported from foreign countries for \n     consumption in the United States.\n       Subsection (d) of Section 359c provides that this initial \n     distribution of the base between sugar derived from sugar \n     beets and sugar derived from sugarcane is subject to a \n     required further distribution to establish three bases. The \n     first of these bases is the base for sugar derived from sugar \n     beets, which for a fiscal year is a quantity equal to the \n     product of multiplying the overall base quantity for the \n     fiscal year by 47%. The second base is a base for sugar \n     derived from sugarcane, which for a fiscal year is the \n     quantity obtained by subtracting 1,257,000 short tons, raw \n     value, from the quantity equal to the product of multiplying \n     the overall base quantity for the fiscal year by 53%. The \n     third base is the base for refined cane sugar, which is the \n     quantity equal to the product of multiplying the overall base \n     quantity for the fiscal year by 53%.\n       Section 359c further provides that the base for sugar \n     derived from sugarcane must be distributed among the five \n     States in the United States (considering Puerto Rico as a \n     ``State'' for this purpose) in which sugarcane is produced in \n     a fair and equitable manner on the basis of past marketings \n     of sugar processed from sugarcane in the 2 highest years of \n     production from each States from the 1990 through 1994 \n     crops), processing capacity, and the ability of processors to \n     market the sugar covered under the base.\n       Section 359c also provides for the adjustment of the \n     marketing assessment bases. Whenever the weighted average \n     bulk, FOB factory/refinery net price (including the price of \n     representative consumer and industrial products, adjusted to \n     a bulk basis) reported by all sellers of refined sugar for \n     any week is more than 111 per cent of the average bulk, FOB \n     factory price for refined beet sugar for the fiscal years \n     1990 through 1994, the Secretary may increase the marketing \n     assessment bases of cane sugar refiners and sugar beet \n     processors. Whenever the weighted average bulk FOB factory/\n     refinery net price (including the price of representative \n     consumer and industrial products, adjusted to a bulk basis) \n     reported by all sellers of refined sugar for any week is less \n     than 104 percent of the average FOB factory price for refined \n     beet sugar for the fiscal years 1990 through 1994, the \n     Secretary must decrease the marketing assessment bases of \n     cane sugar refiners, sugar beet processors, and cane sugar \n     processors, but must maintain the minimum access level for \n     imports of sugar set forth in the Harmonized Tariff Schedules \n     of the United States.\n\n\n               distribution of marketing assessment bases\n\n       Section 359d of the 1938 Act, as amended, provides for the \n     distribution of marketing assessment bases to individual \n     processors and refiners. The Secretary must distribute each \n     of the three bases provided for under subsection (d) of \n     section 359c for each of the fiscal years 1997 through 2003 \n     among the processors or cane sugar refiners covered by the \n     base in a fair, efficient and equitable manner. In the case \n     of distributing the cane sugar assessment base among \n     processors, the Secretary is required to take into \n     consideration processing capacity, past marketings of sugar, \n     and the ability of each processor to market sugar covered by \n     that proportion of the base distributed. Further, with \n     respect to distribution the beet sugar assessment base among \n     processors of sugar beets, the Secretary is required to \n     assign processor bases in accordance with each processor's \n     highest amount of\n      sugar produced in any year from sugar beets produced from \n     the 1990 through the 1994 crops. In making these \n     distributions to processors and refiners from the \n     assessments bases, the Secretary is also required to make \n     reasonable provisions for new processors and refiners.\n\n\n                        reassignment of deficits\n\n       Section 359e of the 1938 Act, as amended, provides for the \n     reassignment of any deficits in the marketing of an \n     assessment base. If the Secretary determines that any \n     sugarcane processor who has received a share of a State cane \n     sugar assessment base will be unable to market the \n     processor's share of the State's cane sugar base for the \n     fiscal year, the Secretary must first reassign the estimated \n     quantity of the deficit to the bases for other processors \n     within that State; if after such reassignments the deficit \n     cannot be completely eliminated, the Secretary must then \n     reassign the remaining part of the estimated quantity of the \n     deficit proportionately to the bases for other cane sugar \n     States; and finally, if after these second reassignments, the \n     deficit still cannot be completely eliminated, the Secretary \n     is to reassign the remainder to imports. With respect to beet \n     sugar, if the Secretary determines that a sugar beet \n     processor who has received a share of the beet sugar \n     assessment base will be unable to market its share, the \n     Secretary must first reassign the estimated quantity of the \n     deficit to the bases for other sugar beet processors; if \n     after such reassignments the deficit cannot be completely \n     eliminated, the Secretary must reassign the remainder to \n     imports. If the Secretary determines that a \n\n[[Page S 12249]]\n     cane sugar refiner who has received a share of the cane sugar \n     assessment base will be unable to market that share, the \n     Secretary must reassign the estimated quantity of the deficit \n     to the bases of other refiners, as the Secretary deems \n     appropriate.\n\n\n                   provisions applicable to producers\n\n       Section 359f of the 1938 Act directs the Secretary, for \n     each of the fiscal years 1997 through 2003, to obtain from \n     processors such assurances as the Secretary deems adequate \n     that the assessment base will be shared among producers \n     served by the processors in a fair and equitable manner that \n     adequately reflects producers' production histories, and to \n     resolve through arbitration by the Secretary on the request \n     of either party any dispute between a processor and a \n     producer, or group of producers, with respect to the sharing \n     of the processor's allocation.\n       Section 359f also directs the Secretary, in any case in \n     which a State share of an assessment base is established \n     under subsection (e) of section 359c and there are in excess \n     of 250 producers in the State to which it applies, to make a \n     determination, for each such State share of an assessment \n     base, whether the production of sugar, in the absence of \n     proportionate shares, will be greater than the quantity \n     needed to enable processors to fill the State share of the \n     assessment base and provide a normal carryover inventory. If \n     the Secretary determines this to be the case for a fiscal \n     year, considering the\n      amount of sugar processed from all crops by all processors \n     covered by such State base, then the Secretary must \n     establish a proportionate share for each sugarcane \n     producing farm that limits the acreage of sugarcane that \n     may be harvested on the farm for sugar or seed during the \n     fiscal year, with each such proportionate share subject to \n     adjustment for natural disaster or other condition beyond \n     the control of producers.\n\n\n             Sec. 703. Prevention of Sugar Loan Forfeitures\n\n       Section 703 of title VI amends section 902(c)(2)(A) of the \n     Food Security Act of 1985--which provides that the Secretary \n     is to report to the President any sugar imports from Cuba by \n     certain countries exporting sugar to the United States--by \n     extending its applicability to August 1, 2002.\n\n                Title VIII--General Commodity Provisions\n\n       Significant adjustments have been made in the General \n     Provisions to increase planting flexibility and comply with \n     deficit reduction targets. Increased flexibility is provided \n     in two ways: (1) by expanding so-called optimal flex acres \n     from 10% of permitted acres to 100% of permitted acres and \n     (2) by providing new authority to allow producers to plant up \n     to 25% of their historical oilseed acreage to a program crop. \n     In both cases, the crop ``flexed'' would be eligible for loan \n     but not deficiency payments.\n\n\n            Sec. 801. Deficiency and Land Diversion Payments\n\n       Section 801 amends section 114 of the 1949 Act to continue \n     the authority of the Secretary of Agriculture to make advance \n     deficiency payments.\n\n\n               Sec. 802. Adjustment of Established Prices\n\n       Section 802 extends the authority contained in section \n     402(b) of the 1949 Act through the 2002 crops.\n\n\n                 Sec. 803. Adjustment of Support Prices\n\n       Section 803 extends the authority contained in section \n     403(c) of the 1949 Act through the 2002 crops.\n\n\n       Sec. 804. Program Option for the 1003 and Subsequent Crops\n\n       Section 804 amends section 406 of the 1949 Act to provide \n     the Secretary with the authority to offer optional programs \n     for the 2003 and subsequent crop years that are similar to \n     those provided in the 1949 Act for the 2002 crops.\n\n\n     Sec. 805. Application of Terms in the Agricultural Act of 1949\n\n       Section 805 amends section 408(k)(3) of the 1949 Act to \n     make its terms applicable to the 1996-2002 crops.\n\n\n                Sec. 806. Acreage Base and Yield System\n\n       Title V of the 1949 Act is basically extended and made \n     applicable to the 1996 through 2002 crops of wheat, feed \n     grains, upland cotton and rice. Section 806 changes current \n     law governing planting flexibility as follows:\n       Increases current planting flexibility from 25% to 100%. \n     Producers can effectively respond to market signals by \n     planting alternative crops on up to 100% of their crop \n     acreage base without penalty and without market-distorting \n     financial incentives; and\n       Provides producers with ability to plant program crops on \n     up to 25% of their historical soybean acreage, without losing \n     program eligibility and without market-distorting financial \n     incentives. Any program crop planted under this provision \n     will retain loan eligibility.\n\n\n                     Secs. 811. Payment Limitations\n\n       Section 811 extends the application of payment limitations \n     as provided in title X of the Food Security Act of 1985 to \n     the 1996 through 2002 crops.\n\n\n         Sec. 812-831. Miscellaneous and Conforming Amendments\n\n       Sections 812 through 831 of the bill contain various \n     miscellaneous and conforming amendments either extending \n     certain provisions of law or making necessary modifications \n     to current law to conform with the provisions of the \n     agricultural Competitiveness act of 1995.\n     \\1\\ Section 358 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 \n     requires the Secretary to establish and apportion a national \n     marketing quota and a national acreage allotment for the \n     production of peanuts.\n     \\2\\ Section 358a of the Act provides for the sale, lease, and \n     transfer of peanut acreage allotments.\n     \\3\\ Section 371 of the Act provides for the adjustment of \n     marketing quotas and acreage allotments for cotton, rice, \n     peanuts, or tobacco based on the supply of the commodity \n     involved.\n     \\4\\ Part I provides for the publication and review of \n     marketing quotas and acreage allotments for tobacco, corn, \n     wheat, cotton, peanuts, and rice.\n     \\5\\ Section 358-1(a)(1) of current law prohibits the \n     secretary from establishing the national poundage quota for a \n     marketing year at less than 1,350,000 tons.\n     \\6\\ Section 358-1(b)(4) of the Act provides that quota will \n     be considered produced if it is either voluntarily released \n     during 1 of the 3 previous years or leased during 1 of the 3 \n     previous years (or both).\n     \\7\\ Section 358-1(b)(6)(B) of the Act provides that not more \n     than 25 percent of such quota may be reallocated to farms for \n     which no quota was established for the preceding year.\n     \\8\\ Section 358e of the Act provides for the handling and \n     disposal of peanuts and establishes penalties for the \n     marketing of peanuts in excess of the established poundage \n     quota.\n     \\9\\ Section 358c of the Act authorizes the Secretary to \n     permit not more than 1 tenth of 1 percent of the basic quota \n     for a State to be utilized for experimental and research \n     purposes.\n                                                                    ____\n\n     Key Provisions of the Agricultural Competitiveness Act of 1955\n\n       Maintains the current basic structure of our highly \n     successful farm programs (contains the freeze on target \n     prices and maintains from marketing loan program for wheat, \n     feedgrains, cotton, and rice).\n       Requires farm policies to be modified in order to meet the \n     Balanced Budget Reconciliation Instruction--Increases non-\n     paid base acres from 15% to 25%.\n       Allows for 100% flexibility; increases the Optional Flex \n     Acres (OFA) from 10% to 100% of program crop acreage base. \n     This will allow producers to more effectively respond to \n     market signals by being able to plant eligible alternative \n     crops on up to 100% of their program base acres without being \n     penalized by having their base acreage reduced in the \n     following crop year.\n       Provides farmers the option for up to 25% two-way \n     flexibility. This will enable farmers to produce program \n     crops on up to 25% of historical soybean acres. In essence, \n     this provision further allows farmers to respond to market \n     signals by enabling them to plant up to 25% of their \n     historical soybean acres to program crops which will be \n     eligible for loan participation.\n       Allows the Secretary to increase soybean and minor oilseed \n     marketing loan rates up to 85% of their 5 year average market \n     price or $5.50 per bushel and $9.75 per hundred weight, \n     respectively, if the Secretary determines that these rates \n     will be budget neutral. The minimum market loan rate for \n     soybeans and minor oilseeds are increased to $5.00 per bushel \n     and $8.90 per hundred weight respectively.\n       Eliminates any ARP requirements for oilseeds which are \n     double cropped with program crops.\n       The Peanut program is reformed to move it toward no \n     government cost, further opening the program to new producers \n     and more closely tying production limits to market demand. \n     Removes the limitations on the Secretary to control the cost \n     of the program by giving the Secretary full discretion to \n     adjust the amount of peanuts eligible for domestic price \n     support so production will better equal market demand. \n     Undermarketings are eliminated (the current practice of \n     allowing unproduced quota to be produced the following year). \n     Program benefits to producers will be reduced, but government \n     costs will be dramatically reduced and the program made more \n     responsible to imports and market demand.\n       The Sugar program is reformed to allow U.S. Sugar policy to \n     continue its 1985 mandate to operate at a ``no cost'' to the \n     U.S. Treasury. Marketing assessments imposed beginning in \n     1991 on sugar sales would continue at current levels and \n     extended to imports, providing over $30 million per year \n     toward federal deficit reduction. There are no payments to \n     sugar producers. The 18 cent per pound loan rate for raw \n     sugar remains at the 1985 level. In order to meet the new \n     minimum import obligations required by the GATT and remain no \n     cost, a system requiring private industry to equitably carry \n     surplus stocks is proposed which is more market oriented and \n     more reliable than current policy. The reform proposal also \n     includes new consumer price projections.\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I join my distinguished colleague \nfrom Mississippi, Senator Cochran, in cosponsoring the Agricultural \nCompetitiveness Act of 1995. This legislation represents stability in \nthe most important business sector of this Nation. Farmers and ranchers \nof this country continue to produce the most affordable and abundant \nfood and fiber supply in the world and this bill helps to ensure they \npersist in this role for the next 7 years and beyond.\n  Senator Cochran and I have cosponsored legislation many times in past \nfarm bill debates. As agriculture is so important to the States of \nArkansas and Mississippi, we have always strived to put forth policy \nideas that provide agriculture the necessary fundamental tools to \nsurvive. The legislation we are \n\n[[Page S 12250]]\nintroducing today accomplishes this consistent goal.\n  Mr. President, the farmers and ranchers in Arkansas have made one \nvery important point to me as we enter this year's farm bill debate--\nU.S. agriculture policy has served America very well. The consumers of \nthis country spend less of their disposable income on food than any \nother country in the world. Farm programs, that represent only 0.6 \npercent of the Federal budget, guarantee a reliable supply of food and \nfiber products at the best prices.\n  However, with an ever increasing global marketplace, the success of \nfarms in the delta of Arkansas is becoming more dependent on policies \nin Canada, the European Union, or even Japan. Because of these \nincreasing uncertainties and the willingness of competitor countries to \nheavily subsidize, we must have policies in place to assist our farmers \nwho are directly competing against foreign treasuries. This legislation \naddresses this important point and helps to protect the food and fiber \nsecurity of our country.\n  Mr. President, the legislation we are introducing today also provides \nsignificant but responsible change. Flexibility, being the buzz word in \nthis year's farm bill debate, is expanded. Farmers can respond to a \nchanging market by planting alternative crops on up to 100 percent of \ntheir crop acreage base without being penalized by losing base acres in \nthe following crop year. Additionally, our flexibility is provided as a \nchoice to the farmer without market-distorting financial incentives.\n  This farmer-oriented legislation also addresses the continuing budget \npressures faced by the government. Although I did not support the \nbalanced budget amendment or the budget resolution this year because I \nbelieve they went too far too fast, I obviously recognize that there \nwill have to be some reductions. However, I believe this should be done \nin a responsible fashion. when faced with painful budget cutting \nchoices, farmers have generally preferred an increase in nonpaid acres \nrather than other more drastic approaches.\n  Our legislation prudently increases nonpaid acres from 15 to 25 \npercent over the next 7 years, significantly reducing Federal outlays. \nFurther, the bill recognizes the budget reconciliation instructions the \nAgriculture Committee will have to consider. I still believe the cuts \nbeing forced on agriculture are far too drastic and don't recognize the \nfact that we have paid more than our fair share and will continue to \nsupport efforts to reduce this financial burden during the budget \nreconciliation process. However, in working to find responsible ways \nfor farmers and ranchers to contribute their fair share, this bill does \naddress a responsible way of meeting certain budget obligations.\n  In summary, Mr. President, this legislation improves upon policies \nthat have served this country well. With these improvements, \nagriculture will better be able to meet the new challenges of a world \neconomy.\n Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, it has become increasingly \napparent that the 1995 farm bill will be a comprehensive debate on the \nfuture of American agriculture not only in the face of tight Federal \nbudget constraints, but also under new competitive realities brought on \nby the passage of the NAFTA and GATT trade agreements. In this debate, \nmy colleagues and I are challenged to design a plan that will protect \nproduction agriculture and the fragile rural economies it supports \nwhile meeting necessary spending reductions that will eventually bring \nus to our imperative goal of a balanced federal budget.\n  In order to meet the competitive challenges we face in regard to our \nnation's commodity programs, my distinguished colleague from \nMississippi, Senator Cochran, has carefully crafted a bill titled the \nAgricultural Competitiveness Act of 1995. For his leadership in this \nregard, I would like to commend the Senator and join his effort by \ncosponsoring this legislation. This bill, of which I am a coauthor, \nwill provide a steady direction for production agriculture over the \nnext 7 years. It also offers a commitment to programmatic changes \nnecessary to meet all spending reductions required by the Senate \nAgriculture Committee.\n  Production leaders of each commodity program contained in this bill \nhave actively participated in its formulation and have been extremely \ncooperative in working toward our goals. Particular credit should go to \nour leaders in the peanut industry who have accepted the challenge to \nreform and have delivered a significant product. It could be argued \nthat the peanut industry has made more substantive changes in its \nprogram than any other commodity program we currently administer. Our \nreformed peanut title was taken directly from the positions established \nby the National Peanut Growers Group, the Nation's largest grower \norganization, who labored over several months to make the tough \ndecisions required of them.\n  A review of our title will indicate substantive change. We have moved \nthe program toward no Government cost, opened the opportunities for \ngreater participation and have become more market oriented. It should \nbe mentioned that these peanut title reforms do not come without pain \nfor our growers. This legislation will represent a nearly 30 percent \ndecrease in peanut farmer income. In addition, USDA has estimated that \nwe will save at least $500 million over the life of this bill from the \ndifficult changes we have made. And, it is these very changes that \nrepresent our true commitment to budgetary responsibility.\n  We have eliminated almost all government cost and responded to \ncompetitive demands with the following five program changes:\n  First, elimination of the statutory minimum quota floor.\n  The Secretary of Agriculture is granted the authority to set the \namount of quota peanuts eligible for domestic price support equal to \nmarket demand. This provision it will eliminate the recent Government \nsurpluses of peanuts that must be crushed for oil at tremendous losses \nto the American taxpayer.\n  Second, elimination of undermarketings.\n  This provision will help insure government cost reductions by ending \ncarry-over of quota to future crop years. It has been estimated that if \nundermarketings had been eliminated in the 1994 crop year, we would \nhave saved $60 million.\n  Third, price support to decrease with farm production cost decreases.\n  The price support for peanut growers would be allowed to decrease up \nto 5 percent with reductions in farm production costs. Currently, the \ncost of production model allows only for increases in prices support. \nThis is a market-oriented measure designed to keep the support price \ncompetitive and reduce Government cost.\n  Fourth, provide all peanut growers with quota for seed.\n  Fairness is the issue here. Our quota growers have agreed to provide \nany peanut grower with quota equal to the approximate amount of seed \nthey plant each year. This addresses the concerns about seed costs of \nsome farmers who grow peanuts primarily for the export market.\n  Fifth, allowance of cross-county line sale and transfer of quota.\n  This provision would allow 40 percent of our total quota to be \ntransferred or sold across county lines over the life of the bill. \nAllowing nearly half of our Nation's quota to go to the most efficient \ngrowing areas is good policy from a production standpoint. This change \nis also a strong argument against those critics saying the peanut \nprogram operates behind closed doors.\n  These positive changes offered in this bill by our peanut producers, \ncoupled with our cotton growers commitment to meeting necessary \nspending requirements, are strong signs of their commitment to the \nfuture of not only Georgia agriculture, but our nation's as a whole. \nAgain, I commend my colleague from Mississippi for his leadership in \nthis process and look forward to working with him in crafting a final \nproduct that will sustain the future of rural America.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, no other legislation likely to come before \nCongress this year will have more direct impact on my State of North \nCarolina, and the people who live there, than the 1995 farm bill. For \nan agriculture State that ranks third as the most diversified \nagribusiness State in the country, the farm bill is critically \nimportant legislation.\n  I commend the Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran] for leading the \n\n[[Page S 12251]]\n  way in maintaining the support of the agricultural commodities that \ngive American consumers peace of mind by providing the safest, most \naffordable, and most abundant food supply in the world.\n  Mr. President, when Congress begins the debate on this legislation, \nit is essential that we focus on fundamental reform. The time for farm \nprogram facelifts is rapidly approaching--and overdue in some \ninstances. It is time for real change, change that will return farm \nprograms to their fundamental and original mission: helping family \nfarmers survive and prosper. Today, along with the other cosponsors of \nthis commodity title of the 1995 farm bill, I can report that there is \nreal reform for the peanut program.\n  Permit me to highlight a few of the significant changes that have \nbeen made to the peanut program:\n  First, it eliminates Government cost through reducing the amount of \npeanuts subject to government support.\n  Second, allows the sale and transfer of quota across country lines.\n  Third, provides all growers quota to cover seed requirements.\n  Fourth, allows the support level to fluctuate with cost of \nproduction.\n  These sacrifices will cost at least $110 million annually in income \nto our growers.\n  Mr. President, much of a negative nature has been said about peanuts \nthis year. The peanut portion of the commodity title addresses major \nchanges that the growers have supported wholeheartedly. The peanut \nprogram is one of the most important programs not only to my State, but \nto all Southern States.\n  Critics have asserted, mistakenly, that the peanut program costs \nconsumers hundreds of millions of dollars each year in higher prices. \nThis is simply not true. In fact, according to the USDA, 74 percent of \nthe consumer cost is added to a jar of peanut butter after farmers have \nsold their peanuts.\n  So contrary to the myth that farmers are reaping huge profits from \nthe peanut program, it is, in fact, the manufacturers of peanut \nproducts who reap the sizable profits.\n  The 1990 farm bill extended the peanut program through the 1995 crop. \nBut this year, peanut growers had to reevaluate their program; we have \nincluded their reform in this legislation. This reform package is the \nfirst step in providing a safety net for our farmers while addressing \nthe new demands of the North American Free Trade Agreement [NAFTA] and \nthe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trades [GATT]. This legislation \nwill carry our farmers into a more market-oriented 21st century.\n  In the current budget-driven atmosphere in Washington, urban Members \nof Congress often mistakenly view phasing out farm programs as a simple \nsolution to our budget problems. Its easy for politicians who have no \npeanut producers in their States to take cheap shots at the livelihoods \nof those who earn their livings in the peanut industry.\n  The peanut program is an investment in the business of farming. It \nmeans 150,000 U.S. jobs, $200 million in U.S. exports, $1 billion in \nU.S. farm revenue, and $6 billion in U.S. economic activity each year.\n  This commodity title includes peanut reform provisions that make \nsolid changes to the current program. This reform package will be an \nalternative that will turn this program towards a market-oriented plan \nthat will ensure U.S. competitiveness in global markets, will operate \nat no net cost to the taxpayer, and will provide a safety net for \nfarmers.\n  Farmers and their families have contributed so much to the growth of \nour country. Today, according to USDA, the United States is the third \nlargest producer of peanuts in the world. Elimination of the peanut \nprogram would mean an immediate loss of 37,000 U.S. jobs, as well as \n$350 million in lost farm revenue, $50 million in lost exports, and $25 \nmillion in lost tax revenues.\n  Everyone in the peanut industry, from the growers to the shellers and \nmanufacturers, realizes the program must be reformed as part of the \n1995 farm bill.\n  The peanut farmers of my State of North Carolina and throughout the \nNation have taken a responsible voluntary approach of cutting their \nbudgets. They are willing to make major sacrifices and reforms in order \nto eliminate government cost and make the peanut program more market-\noriented. Again, I commend the able Senior Senator from Mississippi \n[Mr. Cochran] for his diligent efforts to address the issues of real \nreform.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HELMS (for himself, Mr. Dole, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. \n        McCain):\n  S. 1157. A bill to authorize the establishment of a multilateral \nBosnia and Herzegovina Self-Defense Fund; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n\n\n       the multilateral bosnia and herzegovina self-defense fund\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor the Multilateral \nBosnia and Herzegovina Self-Defense Fund. In the aftermath of the \noverwhelming votes to lift the arms embargo in the Senate and the \nHouse, this legislation is the logical next step in a policy designed \nto put the future of Bosnia back in Bosnian hands. This legislation \nwill create an international fund for the defense of Bosnia, and will \nprovide for a leadership role for the United States, not only in \nestablishing the fund, but in chairing it.\n  I would like to commend the distinguished chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee in taking the lead and forging legislation to \naddress the critical issue of supporting the Bosnian Government \nmilitarily once the arms embargo is lifted--and it will be lifted. I \nwould also add that the chairman has brought together a bipartisan \ngroup of distinguished Senators, including Senator Lieberman, in this \nimportant effort.\n  During our debates on lifting the arms embargo on Bosnia \nadministration officials have snidely criticized our legislation as \nlift and pray--alleging to the press and even to the Bosnians that \nthere is no support in the Congress for providing military assistance \nto them. This bill makes it absolutely clear that we are serious--that \nwe are ready to follow-through.\n  The reality is that the administration's approach is don't lift and \npray--pray that the American people will be fooled into thinking that \nthere is a U.S. policy and pray that the Croatian government will get \nthe international community off the hook.\n  Well, the American people are not fooled. They know that the \nadministration does not have a policy.\n  As for the recent Croatian military action--Croatia's ability to \nretake its territory has demonstrated that with arms, the victims of \naggression can successfully take matters into their own hands. In 4 \ndays, Croatian forces accomplished what the United Nations could not do \nin 4 years. And, they had no help--the NATO no-fly zone was not \nenforced as Serb jets bombed Croatian towns.\n  The undeniable lesson of the past week is that the arms embargo and \nthe U.N. presence has prolonged the war in the former Yugoslavia by \nkeeping areas of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina under occupation.\n  Another allegation made by administration officials is that lifting \nthe embargo would Americanize the war. We know from the large votes in \nsupport of Bosnia's right to self-defense in the U.N. General Assembly \nand from discussions with international leaders that this assertion is \nsimply not true.\n  This rhetoric is part of the scare tactics employed by the Pentagon \nand State Department in order to try to persuade members of Congress \nthat somehow, if the arms embargo is lifted, we alone would be \nproviding aid to the Bosnians.\n  This fund will provide a mechanism for countries, other than just the \nUnited States, to provide the Bosnians with military assistance--and to \ndo so before the arms embargo is lifted. I would add, however, that the \nactual delivery of weapons will not occur until the U.S. arms embargo \nis lifted which would occur after U.N. forces withdraw.\n  I want to talk for a moment about cost. This bill provides for a $50 \nmillion payment to the fund and authorization for $50 million in \nDepartment of Defense draw down authority for defense articles and \nservices--for a total package of $100 million, far less than we are \ncurrently spending on a failed approach. This year, we are being billed \naround a half a billion dollars for our share of the U.N. peacekeeping \noperation. Our share for UNPROFOR next \n\n[[Page S 12252]]\nyear will probably be closer to $600 million. We are also providing \nindirect support to this operation--for example, through NATO--which \namounts to about $250 million annually. And, we do not get any discount \nwhen UNPROFOR is unable to do its job.\n  The bottom line is that keeping the U.N. in Bosnia is not cost-free. \nIndeed it is far more expensive than helping the Bosnians help \nthemselves. Furthermore, we have to look at the costs of this failure \nto our credibility and our principles.\n  As we introduce this legislation today, President Clinton is poised \nto veto S. 21, the Dole-Lieberman legislation to lift the arms embargo \non Bosnia.\n  Administration officials are reportedly in Europe devising new ways \nto divide Bosnia and Herzegovina and to bribe Serbian President \nMilosevic, while Ambassador Albright is briefing the Security Council \non evidence that more than 2,000 people were buried in mass graves in \nthe wake of the Bosnian Serb take over of Srebrenica.\n  No doubt about it, the international community is partially \nresponsible for these war crimes. It has refused to protect the \nBosnians and denied the Bosnians the means to protect themselves.\n  How can America, the leader of the free world, continue to be a part \nof this immoral embargo? Administration officials even publicly \nacknowledge that it is immoral. As for the embargo's practical effect, \nit has been a total failure at achieving its goal of limiting violence \nand ending the war.\n  America should be leading the way toward a moral and rational policy \nthat has some chance of resulting in a just and stable settlement. \nInstead, America is following an ineffective, failed approached based \non appeasement.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1157\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for his \nstatement and for his support, as I thank the other cosponsors.\n  Now, the purpose of this legislation is to correct an injustice that \nis burdening the conscience of millions of Americans, as well as \ncitizens of all civilized countries around the world.\n  I refer, of course, to what so many Senators properly consider an \nimperative responsibility both personally and as a nation to move to \nuntie the hands of the Bosnian people, thereby enabling them to acquire \nthe means to defend themselves against Serbia's cruel genocide designed \nto achieve an illegal conquest of the sovereign nation of Bosnia.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of the distinguished majority leader [Mr. \nDole] Senators Lieberman, McCain, and myself, I shall momentarily send \na bill to the desk to be read the first time.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to correct an injustice that is \nburdening the conscience of millions of Americans as well as citizens \nof all civilized countries around the world.\n  I refer of course to what so many Senators properly consider an \nimperative responsibility to move to untie the hands of the Bosnian \npeople, thereby enabling them to acquire the means to defend themselves \nagainst Serbia's cruel genocide designed to achieve an illegal conquest \nof the sovereign nation of Bosnia.\n  Mr. President, in a joint hearing conducted yesterday by the Senate's \nForeign Relations and Intelligence Committees to investigate war crimes \nin the former Yugoslavia, a distinguished witness asserted that the \ndifference between the conduct of a great nation and the conduct of a \nmighty nation is \n\n[[Page S 12253]]\nthat, while both are capable of shaping events far beyond their \nborders, a great nation is guided by deep sense of moral principle.\n  The greatest expression of that moral principle, as practiced by our \nNation in the past, has been the enduring commitment that never again \nwill we stand silent while a people fall victim to crimes against \nhumanity--as did the Jews in World War II.\n  Could it be that that enduring commitment must today seem an empty \none to the people of Bosnia?\n  Instead of protecting the Bosnian people, the United Nations--the \nvery body created years ago to make certain that such genocide would \nnever happen again--has served instead to render the Bosnian people \ndefenseless in the face of Serbia's annihilation of their country.\n  And the United States, the leader of the Atlantic alliance, has done \nscarcely more than sit on the sidelines and watch as an entire nation \nof people is slowly exterminated.\n  Mr. President, we can no longer sit on the sidelines. The shameful \npolicy of neutrality in the face of genocide must be brought to an end. \nThere must be a policy, once and for all, that distinguishes clearly \nbetween victim and aggressor, and which puts the diplomatic, military, \nand financial resources of the United States squarely behind the \nvictim.\n  No one doubts the magnitude of the abuse against the Bosnian people. \nToday's Washington Post discloses the Clinton administration has openly \nacknowledged that crimes against humanity are being committed this very \nmoment in the center of Europe.\n  Yet the administration continues to deny the Bosnian victims any hope \nof defending themselves. The President of the United States--fully \naware of these crimes--intends to veto the legislation Congress has \npassed to restore Bosnia's right of self-defense. This veto is wrong, \nit is unfair, it is unjust, and it must be overridden.\n  There are many in both the House and the Senate who have pledged to \nthe people of Bosnia that we will do everything in our power to make \nsure Congress overrides that veto. And we will fight to pass \nlegislation not only to lift this brutal embargo, but to help provide \nthe Bosnian people with the means to defend themselves, their families \nand their sovereign nation.\n  Mr. President, it is time the United States began treating the \nBosnian people the same way we treated the contras in Nicaragua and the \nmujahadeen in Afghanistan--as freedom fighters engaged in a war for the \nliberation of their country. We must help arm them and train them and \nto help them defend themselves against Serbian genocide.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will do just that. It will \nestablish a multilateral fund to collect and hold donations by \ncountries seeking to assist in the self-defense of Bosnia until the \narms embargo is lifted.\n  The bill authorizes an initial U.S. contribution of $50 million in \nforeign military financing, and the transfer of up to $50 million in \nU.S. defense stocks. Moreover, it proposes to create the means to \ncoordinate the efforts of nations such as Turkey, Malaysia, Jordan, and \nSaudi Arabia, who are eager to assist the Bosnians in a similar \nfashion.\n  Our bill will ensure that, upon the withdrawal of the failed United \nNations mission, the Serb military will be unable to take advantage of \nany lag in the arming of the Bosnian people. The multilateral fund will \nallow the Bosnian Government to coordinate contributions--and to begin \nprocurement by proxy--of the weapons they need for their national self-\ndefense. The Bosnians will be able to ensure the necessary support and \ntransport are available for immediate delivery of weapons after the \nlifting of the embargo. And finally, Bosnian soldiers will be travel to \nthird countries to acquire training for the use of donated weapons.\n  Our legislation is consistent with the legislation to repeal the arms \nembargo in that it postpones the actual delivery of weaponry until the \nconclusion of the peacekeeping effort. But it will provide the Bosnian \nGovernment a running start as the arms embargo is lifted.\n  The President claims that the recent success of the Croatian military \nhas created a new balance of power in the region, thereby giving us an \nopportunity for a political settlement. The President ignores the \nlessons of the last half-century. There can be no lasting peace built \non weakness; there can only be peace through strength. Let us have no \nillusions that Serbia's recent defeats have taken away their craving \nfor territorial expansion--Serbia's appetite for war, destruction and \nconquest is far from satisfied.\n  What the success of the recent Croatian offensive does show, however, \nis that the Serb aggression can be successfully confronted and \ndefeated, and that Serbs can be driven from land they have unlawfully \nconquered. If a real and lasting peace is to come to Bosnia, we must \nhelp the Bosnians achieve it by forcing the Serbs to evacuate the land \nthey have occupied in Bosnia. We must recognize that there can be no \npeace in that troubled region until the Bosnian people can defend \nthemselves against aggression. We must help them restore their nation \nso that they can negotiate from a position to strength.\n  The lifting of the unlawful and unjust arms embargo on the Bosnian \npeople is long overdue. And it will be lifted. The time has come to end \nAmerica's silence in the face of the unspeakable injustices in Bosnia. \nThe time is overdue to lift the embargo and help arm the Bosnian \nMoslems. I hope the Senate will vote to allow the Bosnian people to \ndefend themselves at long last.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 1158. A bill to deauthorize certain portions of the navigation \nproject for Cohasset Harbor, Massachusetts, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n               THE COHASSET HARBOR NAVIGATION PROJECT ACT\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today with \nSenator Kennedy the Cohasset Harbor Navigation Project Act.\n  This is a simple and straightforward bill that will enable an \nimportant navigation project in the harbor at Cohasset, MA to move \nahead. Its purpose is to make a series of technical changes in the \ncoordinates for the Army Corps of Engineers' Cohasset Harbor project \nthat will enable the dredging project to proceed. The changes are \nnecessary because of shoaling that has taken place since the harbor was \nlast fully dredged in 1960. The shoaling led the Coast Guard in the \nSpring of 1994 to remove Cohasset Harbor from its previously recognized \nstatus as a ``safe harbor'' for storm refuge for certain vessels at \nsea. The Coast Guard now routinely sets and resets channel buoys which \npractically lay on their sides at low tide. Marine engineers and the \nCoast Guard agree that an offshore storm of any substantial magnitude \nwill most probably cause the channel to be blocked completely by the \ntransport of bottom sediment carried in storm surge waters.\n  The situation is having a damaging effect on our commercial fishing \nfleet, and the safe boating environment of Cohasset's portion of \nMassachusetts Bay. Most of Cohasset's racing and recreational vessels \nof any significant size cannot move into or out of the Harbor within 2 \nhours of low tide. The Town of Cohasset has worked closely with all \nparties to expedite the dredging of the inner and outer portions of the \nHarbor. The necessary permits are in place and the funding of $1.415 \nmillion, of which the Federal share is 85 percent, is in place. All \nthat is needed for the project to proceed are the technical corrections \nin the coordinates which this legislation will provide. No further \nfunding is needed.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on the relevant \nCommittees to move this legislation forward. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the full text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                S. 1158\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kerry, in sponsoring this bill for an important \nnavigation project for Cohasset Harbor. This bill is intended to make \nminor adjustments to the limits of Federal navigation and anchorage, in \norder to expedite the dredging planned by the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers.\n  The dredging is urgently needed. The harbor was last fully dredged in \n1960, and shifting shoals have made the current channel unsafe for many \nvessels during several hours of each day at low tide. Cohasset depends \non access to its harbor for commercial fishing and recreational \nvessels.\n  The proposed adjustment to the current limits for Federal navigation \nand anchorage in Cohasset Harbor was prepared by the Army Corps, \nworking in close conjunction with town.

I urge my colleagues to approve this legislation, which is \nof great importance to the people of Cohasset, their safety and the \nlocal economy.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. INOUYE (for himself, Mr. Simon, Mr. Campbell, and Mr. \n        Conrad):\n  S. 1159. A bill to establish an American Indian Policy Information \nCenter, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n       the american indian policy information center act of 1995\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I introduce a measure that reflects \nthe culmination of a 4-year effort which has examined the feasibility \nof and has clearly documented the need for the establishment of the \nentity that this bill addresses.\n  Mr. President, over the course of the last few months, as the Senate \nhas given consideration to broad reform proposals, we have once again \nfound ourselves confronted with the challenge of securing accurate \ninformation with regard to the manner in which such proposals would \naffect Indian country.\n  For instance, in the context of welfare reform, we quickly learned \nthat there was no central source from which we could secure the \nrelevant information with regard to the Indian proportion of the \npopulation served by programs that are the subject of block grant \nproposals or with respect to unemployment rates in the respective \nreservation communities.\n  Nor is there a central source of data with regard to program \nadministration or service delivery systems in Indian country, so that \nwe might ascertain how best to assure that Federal programs which are \nblock granted to the States address the social and economic conditions \nin Indian country. In light of a 200-year history of a Federal Indian \ngovernment-to-government relationship that for the most part does not \ninvolve the State governments, how should the Congress provide for the \nadministration of programs in Indian country under a State block grant \nsystem?\n  To effectively answer this question, we should have a range of policy \nand programmatic options to consider, but there is no existing body \nwith the expertise and knowledge of Indian country that we can call \nupon to identify and analyze such options.\n  Mr. President, in most of Indian country policy-related information \nis very scarce. If tribal governments are to effectively participate in \nthe decisonmaking process associated with reform proposals and other \nFederal actions, they too must have access to information and analyses \nthat will assist them in doing so. It is these imperatives that this \nbill seeks to address.\n  The central purpose of the American Indian Policy Information Center \nthat would be established under the bill would be one of making \ninformation and analyses available to agencies of the Federal \nGovernment, to the Congress, and to tribal and other governments that \nare not otherwise readily available to them. In addition to providing \ninformation collected from a variety of sources, the policy information \ncenter would be authorized to conduct or commission research to meet \npolicy information needs and to conduct or sponsor forums to identify \nand explore policy issues.\n  The bill would establish a successor to the demonstration project now \nauthorized as the National Indian Policy Center, and the activities \nproposed are among those that have been carried out as elements of the \ndemonstration. The bill is a revision of a bill approved by the Senate \nCommittee on Indian Affairs during the 103d Congress, but it has been \nmodified on the basis of the experience of the current demonstration. \nIn revising this measure, I have also drawn upon a bill drafted during \nthe 103d Congress by Senator Craig Thomas.\n  Mr. President, I am hopeful that my colleagues will give this measure \ntheir careful consideration and will join me in seeking its approval by \nthe full Senate.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 1160. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat the depreciation rules which apply for regular tax purposes also \nshall apply for alternative minimum tax purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n      THE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX DEPRECIATION RELIEF ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I am introducing a \nrelatively modest tax measure that could provide significant relief to \ncapital intensive industries that show little to no profits and pay \nincome taxes under the Alternative Minimum Tax [AMT]. This will \neliminate a disincentive in tax policy towards key investment in \nindustries that are vital to the country's economic competitiveness, \njob base, and industrial strength. This is one of the ways to help the \nemployers, workers, and families in my state of West Virginia.\n  As a tax measure designed to enhance the competitiveness of \nindustries that range from steel, to paper and wood products, autos, \nchemicals, and mining, this bill will result in a cost in the form of \nless revenue collected. But I am introducing the AMT Depreciation \nRelief Act of 1995 to serve as a practical, affordable option to \nconsider along with the versions of AMT reform that have already passed \nthe House and have been introduced earlier this year in the Senate. And \nI believe this bill addresses a real problem that Congress must work \ntogether to overcome.\n  Many manufacturers want to see a complete repeal of the AMT. Some \nespecially want reform to address the problems which result from being \neffectively stuck in AMT status, such as the accumulation of credits \nand past investments in plants and equipment modernization, which I \nthink merit serious attention.\n  This bill focuses specifically on the problem of the way the AMT \ntreats the depreciation of assets, which is a root cause of why many \ncompanies remain stuck in AMT status. If and when a resolution is \nworked out to deal with the problem in the way depreciation is \ncalculated, we will go a long way to getting companies out of AMT \nstatus, with the result that then they would be able to use their \naccumulated credits.\n\n[[Page S 12255]]\n\n  As my colleagues know, the corporate AMT was created in the 1986 Tax \nAct in response to the problem raised when companies would report \nprofits to stockholders, but then claim losses to the IRS. However, the \nsubsequent action taken in this area as part of that historic effort to \n``simplify'' the code had the unintended consequence of penalizing low-\nprofit, capital-intensive companies, because the AMT treats \ndepreciation as an adjustment (or increase in income). As Tom Usher, \nthe chairman and CEO of USX explained to the House Ways and Means \nCommittee in January 1995: ``under the AMT, most steel making assets \nare subject to a 15-year capital cost recovery period and a 150-percent \ndeclining balance method, compared to 7 years and 200 percent under the \nregular tax.'' What that means is that compared to other countries, \nafter 5 years, a U.S. steelmaker under AMT recovers only 37 percent on \nits investment in new plant and equipment, versus the recovery for \ncompanies in other countries, that include 58 percent in Japan, 81 \npercent in Germany, 90 percent in Korea, and 100 percent in Brazil.\n  What it comes down to is that under the regular tax system, \ndepreciation adjustments are designed to encourage investment. However, \nthe AMT has had the unintended consequence of, if anything, \ndiscouraging investment in new plants and equipment. This is precisely \nthe wrong signal to send to our Nation's capital intensive industries.\n  At its heart, this is an issue for how well our companies can compete \non the world stage. For years, I have focused on how trade laws are \nused to ensure that our domestic industries can compete with unfairly \nsold imports. However, the present AMT policies have created a \nsituation which hinders that competitive position.\n  The fix I am suggesting would eliminate depreciation as a adjustment \nunder the alternative minimum tax. Quite simply, that means that \ndepreciation for companies in an AMT status would be treated in \nprecisely the same way as for companies in a regular tax status.\n  This is a simple, two-page, bill. It proposes a modest change in the \ntax code that will have a very beneficial impact on the bottom line of \nsome of America's most important industries and employers. I am looking \nforward to bipartisan support for this change, and hope it can be made \nquickly. I urge my colleagues to join me as cosponsors.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BAUCUS:\n  S. 1161. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exempt \nsmall manufacturers, producers and importers from the firearms excise \ntax; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                         excise tax legislation\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nwhich will exempt custom gunsmiths who manufacture, produce or import \nfewer than 50 guns a year from the Federal excise tax on firearms.\n  In 1982, this body passed legislation which was subsequently signed \ninto law which was intended to relieve custom gunsmiths from the excise \ntax.\n  Apparently we were not clear enough. Notwithstanding that \nlegislation, the Internal Revenue Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, \nTobacco and Firearms continue to attempt to collect the excise tax from \ncustom gunsmiths.\n  Mr. President, the custom gunsmith is a small operator. While \nignorance of the law is no excuse, many of these small operators do not \nknow that an excise tax is owed until they receive a visit from the IRS \nor the BATF. Because the number of custom gunsmiths is small and \nbecause they produce few guns, the revenue raised from the imposition \nof the excise tax is insubstantial. In fact, the BATF has indicated \nthat the cost to the BATF of collecting the tax may well exceed the \nrevenue raised from the tax.\n  For all of these reasons, Congress attempted to relieve custom \ngunsmiths from the firearms excise tax in 1982.\n  The bill I introduce today completes that job.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN (for himself and Mr. D'Amato):\n  S. 1162. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to treat \nacademic health centers like other educational institutions for \npurposes of the exclusion for employer-provided housing; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                 employer-provided housing legislation\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and \nSenator D'Amato to introduce a bill that would correct an anomaly, by \nextending to faculty at independent academic health centers an \nexclusion from income tax for employer-provided housing that is enjoyed \nby faculty at university-affiliated health centers. In 1986, Congress \nenacted a provision allowing employees of educational institutions to \nexclude from income the excess of the fair market value of the \nuniversity-provided housing over the rent actually paid. This exclusion \npermits universities to attract faculty and staff with the necessary \nexpertise to meet the university's needs. The availability of this \nexclusion is especially vital to those institutions located in high-\ncost housing areas like New York City.\n  Currently, faculty at academic health centers that are not affiliated \nwith a university are not allowed to exclude the excess value of their \nemployer-provided housing. This is the case despite the fact that \nindependent academic health centers perform the same function as \nuniversity-affiliated institutions, and that the situation of their \nemployees is likewise identical to that of their counterparts. Many of \nthe tenants of center-owned housing are employees pursuing advanced \ntraining at the academic health center, often at substantial financial \nhardship. Because of the difference in tax treatment, independent \ninstitutions are placed at a competitive disadvantage in terms of their \nability to attract these highly qualified employees. Academic health \ncenters are an important national resource, performing essential \nresearch and providing other significant contributions to our Nation's \nhealth care. By enacting this bill, Congress would ensure the continued \nability of independent academic health centers to pursue their missions \nof patient care, education, and research.\n  Our bill is narrowly drawn to focus only on this competitive \ndisadvantage. Under the proposed amendment, the academic health center \nmust, first, qualify as a tax-exempt hospital or medical research \norganization eligible to receive charitable contributions; second, it \nmust receive Federal funding for graduate medical education; and third, \nit must engage in and teach basic and clinical medical science and \nresearch with the organization's own faculty. The bill would have \nnegligible impact on revenue.\n  We believe that this legislation would rectify the inequitable \ntreatment currently accorded the faculty of independent academic health \ncenters, ensuring fair tax treatment for these employees and the \ncontinued excellence of the institutions for which they work.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1162\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to implement the recommendations of the Northern \nStewardship Lands Council; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, \nand Forestry.\n\n\n                  THE NORTHERN FOREST STEWARDSHIP ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the Northern \nForest Stewardship Act of 1995, a bill that represents the highest \nstandards of the legislative process. The legislation we are \nintroducing is founded on extensive research, open discussion, \nconsensus decisions, and visionary problem solving. The goal of this \nbill is to capture perfectly the vision of Northern Forest Lands \nCouncil and northern communities.\n  The Northern Forest Lands Council process was initiated to avoid the \ndivisive conflicts that have torn communities apart in some regions of \nour country. Too often we have seen parties fuel conflicts for \npolitical gain, exacerbate conflicts with misinformation, or prolong \nconflicts in hopes of a one-sided windfall. Over the past 4 years, the \nNorthern Forest communities made dedicated effort to steer clear of \ndivisive conflict to chart a future for themselves. They have worked \nhard to develop a consensus vision. We owe it to them to deliver the \nrequests they have made.\n  This legislation delivers these requests. It goes no further than the \nCouncil's recommendations and nor does it fall short. This bill \nincludes a package of technical and financial assistance programs that \nI believe this Congress can and should support. Sometimes studies are \ncommissioned primarily to delay solution or pacify a problem. The \nCouncil's study was driven by a desire to achieve something. The \nnorthern forest delegation will not let this study sit on a shelf. \nBetween the Family Forestland Preservation Act (S. 692) and the \nNorthern Forest Stewardship Act, Congress can achieve for the people of \nthe Northern Forest the requests they have made of us.\n  The legislation embodies the conservation ethic of the 1990's--non-\nregulatory incentives and assistance to realize community-based goals \nfor sustainable economic and environmental prosperity. The rights and \nresponsibilities of landowners are emphasized, the primacy of the state \nis reinforced, and the traditions of the region are protected. And yet, \nthe bill also promotes new ways of achieving our goals and a common \nvision that did not exist several years ago. Moving ahead with the \nCouncil's work, we will pursue enhanced forest management, land \nprotection that supports the recreational and wildlife needs of the \nregion, integrated research and decision making, and increased \nproductivity in the traditional industries and new compatible \nindustries. Through this bill, I hope to boost sustainable development \nand protect the ecological integrity of biological resources across the \nlandscape. The nation has taken notice of this highly successful effort \nas a model for meeting the conservation challenges of the country, and \nI am confident of its inevitable success.\n  I welcome the constructive input of people who will compare this \nlegislation with the recommendations, research, and public \nparticipation in the Northern Forest Lands Council.\n  It is my goal to create a perfect representation of the future \ndescribed in the report to Congress Finding Common Ground: Conserving \nthe Northern Forest. Most of all, I want the Council's solutions to \nwork, and work well. I hope all affected citizens will take advantage \nof the opportunity to shape the final product of their hard work.\n  I want to congratulate the members of the Council for their success, \nand most importantly the people of the Northern Forest for their \nenthusiasm for this process. Thousands of people took time from their \nbusy lives to drive down to a school auditorium, local restaurant, or \nhotel auditorium to share their views on the Northern Forest. Hundreds \nmore put pen to paper or picked up the phone to register their \nthoughts. Without their effort, this would be an empty process. It is a \nvibrant process and the will of the majority produced a brilliant piece \nof work.\n  I will include a short section by section summary of the bill for the \nRecord that emphasizes the Council recommendation that inspired each \nprovision. I also want to thank Senators Gregg, Jeffords, Cohen and \nSnowe for their contributions to this draft, and I look forward to \nworking with entire delegation to refine this legislation if necessary, \nand move it through the Senate in the upcoming months.\n  Mr. President, the Council's process has the highest integrity, the \nrecommendations reflect the true consensus vision of the Northern \nForest communities, and I believe we owe it to Northern New England to \nfollow through on their expectations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Section-by-Section Summary\n\n\n                                Overview\n\n       The Northern Forest Stewardship Act takes the specific \n     consensus proposals of the Northern Forest Lands Council that \n     require Congressional action and translates them into \n     legislation. The Council's proposals reflect four years of \n     research and public input refined and condensed by the \n     diverse membership of the Council. This bill, together with \n     the Family Forestland Preservation Act (S. 692), goes no \n     further than, nor falls short of, the Council's proposals for \n     the Northern Forest lands. Affected parties are encouraged \n     submit constructive comments to their Congressional \n     delegation to make this a perfect representation of the \n     Council's consensus vision. The authorities in this bill are \n     voluntary opportunities for technical and financial \n     assistance to states, landowners, businesses and scientists \n     to work in partnership with the federal government and each \n     other to achieve stewardship goals.\n\n\n           section 1: title--northern forest stewardship act\n\n                        section 2: declarations\n\n       The first ten principles are lifted from the Council's \n     fundamental principles on page 15 of the report to Congress. \n     The eleventh one is added to make them relevant to this bill.\n\n\n                   section 3: marketing cooperatives\n\n       Section 3 implements recommendation #23 to facilitate the \n     formation of forestry cooperatives. Timber growers are \n     eligible to form cooperatives under the Capper-Volstead Act \n     of 1922, but few cooperative efforts in New England have been \n     successful. This provision directs the Secretary to provide \n     assistance and evaluate the opportunities to increase \n     profitability and improve forest management through \n     cooperatives.\n\n\n                section 4: principles of sustainability\n\n       Section 4 implements recommendations #10 and #11 to define \n     measurable benchmarks for sustainability and facilitate the \n     formation of best management practice to achieve \n     sustainability. The principles of sustainability for Sec \n     (4)(b) are lifted from page 42 of the Council's report.\n\n\n            section 5: northern forest research cooperative\n\n       Section 5 implements recommendations #33 to form a research \n     cooperative much like Senator Gorton's ``Blue Mountain \n     Institute'' in the 1990 Farm Bill with objectives defined on \n     page 86 of the Council's report.\n              section 6: interstate coordination strategy\n\n       Section 6 implements the recommendation on page 95 to \n     facilitate continued dialogue between the four states. \n     Section 6 names representatives to an interstate working \n     group with wide flexibility to include state roundtables.\n\n\n                  section 7: labor safety and training\n\n       Section 7 implements recommendation #27 to improve worker \n     safety and thereby reduce operating costs for forest products \n     companies.\n\n\n                      section 8: land conservation\n\n       Section 8 implements recommendations #16 and 17 to improve \n     funding opportunities for public land acquisition by both the \n     states and the federal government. This creates a new \n     authority to protect important recreation and conservation \n     land but does not guarantee increased funding. Section 8 also \n     establishes a public process for prioritizing public \n     acquisition.\n\n\n                section 9: landowner liability exemption\n\n       Section 9 expresses the Sense of the Senate that states \n     should enact laws to reduce the liability of landowners who \n     make their lands available for free public use as requested \n     in recommendation #26.\n\n\n                    section 10: nongame conservation\n\n       Section 10 expresses the sense of the Senate that a \n     mechanism is needed to protect non-game wildlife using a user \n     fee similar to the Wallop-Breaux and Pittman-Robertson \n     programs as requested in recommendation #14. A full \n     legislative proposal may be ready within the year and it \n     should be considered after it has been introduced.\n\n\n     section 11: authorization for appropriations/rural development\n\n       Section 11 provides such sums as necessary for \n     implementation and authorizes targeted rural development \n     funding for the Northern Forest states through the Rural \n     Development Through Forestry program.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 1164. A bill to amend the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation \nAct \n\n[[Page S 12257]]\nof 1980 with respect to inventions made under cooperative research and \ndevelopment agreements, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n            the technology transfer improvements act of 1995\n\n   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased today to \nintroduce the 1995 version of the Technology Transfer Improvements Act, \na bill I first introduced in 1993. This legislation will help \nfacilitate and speed technology cooperation between companies and \nFederal laboratories, and thus will benefit our economy and citizens.\n  It does so by giving both companies and Federal laboratories clear \nguidelines regarding intellectual property rights to technology \ndeveloped under cooperative research projects--guidelines that will \nreduce negotiating time and reduce the uncertainty that can deter \ncompanies from working with the Government.\n  Specifically, the bill amends the Stevenson-Wydler Technology \nInnovation Act, which since 1986 has allowed Federal laboratories to \nenter into cooperative research and development agreements [CRADAs] \nwith industry and other collaborating parties. The laboratories can \ncontribute people, facilities, equipment, and ideas, but not funding, \nand the companies contribute people and funding.\n  Even under the current law, the CRADA provision has been a success. \nHundreds of these agreements have been signed and carried out in recent \nyears, making expertise and technology that the Federal Government has \nalready paid for through its mission-related work available to the \nwider economy. But we also have seen a problem. Currently, the law \nprovides little guidance on what intellectual property rights a \ncollaborating partner should receive from a CRADA. The current law \ngives agencies very broad discretion on this matter, which provides \nflexibility but also means that both companies and laboratory \nexecutives must laboriously negotiate patent rights each time they \ndiscuss a new CRADA. Neither side has much guidance as to what \nconstitutes an appropriate agreement regarding intellectual property \ndeveloped under the CRADA. Options range from assigning full patent \ntitle to the company all the way to providing the firm with only a \nnonexclusive license for a narrow field of use.\n  In conversations with company executives, we learned that this \nuncertainty--and the time and effort involved in negotiating \nintellectual property from scratch in each CRADA--was often a barrier \nto working with government laboratories. Companies are reluctant to \nenter into a CRADA, or, equally important, to commit additional \nresources to commercialize a CRADA invention, unless they have some \nassurance they will control important patient rights.\n  In 1993, I began working with Congresswoman Connie Morella on \npossible ways to reduce the uncertainty and negotiating burden facing \ncompanies, while still ensuring that the government interest remains \nprotected. To begin legislative discussion on this matter, I introduced \nS. 1537 on October 7, 1993, for myself and Senator DeConcini, then \nchairman of the Senate Patent Subcommittee. That bill would have \ndirected Federal laboratories to assign to the collaborating party--the \ncompany--title to any intellectual property arising from a CRADA, in \nexchange for reasonable compensation to the laboratory and certain \npatent safeguards.\n  S. 1537 also contained a second provision--an additional incentive \nfor Federal scientists to report and develop inventions that might have \ncommercial as well as government value. The General Accounting Office \n[GAO] had recommended that Federal inventors receive more of the \nroyalties received by laboratories as government compensation under \nCRADAs. My bill incorporated that recommendation.\n  Soon after Senator DeConcini and I introduced our bill, Congresswoman \nMorella introduced the companion House bill, H.R. 3590. In subsequent \nHouse and Senate hearings, the bill received strong support from \nindustry, professional societies, trade associations, and the \nadministration. At that point, we also began working closely with \nCommerce Department Under Secretary for Technology Mary Good and her \nstaff, who helped us obtain detailed technical suggestions from \nexecutive branch agencies and other patent experts. We made major \nprogress during the 103rd Congress, but in 1994 ran out of time to \ncomplete action on the legislation.\n  Now we are back with a similar bill that incorporates suggestions \nmade by the experts. Through her position as Chair of the House Science \nCommittee's Subcommittee on Technology, Congresswoman Morella has \nworked closely with us and the administration to produce a revised \nversion of the bill which I believe is strongly supported by all \ninterested parties. The revised bill continues to focus on the twin \nissues of company rights under a CRADA and royalty sharing for Federal \ninvestors.\n  The revised bill would give a collaborating party a statutory option \nto choose an exclusive license for a field of use for any such \ninvention created under the agreement. Agencies may still assign full \npatent title to the company; the agencies we consulted felt they needed \nto retain that flexibility, and our new bill allows them to do so. But \nthe important point is that a company will now know that it is assured \nof having no less than an exclusive license in a field of use of its \nchoosing. This statutory guideline will give companies real assurance \nthat they will get important intellectual property out any CRADA they \nfund. In turn, that assurance will give those companies both an extra \nincentive to enter into a CRADA and the knowledge that they can safely \ninvest further in the commercialization of that invention, knowing they \nhave an exclusive claim on it.\n  In return, the Government may negotiate for reasonable compensation, \nsuch as royalties. And the Government retains minimal rights to use the \ninvention under unusual but important circumstances, such as when the \ninvention is needed to meet health and safety needs that are not \nreasonably satisfied by the collaborating party.\n  In sum, the bill continues to carry out the original purpose we \nenvisioned in 1993--providing guidelines that simplify the negotiation \nof CRADA's and, in the process, give companies greater assurance they \nwill share in the benefits of the research they fund. We expect that \nthis change will increase the number of CRADA's, reduce the time and \neffort required to negotiate them, and thus speed the transfer of \nlaboratory technology and know-how to the broader economy.\n  The revised version also contains a slightly revised version of the \nprovision regarding royaltysharing for Federal inventors. Under the new \nbill, agencies each year must pay a Federal inventor the first $2,000 \nin royalties received because of that person's inventions, plus at \nleast 15 percent of any additional annual royalties. By rewarding \nFederal inventors, we will give them an incentive to report inventions \nand work in CRADA's. The bill involves no Federal spending; all rewards \nwould be from royalties paid to the Government by companies and others.\n  Mr. President, Mrs. Morella introduced the House version of the \nrevised bill last Friday, August 4. It is H.R. 2196. Cosponsors include \nHouse Science Committee Chairman Bob Walker, House Science Committee \nRanking Member George Brown, and Technology Subcommittee Ranking Member \nJohn Tanner. Today I am proud to introduce the same bill in the Senate.\n  This bill is a concrete step towards making our government's huge \ninvestment in science and technology--an investment made primarily to \ncarry out important government missions--more useful to commercial \ncompanies and our economy. If we do it right, the end result will be \nnew technologies, new products, and new jobs for Americans. I look \nforward to continuing to work with my House and Senate colleagues and \nwith the Administration to enact this valuable, focused piece of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary sheet prepared \nby Mrs. Morella's office and the text of the bill itself be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                S. 1164\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     \n[[Page S 12258]]\n\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Technology Transfer \n     Improvements Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Bringing technology and industrial innovation to the \n     marketplace is central to the economic, environmental, and \n     social well-being of the people of the United States.\n       (2) The Federal Government can help United States business \n     to speed the development of new products and processes by \n     entering into cooperative research and development agreements \n     which make available the assistance of Federal laboratories \n     to the private sector, but the commercialization of \n     technology and industrial innovation in the United States \n     depends upon actions by business.\n       (3) The commercialization of technology and industrial \n     innovation in the United States will be enhanced if \n     companies, in return for reasonable compensation to the \n     Federal Government, can more easily obtain exclusive licenses \n     to inventions which develop as a result of cooperative \n     research with scientists employed by Federal laboratories.\n\n     SEC. 3. USE OF FEDERAL TECHNOLOGY\n\n       Subparagraph (B) of section 11(e)(7) of the Stevenson-\n     Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 (15 U.S.C. \n     3710(e)(7)(B)) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(B) A transfer shall be made by any Federal agency under \n     subparagraph (A), for any fiscal year, only if the amount so \n     transferred by that agency (as determined under such \n     subparagraph) would exceed $10,000.''.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ntax credit for adoption expenses and an exclusion for employer-provided \nadoption assistance; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 the fairness for adopting families act\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Fairness for \nAdopting Families Act. This act reimburses legitimate adoption expenses \nthrough a nonrefundable tax credit and permits companies to offer \nadoption benefits to their employees as a tax-free fringe benefit.\n  We should be grateful, Mr. President, that many parents in America \ntoday form their families through adoption. Our laws should help \nalleviate the cost barriers associated with an adoption. Many Americans \nare unaware of the enormous costs associated with an adoption. It's not \nuncommon for the adopting family to pay thousands in legal expenses, \nprenatal care for the birth mother, and the cost of the adopted child's \nhospital delivery. And none of these expenses is tax deductible.\n  If an employer helps to pay an employee's pregnancy expenses by \nfunding an insurance policy or paying the fees for an employee to join \nan HMO, these expenses are treated as tax-free fringe benefits. But if \nan employer decides to help his or her employees form families through \nadoption, it will have to pay these expenses in after-tax dollars. Mr. \nPresident, this is just not fair.\n  Our tax system should encourage families to adopt children. Adoption \nis an option that can relieve some of the suffering and loneliness that \ntoo many young children face. Adoption is vitally important to millions \nof couples and to children wanting to belong to a family of their own. \nIn America today, Mr. President, an estimated 36,000 adoptable children \nremain in foster care or institutions, often bereft of the nurturing, \nguidance, and security that all children need, because of public and \nprivate barriers to adoption. Mr. President, a majority of these \nchildren have special physical, emotional, or mental needs; or they may \nhave reached school age, have brothers and sisters with whom they must \nbe adopted, or be of various ethnic backgrounds.A stable home and \nstrong role models are especially important for these at-risk \nyoungsters.\n  The Fairness for Adopting Families Act provides adopting families \nwith a desperately needed tax credit, needed by children who are \nwaiting to be adopted and needed by families who are sacrificing to \nfinance the ever-increasing costs of adopting a child. In today's \nchanging society, we must continue to express our support for the \nfamily unit. Mr. President, with the increase in teenage pregnancy, \nbroken homes, and children born out of wedlock, adoption can provide \nmany of these children with a chance to succeed in life. We all agree \nthat strong families are the key to a strong America. A true pro-family \npolicy would assist families being formed through adoption.\n  Mr. President, to many families wishing to adopt a child, the costs \nassociated with such a procedure are simply prohibitive. Prospective \nparents are often required to pay\n not only court and attorney fees but also expenses for maternity home \nservices, hospital and physician costs, and, at times, prenatal care \nfor the birth mother. Data provided by the National Council for \nAdoption show that the actual costs connected with legal adoptions can \neasily exceed $15,000.\n\n  Mr. President, one family in my home State of Utah illustrates the \nfinancial burden an adoption can place on a family. This family was in \nthe process of adopting an infant. All of the paperwork had been filed \nwith the appropriate agencies when they discovered that they were \nrequired to pay a lump sum of $13,000 within a short period of time. \nThis was a significant amount of money for this middle-class family, \nMr. President. Their insurance company would reimburse them for $3,000, \nbut only after the adoption was finalized. Tragically, this heartbroken \nfamily simply could not afford to continue with the adoption and had to \ndiscontinue the proceeding. Situations like this should not have to \nhappen. Family wealth should not be the determining factor in adopting \na child.\n  This bill recognizes the importance of the family unit by alleviating \nsome of the cost barriers associated with \n\n[[Page S 12260]]\nadoption. This legislation has two major features.\n  First, it provides a nonrefundable tax credit of up to $5,000 for \nlegitimate adoption expenses. One of the problems with most \nnonrefundable tax credits, Mr. President, is that they can only help \nfamilies with sizeable tax liabilities. If a family spends $5,000 on an \nadoption but only owes $2,000 in Federal income taxes, $3,000 of credit \nwould ordinarily be lost under a nonrefundable system.\n  To help lower-income families who may not owe much in Federal income \ntaxes, this bill would allow any unused adoption credit to be carried \nforward for up to 5 years. This will avoid some of the problems that \nhave unfortunately arisen with the only refundable credit currently in \nthe personal income tax, the earned income tax credit.\n  Second, the bill would exclude from an employee's gross income up to \n$5,000 for adoption expenses paid by an employer; those who participate \nin the military's adoption expense reimbursement program would also \nreceive this exclusion. This feature of my bill provides fair treatment \nfor adopting families. Many of America's employers have recognized the \nimportance of adoption, and this bill's provisions build upon that \nrecognition. Corporations such as Dow Chemical, Wendy's Inc., IBM, \nDigital Equipment, and Honeywell currently offer adoption benefits. \nThis legislation will encourage more employers to establish these pro-\nfamily plans.\n  These tax provisions are specifically aimed to help families who \notherwise might not be able to afford to adopt; for that reason, they \nphase out for families with taxable incomes above $60,000. Using \ntaxable income rather than adjusted gross income further focuses the \ncredit's purpose. It ensures that large families with moderate incomes \nwill remain as eligible as smaller families with lower incomes. A \nfamily earning $65,000 but raising four children would hardly qualify \nas well-off; they should be just as able to adopt a child as a smaller, \nless affluent family. Using taxable (post-deduction) income to \ncalculate eligibility will level the playing field for larger families.\n  I want to point out, Mr. President, that this legislation does not \nprovide an exclusion or credit for expenses for adoptions administered \nthrough illegal practices, such as through a baby broker. Many adopting \nparents in my own State of Utah and in other States have sadly been \ndefrauded by such schemes.\n  This legislation will actually result in less Government spending, \nMr. President. The National Council for Adoption has shown savings in \ntwo ways. First, the bill would move thousands of children, who might \notherwise have lingered in foster care, into permanent, loving homes. \nSecond, the tax credit encourages the shifting of medical costs to the \nadopting family and away from the more expensive AFDC and Medicaid \nprograms.\n  I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this legislation. We \nare representatives of a society that professes a commitment to the \nsuccess of the family. The Tax Code should demonstrate that commitment \nby allowing for the fair tax treatment of adoption expenses.\n  At a time when our Nation is experiencing a tragic increase in crime, \nteenage pregnancies, disease, and violence, we cannot afford to let \neven one child fall through the cracks. We must work together to bring \nchildren into permanent, secure, and loving families. We must work \ntogether to eliminate the barriers that discourage adoption.\n  The most important resource America has is its families. We must do \neverything in our power to ensure their continued growth and success. A \nrelatively small dollar investment in this bill will move us a long way \ntoward strengthening the American family.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nincluded in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                S. 1165\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide,and \nRodenticide Act, to improve the registration of pesticides, to provide \nminor use crop protection, to improve pesticide tolerances and \nsafeguard infants and children, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                the food quality protection act of 1995\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I introduce bipartisan legislation \nthat will help ensure that continued availability of a safe, \naffordable, and abundant food supply in our Nation.\n  This bill reforms the scientifically outdated Delaney clause. The \ncontinuation of and strict enforcement of the Delaney clause enacted in \n1958 could have a significant negative impact on our Nation's farmers \nand ranchers.\n  The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act [FFDCA] establishes rules for \nsetting tolerances for pesticide residues on food which differ for raw \nand processed commodities. Residues in raw commodities are subject to \nsection 408 of the FFDCA which requires that residue tolerances be set \nfor raw food commodities at levels necessary to protect public health \nconsidering the need for an adequate, wholesome, and economic food \nsupply. Thus risk and benefits are balanced in determining an \nacceptable tolerance level. This approach allows EPA to determine what \nlevel of risks are acceptable and to set tolerance levels accordingly. \nSuch an approach is scientifically defensible. Balancing risk and \nbenefits is a fundamental component in any decisionmaking process, \nwhether it concerns pesticides or any other product in the marketplace.\n  When pesticide residues concentrate in processed foods above levels \nof sanctioned on raw commodities, they are treated as food additives \nunder section 409. The Delaney clause in section 409 prohibits granting \na residue tolerance for any food additive that has been found to cause \ncancer in humans or animals, no matter how low the estimated risk might \nbe. Thus, for processed foods, no pesticide residue is permitted, if \nthe pesticide is a possible carcinogen and is concentrated above the \nlevel permitted on or in the raw food.\n  Advances in science and technology improving our ability to detect \nsmall quantities of substances, to parts per trillion in some cases, \nhave shown that the Delaney clause enacted in 1958 is scientifically \noutdated. As has been stated by EPA Administrator Browner, the \npesticides impacted by the Delaney clause do not pose an unacceptable \nrisk to public health.\n  This is not a partisan issue, as evidenced by the strong show of \nsupport from the cosponsors of this bill today. This group of Senators \nagrees: The Delaney clause needs modernization.\n  The scientific evidence is clear. Almost a decade ago, the\n   National Research Council's Board on Agriculture of the National \nAcademy of Sciences recommended the use of a single negligible risk \nstandard for approving acceptable levels of pesticide residues in both \nraw and processed foods. This recommendation appeared in the NRC's 1987 \nreport, ``Regulating Pesticides in Food: The Delaney Paradox.''\n\n  This bill implements the recommendations of the National Academy of \nSciences report by establishing a negligible risk standard for both raw \nand processed foods. Under current procedures, Federal regulators must \ndeal with two distinct and conflicting standards for pesticide residues \non raw and processed foods.\n  Despite many years of acknowledging the need for Delaney reform, \nCongress has failed to pass legislation. After the Environmental \nProtection Agency [EPA] in 1988 articulated its de minimis policy for \ninterpreting Delaney, the agency was sued. In 1992, the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled in favor of strict enforcement of \nDelaney. A consent decree in another case, agreed to by EPA this year, \nestablishes an expedited schedule of review of all pesticides impacted \nby Delaney. Reform can no longer be delayed.\n  Continuation of the Delaney clause and its strict enforcement could \nimpact the international competitiveness of U.S. agriculture. The \njudicious use of pesticides has enabled our Nation's farmers to improve \nyields and efficiency and become high quality and competitive producers \nfor the global marketplace. Researchers at the National Center for Food \nand Agricultural Policy have estimated that strict enforcement of \nDelaney could result in an increase in production costs of $175 million \nin the first year and yield losses totaling $212 million per year.\n  This bill also addresses concerns that have been raised following \nanother report of the National Research Council of the National Academy \nof Sciences, ``Pesticides in the Diets of Infants and Children.'' This \nlegislation directs EPA, the Department of Agriculture, and the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services to coordinate the development \nand implementation of procedures to ensure that pesticide tolerances \nadequately safeguard the health of infants and children based on this \nreport released in 1993.\n  Providing regulatory relief for minor use pesticides is also \nimportant in helping to ensure the availability of minor use pesticides \nfor farmers and an abundant and varied food supply for our Nation. \nMinor use pesticides are generally used on relatively small acreage or \nfor regional pest or disease problems. Because there is a significant \ncost to develop scientific data to register or reregister these \nproducts and there is a limited market potential once approved, many \nminor use pesticides are not being supported or are being voluntarily \ncanceled for economic, not safety reasons. This bill offers several \nincentives for manufacturers to maintain and develop new safe and \neffective pesticides for minor uses without compromising food safety or \nadversely affecting the environment.\n  This bill is similar to legislation that I cosponsored in the last \nCongress and to legislation now being considered within the House of \nRepresentatives. Legislation in the 103d Congress gained the support of \n21 of my Senate colleagues while legislation pending in the House this \nyear has already garnered 192 cosponsors.\n  I have a long history of involvement in these often complex and \nchallenging food safety and pesticide issues. As chairman of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, I am hopeful that this year we will be able to \nfinally see much needed reform of these food safety and pesticide \nstatutes. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bill and to recognize \nthat the Delaney clause is far too rigid. We need to move toward the \nfuture in a scientifically sound way by removing the unduly restrictive \nDelaney clause.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary and copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                S. 1166\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to exclude \nany private lands from the segment of the Missouri River designated as \na recreational river, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                niobrara recreational river legislation\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, earlier this year I spoke on the Senate \nfloor regarding the visit to Washington, DC, of an outstanding South \nDakota family--the Talsmas. Georgia and Larry Talsma, from Springfield, \nSD, made their first trip ever to Washington, DC, by car.\n  The Talsmas came to Washington to tell their story of how the Federal \nGovernment is intruding on their land and threatening to take over \ntheir private property. In its drive to protect a small portion of the \nMissouri River as a recreational river, the National Park Service \nappears intent on trampling private property rights.\n  During their visit, I arranged for the Director of the National Park \nService to come to my office and listen to the Talsmas. At that meeting \nI told the Director that I intended to introduce legislation to undo \nthe designation in South Dakota. This is an effort the Talsmas and \nother South Dakotans strongly support.\n  As a result of the Talsmas' visit, the Director agreed to push back \nthe deadline for a preferred alternative to no earlier than August 1, \n1995, assured the Talsmas there would be at least a 60-day comment \nperiod on any preferred alternative, and if more time is needed, \nDirector Kennedy said he would be willing to provide such time.\n  All in all, quite a success story for a family's first trip to \nWashington, DC, to convince the Federal Government that they were going \nto far.\n  Well, it was just a few weeks since the Talsmas returned to South \nDakota, that I received a letter from Georgia. It appeared that the new \nplans of the\n Director fell on deaf ears out in the regional office. At the next \npublic meeting the Talsmas were told there had been no communication \nfrom the Director of the Park Service to the regional office. In \naddition, the Park Service representative told the Talsmas that the \nDirector of the National Park Service was not well informed. I find \nthis lack of communication between the regional and D.C. offices very \ndisturbing. It certainly does little for the Talsma's hope that \ngovernment can work to solve problems.\n\n  As I told the Director at the meeting, I was prepared to introduce \nlegislation designed to protect property owners in South Dakota. The \nlegislation I am introducing today will do just that.\n  The first bill would ``undesignate'' the 39-mile stretch of the \nMissouri River as a recreational river. The second bill would exempt \nprivate property from any boundary of a recreational river. The second \nbill is necessary should the bill undesignating the river not pass.\n  All too often we hear of reports of the federal bureaucracy out of \ncontrol. Frankly, Congress helped create this problem by designating \nthe recreational river. However, I am sure that Congress never intended \nto trample private property rights.\n  The right thing to do is to undesignate the river, or, at the very \nleast, exempt private property from the designation.\n  The Talsmas and other South Dakota land owners want to see that their \nproperty and their rights fully protected. They want to see government \nwork to respond to the needs of property owners when government is \noverreaching. That is why the Talsmas traveled to Washington. They are \nright.\n  The bills I am introducing today will achieve that goal.\n                                 ______\n\n                                 \n[[Page S 12270]]\n\n      By Mr. KEMPTHORNE:\n  S. 1169. A bill to amend the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater \nStudy and Facilities Act to authorize construction of facilities for \nthe reclamation and reuse of wastewater at McCall, Idaho, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\nthe mccall area wastewater reclamation and reuse project authorization \n                              act of 1995\n\n Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today \nthat will enable the Federal Government to carry through on its \ncommitments and its responsibilities to improve water quality \nassociated with Federal facilities. Specifically, the bill authorizes \nthe Bureau of Reclamation to participate financially in a Federal, \nState, local, and private sector project to correct severe water \nquality problems in Cascade Reservoir, which is owned and operated by \nthe Bureau of Reclamation.\n  The water quality problems in Cascade Reservoir are so severe that at \nvarious times we have had both major fish kills and the death of some \ncattle. The primary culprit appears to be large amounts of phosphorus \nin the water, which result in algae blooms that are both aesthetically \ndispleasing and occasionally toxic. Last year, when the National Marine \nFisheries Service commanded Cascade Reservoir water to help flush \nmigrating endangered salmon toward the ocean, the water quality \nproblems got even worse and disrupted what has been an ongoing effort \nto improve water quality.\n  Cascade Reservoir is now formally listed as water quality limited \nunder section 303 of the Clean Water Act. Surrounding communities are \nunder court orders to fix the problems, and the clock is running out.\n  The community is identifying every means it can to reduce phosphorus \nloadings going\n into the north fork of the Payette River and Cascade Reservoir. \nStudies show that somewhere between 6 and 11 percent of the phosphorus \ncomes from the city of McCall's wastewater treatment plant, which \ndischarges effluent into the north fork of the Payette River.\n\n  Using its authority under the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater \nStudy and Facilities Act, the Bureau of Reclamation has identified the \nMcCall, ID, situation has an opportunity for the Bureau to facilitate \nthe reclamation and reuse of wastewater. Under a proposal that has been \ndeveloped by the State of Idaho, the city of McCall, and the Payette \nLakes Water and Sewer District with the Bureau of Reclamation, a \nproject would be constructed to use the wastewater presently discharged \ninto the north fork to irrigate agricultural land.\n  Direct irrigation would take place during the summer months, with the \neffluent being stored during the winter months for application during \nthe growing season. The arrangement will allow wastewater to be \nreclaimed and reused in a way that both improves water quality and meet \nfarmers needs for both water and crop nutrients.\n  The total cost of the project is roughly $11.3 million, of which the \nBureau of Reclamation will provide roughly $5.6 million. While most of \nthat commitment is intended for phase II of the project in fiscal year \n1997, expenditures of a portion of that amount in fiscal year 1996 \nwould go a long way toward strengthening the State, local, Federal, and \nprivate sector partnership that has been established here. The bill \nlimits the Federal cost share on the project to 50 percent of the total \ncapital costs, and prohibits the use of the funds for operations and \nmaintenance.\n  Mr. President, Cascade Reservoir is a Federal facility under the \njurisdiction of the Bureau of Reclamation. It is therefore appropriate \nthat it participate in solving the water quality problems of the \nreservoir.\n  I commend the regional director, John Keys, and his personnel, who \nhave recognized the Federal responsibility in this area. And, I \nappreciate all of those individuals who have worked so hard to develop \nthis part of the solution to the reservoir's water quality problems. \nThey have committed financially to this effort, and I hope Congress \nwill act expeditiously to enact this bill to authorize the McCall \nWastewater Reclamation and Reuse project so the Federal Government can \nfollow through with its financial commitment.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. PRESSLER (for himself and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 1170. A bill to limit the applicability of the generation-skipping \ntransfer tax; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n      the generation-skipping transfer tax correction act of 1995\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce a bill today \nthat would correct an unintended consequence of changes in the \ngeneration-skipping transfer [GST] tax that were made as part of the \n1986 Tax Reform Act. As the law currently stands, individuals are \ndiscouraged from establishing charitable trusts in certain \ncircumstances due to the tax treatment of such trusts. My bill would \ncorrect this discrepancy, thereby opening the option of contributing to \ncharity through this instrument to those who otherwise would not do so.\n  The corrections in my bill relate to the predeceased parent exclusion \nof the GST tax. As my colleagues know, the GST tax prevents individuals \nfrom avoiding estate and gift taxes by circumventing the first \ngeneration heir and passing the assets along to a second generation \nheir, thereby skipping a generation. The exclusion provides that the \nGST tax is not applied to direct gifts or bequests made by a \ngrandparent to a grandchild where the grandchild's parent--the \ntransferor's child--is deceased at the time of the transfer. In this \nsituation, clearly there is no intent to circumvent the tax by skipping \na generation, as that generation no longer exists.\n  My bill would correct two problems in the current law. First, as the \nlaw is currently written, childless individuals are treated differently \nthan those who have lineal descendants. An individual who outlives his \nor her own generation--siblings and cousins--and the subsequent \ngeneration--nieces and nephews--cannot transfer property to his or her \ngrandnieces and grandnephews without being hit by the punitive GST tax.\n  This seems to be an inequitable, and unintended, situation which \nneeds to be resolved so that these individuals can transfer property to \ntheir closest living relatives. My bill would amend the exclusion to \nmake it applicable to collateral heirs in this situation.\n  Second, current law limits the predeceased parent exclusion to direct \ngifts and bequests only; it does not apply to any type of transfer from \na trust. Unfortunately, the effect of this limitation is to strongly \ndiscourage individuals, whose direct gifts or bequests would otherwise \nbe covered by the exclusion, from establishing a charitable trust for \nsome period of years before distributing the property to qualifying \nfamily members.\n  Trusts of this nature are very important to charities in South Dakota \nand across the country. Because of this discriminatory treatment of \ntrusts, many South Dakotan charitable groups stand to lose potential \nfunding sources. As volunteer and charitable service groups are vital \nfor our communities, I find it unproductive to have excessive rules in \nthe tax code such as this that chill charitable giving, and do not \nserve the ends that the GST was established to achieve.\n  In this era of tight budgetary constraints on the federal budget, we \nneed to do all that we can to encourage private charitable giving that \nhelps those who are less fortunate within our communities. This bill \nlifts an unnecessary restriction on giving and I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in support of this bill to change these rules so that \ncharitable giving may continue to flourish.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself and Mr. Ford):\n  S. 1171. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \nthe application of the passive loss limitations to equine activities; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                        passive loss legislation\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator Ford, I \nrise today to introduce a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code to \nmodify application of passive loss limitations to horse activities.\n  The horse industry is extremely important for my State, and for the \nthousands of Kentuckians who actively participate in horse-related \nactivities--whether it is owning, breeding, or racing horses, or simply \nenjoying an afternoon trail ride or horse show. However, \n\n[[Page S 12271]]\nthe horse industry has been adversely impacted by the changes made in \nthe Tax Reform Act of 1986 with job losses occurring at racetracks and \nhorse farms. Hundreds of breeding farms have gone out of business.\n  The horse industry is a $15.2 billion industry that employs and \nsupports hundreds of thousands of workers. In Kentucky alone, a study \ndone by the University of Kentucky found that $5 billion annually can \nbe attributed to the direct and indirect effects of the horse industry. \nThe study also emphasized that the majority of people involved in \nbreeding horses operate small, family run farms, a detail that garners \nlittle attention. The equine industry is an extremely labor-intensive \nindustry employing hundreds of thousands of people to do everything \nfrom exercising horses to track, employees to trainers. In Kentucky, \nover 80,000 jobs are related to the horse industry.\n  What supports the horse industry, including the job base, the \nbreeding farms and the revenue stream in the form of taxes to all \nlevels of Government, is the investment in the horses themselves. The \nhorse industry relies on outside investment to operate, just as other \nbusinesses do. Without owners willing to buy, breed, and race horses, \nthe hundreds of thousands who are employed fulltime by the industry \ncannot work. Without such investment, jobs and revenue are lost.\n  Since the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the horse industry has experienced \na near devastating decline. Most horse owners and breeders believe that \nthe limits on passive losses was a major reason for the decline, and \nchilled the interest of investors in horses. Since the mid-1980's, the \nnumber of horses bred and registered has decreased--leading to losses \nin jobs and revenues for states.\n  The 1986 act indicates that in order to satisfy the material \nparticipation requirement, a person's involvement must be regular, \ncontinuous, and substantial. The passive loss rules are difficult for \nmany to satisfy because this is such a unique industry. It is difficult \nfor many owners to ride, train, breed, or show their horses because of \nthe expertise and physical ability that is required. This would alter \nthese requirements to make them fair, workable, and enforceable.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. ROTH (for himself, Mr. Hatch, and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 1172. A bill to amend the Revenue Act of 1987 to provide a \npermanent extension of the transition rule for certain publicly traded \npartnerships; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                publicly traded partnerships legislation\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce, along with my \nFinance Committee colleagues, Mr. Baucus and Mr. Hatch, a bill to \ncorrect what I believe was a mistake made in the Omnibus Budget \nReconciliation Act of 1987 relating to publicly traded partnerships, or \nPTP's, as they are commonly known. PTP's are limited partnerships \ntraded as units on public stock exchanges or over the counter. They are \nregulated by the SEC comparably to other public companies. Many \ninvestors, large and small, find PTP units to be safe, liquid \ninvestments.\n  The 1987 act included a change to the Tax Code which arbitrarily \nlimited the future life of certain PTP's to no more than 10 years. The \npurpose of our amendment is to eliminate that change and permit this \nsmall group of PTP's that were in existence back in 1987 to continue \noperating as partnerships as long as they wish. We believe that a \nmistake was made in 1987. If the mistake is not corrected in the very \nnear future, these companies will be forced to undertake an expensive \nand disruptive conversion to corporate form, or some other operating \nform. No public purpose will be served by such forced conversions.\n  PTP's first came into being in the early 1980's as a new means to \nraise capital for industries that had traditionally done business in \npartnership form. At the time, a number of corporations decided that \nthe PTP structure better suited their operations. A few years later, \nCongress became concerned that the opportunity to become a PTP might \nerode the corporate tax base and decided, in 1987, to limit the extent \nto which new PTP's could be created. The law restricted future PTP \noperating status to companies in the energy, real estate, and natural \nresources sectors.\n  For reasons that were not clear at the time, and still are not clear \nfrom the committee reports explaining the 1987 act, all companies then \noperating as PTP's outside the protected sectors were to be \n``sunsetted,'' or terminated, within 10 years. Unless the law is \nchanged, this provision, sometimes referred to as the ``PTP grandfather \nprovision,'' will punish 27 American companies who played by the rules. \nUnless changed, this provision of law will compel them to convert by \nJanuary 1, 1998.\n  Our amendment would stop this punitive process in its tracks. Our \namendment recognizes the positive contribution that these companies \nmake to their communities, to their employees, and to the unit holders. \nOur amendment is consistent with many precedents which have changed tax \nlaw prospectively, and left alone those who relied on prior law for \nmajor business decisions.\n  Our amendment also strikes a blow for fairness. After all, companies \nthat converted to PTP form went through a complex, expensive,\n and time-consuming process. In so doing, they relied on the \nexpectation that they would be able to operate as partnerships as long \nas they wanted. If they ever wished to convert to corporate form, or to \nbecome a nontraded partnership, they could do so when it was in their \nbest interests. Some firms have converted voluntarily during the \nintervening years for business reasons unrelated to the sunset. \nHowever, to force such a conversion arbitrarily is totally unfair, and \nwill require the investment of significant resources and managerial \ntime far better devoted to strengthening these companies.\n\n  There were only about 120 PTP's in existence in 1987; nearly three-\nfourths of which were in lines of business untouched by the new \nrestrictions. Today, their are still 27 ``grandfathered'' PTP's in \noperation. They are in such businesses as nursing homes, restaurants, \nhotels and motels, investment management and financial advisory \nservices, cable television, home, and office services such as carpet \ncleaning, lawn maintenance and pest control, and even Macadamaia nuts.\n  They operate in all 50 states and employ more than 225,000 people \nnationwide--from fewer than 200 people in Alaska, South Dakota, and \nVermont, to more than 10,000 people in California, Illinois, Ohio, \nPennsylvania, and Texas. There are more than 300,000 unit holders \nnationwide from as few as 500 in North Dakota to as many as 30,000 in \nCalifornia.\n  These are the people with the greatest stake in this amendment--the \nemployees and unit holders of the affected PTP's. Unless our amendment \nis enacted into law, the value of units will decline. The investors \nwill suffer--most of whom are average, middle-class Americans who \npurchased their PTP's, oftentimes through an individual retirement \naccount, because of the attractive yield, safety, and liquidity. As PTP \nunits decline in value, a company's ability to expand will be \nnegatively affected and the employees will suffer. Employees who are \nalso unit holders--tens of thousands of individuals nationwide--face a \n``double whammy.''\n  I hope my colleagues will agree that this punitive provision of the \ntax code is unfair, counterproductive, and contrary to the objectives \nof capital formation and jobs growth. Our amendment would fix the \nproblem, so I urge its inclusion in this year's tax bill.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my distinguished \ncolleague from Delaware, Senator Roth, in introducing legislation that \nwould prevent publicly traded partnerships [PTP's] from becoming \nsubject to the double taxation of corporate tax status. This bill \nextends permanently the tax law that recognizes these entities as \nordinary partnerships for tax purposes. As a result, they will escape \nthe unfair consequences that would occur if this bill is not passed.\n  The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act [OBRA] of 1987 changed the tax \nlaw so that all PTP's would be treated, for tax purposes, as \ncorporations. However, those partnerships established prior to this \nlegislation were grandfathered. For the past 8 years, these \ngrandfathered PTP's have been taxed as \n\n[[Page S 12272]]\npartnerships, but the grandfather protection provided by OBRA '87 will \nexpire at the end of 1997. In order to continue this needed protection \nfrom double taxation, it is necessary to extend this provision \npermanently.\n  At the time OBRA '87 was enacted, the Congress commissioned the \nTreasury Department to study the effect that this change in the \ntaxation of PTP's would have on Federal revenue. However, the 1991 \nTreasury study on large partnerships did not address this issue \ndirectly. This suggests to me the possibility of invalid reasoning \nbehind OBRA '87 provision that taxes newly formed PTP's as \ncorporations. This apparent lack of justification in taxing newly \nformed publicly traded partnerships as corporations clearly makes \nswitching the grandfathered PTP's to this tax status unfair.\n  Mr. President, the world recognizes America as a land of business \nopportunity. In order to preserve these partnerships from penalties and \ntaxes that were unforeseen at the time of their establishment--and to \nprevent negative repercussions for workers, investors, customers, and \nsuppliers--I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN (for himself, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Bradley, and Mr. \n        Lautenberg):\n  S. 1175. A bill to suspend temporarily the duty for personal effect \nof participants in certain world athletic events; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                      foreign athletes legislation\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nfacilitate the entry of foreign athletes into the United States to \nparticipate in the 1998 Goodwill Games. The New York metropolitan area \nhas assumed the honor of hosting the 1998 games, with events to be held \nin both New York and New Jersey. I am pleased to be joined by Senator \nD'Amato, Bradley, and Lautenberg in this effort. The House Ways and \nMeans Subcommittee on Trade approved an identical measure last week.\n  The United States has routinely granted duty-free entry for such \nevents in the past. Last year, Congress granted temporary customs duty \nwaivers to the 1994 World Cup, the 1996 Summer Olympics, and three \nother international sporting events. Before that, to the World \nUniversity Games held in 1993 in Buffalo, NY. Without this bill, teams, \nathletes and officials would suffer an extensive Customs paperwork \nprocess and pay duties for their equipment and personal effects. They \nwould receive refunds of these duties only upon their departure from \nthe United States. Furthermore, handling the sheer volume of \nparticipants who will enter the United States would pose a serious \nburden on U.S. Customs officials, who have many other important \nresponsibilities. Foreign nations, without exception, assure hassle-\nfree entry for U.S. athletes participating in similar events, and we \nshould continue to reciprocate the courtesy.\n  New York is much looking forward to hosting the 1998 Goodwill Games, \nwhich, since they follow the 1998 Winter Olympic Games in Nagano, \nJapan, should be the final major gathering of nations in the 20th \ncentury. This is fitting because the games were founded with the vision \nof promoting international cooperation through world-class competition. \nMoscow hosted the inaugural games in 1986--the cold war still \npersisting and only 2 years after the Soviets boycotted the 1984 Summer \nOlympics in Los Angeles--and the world witnessed 91 national 8 \nEuropean, and 6 world records broken. The 1990 games in Seattle were \nthe largest cultural and business-to-business exchange in United \nStates-Soviet history, and the 1994 games in St. Petersburg, Russia \nwere the first international event in Democratic Russia. Organizers \nanticipate the 1998 games in New York to attract 3,000 athletes from \nover 70 countries, and I expect them to be a worthy addition to this \nimpressive history.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. KYL (for himself and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 1176. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to make \ncertain modifications with respect to a water contact with the city of \nKingman, Arizona, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n\n\n                       water contract legislation\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I join today with my colleague from \nArizona, Senator Kyl, in introducing legislation to help resolve a \nproblem that affects the water supplies of more than 120,000 of our \nconstituents in Mohave County, AZ.\n  Representative Bob Stump (R-AZ), whose Third Congressional District \nincludes Mohave County, recently introduced a similar bill cosponsored \nby all Arizona House Members.\n  The purpose of the bill is to require the Secretary of the Interior \nto take three actions with respect to a contract that provides for the \nSecretary to deliver 18,500 acre-feet of Colorado River water to the \ncity of Kingman, AZ.\n  First, the measure directs the Secretary to amend the contract by \nextending its term from December 31, 1995, to December 31, 2001.\n  Second, the bill directs the Secretary, within 60 days of receiving a \nrequest from Kingman, to approve the assignment of the amended contract \nto the Mohave County Water Authority, a corporation organized pursuant \nto State law.\n  Third, the bill directs the Secretary to further amend the contract \nso as to make water available for permanent service, consistent with a \nplan developed by the city in consultation with the U.S. Bureau of \nReclamation.\n  Mr. President, enactment of this legislation is necessary to \nimplement a regional plan for meeting existing and future water needs \nof the city of Kingman and other fast-growing communities in Mohave \nCounty. The most significant element of this plan is the assignment of \nKingman's contract for Colorado River water to the Mohave County Water \nAuthority.\n  In 1968, Kingman entered into a contract with the Secretary of the \nInterior providing for the annual delivery of 18,500 acre-feet of \nColorado River water for use by the city's municipal and industrial \ncustomers. Under this contract, the United States reserved the right to \nterminate the contract if Kingman did not ``order, divert, transport \nand apply to water for use by the city'' by November 13, 1993.\n  In the early 1970's, the city began studying various alternatives to \nfacilitate direct use of its entitlement to Colorado River water.These \nstudies consistently indicated that the capital expenditures required \nfor water transportation and treatment make direct use of the water \nprohibitively expensive.\n  In May 1993, the city adopted a water adequacy study that set forth a \nlong-term water resource management plan. The plan is based largely on \na hydrological analysis of the Hualapai Basin, which is Kingman's \nprimary groundwater source. This analysis concluded that there is more \nthan enough groundwater in the basin to meet the city's needs for the \nnext century. Accordingly, the study recommended that the city's \nColorado River entitlement be exchanged for funds to develop its \ngroundwater resources, and to pursue effluent reuse and conservation \nprojects.\n  Subsequently, Kingman solicited statements of interest from entities \nthat would be interested in an exchange of the city's contractual \nentitlement to Colorado River water. In a response that reflects the \ngreat need in the region for water, seven entities expressed an \ninterest in obtaining more than 45,000 acre-feet of water annually.\n  In September 1993, the Bureau of Reclamation extended Kingman's \ncontract to provide additional time for the city and other Mohave \nCounty communities to develop a regional approach to putting Kingman's \nentitlement to beneficial use. Public meetings and discussions by the \nColorado River Ad Hoc Water Users Group/Mojave Ad Hoc Committee, \nKingman, Bullhead City, Lake Havasu City, Golden Shores Water \nConservation District, the Mojave Valley Irrigation and Drainage \nDistrict, the Mohave Water Conservation District, and others, led to a \nconsensus that a county water authority should be created. This new \nauthority would also\n satisfy Reclamation's expressed interest in having a single entity to \nwork with in coordinating efforts to meet the needs of water \ncontractors in Mohave County.\n\n  In January 1994, Mohave County's representatives in the State \nlegislature introduced legislation to establish a \n\n[[Page S 12273]]\nMohave County Water Authority. Governor Fife Symington signed the bill \ninto law on April 8, 1994, and the Arizona Department of Water \nResources recommended that the Bureau of Reclamation initiate the \nprocess to effect the transfer of Kingman's water to the authority. To \nprovide the time needed to complete this process, the Bureau again \nextended the contract to December 31, 1995.\n  In March 1995, just days before Kingman, the authority and \nReclamation were to sign the documents necessary to assign the city's \nwater to the authority, the Interior Department abruptly directed \nReclamation to ``temporarily suspend'' the proceedings. It was later \nlearned that the reason for this suspension was a last-minute decision \nby the Department to look at possibly using the Kingman water to settle \nIndian water rights claims in Arizona.\n  The Arizona delegation has always recognized that water from many \nsources will be needed to complete settlements of the remaining tribal \nclaims in our State. However, at no time has the delegation or the \nState of Arizona regard the Kingman water allocation as a necessary \npart of any overall Indian water settlement plan. To the contrary, as \nnoted in the preceding paragraphs, the delegation has worked to assist \nKingman and other Mohave County communities in the their efforts to \ndevelop the kind of regional solution that the new county water \nauthority represents.\n  Mr. President, over the past 12 years, Arizona congressional \ndelegations have worked with previous administrations and the current \nadministration in seeking to settle Indian water rights claims by \nnegotiation, not litigation. A high level of cooperation and \ncommunication has characterized these efforts, which thus far have \nresulted in Congress enacting six water settlements involving Arizona \ntribes. Settling the remaining water rights claims of Arizona tribes \nwill require similar efforts, and involve completion of the allocation \nof Arizona's finite water sources.\n  Regrettably, the Department's action in aborting the lengthy process \nby which the Kingman water was to be allocated was contrary to all \nprevious representations and commitments by the Department regarding \nthe Kingman water. It effectively disregarded the extensive efforts by \nMohave County, the Arizona Department of Water Resources, the Arizona \nlegislature, and the local communities and citizens who, with the \nactive cooperation and support by the Bureau of Reclamation, developed \nthe Mohave County Water Authority.\n  Mr. President, I strongly believe that the agreements that were to \nhave been concluded in March that would have assigned the Kingman water \ncontract to the Mohave County Water Authority should be signed and \nimplemented. The legislation that Senator Kyl and I introduce today \nwill simply ensure that the assignment will occur as planned.\n  I am hopeful that the Congress can consider and approve this \nlegislation in an expeditious manner. I am also hopeful that the \nDepartment will support this legislation in an effort to reestablish \nthe kind of cooperation and communication that is so essential to \nconcluding and implementing the complex agreements that comprise any \nwater rights settlement.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 1177. A bill to amend the Social Security Act and the Internal \nRevenue Code of 1986 to provide improved access to quality long-term \ncare services, to obtain cost savings through provider incentives and \nremoval of regulatory and legislative barriers, to encourage greater \nprivate sector participation and personal responsibility in financing \nsuch services, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                     the quality care for life act\n\n  Mr. HATCH.\n   Mr. President, I rise today to introduce S. 1177, the Quality Care \nfor Life Act, which offers ideas on how we can deal with an important \nand necessary aspect of our health care delivery system--long term \ncare.\n\n  One of the most frequent concerns I hear from citizens of Utah is the \nfear of having to impoverish themselves and their loved ones in order \nto obtain much needed long term care services.\n  Clearly, long term care is an issue of vital concern to our \nconstituents and to Members of this body as well.\n  But, the issue of long term care always presents this body with a \ndilemma.\n  On the one hand, Senators wish very much that we can offer some kind \nof help to many, many American families that face the human and \nfinancial struggle of needing long term care.\n  On the other hand, a public program to provide and/or pay for long \nterm care, if not designed properly, could prove enormously expensive \nand become just another promise that we cannot keep.\n  At a time when this country faces budget deficits so massive that \nthey affect the future viability of our country, I do not think that we \ncan afford any enormously expensive new program. That is not my intent \nin putting this bill forward today.\n  Indeed, I hope that this measure will offer a useful starting point \nin the Senate for discussions on long term care and related issues, \nincluding the appropriate Federal role. Obviously, any final measure we \nadopt must be crafted very carefully in close consultation with the \nCongressional Budget Office, so that it does not add unduly to the \ndeficit.\n  In the interim, I think it is important that the Senate indicate its \ncommitment to resolving the long term care dilemma which faces so many \nAmericans.\n  The extent of the proposals we consider, and their costs, are \nfactors, but they should not become obstacles. Because we cannot do it \nall for everyone, we must not settle for doing nothing for anyone.\n  It is only by taking action now to lay the foundations for a public/\nprivate partnership that our society will be prepared 10, 20, and 30 \nyears hence to meet the long term care needs of a growing elderly \npopulation.\n  I am putting forth this legislative proposal, the Quality Care for \nLife Act, in order to provoke a national dialogue on our Nation's long \nterm care needs and how they can best be addressed.\n  In drafting S. 1177, I attempted to widen and strengthen the long \nterm care safety net with appropriate reliance on private sector \nresources.\n  Last year, this body considered health care reform legislation that \nwould have created a new Federal long term care program offering \nFederal and State payment for long term care services to the \nfunctionally disabled.\n  Many of us agreed with the intent of that program, but had serious \nconcerns about whether it embodied the best approach for addressing our \nNation's long term care needs.\n  First, such a program would have been far too expensive. It is clear \nthat we are going to have to invest greater resources in long term \ncare. However, in making that investment, we must make sure that we \ninvest wisely, and that we offer solutions that address the need in a \nconstructive manner.\n  Second, such a program would not have embodied true reform; it would \nonly have created yet more government programs modeled after previous \nand ineffective government programs.\n  The legislation I am introducing today meets the same goals as the \nmore ambitious and expensive legislation that we considered last year, \nyet it accomplishes them through a more targeted and cost-effective \napproach.\n  For the edification of my colleagues, I would like to describe the \nproblems that my legislation seeks to remedy, and outline how the bill \naddresses those areas.\n\n\n            The Need for Change in Long Term Care Financing\n\n  Our society, individually and collectively, has not made adequate \nprovisions for financing the costs of long term care. Individuals and \nfamilies are not saving for, or insuring themselves against, the costs \nof long term care. The Federal/State Medicaid Program is stretched to \nthe breaking point. Families and governments are going broke.\n  Without action to address these problems, our growing elderly \npopulation will come to rely much more heavily on Medicaid to pay for \nlong term care. In 1993, Medicaid accounted for approximately 52 \npercent of all long term care payment--and about 69 percent of all \nnursing facility residents--in the United States. If current trends \ncontinue unchecked, Medicaid will be burdened with an ever increasing \nshare of the nation's long term care costs as the baby boomers reach \nretirement. \n\n[[Page S 12274]]\n\n  But these current trends cannot continue. Federal and State budgets--\nalready strained badly by current Medicaid long term care obligations--\ncannot bear such costs. Nor would the elderly be well served by an \noverwhelmed Medicaid Program.\n  February 1993 Gallup Organization survey results indicated that 76 \npercent of Americans agree that ``government should pay the cost of \nnursing home care only for those who cannot afford it.'' In order to \nmeet the Nation's growing long term care needs without both emptying \nthe public purse and sacrificing quality of care, our society cannot \nafford to rely solely on government.\n  Instead, we must encourage and enforce an expectation of personal \nresponsibility on the part of those with the means to plan for and pay \nfor potential long term care costs. Government can--and must--help in \nthe effort by working to see that individuals have the information and \nresources needed to accept responsibility for meeting their own long \nterm care needs.\n\n\n         Long Term Care Costs are Impoverishing Senior Citizens\n\n  Most elderly Americans are unaware of the magnitude of long term care \ncosts and of the limits of government assistance. Most Americans do not \nforesee needing long term care. Most probably do not realize how costly \nmonths or years of long term care can be.\n  Many Americans wrongly assume that government programs of their \ngeneral health insurance will cover the cost of any long term care \nservices they might need. For all these reasons, individuals and \nfamilies face long term care costs for which they have not planned and \nwhich they cannot afford.\n  The costs of long term care can quickly wipe out the assets even of \nthose who have worked and saved for a lifetime. The cost of 1 year of \nnursing home care is more than triple the average annual income for an \nelderly American.\n  But the nation's current long term care policy does not promote \npersonal planning, saving, or the purchase of insurance against the \nfinancial risk of long term care costs. Nor does our Nation provide \ncomprehensive social insurance against the financial catastrophe of \nlong term care costs. Only after a long term care recipient has been \nimpoverished does government assistance become available through \nMedicaid--a welfare program.\n\n\n      Medicaid is Impoverishing the Federal and State Governments\n\n  According to the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), total \nMedicaid payments (state and federal) have nearly doubled over recent \nyears--from $54.5 billion in FY 1989 to $101.7 billion in fiscal year \n1993. The countless court battles over Medicaid reimbursement, and the \nprotracted battle over ``provider specific taxes'' well illustrate the \nstrain that Medicaid is putting on State and Federal resources. This \nstrain jeopardizes the availability and quality of both acute and long \nterm care for those who must depend on Medicaid.\n  Clearly, if current long term care needs have stretched Federal and \nState budgets to their limits, the future needs of a burgeoning \npopulation of elderly will overwhelm our current arrangements for long \nterm care financing. Therefore, the nation must look to sources other \nthan government for additional resources to meet the future long term \ncare needs.\n  I believe that long term care reform should have the following goals: \nproviding appropriate access to the full continuum of long term care \nservices; ensuring that all Americans have the means to meet the cost \nof long term care; moving individuals and families away from dependence \non government welfare; programs for long term care financing; and \naddressing the Nation's long term care needs in a fiscally responsible \nway.\n\n\n              The Role of Private Long Term Care Insurance\n\n  Results from the March 1993 Gallup Organization survey indicate that \n79 percent of Americans agree that ``to keep government costs as low as \npossible, private insurance should play a more active role in paying \nfor nursing home bills for most Americans.''\n  Private insurance, so useful in protecting individuals and families \nform such costly misfortunes as accidents and illness, has great \npotential for marshaling private sector resources to meet long term \ncare costs.\n  Insurance offers a very good means to preserve an individuals's \nchoice from among various long term care arrangements and competing \nproviders. Its expanded use would make an appropriate private/public \nlong term care cost burden that the graying of America will otherwise \nput on the American taxpayer.\n  To date, private insurance accounts for less that two percent of all \npayments for long term care services. I am confident, however, that \nwith appropriate changes in federal policies private long term care \ninsurance can and will take on a larger role of private insurance, a \nnumber of things must change. Chiefly, long term care insurance \npolicies must have value to consumers.\n  Many States are interested in encouraging residents to purchase \nprivate long term care insurance because they see an opportunity to \nslow the growth of their Medicaid spending by shifting a significant \nshare of long term care costs to private insurance. We are now \nbeginning to see evidence of how much long term care insurance can save \nthe Medicaid Program. Publishing in Health Affairs in the fall of 1994, \nMarc Cohen, Nanda Kumar, and Stanley Wallack estimated that having a \nlong term care insurance policy reduces the probability of spending \ndown to Medicaid eligibility levels by some 39 percent. The authors \nestimate that, in the aggregate, Medicaid expenditures would be reduced \nby $7,945 to $15,519 for every nursing home entrant who had a long term \ncare insurance policy. According to the analysis of Cohen, Kumar, and \nWallack, this translates into cutting what Medicaid pays per nursing \nhome entrant in half for long term care purchasers.\n  The Quality Care for Life Act would make the laws tighter on asset \ntransfers so that people cannot avoid their personal responsibilities \nby protecting unreasonable amounts of their personal funds from \nlegitimate nursing home expenses, thus shifting the burden to \ntaxpayers.\n\n\n  Federal Long Term Care Insurance Standards and Consumer Protections\n\n  Appropriate Federal standards and consumer protections for long term \ncare insurance would inspire consumer confidence, foster growth of the \nprivate long term care insurance market, and ensure that elderly \nconsumers are spared the problems that once plagued the Medigap \ninsurance business. Accordingly, S. 1177 would establish Federal \nstandards to ensure appropriate policy design and sales practices.\n\n\n   Clarification of the Federal Tax Status of Private Long Term Care \n                               Insurance\n\n  The Quality Care for Life Act would make the following clarifications \nto the tax treatment of long term care insurance: treatment of long \nterm care insurance premiums paid by individuals in the same manner as \naccident and health insurance premiums; treatment of benefits received \nunder long term care insurance contracts for long term care services in \nthe same manner as benefits received under accident and health \ninsurance; treatment of employer plans providing long term care \nservices in the same manner as accident or health plans; treatment of \nlife insurance benefits paid to a terminally ill individual in the same \nmanner as death benefits; inclusion of long term care options as \npreferred employee benefits in employer programs, including cafeteria \nplans; and clarification of the allowance of tax deduction for \nadditions to an insurer's long term care insurance reserves.\n  The private long term care insurance market is growing and improving. \nProducts have evolved and improved. Insurance companies, have gained \nexperience and expertise in designing and pricing policies. Sales have \nbeen rising by 30-35 percent a year over recent years. There have been \nsome two million long term care policies purchased. I believe that the \nprivate long term care insurance market is on the way to realizing its \npotential. With the right kind of Federal standards, consumers will \ncome to understand the value of long term care insurance. Private \ninsurance can then become a full partner in a private/public long term \ncare partnership.\n\n\n          Expansion of Home and Community Based Long Term Care\n\n  Today, about 6 million older Americans living at home need assistance \nas \n\n[[Page S 12275]]\na result of their disabilities. As we in Congress debate a health care \nsystem that addresses our current inequities in access and costs, we \nmust lay the foundation for addressing our long term care demands of \ntoday and tomorrow.\n  The Quality Care for Life Act would establish a home and community \nbased service program for disabled persons who either need assistance \nwith three activities of daily living or who suffer from Alzheimer's \ndisease or a related cognitive disorder.\n  S. 1177 also revises the reimbursement system to create a payment \nlevel for subacute care in nursing home, thus increasing access for \nthose patients who need that level of care but are unable to get that \ncare in community nursing facilities because the costs for providing \nthe service are much higher than the current skilled nursing home daily \nrate. Currently, these services are provided by hospitals at a much \nhigher cost. Finally, the bill provides for a prospective payment \nsystem for nursing facilities.\n  By the year 2030, there will be more elderly than young people, and \nthe population age 85 and over is expected to more than triple in size \nbetween 1980 and 2030. My home State of Utah has the fastest growing \npopulation over 80 in the country.\n  We simply do not have the necessary federal resources to provide all \nAmericans every benefit they need. An aging population will \nsignificantly increase demand for long term care services. Planning \ntoday will save us from bankruptcy and lack of services tomorrow.\n  I believe the greatest barrier to enacting long term care legislation \nhas been its substantial cost. Although any proposal will entail new \ncosts, I have constructed the Quality Care for Life Act to place \nmaximum reliance upon the private sector wherever possible, in order to \nleverage our resources since we will be providing new services. It is \ntrue that my bill will entail new spending in the short-run, but these \nfunds are an investment which will achieve greater savings over the \nlong-run.\n  Some of the costs will be incurred because we are establishing a \nfloor for home health services, so that the most frail and sick of our \nelderly population are guaranteed home care now. Currently, many fall \nthrough the cracks of our care system. They lack adequate home care and \nare denied access to adequate nursing home services.\n  We all know that the amount and duration of home care services varies \nfrom State to State and also varies with State areas between urban and \nrural areas. But this is not fair to our frail elderly, and we have a \nresponsibility to see that all Americans, regardless of where they \nlive, can receive the home care services they need and deserve.\n  If we help our elderly now, and provide the kinds of home care \nservices they need, they may never need to be in a nursing home and may \nnever be a long-term drain on scarce Federal financial resources. We \ncan do the right thing, and do it now. If we do not act soon, we will \nbe mortgaging our children's future to pay for our own long term care \nneeds.\n  I intend to work with the other members of this body so that we can \nprovide our Nation's elderly the care they so badly need and deserve. I \nthink that the Quality Care for Life proposal will go a long way in \nmeeting that goal, and I hope my colleagues will give it serious \nconsideration. I certainly welcome their suggestions.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. CHAFEE (for himself, Mr. Mack, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Pell, Mr. \n        Bumpers, and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 1178. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for coverage of colorectal screening under part B of the \nMedicare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            THE CANCER SCREENING AND PREVENTION ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Cancer \nScreening and Prevention Act of 1995. This bill targets colorectal \ncancer, one of this Nation's leading causes of death by cancer, by \nproviding coverage under Medicare for prevention and early detection of \ncolorectal cancer services. Medicare already provides for the treatment \nof colorectal cancer, but the treatment of this disease in its later \nstages is much more expensive than finding it early and treating it \nearly.\n  Last year, a Senate amendment--offered by my colleague from Utah, Mr. \nHatch--was adopted during the health reform debate with strong \nbipartisan support. It directed that colorectal cancer screening \nbenefits consistent with the guide to clinical preventive services, \nrecommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, be included in \nany health care reform comprehensive benefits package. An amendment \nvirtually identical to the bill I am introducing today, was passed with \nstrong bipartisan support last year by the relevant House committees. A \ncompanion bill was introduced again this year in the House and has well \nover 40 cosponsors. I am hopeful our bill will receive similar strong \nsupport. I believe it is important for the Congress to act on this bill \nin order to stop the deaths this disease causes without prevention \nscreening.\n  In 1995 alone, 55,300 people are expected to die from colorectal \ncancer, and 138,200 new cases will be found. Colorectal cancer is the \nsecond leading cause of cancer death in this Nation--far more men and \nwomen die each year of colorectal cancer than with breast cancer or \nprostate cancer. In fact, colorectal cancer strikes men and women \nequally but is easily treated when found early.\n  If colorectal cancer is not found early, the 5-year survival rate is \n60 percent or lower. Early detection, however, can boost patients' 5-\nyear survival rate to 91 percent. That differential is astonishing when \nmeasured in terms of lives and dollars saved. In recent years, colon \ncancers have become almost completely preventable by using techniques \nwhich became readily available only during the past decade. The vast \nmajority of those afflicted with colorectal cancer are over the age of \n50. Unfortunately, Medicare does not specifically cover colorectal \ncancer screening and prevention services and it should.\n  In recent years, scientific developments have made clear that \ncolorectal cancer can be eradicated. Just as Medicare now covers other \npreventive services such as mammography screening and flu shots, its \ntime to add colorectal screening and prevention services.\n  Several years ago, we moved aggressively to ensure that women took \nappropriate steps to prevent cervical cancer. It is time now to move \naggressively to provide the preventive services necessary to eradicate \nthis lethal cancer in the population most at risk.\n  A study recently published in the Journal of the National Cancer \nInstitute evaluated the effect of various factors on the costs of colon \nand other cancers. Not surprisingly, the study found that the costs \nassociated with initial care of colon cancer was higher than when the \ncancer was first detected in its later stages. Based on these findings, \nthe study concluded that interventions that prevent colon cancer will \nafford the greatest immediate cost savings.\n  Under this act, all Medicare recipients will be eligible for limited \ncancer screening or preventive services. For certain high risk \nindividuals a more comprehensive examination is available.\n  The legislation enables early detection of colon cancer by providing \nfor an annual fecal occult blood test. This low-cost, noninvasive \nblood-screening test allows for early detection of colorectal cancer. \nResearch shows that this test, as well as a followup exam of a positive \nresult, reduces cancer risks from 33 to 43 percent. The average cost of \nthis test is only $5.\n  Second, this legislation includes limited coverage of a flexible \nsigmoidoscopy exam which enables a doctor to inspect the lower part of \nthe colon where 50 to 60 percent of polyps and cancers occur. This \npreventive service would be available no more than once every 4 years \nand is an essential component of the basic screening regimen \nrecommended by the American Cancer Society for all asymptomatic, \naverage risk Americans over the age of 50.\n  Third, this act would allow individuals at high risk for getting \ncolon cancer to receive a screening colonoscopy exam no more than once \nevery 2 years. A screening colonoscopy allows a doctor to inspect the \nentire colon. This procedure also enables doctors contemporaneously to \nperform biopsies and to remove potentially precancerous polyps.\n\n[[Page S 12276]]\n\n  The Cancer Screening and Prevention Act of 1995 specifically \ndelineates those individuals at high risk for colon cancer, and allows \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority to revise the \ncategory of high risk individuals. An individual faces a high risk of \ncolon cancer if he or she has a history of cancer, suspicious polyps, \nor chronic digestive diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, \nCrohn's disease, or ulcerative colitis, or if the individual has any \ngene markers for colorectal cancer present, or has a family history of \ncolon cancer.\n  The preventive screening services in this act are all standard \nmedical procedures which are recommended by the American Cancer \nSociety, the National Cancer Institute, the American College of \nGastroenterology, the American Gastroenterological Association, and the \nAmerican College of Physicians.\n  Patient and professional groups alike support this legislation. The \nAmerican College of Gastroenterology worked closely in providing\n scientific and technical information. This bill also enjoys the strong \nsupport of the American Gastroenterological Association, and the \nAmerican Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. It is strongly \nsupported by consumer groups including the Crohn's and Colitis \nFoundation, the United Ostomy Association, and the other 10 patient \ncare groups which comprise the Digestive Disease National Coalition.\n\n  It is my understanding that a group of radiologists are concerned \nthat their diagnostic procedures is not named as a covered service in \nthis legislation. It is my hope that should this bill move through the \nFinance Committee and the Senate, we will work with these groups to \nresolve this issue.\n  Several of my colleagues have indicated their strong support by \nsending a letter urging other Members to support this legislation. I \nask unanimous consent that the letter of Senators Mack and Lieberman be \nincluded in the Record.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor the Cancer Screening and Prevention \nAct.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n      Colorectal Cancer Screening Should be Covered Under Medicare\n\n       Colorectal cancer screening should be added to the clinical \n     preventive services now covered under Medicare.\n       Leading scientific organizations recommend colorectal \n     cancer screening services for normal risk individuals \n     beginning at age 50. Three types of tests should be covered: \n     Annual fecal occult blood test (FOBT) for normal risk \n     patients age 50 and over; flexible sigmoidoscopy for normal \n     risk patients 50 and over, once every 3-5 years; and \n     colonoscopy exams for high risk patients.\n       Currently, Medicare coverage of preventive services is \n     limited to screening for cervical and breast cancer, \n     pneumococcal vaccines and hepatitis B vaccines. Yet, \n     colorectal cancer is the No. 2 cancer killer and is one of \n     the most preventable types of cancer and curable when \n     detected early.\n       Colorectal cancer screening services should be covered \n     because:\n       Colorectal cancer is the second deadliest cancer right \n     after lung cancer.\n       About 138,000 new cases of colorectal cancer will be \n     diagnosed and about 55,300 people will die from the disease \n     in 1995. The disease is most common in people over 50 and \n     strikes men and women in almost equal numbers. In fact, the \n     average age of colorectal cancer patients at time of \n     diagnosis is 71.\n       It is one of the most preventable types of cancer and \n     curable when detected early.\n       Most colorectal cancers develop from benign polyps. Finding \n     and removing these polyps reduces the risk of colon cancer by \n     90 percent.\n       Detection and prevention strategies are well documented and \n     highly effective.\n       Screening has long been recommended by many organizations, \n     including American Cancer Society, National Cancer Institute, \n     American College of Physicians, and the Blue Cross and Blue \n     Shield Association in their guidelines.\n       The nation's leading expert panel--the U.S. Preventive \n     Services Task Force--is releasing their report in September \n     of 1995 and it is expected to recommend screening (FOBT and \n     sigmoidoscopy). An April 1995 study done by the Office of \n     Technology Assessment shows colorectal screening to be cost-\n     effective.\n       Colorectral screening services are provided to most Federal \n     employees.\n       Every major Federal employee health care plan recognizes \n     the effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening services and \n     provides coverage for these services.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 10, 1995.\n       Dear Colleague: Even though we face many competing \n     priorities this year, we think it is critically important \n     that we make progress in addressing the No. 2 cancer killer \n     in the United States--colorectal cancer. This year, 149,000 \n     new cases of colorectal cancer will be detected and about \n     55,300 people will die from the disease, making it second \n     only to lung cancer in causing cancer deaths. It \n     predominantly strikes individuals over the age of 50, most of \n     whom are senior citizens. The average age at the time of \n     diagnosis is 71.\n       Today our colleague, Senator John Chafee, is introducing \n     the Cancer Screening and Prevention Act of 1995. This bill \n     provides Medicare coverage of preventive services which will \n     enable the detection and early treatment of colon cancer. Its \n     preventive measures track the screening recommendations of \n     the American Cancer Society (ACS), the National Cancer \n     Institute (NCI), the National Institutes on Health (NIH), the \n     American College of Gastroenterology (ACG), the American \n     Gastroenterological Association (AGA), and the American \n     Medical Association (AMA).\n       We know that early detection of colorectal cancer saves \n     lives. Colon cancer is nearly completely preventable using \n     techniques that have been available for over a decade. Recent \n     research bears this out.\n       Research published by Dr. Sidney Winawer and colleagues in \n     the New England Journal of Medicine (December 1993) found \n     that removal of precancerous polyps reduced the incidence of \n     colon cancer by 90 percent and mortality by over 95 percent. \n     This work proved conclusively that timely removal of polyps \n     will eliminate most colon cancers.\n       The way to reduce colorectal cancer is very simple--promote \n     screening. The ACS, the NCI, the ACG, and the AGA recommend \n     that individuals at age 50 be screened annually for \n     colorectal cancer by fecal occult blood tests and by flexible \n     sigmoidoscopic examination every three to five years. High \n     risk individuals should have a more thorough test--\n     colonoscopic surveillance--available every two years. \n     Colorectal cancer screening reduces cancer risk and is at \n     least as cost-effective as other preventive health care \n     services.\n       The NCI conducted a cost analysis of screening the U.S. \n     population from ages 50 to 80 that demonstrated a beneficial \n     cost-effectiveness ration relative to other preventive \n     services. Scientific evidence is well established to \n     demonstrate that screening of our elderly population for \n     colorectal cancer will save lives and is cost-effective.\n       Given the prevalence of this disease in older Americans and \n     the overwhelming evidence that screening is effective, these \n     preventive benefits should be covered under Medicare. A \n     recent analysis and estimate of the cost of this legislation, \n     prepared by Peter McMenamin, Ph.D., a former Health Care \n     Financing Administration official, projects the full cost of \n     this legislation to be $429 million over four years, which \n     means an average of $107 million annually.\n       Please join us as original cosponsors of the Cancer \n     Screening and Prevention Act of 1995. To become a cosponsor \n     or for further information, please call Doug Guerdat of \n     Senator Chafee's staff at 224-2921.\n           Sincerely,\n     Connie Mack.\n     Joseph I. Lieberman.\n Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, \nSenator John Chafee in introducing the Medicare Cancer Screening and \nPrevention Act of 1995. The legislation provides for Medicare coverage \nof preventive care specifically aimed at the early detection, \nprevention, and treatment of colorectal cancer.\n  This bill, when enacted, will close a significant gap that currently \nexists in the preventive services covered by Medicare. Under current \nlaw, Medicare does not reimburse for preventive colorectal screening \nservices. A beneficiary must have a presenting condition, such as \nbleeding, or must already have colorectal cancer before services are \nprovided through Medicare. These are very costly diseases, which \nMedicare will pay to treat. However, I believe it is in the best \ninterests of patients and the Medicare system to provide for coverage \nof tests which will identify colorectal cancer at its earliest stages. \nMedicare currently provides coverage for other preventive services such \nas mammography screening for breast cancer and flu shots. This \nlegislation will send the message to all beneficiaries that colorectal \ncancer is curable if detected early.\n  This legislation will ensure that Medicare beneficiaries will be \neligible to receive the basic colorectal cancer screening tests which \nare recommended by the American Cancer Society for all Americans over \nthe age of 50. As my colleagues will recall, these basic tests were \nused successfully to detect and successfully treat former President \nRonald Reagan's cancerous colon polyps in 1985.\n  Colorectal cancer is one of the most widely contracted forms of \ncancer, with higher incidence rates than either breast cancer or \nprostate cancer. In \n\n[[Page S 12277]]\n1995 alone, according to the American Cancer Society, more than 138,000 \nnew cases of colorectal cancer will be diagnosed. Tragically, more than \n55,000 Americans will die from the disease this year. My home State of \nFlorida has been disproportionately affected by colorectal cancer with \nthe third highest estimated number of new cases and deaths associated \nwith this form of cancer.\n  Scientific data clearly show preventive services can successfully \ncombat many cases of colorectal cancer. If colorectal cancer goes \nundetected, the 5-year survival rate is approximately 60 percent or \nless. If, however, colorectal cancer is detected at its earliest \nstages, then the 5-year survival rate increases dramatically to 87 \npercent for rectal cancer and 93 percent for colon cancer. The \nlegislation we are introducing today will not only address the early \ndetection of colorectal cancer, but it will also aid in the prevention \nof colorectal cancer in many Americans over the age of 50.\n  At a time when the Board of Trustees of Social Security and Medicare \nwarns that the Hospital Insurance, or Medicare part A, trust fund will \nbecome insolvent by the year 2002, Congress should enact laws to \nprevent hospitalization and reduce long-term health care costs. This \nlegislation will greatly enhance this effort by focusing on preventive \nservices which have been shown to be cost-effective. For example, a \nNational Cancer Institute study found the costs of screening for \ncolorectal cancer are favorable as compared to other preventive \nservices. The study also found the costs of medical treatment of \nadvanced colorectal cancer far outweigh the costs of prevention and \nearly treatment. In addition, the onset of this tragic form of cancer \nleads to lost productivity, lost income, and lost tax revenues.\n  The scientific evidence supporting the benefits of early detection \nand screening is clear. The technology to prevent colorectal cancer has \nbeen available for more than a decade. Now is the time to increase the \naccessibility of these services to the population of Americans who are \nat highest risk of contracting colorectal cancer--our senior citizens. \nThe American Cancer Society, along with physician organizations such as \nthe American College of Gastroenterology, and consumer groups such as \nthe Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America are unified in their \nstrong support and advocacy for this important legislation. Enactment \nof this bill is prudent, cost-effective, and humane.\n  My wife, our daughter, my mother, and I are each alive today because \nof the early detection of cancer. I've been told that our Nation can \nsee a 50-percent increase in cancer survival rates if only Americans \nwould follow the screening recommendations of the American Cancer \nSociety. The need is great. The cost-effectiveness of these tests is \nconclusive. I am proud to join in introducing the Medicare Cancer \nScreening and Prevention Act of 1995. I ask all of my colleagues to \njoin us in this effort.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 1179. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nreductions in required contributions to the United Mine Workers of \nAmerica Combined Benefit Fund, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n\n\n             the small noncoal producing company relief act\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today, I am introducing a bill to \nprovide relief to small, non-coal producing companies that are \nexperiencing difficulty in meeting their financial obligations under \nthe 1992 Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act. I want to see this \nbill enacted into law so a group of small companies will get the help \nneeded to preserve and pay for the health care coverage of their former \nworkers. These companies want to make sure miners' health care benefits \nare protected, just as I do. But they need some help to do it.\n  I will talk more about why I think it is so important that the Senate \nact on this legislation, but first, I think it's equally important for \neveryone to understand what brought me to this place. The context for \nthe introduction of a bill is important, and in this case, the context \nis the history of the coal fields. So, first some background before I \ndiscuss my proposal for small company relief:\n  Almost 50 years ago, the President of the United States, Harry S. \nTruman, ended a national coal strike that had forced him to seize the \nmines. That action established a unique relationship between the \nFederal government, miners and operators in the coal industry. In that \n1946 strike, health care was a central issue. And coal miners' health \ncare benefits remain central to labor relations in the coal industry \ntoday.\n  Through the years since that 1946 strike, coal miners and their \nfamilies have traded or foregone other benefits to preserve the decent \nhealth care benefits upon which they depend because illness and injury \nare so endemic to coal mining. In fact, the health program that exists \nfor current and retired miners today derives from the one established \nwhen President Truman seized the mines.\n  In the 1950's, a grand compact was reached between labor and \nmanagement in the coal industry. In return for health and pension \nsecurity, labor agreed to mechanization of the mines, which led to the \nelimination of 300,000 jobs in Appalachia alone. This leads to today's \nsituation, because it is largely the retirees of that vast industrial \nrestructuring whose health care was in jeopardy before passage of the \n1992 Coal\n Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act, now simply known as the Coal Act. \nThose coal miners created the might of modern industrial America. They \nfueled our Nation's economic progress. In 1992, when Congress passed \nthe Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act, we told those miners that \ntheir tremendous contributions and sacrifices mattered and the promises \nmade to them will be kept. We must not forsake that promise now or \never.\n\n  The urgent need for legislation to protect miners' health care \nbenefits became increasingly clear during the fall of 1989, when \nanother coal strike broke out, where health care benefits were, once \nagain, a central issue. In that year, I introduced my first bill to \nprevent collapse of the trust funds that provide health care for \nretired coal miners. The dwindling base of contributors resulting from \nbankruptcies and the failure of some companies to keep paying into the \nfunds, along with exploding health care inflation, put the health trust \nfunds in jeopardy. Then-Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole appointed a \nmediator to assist in settlement of the strike. When the settlement was \nreached, she announced appointment of a commission to recommend a long-\nterm solution to the crisis of the health trust funds. That Commission \nbecame known as the Coal Commission.\n  Secretary Dole explained that during negotiation of the settlement of \nthat strike, which involved a single company, ``it became clear to all \nparties involved that the issue of health care benefits for retirees \naffects the entire industry.''\n  ``A comprehensive, industry wide solution is desperately needed,'' \nSecretary Dole then said.\n  Secretary Dole's Coal Commission submitted its final report in \nNovember, 1990. The Commission observed that health benefits are an \nemotional subject in the coal industry, not only because coal miners \nhave been promised and guaranteed health care benefits for life, but \nalso because coal miners in their labor contracts have traded lower \npensions over the years for better health care benefits. The Commission \nsaid it firmly believes that the retired miners are entitled to the \nhealth care benefits that were promised and guaranteed them and that \nsuch commitments must be honored. To quote from that 1990 report--\n\n       Retired coal miners have legitimate expectations of health \n     care benefits for life; that was the promise they received \n     during their working lives and that is how they planned their \n     retirement years. That commitment should be honored.\n\n  The Coal Commission also considered the fairest way to ensure that \nthe health fund did not collapse. They recommended that companies that \nemployed miners, current signatories and former signatories alike, \nshare the costs of providing benefits to miners whose employers went \nout of business. And, in the words of the Dole Commission, the best way \nto finance the health benefits promised miners was the ``imposition of \na statutory obligation to contribute on current and past signatories, \nmechanisms to prevent future dumping of retiree health obligations''.\n\n[[Page S 12278]]\n\n  Collective bargaining cannot work when companies are not around to \nbargain because they are bankrupt or have walked away from their \nresponsibilities, sometimes through legal loopholes created by dozens \nof conflicting court decisions. Moreover, the orphan retirees whose \nlast employers were gone faced the prospect that when the collective-\nbargaining agreement expired in 1993, no one would have been \nresponsible for their health care. The miners' health program's \nshrinking funding base and spiraling costs made continuation of the old \nprogram unworkable. The task Congress and the administration had in \n1992 when we passed the Coal Act was to do the best we could to assign \nresponsibility for funding the health program, recognizing that there \nwas not then, nor is there now, a perfect solution.\n  And so, in 1992, Congress met its national responsibility to protect \nminers' health benefits. I was proud to author that legislation, the \nCoal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act, or the Coal Act. It was \nattached to the Energy Policy Act of 1992. I worked on that legislation \nwith an outstanding group of Members whose invaluable contributions \nwere essential to securing passage of the Act--my esteemed colleagues \nSenators Byrd and Ford, Senators Specter, Wallop, and others from the \nFinance and Energy Committees. The Coal Act would not have become law \nwithout their work and without strong bipartisan cooperation. We did \nour work and miners' benefits were saved. That makes me enormously \nproud.\n  Those miners today, on average, are 73 years old. Most worked in the \nmines for 20, 30, 40 years, or more. Every day many rode a rail car a \nmile underground, stooped in a crawlspace 4 feet high with ice cold \nwater up to their knees, and made their mines productive and their \nemployers rich. For them, the legacy of that work is black lung \ndisease, asthma, cancer, back pain, and chronic respiratory disease. \nTheir health benefits remain a matter of life and death. The Coal Act \nprotected their benefits into the future. But in the 104th Congress, \nsome want to take away the health care security of miners. I don't \nintend to let that happen.\n  But there are big mining companies still looking for a way\n   to walk from the promise made to these miners nearly 50 years ago. \nThese companies have spent millions to oppose the implementation of the \nCoal Act. So far, they have not succeeded in robbing miners of the \nhealth security the Coal Act provides.\n\n  But this year, they are at it again, seeking what amounts to nothing \nmore than a tax break for a select group of special interest companies.\n  If they succeed, the health benefits of 30,000 West Virginia miners, \nwidows, and orphans will be in jeopardy. Thousands of people like them \nin other States will face the same peril. If those people lose their \nhealth care coverage, we will have a disastrous health care crisis in \nWest Virginia, with miners and widows being forced to sell their homes \nto pay for the medication and treatment they now receive. Retirees in \nevery State will be in the same desperate straits, and the other coal \nStates where most miners have retired would all face the same health \ncare tragedy.\n  We must remember that the promise of coal miners' health is not just \nanother entitlement program. These benefits have been earned by a \nlifetime in the mines--a lifetime of deferred wages as the price paid \nfor health care coverage. Some big companies who are, or were, in the \ncoal business, and who can afford to pay for these benefits, continue \nto say they do not want to meet their responsibilities. And I am sad to \nhave to report that there are bills in both the Senate and the House \nwhich seek to amend the Coal Act and let these companies walk away from \ntheir commitment to miners.\n  Some Members of Congress are supporting a bill to let big coal \ncompanies abandon retired miners. Some would like to see such a bill \nincluded in this year's budget reconciliation bill, hiding the fate of \nmore than 92,000 retired miners and their dependents as a tiny \nprovision in a massive bill. If Congress is not careful, a cut in coal \nminers' health benefits may be snuck through in the bill needed to make \nsure the Federal Government can operate.\n  What's especially troubling is how many of these companies are using \nexaggerated claims of a huge surplus in the health fund to bolster \ntheir contention that there is sufficient money with which to give them \na tax break. The problem is the big surplus which they project is not \nsupported by the independent actuarial analysis commissioned (by the \nfund's trustees) to review the financial health of the fund. The Ernst \nand Young analysis, conducted by Guy King, a former chief actuary at \nHCFA, advises Congress to be very cautious about any changes to the Act \nwhich expend the fund's reserves. Guy King's report said that the most \nlikely scenario is there\n will be a $39 million deficit in the health funds in the year 2003. \nThe General Accounting Office told Congress on May 25, 1995, that ``it \nnow appears that annual deficits--instead of surpluses--are likely to \noccur, which would erode the current surplus over time.'' That means \nthat there's not a lot of extra money, available to help pay for this \nproposed tax break.\n\n  This tells me we have to be very, very thoughtful about doing \nanything which would destabilize the health fund--which a big tax break \nwould most certainly do.\n  While we are seeing all the efforts of the millions- and billion-\ndollar mining conglomerates who are looking to the courts and to legal \nfine print for a way out of keeping their promise to retired coal \nminers and their widows--these companies are certainly not focused on \nhow smaller businesses are affected by the Act.\n  These large companies are hoping Congress will give them a big tax \nbreak, but small businesses in financial need would not be helped under \ntheir plans to amend the Coal Act.\n  I think that's wrong. The Coal Act ensures retired miners and their \ndependents will receive the health benefits they were promised. That's \nwhat it was intended to do. And it's working.\n  But over the last year or two, as I have monitored the implementation \nof the Act, I have been hearing from and meeting with small companies \nwho are very troubled. They tell me it is difficult for a number of \nthem to do what is required under the provisions of the Coal Act. They \ntell me that they need some relief. As you know, the Coal Act requires \nsmall and large businesses to contribute to the miners' health funds on \nbehalf of their former employees. But that requirement may be more \ndoable for large companies than it is for small ones.\n  While holding small businesses legitimately responsible for the \nhealth benefits of their former workers is fair, the burden of making \nthose payments may be difficult for some. That's why I am introducing a \nbill which would amend the Coal Act to help small, non-coal producing \nbusinesses make their premium payments under the Act.\n  I think this legislation is a way we can provide some relief to small \ncompanies, who are no longer in the coal business, and yet still \nmaintain the stable financing structure of the Act.\n  It doesn't make sense to me to bankrupt a viable small company \nbecause it cannot meet its full premium obligations\n under the Act, especially if the company has an ability to make \npayments consistently over time. I want to make it easier for these \nsmall businesses, which create jobs in West Virginia, Pennsylvania, \nOhio, and across the Nation, to stay in business and make reasonable \npremium payments under the Act.\n\n  An important point to underscore: the financial condition of the fund \nis not such that forgiving the health care liability assigned any one \ngroup of companies under the Act is possible. Miners' benefits would be \nat risk. What I think we can do is limit, or cap, the liability of \nsmall, non-coal producing companies in a way which provides meaningful \nassistance. That is what my bill attempts to do. Again, it's not \nperfect, but it offers relief that could make a real difference to \nsmall companies.\n  The group of small, non-coal producing companies which I have been \nworking with committed themselves to a long process in which we sat \ndown and together figured out a way that small companies could get help \nwhile miners' benefits are protected. We struggled with the numbers, \nand we struggled with the constraints--practical, political, some \nphilosophical.\n\n[[Page S 12279]]\n\n  Keeping in mind our shared goal of protecting miners benefits and \ndoing something concrete to help small companies--something which could \nactually be signed into law--together, we negotiated the piece of \nlegislation I am introducing today.\n  This is not necessarily the only way to provide a group of small \ncompanies with targeted relief from their obligations under the Coal \nAct. Others may suggest different approaches. But I firmly believe that \nthis approach is one which can pass, and be signed into law, if we keep \nthis relief package directed at the small companies most in need of \nfinancial assistance. I am working on one or two other minor \nadjustments to the Act, one of particular interest to West Virginia, \nwhich I also hope to have ready for the Senate's consideration in the \nnear future.\n  Another word of caution: If companies with an ability to pay, but \nwith a desire to avoid their responsibilities, want to use a small \ncompany relief package as momentum for their efforts, it could be that \nwe go another year or many years without small company relief. I, for \none, do not want a bunch of big companies with the ability and \nobligation to keep promises to miners to get in the way of small \ncompany relief along the lines of what I have proposed here. I hope my \ncolleagues don't either. One thing I do know, if efforts to pile on \nsome mega-tax break or relief for companies that do not need or deserve \nit are successfully attached to this\n proposal in the legislative process, I will not be able to recommend \nto the President that he sign such a bill. I cannot support anything \nthat puts miners' health benefits at risk. I hope we can avoid that \nscenario.\n\n  The small company relief bill which I am introducing is enactable. It \nwill go a long way to helping meet the needs of the small companies \nwhich I have been working with--and they are a cross-section of small \ncompanies from all over the country. This is the product of many, many, \nmonths of negotiations. I have consulted with Rich Trumka, the \nPresident of the United Mine Workers of America [UMW] about this \npackage. He agrees that there may be a need to address the needs of \nsmall companies that truly can't afford to pay. The members of the \nBituminous Coal Operators Association [BCOA] also understand my strong \ndesire to see this type of relief enacted this year, and they know what \nis in this bill and why. With those two disparate interests in \nagreement that it is appropriate for me to pursue small company relief, \nI am confident that we can actually make this small company relief a \nreality this year.\n  All parties--the small companies, the BCOA, and the UMW--agree that \nwe cannot know today, with any precision, the exact dollar impact of \nthese provisions on the long-term financial health of the fund. As the \nfinancial impact comes into better focus, under no circumstances will \nwe move ahead with this amendment if it would cause the fund surplus to \nfall below a level that protects the benefits.\n  A sacred promise was made to coal miners, their widows and \ndependents, and Congress took historic, bipartisan action in 1992 to \nkeep that promise. These guaranteed health benefits cannot be sold off \nor traded away. But small companies can get some meaningful relief to \nhelp them meet their obligations under the 1992 Coal Act without \njeopardizing miners' health benefits through the bill I am submitting \ntoday. I urge my colleagues to carefully consider this legislation, and \nto work with me in enacting and achieving its objective.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the complete text of the \nSmall Non-Coal Producing Company Relief Act of 1995 be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                S. 1179\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Public Health Service Act \nto provide for health performance partnerships, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n THE SAMHSA REAUTHORIZATION FLEXIBILITY ENHANCEMENT AND CONSOLIDATION \n                              ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the SAMHSA \nReauthorization, Flexibility Enhancement, and Consolidation Act of \n1995. An important aim of this legislation is to increase state \nflexibility in the use of mental health and substance abuse block grant \nfunds while improving program accountability.\n  The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration \n[SAMHSA] programs address the nation's major substance abuse and mental \nillness health problems. The SAMHSA programs have greatly improved the \nquality and availability of substance abuse prevention and treatment \nand mental health services for our citizens.\n  The fields of substance abuse treatment and prevention and mental \nhealth have changed considerably since the last reauthorization in \n1992--so must our approach in addressing these major public health \nissues.\n  One important feature of the reauthorization legislation I am \nproposing is its focus on establishing new partnership block grant \narrangements with the states. The performance partnerships will utilize \nstate selected ``benchmarks'' to help us learn what works. They will \nalso facilitate the ability of state and local communities to improve \nthe health of their people. These partnership block grants are a unique \nblend of categorical and block grants.\n  I believe performance partnerships will increase state flexibility \nand streamline Federal management while they also will retain \naccountability. The performance partnerships would also lead to the \ndevelopment and enhancement of national and state data collection \nsystems and provide for justification of future funding.\n  Another major issue addressed in my proposal is that of the mentally \nill homeless. My proposal to enhance outpatient treatment for the \ngravely disabled mentally ill who are committed would ensure that these \nindividuals receive needed treatment in the least restrictive setting.\n  Concerns have been raised about my approach which I would like to \naddress. First, some believe my proposal would not allow a sufficient \ntransition time to develop meaningful partnerships between the Federal \nGovernment and the state around the implementation of performance \npartnerships.\n  Second, some believe my proposal should not retain any of the set-\nasides because this does not allow for flexibility for the states.\n  Third, others perceive the current data systems to be inadequate and \nirrelevant to measure performance on national and state-local levels.\n  To address these concerns, the legislation would:\n  First, establish a minimum 2-year transition period before \nperformance partnerships are implemented;\n  Second, provide states the option to opt-out of the current set-aside \nrequirements; and\n  Third, require states to report only on performance for which they \nhave current and relevant data systems.\n  Mr. President, I realize there are issues which others may continue \nto raise regarding the performance partnership block grants and the \ncommitment of the mentally ill homeless. The introduction of this \nproposal today should serve as the starting point for further \ndiscussions of these issues.\n  As discussion of these issues develops, I would welcome any \nsuggestions my colleagues or others may have for improving this \nlegislation. I ask unanimous consent that a summary of this bill and \nthe text of the legislation be made a part of the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                S. 1180\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

If the \n     Secretary determines, using data with respect to the intended \n     purpose of any such requirement, that the State has a \n     significant need to improve the outcomes related to the \n     intended purposes of any such requirements, the Secretary may \n     require the State to utilize an objective that addresses the \n     intended purpose of any such requirement.\n       (B) Consultation process.--Until the Secretary makes the \n     determination described in subparagraph (A), a State shall--\n       (i) comply with the requirements described in subparagraph \n     (C); or\n       (ii) select objectives to be measured that would address \n     the intended purpose of each of such requirements.\n       (C) Requirements.--The requirements described in this \n     subparagraph are the requirements contained in the following:\n       (i) Section 1922(b) (42 U.S.C. 300x-21) (as amended by this \n     Act), relating to minimum allocation of funds for services to \n     pregnant women and women with dependent children.\n       (ii) Section 1923 (42 U.S.C. 300x-23), relating to whether \n     injecting drug users have timely access to treatment upon \n     request.\n       (iii) Section 1924 (42 U.S.C. 300x-24), relating to \n     requirements related to tuberculosis and HIV.\n       (iv) Section 1926 (42 U.S.C. 300x-26), relating to \n     curtailing the sale of tobacco products to persons under the \n     age of 18.\n       (v) Section 1927 (42 U.S.C. 300x-27), relating to \n     preference in the admission of pregnant women for treatment.\n       (vi) Section 1929 (42 U.S.C. 300x-29), relating to the \n     needs assessments.\n       (d) Existing Projects.--A project that receives support for \n     fiscal year 1996, 1997, 1998, or 1999 under section 506 or \n     520A of the Public Health Service Act (as amended by section \n     108 or 109(2), respectively), and that previously received \n     support under title V of the Public Health Service Act for \n     fiscal year 1995, shall be subject to the requirements to \n     which that project was subject to for fiscal year 1995 unless \n     the Secretary of Health and Human Services determines \n     otherwise.\n       (e) Waivers.--Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     Act, or an amendment made by this Act, the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services may grant a State a waiver to \n     permit such State to operate a performance partnership \n     program prior to fiscal year 1998. Such programs shall be \n     operated under the requirements described in the amendments \n     made by sections 101 and 201 and shall be funded using \n     amounts appropriated for the fiscal year involved under part \n     B of title XIX of the Public Health Service Act.\n                                                                    ____\n\nThe SAMHSA Reauthorization, Flexibility Enhancement, and Consolidation \n                          Act of 1995--Summary\n\n\n                             mental health\n\n       1. Reauthorize the mental health block grant as a \n     Performance Partnership Block Grant (PPG). Under this \n     provision, each State and the Federal Government would work \n     in a partnership to develop goals and performance objectives \n     to improve the mental health of adults with serious mental \n     illness and children with serious emotional disturbances. \n     Each State would submit a performance partnership proposal \n     based on the State selected goals and objectives which the \n     State would be held accountable. Funding for this PPG would \n     be authorized at $280,000,000.\n       2. Establish a Transition Provision for implementing the \n     PPGs. Under this provision, States would begin the PPGs no \n     sooner than October 1, 1997. This minimum two-year transition \n     period would allow for the development of partnerships \n     between the Federal government and the states to: (1) develop \n     the menu of objectives; (2) carry out a technical analysis of \n     the availability, relevancy, and sufficiency of existing data \n     sets; and (3) develop a plan to address insufficient data \n     systems. This process would include individuals from states, \n     local governments, consumers, and others who have technical \n     expertise in this area.\n       3. Eliminate set-asides. This section would repeal the 10 \n     percent set-aside to provide services for children with \n     serious emotional disturbances.\n       4. Repeal the current (4) separate demonstration \n     authorities and establish a transition funding period for the \n     current mental health demonstration programs. This section \n     repeals separate categorical authorities for programs \n     relating to: (1) clinical training and AIDS training, (2) \n     community support programs; (3) homeless demonstrations; and \n     (4) AIDS demonstrations. Each current demonstration grant \n     would continue under the same terms and conditions until the \n     expiration of the grant period.\n       5. Establish a general authority for priority mental health \n     needs of regional and national significance. Through this \n     single demonstration authority, the SAMHSA could provide \n     technical assistance, conduct applied research, or conduct \n     demonstration projects to address compelling mental health \n     prevention and treatment needs of regional and national \n     importance. All support for a specific problem would be time-\n     limited to five years. Once successful solutions are \n     developed, the SAMHSA would work with States to incorporate \n     these solutions through the use of the State's performance \n     partnership grant.\n       Funding for this authority would be authorized at \n     $50,000,000 for each fiscal year 1996-1997 and $30,000,000 \n     for fiscal year 1998. This accounts for the repeal of the \n     ACCESS Program in fiscal year 1998. This funding level \n     represents a ten-percent reduction from the combined totals \n     of the three demonstration programs consolidated. In the \n     event of reductions in the appropriations for the \n     demonstration and training programs, the Secretary would \n     decide which existing programs to reduce or eliminate.\n       6. Establish a separate authority for the Children's Mental \n     Health Services Program. Through this single demonstration \n     authority, appropriate community services for children \n     suffering from severe mental disorders would continue as \n     provided for under current law. Funding for this authority \n     would be authorized at $60,000,000--equal to fiscal year 1995 \n     appropriations.\n     \n[[Page S 12289]]\n\n       7. Permit States to provide funding to for-profit \n     organizations in order to facilitate integration of services. \n     This provision would provide flexibility for States to \n     utilize the service of mental health managed care programs to \n     operate Medicaid managed mental health programs. This would \n     facilitate integration of mental health services within each \n     State to achieve standardization of care and cost reductions.\n       8. Permit the Secretary to reserve up to 5 percent for data \n     collection, technical assistance, and evaluations. This \n     provision would permit the Secretary to reserve up to 5 \n     percent of the amount appropriated in any fiscal year for \n     necessary data collection, technical assistance, and program \n     evaluation. Also, the Secretary could use these funds to \n     assist States with developing and strengthening their \n     capacity for data collection.\n\n\n               summary of mentally ill homeless provision\n\n       Generally, the purpose of this proposal would be to improve \n     the mental health treatment--and thus the living conditions--\n     of the mentally ill homeless who are gravely disabled as a \n     result of their illness. It would also continue to fund \n     treatment and support systems for the mentally ill homeless \n     who are not gravely disabled.\n       1. Reauthorize the current PATH provisions as a new Part I \n     of the PATH program. This will retain a focus on the \n     expansion of services for the mentally ill homeless. The \n     major problem currently facing the mentally ill homeless, \n     regardless of whether they receive outpatient commitment or \n     not, is the lack of adequate treatment capacity. Continuation \n     of the PATH program would assure that services for the \n     mentally ill homeless are either maintained or expanded. \n     Funding for this block grant would be authorized at $29 \n     million--equal to FY 1995 appropriations.\n       2. Create a second part to the PATH program for incentive \n     grants to states to improve and operate outpatient commitment \n     treatment programs for the gravely disabled mentally ill \n     homeless. The purpose of this grant would be to improve the \n     treatment capacity, which is often inadequate, for \n     individuals with severe mental illness. In addition,\n      these grants could encourage state mental health agencies to \n     work with judges to help assure the consistent enforcement \n     and appropriate use of state commitment statutes for the \n     gravely disabled mentally ill.\n       Funding for this provision would be provided from funds \n     currently used to support the ACCESS program. Because the \n     current ACCESS grantees are funded for two more years, these \n     incentive grants would become available beginning in fiscal \n     year 1998.\n       As a condition of receiving a categorical grant under this \n     program, a state would be required to have a statute \n     providing for the commitment of the gravely disabled mentally \n     ill homeless. The state would also be required to provide for \n     intensive case management monitoring and follow-up care, and \n     a hearing prior to recommitment of a gravely disabled \n     individual.\n       In addition, the grants would be made to states which \n     successfully bring, or which have the greatest chance to \n     bring, the gravely disabled mentally ill homeless into \n     treatment and which show that such individuals remain in \n     treatment. These funds would be used to provide treatment, \n     outreach, and case management services to individuals who \n     have been committed to an outpatient setting because they \n     have been determined to be gravely disabled as a result of \n     their mental illness.\n       3. Allow the new Part I PATH funds to fund supportive \n     housing for homeless mentally ill individuals who are \n     committed to or were previously committed to outpatient \n     treatment. This would help improve treatment outcomes for \n     these individuals. Supportive housing is critical to the \n     treatment of the gravely disabled mentally ill.\n       4. Permit the new Part I PATH funds to be used to educate \n     the judiciary regarding mental illness and the \n     appropriateness of outpatient commitment for the gravely \n     disabled mentally ill homeless. Many experts believe that \n     successful implementation of grave disability commitment laws \n     for the mentally ill homeless will require education of the \n     judges. This education is needed because judges are not often \n     prepared to rule on the mental status of the homeless.\n\n\n                substance abuse prevention and treatment\n\n       1. Reauthorize the substance abuse prevention and treatment \n     services block grant as a Performance Partnership Block Grant \n     (PPG). Under this provision, each State and the Federal \n     Government would work in a partnership to develop goals and \n     performance objectives. The State Needs Assessments could be \n     utilized to assist States in selection of their objectives. \n     Each State would submit a performance partnership proposal. \n     Through a negotiated process the State and the Federal \n     government would agree to objectives which would: 1) reduce \n     the incidence and prevalence of substance abuse and \n     dependence; 2) improve access to appropriate prevention and \n     treatment programs for targeted populations; 3) enhance the \n     effectiveness of substance abuse prevention and treatment \n     programs; and 4) reduce the personal and community risks for \n     substance abuse. Funding for this authority would be \n     authorized at $1,300,000,000.\n       2. Establish a Transition Provision for implementing the \n     PPGs. Under this provision, States would begin the PPGs no \n     sooner than October 1, 1997. This minimum two-year transition \n     period would allow for the development of partnerships \n     between the Federal government and the states to: 1) develop \n     the menu of objectives; 2) carry out a technical analysis of \n     the availability, relevancy, and sufficiency of existing data \n     sets; and 3) develop a plan to address insufficient data \n     systems. This process would include individuals from states, \n     local governments, consumers, and others who have technical \n     expertise in this area.\n       3. Repeal set-asides for alcohol and drugs under the block \n     grant. To allow States the flexibility to plan and implement \n     services specific to their drug and alcohol treatment and \n     prevention needs, set-asides for alcohol and drugs are \n     repealed.\n       4. Establish a ``mandatory exemption'' provision as a \n     transition to eliminating the set-asides in the PPGs. Under \n     this provision, States would be required either to follow \n     current law for set-asides or to select an objective which \n     meets the intent of the set-aside. This process would remain \n     in place until the menu of objectives and the data sets have \n     been developed and are relevant, sufficient, and readily \n     available to measure outcomes in each state. Then, using \n     outcome data, the Secretary may require a state to select an \n     objective which meets the intent of the set-aside if the \n     Secretary determines that the State has a significant problem \n     in an area previously addressed by the set-aside.\n       5. Maintain requirements that States spend certain amounts \n     for primary prevention and for programs providing treatment \n     services to pregnant women and women with dependent children \n     under the block grant. The reauthorization bill will continue \n     to provide a 20 percent set-aside for primary prevention \n     activities and the development of effective substance abuse \n     prevention strategies, programs, and systems to reduce drug \n     and alcohol use and abuse.\n       6. Increase the minimum threshold from 10 per 100,000 cases \n     of AIDS to 15 per 100,000 for a State to be required to carry \n     out HIV Early Intervention services and repeal the provision \n     of treatment requirement for tuberculosis under the block \n     grant. The higher AIDS case rate threshold requirement for \n     the provision of HIV Early Intervention services would \n     allocate resources to States with the greatest need in \n     addressing co-morbid conditions of substance abusers. Also, \n     the higher threshold rate will moderately reflect \n     proportionately the change in the increase number of AIDS \n     cases since the CDC AIDS surveillance case definition was \n     changed (in 1993). Requirement for HIV Early Intervention \n     Services would remain as in current law. Requirements for TB \n     have been streamlined to include only counseling and testing/\n     screening.\n       7. Repeal the current (7) demonstration authorities and \n     establish a transition funding period for the current \n     substance abuse and prevention demonstration programs. This \n     section would repeal separate categorical authorities for \n     programs relating to: 1) residential treatment programs for \n     pregnant women, 2) demonstration projects of national \n     significance, 3) substance abuse treatment in State and local \n     criminal justice systems, 4) training in the provision of \n     treatment services, 5) community prevention programs, 6) \n     clinical training of substance abuse prevention \n     professionals; and 7) high risk youth and national capital \n     area demonstrations. Also, this provision provides for a \n     transition funding period of these programs. Each current \n     demonstration grant would continue under the same terms and \n     conditions until the expiration of the grant period.\n       8. Establish a general authority for priority substance \n     abuse prevention and treatment needs of regional and national \n     significance. Through this single demonstration authority, \n     the SAMHSA could provide technical assistance, conduct \n     applied research, or conduct demonstration projects to \n     address compelling substance abuse prevention and treatment \n     needs of regional and national importance. Substance abuse \n     health needs would include prevention activities as a \n     priority. All support for a specific problem would be time-\n     limited to five years. Once successful solutions are \n     developed, the SAMHSA would work with States to incorporate \n     these solutions through the use of the State's performance \n     partnership grant.\n       Funding for this authority would be authorized at \n     $352,000,000. This funding level represents a ten-percent \n     reduction from the combined total of the 14 demonstration \n     programs consolidated in this authority. In the event of \n     reductions in the appropriations for the demonstration and \n     training programs, the Secretary would decide which existing \n     programs to reduce or eliminate.\n       9. Maintain the state based loan funds used to establish \n     group homes for recovering substance abusers only for States \n     that have utilized such funds. To allow for greater \n     flexibility to the States, this provision would apply only to \n     States that have current obligations under the revolving loan \n     fund. States which are not currently providing from their \n     loan funds would be exempt from maintaining such loan funds. \n     States would use funds established under this provision to \n     provide other substance abuse treatment services. The \n     requirement for such funds to be maintained in any State \n     would be repealed on September 30, 1998.\n       10. Permit States to provide funding to for-profit \n     organizations in order to facilitate integration of services. \n     This provision would provide flexibility for States to \n     utilize the \n\n[[Page S 12290]]\n     services of substance abuse treatment managed care programs to operate \n     Medicaid managed substance abuse treatment programs. The \n     provision would facilitate integration of substance abuse \n     treatment services within each State to achieve \n     standardization of care and cost reductions. However, for-\n     profit organizations would have to agree to fulfill certain \n     requirements in order to qualify for funds under this Act.\n       11. Permit the Secretary to reserve up to 5 percent of \n     funding for data collection, technical assistance and \n     evaluations. This provision would permit the Secretary to \n     reserve up to 5 percent of the amount appropriated in any \n     fiscal year for necessary data collection, technical \n     assistance and program evaluation. Also, the Secretary could \n     use these funds to assist states with developing and \n     strengthening their capacity for data collection.\n\n\n  GENERAL PROVISIONS, PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY, AND INSTITUTES OF THE \n                     NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH\n\n       1. Require States to report on performance. This provision \n     would require each State to submit an annual report and to \n     include data concerning its performance in relation to the \n     core set of partnership objectives, including the State's \n     objectives and performance targets.\n       2. Require State Review. This provision would replace \n     current peer review requirements but establishes reviews by \n     States in accordance with their existing accreditation and \n     certification standards.\n       3. Require on site performance reviews. This provision \n     would replace current requirements for annual investigations \n     by the Secretary in at least 10 States with a new requirement \n     for on site performance reviews in each State every two to \n     three years.\n       4. Provide an additional year for obligation by State. This \n     provision would allow States an additional year in which to \n     obligate grant funds.\n       5. Repeal of Addict Referral Provisions. This section would \n     repeal authority for Federal judges to refer drug addicts in \n     the criminal justice system to the Surgeon General of the \n     Public Health Service for treatment in lieu of prosecution \n     for a criminal offense.\n       6. Reauthorize Protection and Advocacy for Mentally Ill \n     Individuals. This reauthorization would reauthorize this \n     program for three years and amends the name of the act to \n     ``Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental \n     Illnesses Act of 1986.''\n       7. Reauthorize the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and \n     Alcoholism (NIAA), National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) \n     and the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). This \n     provision reauthorizes each of the Institutes and programs \n     for only one year in order to correspond with the \n     reauthorization of the entire NIH next year.\n     \n\n

Res. 162\n\n       Whereas the media are a powerful force within our system of \n     government;\n       Whereas the media have unequaled influence over the \n     dissemination of information to the American people;\n       Whereas public trust of the media is essential to the \n     health and proper functioning of our republican form of \n     government;\n       Whereas the media have no industrywide ethical standards \n     regarding the acceptance of earned outside income;\n       Whereas members of the media could appear to compromise \n     their objectivity by receiving compensation from the same \n     groups they cover; and\n       Whereas it is in the best interests of the American people \n     and the media that any appearance of a conflict of interest \n     regarding a member of the media's receipt of outside earned \n     income be removed: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That (a) not later than May 15 of each year, each \n     accredited member of any of the Senate press galleries who \n     was an accredited member in the preceding year shall file a \n     report for the preceding year with the Secretary of the \n     Senate disclosing the identity of--\n       (1) the primary employer of the member during the preceding \n     year; and\n       (2) the identity of any additional sources of earned \n     outside income received by the member, together with the \n     amounts received from each such source, during the preceding \n     year.\n       (b) For purposes of this resolution\n       (1) the term ``Senate press galleries'' means--\n       (A) the Senate Press Gallery;\n       (B) the Senate Radio and Television Correspondents Gallery;\n       (C) the Senate Periodical Press Gallery; and\n       (D) the Senate Press Photographers Gallery; and\n       (2) the term ``earned outside income'' means any earned \n     income received from sources other than a member's primary \n     employer but does not include interest or dividends received \n     on stocks, bonds, savings accounts, or other forms of passive \n     investment or income from inheritances or rental activities.\n       (c) A report filed pursuant to this resolution shall be \n     filed with the Secretary of the Senate and available for \n     public inspection as provided in section 103 of the Ethics in \n     Government Act of 1978 for financial reports filed by Members \n     and employees of the Senate.\n       (d) An accredited member of any of the Senate press \n     galleries who fails to file a report as required by this \n     resolution shall be subject to the loss of the member's \n     accreditation or such other penalties as the member's Senate \n     press gallery deems appropriate.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on July 20, 1995, this body adopted an \namendment I proposed which expressed support for public disclosure of \ncertain types of earned income by members of the press in order for \nthem to receive accreditation in the Senate press galleries. By a vote \nof 60-39, the Senate voiced its concern over the public perception of a \npress corps that largely lacks any ethical standards to guide its \nmembers. Today I am offering a resolution that, if adopted, will \nrequire such disclosure from the press.\n  I know that this is a controversial and somewhat delicate matter. I \nam aware of the concerns that the fourth estate has with requiring its \nmembers to reveal such information. Some members of the media will \ncertainly object to any outside attempt to encourage even a limited \ncode of ethical standards. I believe that those objections are \nmisguided.\n  This resolution is not intended to be a punitive or vindictive \nexercise designed to punish, inconvenience or embarrass reporters. When \npoll after poll records alarming losses of public faith in our \ntraditional institutions, I simply believe that responsible efforts \nmust be made to address that erosion of public trust.\n  The general perception is that the politicians are corrupt, that \njudges cannot be entirely trusted, and that the media are biased and \nunscrupulous. I believe that it is time to take serious steps to \nrestore public credibility in these institutions.\n  The Senate took one such step in 1991 when it adopted legislation \nwhich I sponsored to prohibit its members from receiving honoraria. I \nbelieve that action has proved to be meritorious and constructive.\n  More recently, I offered a sense-of-the-Senate amendment calling on \n\n[[Page S 12292]]\n  members of the Judiciary to take another look at their rather lax \nregulations governing gifts and travel. The amendment passed by a vote \nof 75 to 23. Again, my intent was to help restore confidence and some \nmeasure of accountability to governmental officials and institutions.\n  Although not a formal governmental institution, the importance of the \nmedia in a representative democracy cannot be overstated. The role of \nthe press as interpreter and sole purveyor of the news conveys with it \na solemn duty to the public it serves. No single elected official or \ngroup of officials can so profoundly affect the focus and tone of the \nvital daily information which the public digests, believes, and relies \nupon. The press have an awesome responsibility in our form of \ngovernment--one that far outweighs any slight inconvenience like filing \na list of one's speaking fees. Regrettably, the activities of some--not \nall, some--members of the press have called into question the ability \nof the media to be consistently fair and unbiased. As with every \ninstitution, most journalists do a good job, providing balanced \ninformation that fosters an informed populace. Unfortunately, the \nperception remains that some reporters' stories are slanted in a \nparticular way or skewed toward a specific interest. It is these \nperceptions that have to be addressed. My hope, all along, has been \nthat journalists would recognize the need to address this problem \nthemselves. They should do that. That is the way it should be done. As \nof now, I see little evidence that this will happen.\n  So today, I am submitting this measure in an effort to jump start the \nprocess and begin the frank public discourse which will be necessary in \norder to meet the justifiable expectations of the American people, whom \nwe all serve. The Senate Rules Committee has jurisdiction over this \narea. I have spoken with its chairman, Senator Stevens, some time ago \nand he is willing to hold hearings on the bill. These hearings will \nprovide an excellent opportunity for all interested parties to come \ntogether and offer their varying perspectives and viewpoints. I look \nforward to a thorough airing of the views of any and all participants \nwho wish to come.\n  This country is at a critical cross-roads. The American people's \ntrust of government has been replaced with a cynicism that is deeply \ndisturbing. If the public continues to lose faith in the traditional \ninstitutions which form the bedrock of our republic, before long the \nvery institutions themselves will start crumbling. To avoid such a \ncalamity, we all must work together to try and rebuild confidence in \nour basic institutions. I firmly believe that this critical need \noutweighs any one individual's particular concerns and transcends what \nmay be viewed as certain personal prerogatives. All of us involved in \nthis process have a responsibility to make it work. Often a small \nsacrifice--a good-faith gesture can do wonders toward restoring \ncredibility. The Senate, as it did in 1991, when it adopted my \namendment banning honoraria--some Senators did not like that, and we \nalso banned honoraria to our staffs--has led the way and set an \nexample.

Therefore, the Senate strongly \n     desires to be informed on the progress of each theater \n     missile defense acquisition program and its integration into \n     a system that will effectively defend our forward deployed \n     and expeditionary forces, friends and allies.\n       ``(b) Testing of Theater Missile Defense Interceptors.--(1) \n     The Secretary of Defense may not approve a theater missile \n     defense interceptor program proceeding beyond the low-rate \n     initial production acquisition stage until the Secretary \n     certifies to the Congressional defense committees that such \n     program has successfully completed initial operational test \n     and evaluation, and is found to be a suitable and effective \n     system.\n       ``(2) In order to be certified under paragraph (b) as \n     having been successfully completed, the initial operational \n     test and evaluation conducted with respect to an interceptors \n     program must have included flight tests--\n       ``(A) that were conducted with multiple interceptors and \n     multiple targets in the presence of realistic \n     countermeasures; and\n       ``(B) the results of which demonstrate the achievement by \n     the interceptors of the baseline performance thresholds.\n       ``(3) For purposes of this subsection, the baseline \n     performance thresholds with respect to a program are the \n     weapons systems performance thresholds specified in the \n     baseline description for the system established (pursuant to \n     section 2435(a)(1) if title 10, United States Code) before \n     the program entered the engineering and manufacturing \n     development stage.\n       ``(4) The number of flight tests described in paragraph (2) \n     that are required in order to make the certification under \n     paragraph (1) shall be a number determined by the Director, \n     Operational Test and Evaluation to be sufficient for the \n     purposes of this section.\n\n[[Page S 12297]]\n\n       ``(5) The Secretary may augment flight testing to \n     demonstrate weapons system performance goals for purposes of \n     the certification under paragraph (1) through the use of \n     modeling and simulation that is validated by ground and \n     flight testing.\n       ``(6) The Director, Operational Test and Evaluation and \n     Ballistic Missile Defense Organization shall include in their \n     annual reports to Congress plans to adequately test theater \n     missile defense interceptor programs throughout the \n     acquisition process.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``NATO Participation Act \n     Amendments of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. ____02. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n     (NATO) has played an essential role in guaranteeing the \n     security, freedom, and prosperity of the United States and \n     its partners in the Alliance.\n       (2) NATO has expanded its membership on three different \n     occasions since 1949.\n       (3) The sustained commitment of the member countries of \n     NATO to mutual defense of their security ultimately made \n     possible the democratic transformation in Central and Eastern \n     Europe and the demise of the Soviet Union.\n       (4) NATO was designed to be and remains a defensive \n     military organization whose members have never contemplated \n     the use of, or used, military force to expand the borders of \n     its member states.\n       (5) While the immediate threat to the security of the \n     United States and its allies has been reduced with the \n     collapse of the Iron Curtain, new security threats, such as \n     the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, are emerging to the \n     shared interests of the member countries of NATO.\n       (6) NATO remains the only multilateral security \n     organization capable of conducting effective military \n     operations to protect Western security interests.\n       (7) NATO has played a positive role in defusing tensions \n     between NATO members and, as a result, no military action has \n     occurred between two NATO member states since the inception \n     of NATO in 1949.\n       (8) NATO is also an important diplomatic forum for the \n     discussion of issues of concern to its member states and for \n     the peaceful resolution of disputes.\n       (9) America's security, freedom, and prosperity remain \n     linked to the security of the countries of Europe.\n       (10) Any threat to the security of the newly emerging \n     democracies in Central Europe would pose a security threat to \n     the United States and its European allies.\n       (11) The admission to NATO of Central and East European \n     countries that have been freed from Communist domination and \n     that meet specific criteria for NATO membership would \n     contribute to international peace and enhance the security of \n     the region.\n       (12) A number of countries have expressed varying degrees \n     of interest in NATO membership, and have taken concrete steps \n     to demonstrate this commitment.\n       (13) Full integration of Central and East European \n     countries into the North Atlantic Alliance after such \n     countries meet essential criteria for admission would enhance \n     the security of the Alliance and, thereby, contribute to the \n     security of the United States.\n       (14) The expansion of NATO can create the stable \n     environment needed to successfully complete the political and \n     economic transformation envisioned by Eastern and Central \n     European countries.\n       (15) In recognition that not all countries which have \n     requested membership in NATO will necessarily qualify at the \n     same pace, the date for membership of each country will vary.\n       (16) The provision of NATO transition assistance should \n     include those countries most ready for closer ties with NATO, \n     such as Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia and \n     should be designed to assist other countries meeting \n     specified criteria of eligibility to move toward eventual \n     NATO membership, including Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, \n     Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria, and Slovenia.\n       (17) Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia have made significant \n     progress in preparing for NATO membership and should be given \n     every consideration for inclusion in programs for NATO \n     transition assistance.\n\n     SEC. ____03. UNITED STATES POLICY.\n\n       It should be the policy of the United States--\n       (1) to join with the NATO allies of the United States to \n     redefine the role of the NATO Alliance in the post-Cold War \n     world;\n       (2) to actively assist European countries emerging from \n     communist domination in their transition so that such \n     countries may eventually qualify for NATO membership;\n       (3) to use the voice and vote of the United States to urge \n     observer status in the North Atlantic Council for countries \n     designated under section 203(d) of the NATO Participation Act \n     of 1994 (as amended by this title) as eligible for NATO \n     transition assistance; and\n       (4) to work to define the political and security \n     relationship between an enlarged NATO and the Russian \n     Federation.\n\n     SEC. ____04. REVISIONS TO PROGRAM TO FACILITATE TRANSITION TO \n                   NATO MEMBERSHIP.\n\n       (a) Establishment of Program.--Subsection (a) of section \n     203 of the NATO Participation Act of 1994 (title II of Public \n     Law 103-447; 22 U.S.C. 1928 note) is amended to read as \n     follows:\n       ``(a) Establishment of Program.--The President shall \n     establish a program to assist countries designated under \n     subsection (d) in the transition to full NATO membership.''.\n       (b) Eligible Countries.--\n       (1) Eligibility.--Subsection (d) of section 203 of such Act \n     is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(d) Designation of Eligible Countries.--\n       ``(1) Specific countries.--The following countries are \n     hereby designated for purposes of this title: Poland, \n     Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia.\n       ``(2) Other european countries emerging from communist \n     domination.--In addition to the countries designated in \n     paragraph (1), the President may designate other European \n     countries emerging from Communist domination to receive \n     assistance under the program established under subsection \n     (a).

Mr. President, I call my colleagues' attention \nto an important addition to the debate concerning preferential policies \nin America. Former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack Kemp \nrecently published in the Washington Post an article that I believe \ngoes to the heart of our troubles with affirmative action. Mr. Kemp \nfirst notes that affirmative action based on racial quotas and racial \npreferences is ``wrong in principle and ruinous in practice.'' He goes \non to issue a call for policymakers to come forward with truly positive \nproposals--affirmative efforts--to replace it. Mr. Kemp has spent his \npublic career valiantly fighting for an opportunity society. In this \narticle, he continues that fight, arguing for school vouchers, tax and \nregulatory reforms, and other programs aimed at giving every American \nthe chance to work for a decent education and a decent job in our free \nmarket economy.\n  Mr. President, I commend Secretary Kemp's article to all our \ncolleagues. In conjunction with Senator Lieberman, I will be presenting \nlegislation in a few weeks aimed at furthering the cause of equal \nopportunity. By reducing taxes and regulations, particularly in \ndistressed areas denoted enterprise zones, this bill will encourage \neconomic opportunity. By providing for school choice in these same \nareas it will promote educational opportunities. In sum, it is an \nattempt to make the opportunity society a reality, particularly for \nAmerica's inner cities and other distressed areas.\n  I request that the following be entered into the Record:\n                [From the Washington Post, Aug. 6, 1995]\n\n         Affirmative Action: The ``Radical Republican'' Example\n\n                             (By Jack Kemp)\n\n       The scene is Washington: a Republican President, new to the \n     White House, defiantly throwing down the gauntlet to a \n     Republican Congress, saying he will veto any bill that \n     proposes to do more for ``black Americans'' than for \n     ``whites.'' This is not some fast-forward vision of 1997 and \n     the first days of a new Republican White House. It's a \n     flashback to 1866. The agency to be vetoed was the Freedman's \n     Bureau, established in President Lincoln's administration to \n     ``affirmatively'' assist the recently emancipated African \n     Americans. The president--Andrew Johnson, Lincoln's \n     successor--worried that any ``affirmative action'' would hurt \n     the white population by specifically helping ``Negroes.''\n       I offer this page from history not to prove once again that \n     politically, there is not much new under the sun but to \n     illustrate that the issues of race and equality are woven \n     into the essence of our American experience. While our \n     present-day passions on the subject of affirmative action \n     open old wounds, they also summon us to moral leadership of \n     Lincolnesque proportions.\n       Thus far the summons goes unanswered by both liberals and \n     conservatives alike. The \n\n[[Page S 12307]]\n     unreconstructed liberal notion of endless racial reparations and race-\n     based preferences is doubly guilty: wrong in principle and \n     ruinous in practice. President Clinton's much-vaunted \n     affirmative action review produced more of a bumper sticker \n     than a policy; Clinton's focus-group-fashioned ``mend it, not \n     end it'' slogan makes a far better rhyme than reason.\n       The same, however, is true of the new affirmative action \n     ``abolitionist'' position, which heralds equality but seldom \n     addresses the way to truly give all people an equal footing. \n     Critics are right in asserting that ``affirmative action'' \n     quotas have contributed to the poisoning of race relations in \n     this country. But critics must offer much more than just \n     opposition and reproach. We know what they are against, but \n     what are they for?\n       ``A colorblind society,'' comes their response. Of course, \n     the goal of equal opportunity is paramount and a worthy \n     destiny to seek. But to say that we have arrived at that goal \n     is simply not true. My friends on the right call for a \n     colorblind society and then quote Martin Luther King's \n     inspirational ``I have a dream'' speech, in which he imagined \n     a nation in which every American would be judged not on the \n     color of his or her skin but on the ``content of his \n     character.'' All too often, though, they neglect to quote the \n     end of his speech, where he describes the painful plight of \n     minority America: ``The Negro,'' King said, ``lives on a \n     lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of \n     material prosperity.''\n       Much has changed in the 30 years since King stood on the \n     steps of the Lincoln Memorial. Minority enterprises have \n     begun to gain a foothold, although there are far too few of \n     them. But can anyone venture to the crumbling brick and \n     mortar of Cabrini Green Public Housing, or the fear-ridden \n     projects of Bed-Stuy or the streets lined with the unemployed \n     in South Central LA or East St. Louis and believe that what \n     he sees there today would pass as progress since Dr. King's \n     day?\n       This is not to negate the gains made by so many in the \n     black and minority communities. But for large numbers the \n     situation has not only not improved in 30 years, it has grown \n     dramatically worse--with a welfare system that entraps rather \n     than empowers, punishes work and marriage and prevents access \n     to capital, credit and property.\n       Reality requires that we admit two things--difficult \n     admissions for both liberals and conservatives. First, that a \n     race conscious policy of quotas and rigid preferences has \n     helped make matters worse. Second, and more important, the \n     Good Shepherd reminds all of us that our work is not done, \n     and as we think about moving into the 21st century, we must \n     not leave anyone behind.\n       Sound policy begins with strong principles. Affirmative \n     action based on quotas is wrong--wrong because it is \n     antithetical to the genius of the American idea: individual \n     liberty. Counting by race in order to remedy past wrongs or \n     rewarding special groups by taking from others perpetuates \n     and even deepens the divisions between us. But race-based \n     politics is even more wrong and must be repudiated by men and \n     women of civility and compassion.\n       Instead, like the ``radical Republicans'' of Lincoln's day, \n     who overrode President Johnson's veto on the Freedman's \n     Bureau, we would honor the past by creating a future more in \n     keeping with our revolutionary founding ideals of equality. \n     In this way, the eventual ending of affirmative action is \n     only a beginning--the political predicate of a new promise of \n     outreach in the name of greater opportunity for access to \n     capital, credit, prosperity, jobs and educational choice for \n     all.\n       The time has definitely come for a new approach an \n     ``affirmative action'' based not just on gender or race or \n     ethnicity but ultimately based on need. ``Affirmative'' \n     because government authority must be employed to remove the \n     obstacles to upward mobility and human advancement. \n     ``Action'' because democratic societies must act positively \n     and create real equality of opportunity--without promising \n     equality of reward.\n       Affirmative opportunity in America begins with education, \n     America's schools, particularly our urban public schools, are \n     depriving minority and low-income children of the education \n     that may be their passport out of poverty. Even the poorest \n     parent must have the option more affluent families enjoy; the \n     right to send their children to the school of their choice. \n     Affirmative effort means ending the educational monopoly that \n     makes poor public school students into pawns of the \n     educational bureaucracy. And we should be paving the way to a \n     voucher and magnet school system of public and private school \n     choice.\n       Opportunity means an entryway into the job market. That \n     mean removing barriers for job creation and entrepreneurship \n     and expanding access to capital and credit. According to the \n     Wall Street Journal, from 1982 to 1987, the number of black-\n     owned firms increased by nearly 38 percent, about triple the \n     overall business growth rate during that period. Hispanic-\n     owned businesses soared by 57 percent, and their sales nearly \n     tripled.\n       Even so, of the 14 million small businesses in existence \n     across the United States today, fewer than 2 percent are \n     black-owned. And of $27 to $28 trillion of capital in this \n     country, less than one percent is in black ownership. \n     Affirmative effort would take aim at expanding capital and \n     credit as the lifeblood of business formation and job \n     creation--including an aggressive effort to end the red-\n     lining of our inner cities and a radical redesign of our tax \n     code to remove barriers to broader ownership of capital, \n     savings and credit.\n       Opportunity means the ability to accumulate property. \n     Affirmative effort would mean an end to every federal program \n     that penalizes the poor for managing to save and accumulate \n     their own assets. An AFDC mother's thrift and foresight in \n     putting money away for a child's future should not be \n     penalized by the government welfare system as fraud as is \n     currently the case.\n       Finally, real opportunity for racial and ethnic \n     reconciliation requires an expanding economy--one that \n     invites the effort and enterprise of all Americans, including \n     minorities and women. A real pro-growth policy must include \n     policies ranging from enterprise zones in our cities to a \n     commitment to lowering barriers to global trade. It should \n     also offer relief from red tape and regulation and freedom \n     from punitive tax policies. Each is part of an affirmative \n     action that can ``move America forward without leaving anyone \n     behind.''\n       Now that we have opened a somewhat hysterical dialogue on \n     affirmative action, we can never go back--only forward. Our \n     challenge is to put aside the past--abandon the endless round \n     of recrimination and a politics that feeds on division, \n     exclusion, anger and envy. We must reaffirm, as Lincoln did \n     at his moment of maximum crisis, a vision of the ``better \n     angels of our nature,'' a big-hearted view of the nation we \n     were always meant to become and must become if we are to \n     enter the 21st century as the model of liberal democracy and \n     market-oriented capitalism the world needs to see.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/10/senate-section/article/S12306-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12307]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n            MARYLAND ATHLETES VICTORIOUS AT OLYMPIC FESTIVAL\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI.

Mr. President: I rise today to salute a true \nRenaissance man, a great light in both national and West Virginia \nhistory: former Congressman Ken Hechler. Having recently celebrated the \n50th anniversary of the World War II crossing of the Ludendorff Bridge \nat Remagen, Germany, it is fitting now to honor this combat historian \nand decorated officer who enshrined his memories of the victory in our \nhearts forever. However, heroism was not only his to behold and \nchronicle. Winning five battle stars and a Bronze Star in the European \ntheater of the war, Ken Hechler is a hero of the West Virginia people.\n  A dedicated servant of the United States in time of war and peace, he \nleft both a Princeton teaching career and his talented pen to serve \nunder Presidents Roosevelt and Truman as researcher and speechwriter, \nthen joined the Stevenson campaign. Serving in Congress from 1959 to \n1977, Congressman Hechler was, in a short time, heralded for his \nintegrity and noted by many as one of the most effective and insightful \nMembers in the House. It should be noted that, although born in New \nYork, in adopting West Virginia as his new native State, he \ndemonstrated that he was very wise as well.\n  Ken Hechler gave voice to the voiceless among his West Virginia \nconstituents. Fighting tirelessly for the rights of impoverished miners \nin the Appalachian coal fields, he decried the terrible conditions in \nthe mines, calling them criminal. He struggled for mine safety \nlegislation, unwilling to appease others unwilling to work toward \nchange. After the Farmington and other mine disasters, arising from the \ntears of miners' widows, he helped enact the Mine Safety and Health Act \nof 1969.\n  His criticism of the mining conditions did not end there, however, as \nhe became a strong advocate of environmental protection, railing \nagainst rampant pollution in West Virginia and strengthening \nlegislation to improve air quality in the Nation. He crusaded against \nstrip mining, helped protect wilderness areas, and in perhaps his \ngreatest achievement, saved West Virginia's New River, the oldest river \nin North America, from a proposed dam project.\n  With a profound sense of history, love of honor, and independence of \nthought, Congressman Hechler throughout his career inspired many with \nhis character and endeavors. After leaving Congress, he resumed \nteaching at Marshall University, served twice as a delegate to the \nDemocratic National Convention, and began to write again. In 1984, he \nwas elected secretary of state of West Virginia, a position he still \nholds today.\n  It is not often that we have the opportunity to laud such a great \npublic figure as Ken Hechler. A consummate politician, he has been a \nconsummate citizen as well. West Virginia is grateful to Dr. Hechler: \nhe has kept hope in the hearts of the downtrodden and toiled for \nelection reform for the public interest. The needs, financial and \nemotional, of his electorate were foremost in his social conscience. A \ntrue maverick, his life of selfless service is legend.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record:)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/10/senate-section/article/S12308-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12308-S12309]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ISSUANCE OF THE ALICE PAUL STAMP\n\n Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the \ntremendous achievements of Alice Paul, a New Jerseyan, suffragist and \ndedicated believer in social justice. On August 18, 1995 the Alice Paul \nCentennial Foundation and the U.S. Postal Service will join together to \ncelebrate a First Day of Issue Ceremony dedicating a new postal stamp \nthat features Alice Paul.\n  Alice Stokes Paul, born in Mount Laurel, NJ in 1885, gave birth to \nthe woman's rights movement, facilitating some of the most important \npolitical and legal achievements made by women in the 20th century. The \ndate of August 26, 1995 marks the 75th anniversary of the passage of \nthe 19th amendment, which granted women the right to vote. Accordingly, \nI am extremely pleased that it is at this time that the U.S. Postal \nService has selected Alice Paul for their 78 cent stamp. Alice Paul's \ncontributions to women's suffrage made possible the increased \nadvancement and recognition of women in our society and throughout the \nworld.\n  After graduating from Swarthmore College in 1905 as a social worker, \nAlice Paul studied in England for a doctoral degree in economics. It \nwas there that she became involved in the British women's suffrage \nmovement led by the Parkhursts. Those 3 years in England showed Alice \nthat women would have to adopt revolutionary methods that would take \nthe vote, not wait passively for it to be given.\n  Upon her return to America, Alice Paul reenergized the battle to win \nthe right to vote for American women. In 1916, she founded the National \nWoman's Party, which worked to gain suffrage at the Federal level \nthrough a constitutional amendment. Proving to be an extraordinary \norganizer, fund-raiser, and politician, Alice Paul allowed nothing into \nher life that did not have a direct bearing on suffrage. In her later \nyears, Alice often reminisced that she lived in a cold room so that she \nwouldn't be tempted to read novels late at night.\n  Alice Paul fostered an incredible solidarity in those around her. She \norganized massive demonstrations, picketing rallies, conventions, and \nhunger strikes that raised the profile of the suffragist movement, \nrevitalized other women's rights groups and awakened the consciousness \nof the entire Nation to the women's suffrage issue.\n  Once the vote was won, when most suffragists believed that their work \nhad ended, Alice Paul was just beginning her crusade. In 1923, 3 years \nafter suffrage was granted, she authored the equal rights amendment, \nstipulating that neither the Federal Government nor States could \nabridge any rights on the basis of sex. From the date of its inception \nto its final passage by Congress for State ratification in 1972, Alice \nPaul kept the issue of the ERA alive before the Congress and State \nlegislators for 54 years.\n  In addition to her efforts on behalf of the right to vote and the \nequal rights amendment, Alice Paul successfully campaigned to make the \nnondiscrimination clause based on sex part of the 1964 Civil Rights \nAct. This clause granted women Federal protection for the first time in \nthe realm of equal job protection and pay in the workplace. \nFurthermore, she worked to include equal rights clauses in the United \nNations Charter and the United Nation's Declaration of Human Rights.\n  In 1977, Alice Paul died in Moorestown, NJ, leaving behind a legacy \nof dedication to women's rights and social justice. To the very end, \nshe worked with the fervent desire to see the equal rights amendment \nbecome Federal law. Even at the age of 88, she was directing the \nstruggle for the passage of the ERA in the Maine Legislature--from the \ntelephone of a nursing home. Her life exemplified what she once said in \nresponse to a question about her unwavering steadiness in the cause of \nwomen's rights: ``Well, I always thought once you put your hand on the \nplough you don't remove it until you get to the end of the row.''\n  In the case of Alice Paul, this simple resolve left a legacy that has \nforever \n\n[[Page S 12309]]\nchanged the lives of men and women throughout the world.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/10/senate-section/article/S12308-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12309]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n   THE DEATH OF A WORLD WAR II HERO, CAPT. CHARLES ASHLEY AUSTIN, JR.\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before Congress adjourns for recess, \nI ask my colleagues to join me in honoring a young World War II \nAmerican pilot--Capt. Charles Ashley ``C.A.'' Austin, Jr.--whose final \nacts of courage and sacrifice, while legendary in a little village in \nFrance, are largely unknown to most Americans. In her quest to reveal \nher fallen husband's heroism, Etta Rizzo Austin Lepore, who lives in \nConnecticut, has sought from the Army the posthumous bestowal of the \nfull range of military honors on Captain Austin.\n  A choice of incredible valor ended the life of Capt. C.A. Austin. \nJr., 50 years ago. On July 4, 1944, following a successful tactical \nbombing mission of German-occupied France, Captain Austin's P-47 \nThunderbolt airplane was shot down by enemy fire. His disabled aircraft \ncareened directly toward the French village of Limetz-Villet--to the \nhorror of the villagers watching from the ground. Miraculously, it \nveered off its course of destruction and crashed in a nearby cornfield. \nCaptain Austin was killed in the crash. The villagers of Limetz were \nconvinced that Captain Austin could have bailed out and saved himself. \nBut Austin chose to stay with the plane and, by maneuvering it from its \nburning trajectory, save the lives of the helpless people of Limetz. \nThose who witnessed Captain Austin's final moments have never forgotten \nthe young man who traded his own life for the lives of their families \nand neighbors. In fact, the people of Limetz-Villet defied their Nazi \noccupiers when they buried Austin with full honors.\n  Because Captain Austin's plane had been separated from the squadron \nhe commanded when it was hit by German antiaircraft fire, the returning \npilots in his squadron did not know their captain's fate. He was \nreported missing in action. There were no official recommendations for \nCaptain Austin to be awarded the highest military honors, namely, the \nMedal of Honor, the Distinguished Flying Cross, or the Bronze Star \nMedal, because no American serviceman had direct knowledge of the \nextraordinary circumstances of his death. In a letter from the mayor of \nLimetz, written in broken English a year after Captain Austin's death, \nMrs. Lepore learned of the details of her husband's fate. The mayor \nwrote:\n\n       (i)n a supreme effort the pilot succeed to place his \n     airship in straight line and by wonderful bend . . . avoid \n     the village . . . reaching a small plain far from many. . .\n\n  The people and descendants of those whose lives and homes Captain \nAustin spared revere him to this day, and his story has been woven into \nthe lore of Limetz. Recently, on the 50th anniversary of Captain \nAustin's death, the villagers erected a monument in his memory. A \nstolen propeller from the wreckage of Captain Austin's plane, the Etta \nII, serves as the centerpiece of this memorial.\n  We Americans have spent much of this year commemorating and \nreflecting upon World War II--its battles and its strategy, its causes \nand consequences. We have questioned--as only latter generations can--\nthe course it took. We have interpreted its drama in broad \nconceptualized strokes. Captain Austin's story brings into focus the \nreality that World War II--like all wars--consisted of the acts of \nindividuals, either combined in the maelstrom of battling armies or--in \nthe case of Captain Austin, singled out, separated from the confidence \nof the group, in places of extremity where private conscience provided \nthe only compass.\n  Captain Austin's single act of grace stands out in the human \nconsciousness. It fortifies a belief that something worthy of hope in \nthe human spirit survives even the most brutal conflagrations of \ncivilization. His is a story that ought to be told and woven into the \nAmerican lore. Perhaps of all the characterizations of the American \nrole in World War II, this is the most relevant: Hundreds of thousands \nof American soldiers sacrificed their lives for strangers--Capt. C.A. \nAustin not the least among them. And in this truth, Americans may \nglimpse a noble piece of our national identity.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/10/senate-section/article/S12309-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12309-S12310]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO JERRY GARCIA AND REX FOUNDATION\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to discuss private arts \nfunding in this country as envisioned under my proposal to privatize \nthe Endowments, and at the same time to pay tribute to one of the \nNation's most beloved and most philanthropic artists, Jerry Garcia. \nJerry Garcia, acoustic guitarist, artist, and the spirit and soul of \nthe Greatful Dead, died early yesterday morning.\n  As is well known, especially in light of the outpouring of grief \nacross the country yesterday, Garcia and his band have attracted \nperhaps the most loyal and dedicated fans of any rock group. What is \nless well known, and is to the band's credit, is that Garcia's band \nalso donated millions of private dollars to charitable causes--\nparticularly to offbeat and undiscovered artists, through the Grateful \nDead's philanthropic arm, the Rex Foundation.\n  The leader of that band died yesterday and I would like to pay \ntribute to Jerry Garcia and his spirit of genuine philanthropy by \ndiscussing one of his many charitable ventures, the Rex Foundation.\n  The Rex Foundation is precisely the sort of private philanthropy that \nopponents of my bill believe cannot exist, or will not exist in \nsufficient numbers to make up the 2 percent of private funding of the \narts that the NEA now provides. Well, this one rock-and-roll band \nprovided a million dollars a year to struggling artists, composers, and \nother charitable causes. And unlike NEA grants, Rex Foundation grants \ncame with no strings attached.\n  Rex was established as an independent charity in the early eighties, \nwhat some call the decade of greed. The profits from the band's charity \nconcerts--about $1 million a year--are funnelled into the Rex \nFoundation, named for road manager Donald Rex Jackson, who died in a \ncar crash in 1976.\n  The Greatful Dead have played as many as five benefits a year for the \nRex Foundation. Half of the royalties from the Ben & Jerry's ice-cream \nflavor ``Cherry Garcia'' go to the Rex Foundation. The rest of the \nfoundation's money mainly comes from private donations. The band \nabsorbs almost all of the administrative and personnel costs.\n  Rex money has had perhaps its greatest impact on modern symphonic \nmusic. Since its inception, the foundation has spent over $100,000 \ncommissioning and recording works by avant-garde composers.\n  Composer Robert Simpson was much acclaimed but poorly remunerated for \nhis work during a long career. At 73 years old, many of his works \nremained unrecorded. One day, he received a $10,000 money order from \nthe Rex Foundation, out of the blue. The composer used the grant to \nhelp record his ninth symphony.\n  In addition to supporting obscure composers, the Rex Foundation has \nassisted saxophonist Pharaoh Sanders, bought uniforms for the \nfinacially-strapped Lithuanian Olympic basketball team, set up \nscholarships that have enabled Salvadoran refugees to go to camp and \nSioux women to study medicine, and financed programs to eradicate \nblindness in Nepal, clean up rivers in Alabama, protect striped bass in \nCalifornia and feed the homeless in Boston.\n  Rex Foundation money was used to record the prison gospel choir of \nSan Quentin. In 1991, Grateful Dead drummer, Mickey Hart, helped bring \nthe Gyoto Tantric Choir Tibetan monks to America. As the monks passed \nSan quentin in a van, they said they felt the presence of trapped souls \nwithin.\n  They wanted to go right in, but Hart informed them that that might be \na little difficult. When the monks later performed at San Quentin \nthrough the Rex Foundation they were able to see the prison's gospel \nchoir perform. According to Hart, one prison guard began playing the \ndrums and another played the organ. Guards and inmates were mixing and \nsinging sacred songs.\n  The album, titled ``He's All I Need,'' peaked at No. 28 on the \nBillboard gospel\n charts. All proceeds went to a fund earmarked for victims of the \ninmates.\n\n  And it's not just musical events the Rex Foundation has funded. \nAnother recipient of Rex Foundation Funds was the Blue Moon, the \nhistoric University District tavern in Seattle which received a grant \nfrom the Rex Foundation to support three projects: Words \n\n[[Page S 12310]]\non Wednesdays, the Pym Cup cash prize and ``Point-No-Point,'' a \nliterary journal.\n  Just a month ago, on July 30, 1995, the band performed a show at Deer \nCreek Music Center in Indiana and donated all the net proceeds--about \n$300,000--to the Rex Foundation. Some of the beneficiaries of that show \nwere local charities: Hoosier Hills Food Bank; Broadway United \nMethodist Church, for a day camp program; Pleasant Run Children's Home; \nHealth Net Community Health Centers; Horizon House; Prevention of Child \nAbuse, Indiana; Gleaners Food Bank; Habitat for Humanity.\n  The Rex Foundation has few hard and fast rules--the Grateful Dead \nhave never been strict rule-followers for themselves or for anyone \nelse. The Rex Foundation has no endowment, no fund-raising campaigns, \nand no paid staff. It solicits no grant proposals, rarely advertises \nits good works and raised almost all its money at rock concerts at \nwhich the Grateful Dead perform. Most of the 60 to 100 grants awarded \neach year go to recipients nominated by a body called the Circle of \nDeciders. It is composed of band members and their families, its 50 \nemployees, and friends.\n  Of course, I cannot list every grant the Rex Foundation has ever \nmade--and if I could there might well be some I would not like. But \nthat is one of the greatest virtues of a private philanthropy such as \nthe Rex Foundation: No Senator, Congressman or Government bureaucrat's \napproval is required.\n  So while we debate the appropriations to be afforded the Government \nagencies charged with funding arts and humanities, and debate as well \nas restrictions that must be attached to any Government distribution of \ntaxpayer money, I think it is worth reflecting on the contributions to \nthe arts and humanities made by Jerry Garcia's band, the Grateful Dead \nover the past 12 years--contributions made without taxpayer money, \nwithout offense to the people whose money is used, and--most \nstrikingly--without self-congratulatory fanfare.\n  And also I would like to give my condolences to Jerry Garcia's \nfamily, friends, and fans, who mourn the passing of the artist, \nmusician and generous spirit, Jerry Garcia.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/10/senate-section/article/S12309-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12310]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n  CONGRATULATIONS TO RAYMOND KNAPE FOR RECEIVING THE AQUINAS COLLEGE \n                            REFLECTION AWARD\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nRaymond E. Knape. In so doing, I join with the members of his community \nwho are honoring Ray Knape on Wednesday, September 6, 1995, with the \nthird annual Aquinas College Reflection Award.\n  This award is presented to Ray as someone who reflects the values of \nGrand Rapids, Michigan's Aquinas College. These values include \ncommitment, vision, service, loyalty, integrity, and trust.\n  Ray is a native of Grand Rapids, MI. He graduated from Catholic \nCentral High School in 1949 and Georgetown University in 1953 with a \nbachelor's degree in business administration. Ray proceeded to enter \nthe University of Michigan and earn both a masters degree in business \nand a law degree.\n  Ray has served his country by joining the U.S. Naval Reserves in \n1951. He went on active duty after his graduation from the University \nof Michigan. He served as an attorney at the Pensacola Naval Air \nStation in Florida and retired from the Naval Reserves as a captain in \n1984.\n  In 1962 Ray joined Knape & Vogt Manufacturing, founded by his \ngrandfather in 1898. Knape & Vogt is the largest manufacturer of \nadjustable wall shelving in the world and holds one third of the \nmarket. It is also the second largest manufacturer of drawer slides for \nwood office furniture and kitchen and utility cabinet makers. Ray \nbecame president of Knape & Vogt in 1985 and in 1989 attained his \ncurrent position as chairman of the board.\n  Ray has been a community-oriented person throughout his life. He has \ngenerously contributed both his time and talents with many \norganizations including the Serra Club of America, Junior Achievement, \nAquinas and Davenport Colleges, Saint Mary's Hospital, the Grand Rapids \nEmployers Association, the Grand Rapids Chamber of Commerce, the \nSymphony Board, and many others. He has been an active fund-raiser and \ntireless worker on behalf of his parish, St. Stephen's Church, and the \nRoman Catholic Diocese of Grand Rapids.\n  Mr. President I ask you along with all of my colleagues in the Senate \nto join with me in extending our heartfelt congratulations to Raymond \nE. Knape in receiving the Aquinas College Reflection Award.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/10/senate-section/article/S12310-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12310]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n   TO DELAY IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S RANGELAND REFORM \n                                PROPOSAL\n\n Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, the bipartisan amendment I am \noffering today addresses an issue that is critical to ranching families \nin my State of Wyoming and throughout the West. The initiative would \nput in place a 90-day moratorium on implementation of Secretary of \nInterior Bruce Babbitt's rangeland reform proposal, which is scheduled \nto take effect August 21, 1995. Soon after the Secretary released his \nplan on February 22, 1995, Senators Pete Domenici and Larry Craig \nintroduced S. 852, the Public Rangelands Management Act of 1995--of \nwhich I am an original cosponsor--to amend Bruce Babbitt's initiative. \nHowever, faced with a full legislative agenda and time constraints, the \nCongress was not able to take up and debate this issue before its \nscheduled summer recess.\n  As a result, a group of western Senators, myself included, met with \nSecretary Babbitt just this morning to ask him to refrain from putting \nhis final rule in place administratively. Unfortunately, the Secretary \nwas unwilling to work with us and grant additional time, which left no \nother alternative than to offer this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I believe this entire discussion comes down to a \nmatter of fairness. If Bruce Babbitt's proposal would not have \ncompletely dismantled the way livestock grazing is conducted on public \nlands there would not be a need for action. As many will remember, 2 \nyears ago the Secretary of Interior proposed a plan soundly rejected by \npeople throughout the West because it would have forced many small-to \nmedium-sized ranchers out of business. Congress sent a clear message to \nMr. Babbitt by defeating his plans. Now, however, the Secretary intends \nto carry out his ideas administratively and believes Members of \nCongress should no longer have a voice in this issue.\n  I strongly disagree. What we are talking about here are the \nlivelihoods of thousands of ranchers in my State and across the West. \nFolks everywhere tell me that if they are forced to live under the \nrules outlined in Bruce Babbitt's initiative, they could lose their \nbusiness. I am not going to let that happen. We have made great \nprogress on the Public Rangelands Management Act. It passed the Senate \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee with bipartisan support, and I \nam certain that with an additional 90 days the Senate will also pass \nthis measure with the support of Republicans and Democrats alike. I \nwould like to thank my colleagues who cosponsored this important \namendment and I urge its adoption.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/10/senate-section/article/S12310-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12310-S12311]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n            THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF INDONESIAN INDEPENDENCE\n\n Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, on August 17th, the Republic of \nIndonesia, one of America's strongest and best allies, will celebrate \nthe 50th anniversary of its declaration of independence. It was on this \nday 50 years ago that this great friend ended 300 years of colonial \nrule by the Dutch. The United States, I am pleased to say, was the \nfirst to recognize Indonesia.\n  Since that momentous day one half century ago our two nations have \nenjoyed a warm and mutually supportive relationship. Indeed, Indonesia \nhas proved this friendship time and time again in matters as diverse as \nvotes in the United Nations and support of the United States position \nduring the Vietnamese war.\n  Mr. President, on this anniversary it is also appropriate to pay \ntribute to President Soeharto under whose leadership, truly astonishing \nprogress has been made. President Soeharto assumed control of the \ncountry in 1965 and was named Acting President by the \n\n[[Page S 12311]]\nnational legislature 2 years later and was then formally elected to \noffice in 1968.\n  Today, the adult illiteracy rate has been cut by two-thirds and \nprimary education is now universal throughout the islands. Per capita \nincome is over $900 a year, putting Indonesia at the edge of membership \nin the tigers groups. Life expectancy at birth has increased by 20 \nyears, or 50 percent, and the rate of infant mortality has plummeted.\n  Perhaps the most telling measure of all, overall poverty rates, best \nillustrates the economic miracle which has occurred in Indonesia. From \na rate of 60 percent in 1967, today less than 15 percent of the total \npopulation is now considered to live in poverty.\n  Indonesia's remarkable growth and development has affected every \nsector of society, every geographic area of this island nation, and all \nethnic groups.\n  There is no question in my mind that these wise economic and social \nachievements have helped build and nurture this relatively new nation, \nand that the nation of Indonesia now rests on a solid foundation.\n  We in the United States along with our many friends in Asia and \nelsewhere have also benefited from the stability which has emerged in \nIndonesia. This stability has enabled Indonesia to move away from the \nearlier years of konfontasi and toward the regional leadership role \nIndonesia has asserted in promoting the peaceful resolution of disputes \nin Southeastern Asia including Cambodia and the Sprattlys. Indonesia \nhas become an important voice of reason throughout Asia and the third \nworld, and is a key part of a peaceful stable Pacific.\n  Mr. President, I know I am joined by my colleagues in sending our \nvery best wishes to our great friend and ally, the Republic of \nIndonesia, and in sending our heartiest congratulations to its \ndistinguished President.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/10/senate-section/article/S12310-3", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12311-S12313]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n           R INVESTMENT AND THE FUTURE OF THE U.S. ECONOMY\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, the Institute for the Future has \ncompleted an important report on the future of research and development \nin this country. This report makes the critical connection between \nresearch and development investment and the competitiveness of American \nindustry. This important link between R and our economy must not be \nunderestimated. Without sufficient investment in R today, we are \ndestined to be losers in the global economic battles of tomorrow. \nGovernment and the private sector need to work as partners to make sure \nthat our business remains competitive, bringing jobs and prosperity to \nour economy.\n  Congress is currently contemplating a major shift in our R policy. \nIn their zeal to balance the budget, many Members have forgotten why we \nare striving to balance the budget. The reason we need to balance the \nbudget is to increase our economic prosperity. Therefore, it is \ncounterproductive to balance the budget by cutting spending in areas \nthat are adding to our economic prosperity. We are on the verge of \nmaking the mistake of cutting investments in the very areas that we are \ntrying to stimulate. R is one of those areas. We are making \nunprecedented cuts in R, departing from an R policy that has \nenjoyed bipartisan support for 50 years, since the end of World War II.\n  I have been working hard in support of research and development \ninitiatives in Congress to promote many of the objectives put forth in \nthe report from the Institute for the Future. We are currently engaged \nin a battle to save the Department of Commerce, business' seat at the \nCabinet table. Those in Congress who seek to dismantle the Department \nof Commerce have not recognized that Government has a role to play in \npartnership with private industry to stimulate the technology \ndevelopment that will be the foundation of the next generation of \nproducts in the global marketplace. The Department of Commerce also \nperforms the basic science that is required to set standards that are \nthe critical benchmarks of modern industry. Other programs educate \nsmall- and mid-size industry in state-of-the-art technologies that \nallow them to compete in an increasingly fierce international \ncompetition for consumers. In addition to its R functions, the \nDepartment of Commerce performs trade functions that promote and \nprotect our interests abroad.\n  Government also has the responsibility of providing an economic \nenvironment that promotes R in the private sector. I am currently \ninvolved in legislation in two areas that will have a significant \nimpact on R investment. I am working on a bipartisan basis to draft \nlegislation to make the R tax credit permanent and more inclusive. \nBusiness cannot function in an uncertain economic environment. To make \ngood business decisions, particularly investment in R, business needs \nto have reliable and well defined tax laws regarding R tax credits. A \npermanent R tax credit will provide business with this certainty. I \nhave also introduced a bill with Senator Hatch which provides a 50-\npercent across-the-board exclusion on capital gains with an increased \nexclusion for qualified small businesses. The bill has a dozen \ncosponsors, spanning the range of the Senate's political spectrum. This \nchange in capital gains taxes should encourage capital investment, \nincluding investment in new businesses which are bringing new \ntechnologies to market, and new jobs to our work force.\n  These efforts are particularly important in the current economic \nclimate. Decreasing product life-cycles and increasing competition is \nforcing industry to focus on shorter time scales, not the longer time \nhorizons required for high risk R We must make sure that there are \nincentives that encourage investment in long-range, high-risk R \nThese private sector programs, however, are only a complement, not a \nreplacement for federally funded R efforts. The Government's role in \nscience and technology tends to be longer term and in areas where \nindustry does not invest. Industry is not prepared to undertake the \nrisk that longer term R entails. Private sector R tends to be \nincreasingly short-term, and focused on areas where there will be a \nclear short-term return. We need increasing investment in both \nGovernment and private sector R, yet we are faced with declining \nprivate sector R investment and major cuts by the new Congress in \nGovernment's R Both of these problems must be addressed if the \nUnited States is to retain its economic leadership. Our competitors are \nincreasing their investments in both R arenas.\n  I applaud the Institute for the Future in their efforts to research \nthe current R climate and to delineate goals for the future. As \npartners, private industry and Government can lay the groundwork for \neffective investments in our future. At a recent event to introduce the \nreport from the Institute for the Future, Dr. Mary Good, Under \nSecretary for Technology, U.S. Department of Commerce, and Richard J. \nKogan, president and chief operating officer, Schering-Plough Corp., \nmade statements concerning the critical role that research and \ndevelopment plays in our economy. I ask that these statements be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The statements follow:\nComments on ``The Future of America's Research-Intensive Industries,'' \n                Prepared by the Institute for the Future\n\n (By Mary L. Good, Under Secretary for Technology, U.S. Department of \n                        Commerce, July 24, 1995)\n\n       First, let me say how pleased I am to have an opportunity \n     to participate in this News Conference which announces the \n     publication of the report entitled ``The Future of America's \n     Research-Intensive Industries''. The Institute for the Future \n     and the sponsors of this report are to be congratulated for \n     their foresight and commitment to the long-term health of the \n     U.S. economy. Clearly, the U.S. research-intensive industries \n     have been one of the major vehicles for the country's \n     economic growth since World War II. They have played a \n     disproportionate role in the improvement of our standard of \n     living, in the development of our industrial infrastructure, \n     and particularly in establishing the United States as the \n     world's leader in high-technology development. In many ways \n     they have been the motivation for the creation of the world's \n     leading higher education system because they generated the \n     jobs that required high-quality graduate training in science \n     and engineering. They appreciated and utilized the research \n     output from our research universities, the national \n     laboratories, and the mission agencies of the government, \n     particularly Defense, NASA, and Energy. Less well recognized, \n     they played a vital role in the success of entrepreneurial, \n     high-tech startup companies that utilized \n\n[[Page S 12312]]\n     the people and technology that was nurtured in their major research \n     centers but did not meet their internal criteria for further \n     in-house development. Many of our successful high-tech \n     startups over the last 30 years or so can trace their \n     ancestry back to ``parents'' or ``grandparents'' in the \n     research-intensive companies who grew and flourished in the \n     years after World War II. In addition, they have provided the \n     market for thousands of small companies, first, second and \n     third tier suppliers who have flourished over the same period \n     of time.\n       The success of this industry, as so capably defined by this \n     report, has been the result of both government and business \n     foresight in the development of a research and development \n     infrastructure in the private sector, the government, and \n     academia. This infrastructure provided the intellectual \n     capital required for our industry to excel. However, it was \n     developed at a time when the government motivation was \n     substantially based on defense needs. The industry had a \n     world competitive position that encouraged long-term \n     investment in R that benefited it directly, and indirectly \n     spilled over to provide great social benefit ranging from the \n     creation of entirely new industries to the development of \n     technology based, civilian infrastructure.\n       As the report documents, the end of the Cold War and the \n     rise of many able competitors all over the world have changed \n     dramatically the position and behavior of both the government \n     and the industry in their role in the R infrastructure \n     which has sustained them over the last 50 years. The \n     questions addressed by the report are vital to our country's \n     future and the ability of our children and grandchildren to \n     enjoy the same opportunities and quality of life that we \n     have. The conclusions of the report and their implications \n     for public policy must not be ignored. The recommendations \n     require active government participation with the industry in \n     working out the new paradigm for R infrastructure which is \n     appropriate for the 21st century. To suggest that the \n     solution to these problems belongs to the industry alone and \n     that it is time for the government to provide significantly \n     less resources and investment in this area so vital to \n     economic growth is to declare defeat in the economic security \n     battles that are raging around the world today. Our future \n     depends on the realignment of a greater share of our \n     government funded R effort to civilian industries; the \n     continued support of university research, both basic and \n     applied science and engineering; the cultivation of a core of \n     the ``best and the brightest'' students to seek an education \n     in science and engineering; and the encouragement of \n     industrial R growth over time. The global market of today \n     may well create the forces which cause individual companies \n     to realign and adjust their R resources to be economically \n     successful. However, those same forces may cause the United \n     States as a country to under-invest in the future where our \n     R intensive industries are world players but not the \n     overall contributors to the nation's well-being that they \n     have been in the past. Thus, public policy must be developed \n     which maintains the results of our Cold War policies but \n     which is focused on programs and resource allocation which \n     are appropriate for the new post-Cold War environment of \n     today.\n       Let me conclude by commenting on each of the five \n     recommendations for public policy listed in the conclusion of \n     the report.\n\n\n              Maintain federal support for basic research\n\n       This is a major priority for going forward. Not only must \n     we maintain the portfolio in the universities funded by the \n     civilian agencies like NSF and NIH, we must continue at least \n     the current level of support from the mission agencies like \n     Defense, NASA, Energy, and Agriculture. This university \n     research includes a significant amount of applied and \n     engineering research which must not be\n      removed on the fallacious argument that the government's \n     role should be limited to ``basic research''.\n       In addition, the role of a segment of the government \n     laboratories in fundamental research must be re-examined and \n     strengthened to provide facilities and long-term programs \n     which support and supplement both the civilian industry and \n     academic efforts.\n\n\n             encourage long-term private investment for r\n\n       An environment must be created that induces both U.S. \n     industry and U.S. subsidiaries of foreign-owned firms to \n     invest in R and high-level manufacturing within the United \n     States. Future high-paying and intellectually challenging \n     jobs depend on this environment. Tax and investment policies \n     which provide these incentives must be part of any public \n     ``technology policy''.\n\n\n       lower government-generated risk associated with innovation\n\n       Public policy must address regulatory and litigation issues \n     so that public interests are balanced against innovation \n     incentives. The lost value of innovations not done because of \n     regulatory and legal disincentives must be considered in the \n     overall context of the optimization of public protection vs. \n     private industry activities.\n\n\n                     protect intellectual property\n\n       In the market place, intellectual property is a major part \n     of the competitive edge which justifies R expenditures. \n     Without world-wide protection of that intellectual property, \n     companies cannot capture the full value of their R \n     investment through global sales with appropriate margins. As \n     products and services become more knowledge-based and \n     software intensive, the need for new paradigms in the \n     protection of intellectual property will become more urgent. \n     Clearly, public policy must focus on international trade \n     relations as well as on domestic legislation if our companies \n     can continue to reap the benefits of extensive R \n     investments.\n\n\n                  support industry cooperation on r\n\n       As product live cycles continue to decrease and private \n     industry spends less on enabling and emerging pre-competitive \n     technologies, the need for better bridges between university \n     and government research and the industrial sector become more \n     urgent. Joint ventures and government-private partnerships \n     provide rapid technology transfer and continue to \n     technological infrastructure that has served us so well in \n     the past. These activities must not be lost by ideological \n     attacks on so-called ``corporate welfare'' and arguments \n     about the government's role in industrial innovation. \n     Programs which have been developed over the past five or six \n     years such as the Advanced Technology Program in the \n     Department of Commerce and the CRADA programs in the \n     Department of Energy must be strengthened and continued. \n     Overall a 5-10% portion of the federal R budget should be \n     reserved for these partnership programs. They should \n     encourage both government and academic interaction with \n     industrial R and foster the kind of relationships where \n     emerging technologies can develop and spin off new industries \n     in a competitive time frame and new enabling technologies can \n     be rapidly assimilated by the industry.\n       The response to these recommendations by today's policy \n     makers and legislators will determine the quality of our \n     country's future. The investments called for must be made in \n     an era of great need to reduce the overall federal deficit \n     and where the need for investments in education and continued \n     support for the needy and the elderly must be found. Thus it \n     is a time when a thoughtful review of government R \n     activities is in order to prioritize the expenditures to meet \n     the recommendations of today's report. Current budget \n     resolutions in the House and Senate project a decrease of at \n     least one-third of all federal government R expenditures by \n     the year 2002 and a prohibition on all R partnership \n     activities where the federal government funds any part of an \n     industrial firm's civilian technology development. The \n     appropriation process which is now underway for 1996 budgets \n     would indicate that the plan is on track. Some $5-6 billion \n     of the $34 billion or so of civilian R have been identified \n     for reduction and most of the newer partnership programs have \n     been severely reduced or eliminated. The Advanced Technology \n     Program has been eliminated, the Technology Reinvestment \n     Program in the Defense Department has almost been eliminated \n     and the DOE CRADA budget has been reduced to a few million \n     dollars. The report before us outlines why the industry will \n     not and can not replace these activities. The discontinuity \n     which will be caused by these budget actions, the consequent \n     loss of thousands of R jobs, and the effect it will have on \n     academic research departments will not be amenable to ``quick \n     fixes'' next year or in the foreseeable future. We can only \n     hope that this report and other current analyses will \n     convince the public and the Congress that this approach is \n     suicidal. A balanced budget will only be achieved by both \n     government reductions and strategic investments in labor, \n     capital and technology which will provide the economic growth \n     and jobs of the future. This report goes a long way to \n     explaining in clear terms why that is true.\n       Thank you.\n       ``The Future of America's Research-Intensive Industries''\n\n (By Richard J. Kogan, President and Chief Operating Officer, Schering-\n                             Plough Corp.)\n\n       Members of the Administration and Congress, distinguished \n     scientists and professors, ladies and gentlemen:\n       Good morning. As the Institute's researchers have noted, \n     pharmaceuticals and biotechnology are one of this nation's \n     ``top eight'' R industries examined for their ability \n     to continue their innovation track record.\n       Certainly, major challenges lie ahead for our industry. \n     With biopharmaceutical industry R costs rising, it's \n     increasingly difficult to repeat our previous innovation \n     achievements that have made America the worldwide \n     technological leader in medicine. Just as we cannot return to \n     yesterday's markets, we cannot replicate our former R \n     expenditures. Growth in industry R spending today is less \n     than half the level of the early 1980s.\n       Schering-Plough in the 15-year period 1979-1994 spent \n     almost $500 million to develop our recombinant alpha \n     interferon, plunging ahead even when it initially appeared \n     the drug would help only a handful of cancer patients. It \n     took nearly 14 years of work before we saw a penny of return \n     on that investment. Today, such an effort might not be made--\n     nor our subsequent discovery that the drug can treat 16 \n     cancer and viral diseases.\n       For pharmaceutical and biotech firms, the burning issue now \n     is not only whether we can continue bringing products to \n     patients that treat unconquered diseases, but whether we can \n     continue covering the expenditure for leading-edge research. \n     Our industry is currently responsible for more than 90 \n     percent of all new U.S. drug discoveries.\n\n[[Page S 12313]]\n\n       Today's diseases--Alzheimer's, AIDS, heart and kidney \n     disease, prostate cancer and arthritis--are far more complex \n     than those successfully treated in the past. Moreover, many \n     of today's most prevalent diseases--primarily chronic and \n     degenerative conditions--are at the high-cost stage in the \n     innovation cycle. If we cut investment in medical progress \n     today, the consequence may be irrevocable and society may rue \n     that decision for years to come.\n       The annual medical costs of only seven major uncured \n     diseases account for about half of today's health care bill. \n     However, many of those diseases are within reach of effective \n     pharmaceutical control or cure. As biomedical technology \n     progresses to that point, the total cost of treating these \n     major ailments should drop sharply. If the cycle of \n     innovation is disrupted, we run the risk of being trapped \n     with today's higher-cost, less-effective options.\n       Today's rapidly changing health care market signals the \n     continuing sense of urgency for optimal patient care and cost \n     containment. By the same token, we must constantly remind \n     ourselves that medical innovation is the most viable, long-\n     term solution for cost-effective quality care--as the \n     findings of the Institute study attest.\n       In 1995, an urgent task before U.S. policymakers should be \n     to assure that the path of innovation remains open, \n     unobstructed and attractive to investors. And, that statement \n     applies across the aboard--from our industry that has cured \n     polio, tuberculosis, measles and diphtheria to our fellow \n     industries that have brought the world the laser, fiber \n     optics, lightweight alloys, integrated circuits, the CAT \n     scanner, and that have taken us into outer space.\n       Thank you.\n       \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/10/senate-section/article/S12311-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12313]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                              BOB SELTZER\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes of the \nSenate's time this evening to salute the career of one of the best \namong us. Tomorrow, Bob Seltzer is turning off his Senate computer \nterminal for the last time, analyzing his last floor debate, perhaps \nwriting his last perceptive piece of policy analysis. After spending \nmuch of the last 17 years serving three different Senators, Bob is \nleaving Capitol Hill for less hectic pursuits. Along with the many \npeople who have had the privilege of working with him, I will miss him \nvery much.\n  Bob was teaching college in Detroit when I was lucky enough to get \nhim to manage my first campaign for the U.S. Senate in 1978. Despite \nthe odds against a city councilman like me winning his first statewide \nrace, Bob maneuvered me into winning and followed me to Washington as \nthe chief of my staff. We both dove into the challenges and \nopportunities of this institution, and he was at my side throughout my \nfirst 4 years. He set up my office, hired my staff, shaped my \nlegislative program, wrote some speeches for me and endorsed me in many \naspects of my job. Even after moving on to other challenges, Bob came \nback when I needed him for another stint on my staff as my \ncommunications director.\n  We learned the ways of Washington together, and we both developed a \ndeep love for the Senate. He was as fascinated as I with its traditions \nand procedures, and he became one of a handful of students of the \nSenate who have a deep understanding of how and why things happen here \nthey way they do. His unique, wry and creative sense of humor helped me \nand all those he worked with survive the many strains of Senate life. \nHe enjoyed poking fun at himself. I relied on his political instincts \nand insights, and on his ability to tell me things straight. His grasp \nof the fundamental principles of what makes our complex society \nfunction and his incredible ability to analyze and explain a problem \nand argue for a solution to it were invaluable assets to this Senator.\n  That ability to paint word pictures of people and problems and their \nsolutions which Bob has is truly remarkable. He can write about \nvirtually any subject and bring it to vivid life, creating memorable \nimages that stay with the listener or the reader. I remember, for \nexample, the way he once described his suspicions about someone's \nguilt: ``There may not be a smoking gun, but there's a trail of spent \nshells leading to his door.'' Even his internal office memos describing \nthe most mundane administrative matters, which he claimed to be \nterrible at dealing with, contained priceless paragraphs of prose and \nself deprecating humor.\n  I would be less than truthful if I did not point out, however, that \nBob did have a weakness in his writing style, a tendency toward \nexcessive alliteration. Perhaps this grows out of his interest in \nliterature, which he is going to pursue in the years ahead by opening a \nbookstore. One of his close friends and former coworkers, Chuck Cutolo, \nwho also recently moved on from the Senate, called to say that if Bob \nwere writing his own headline for the story of this departure, it would \nprobably read something like ``Seltzer Severs Senatorial Services; \nBanks on Books to Bring Him a Breather.''\n  But this one weakness did not stop Bob from getting two other \nSenators to make him a key advisor after he left my staff. Senator Herb \nKohl made Bob his legislative director, and he most recently has served \nSenator Frank Lautenberg in that same capacity. They probably don't \nknow it, but Bob continued to help me, in his spare time. He continued \nto be a political strategist and advisor, and I hope he continues to \ngive me the benefit of his extraordinary skills and his trenchant \nwisdom.\n  When we came here together he was a young man. He's now old enough to \nbe beloved. And that he is.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/10/senate-section/article/S12313-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12313-S12314]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF JOHN J. CALLAHAN\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, on July 21, 1995, the Senate \nCommittee on Finance favorably reported the nomination of John J. \nCallahan for the position of Assistant Secretary for Management and \nBudget and Chief Financial Officer (ASMB/CFO) for the Department of \nHealth and Human Services. I support Dr. Callahan's nomination and feel \nhis expertise would be advantageous to this Department. The importance \nof this Department and its role in our society is immeasurable. For \nthis reason it is crucial that this Department, like every other, be \nserved by outstanding people such as Dr. Callahan.\n  For more than 25 years, John J. Callahan has had an exemplary public \nservice record. He served in the United States Senate for over 15 \nyears. During that period he served as Staff Director for the U.S. \nSenate Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on Intergovernmental Relations \nand the Subcommittee on Government Efficiency, Federalism, and the \nDistrict of Columbia. His service also includes serving as Deputy Staff \nDirector of the Senate Budget Committee and Chief of Staff to my good \nfriend from Tennessee, former Senator Jim Sasser. Dr. Callahan's vast \nCongressional and budget experience should help him tremendously as he \nwrestles with the issues that HHS deals with every day.\n  Earlier in Dr. Callahan's public service career he was a Director at \nthe National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL). During that time \nhe had the opportunity to conduct studies that helped State \nlegislatures review their school finance plans to meet with educational \nmandates. Working for the State governments has given him the \nbackground needed to better link state and national government \nagencies, and to better interpret the effect of Federal requirements on \nstate and local governments.\n  As Chief Financial Officer, Dr. Callahan will have the responsibility \nof handling the more than $300 billion budget that is allocated \nannually to HHS programs. He is ably credentialed for this task. Dr. \nCallahan's work at the Senate Budget Committee included assisting in \nthe preparation of more than 20 Committee hearings and in the \ndevelopment and passage of two budget reconciliation bills (which \ntogether reduced projected deficits by nearly $1 trillion).\n  HHS is considered by many to be one of the most crucial entities of \nour government. This Department affects all Americans at some point or \nanother in their lives. From childhood immunization programs to the \nsupervision of Medicare, we will all eventually benefit from the \nservices of this agency. The Assistant Secretary of Management and \nBudget has many responsibilities that help to make this a productive \nDepartment. John Callahan has the expertise and track record to run \nthis\n office efficiently and purposefully. In a recent meeting with Dr. \nCallahan, we discussed his role in designing more efficient programs. \nJohn Callahan brings with him to this important post not only new and \ninnovative ideas but invaluable experience that has taken him many \nyears to acquire. \n\n[[Page S 12314]]\n\n\n  When it comes to the health of the people of the United States, we \nmust make education and public awareness a top priority. John J. \nCallahan is a devoted student, having earned his Bachelor's Degree in \nPolitical Science at Fordham University, his Master's Degree in \nRegional Planning at Syracuse University and his Ph.D. in Social \nScience also at Syracuse. John has served as an Assistant Professor of \nEducation and Planning at the University of Virginia and an adjunct \nprofessor at the USDA Graduate School and American University.\n  Further, John J. Callahan is a devoted family man. He is very \nsupportive of his wife and three children. He wants to ensure a health \nfuture for his children as well as the children of our entire nation.\n  I would like to conclude by saying that the Department of Health and \nHuman Services has played a key role in today's health care debate. I \nhave no doubt that our great Nation will pull together to find \nsolutions to the problems that have been identified. The solutions will \ncome from individuals like John Callahan, one who has devoted his \nlifetime to education, research and public service.\n  It is again my honor and pleasure to declare my full support for John \nJ. Callahan's nomination to be the Assistant Secretary for Management \nand Budget and Chief Financial Officer of the Department of Health and \nHuman Services.\n  I would like to thank Jeffrey C. Lederman for his capable work on \ndevelopment of this statement. Mr. Lederman is a medical student at the \nUniversity of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-School of \nOsteopathic Medicine who ably assisted by Aging Committee staff as a \nfellow over the last 2 months. We are grateful to Mr. Lederman for his \nservice to the Committee. \n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/10/senate-section/article/S12313-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12314]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  U.S. AIR FORCE AIR MOBILITY COMMAND\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nSecretary, the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Force and the officers, \nmen and women of the United States Air Force Air Mobility Command for \ntheir performance during the recently concluded reliability, \nmaintainability, and availability evaluation of the C-17 Globemaster \nIII. This aircraft, though controversial at the start has more than \nproven itself under intense scrutiny by the USAF testers, but most \nimportantly it has proven itself to the men and women who load it, fly \nit, and maintain it.\n  During the RM evaluation, the C-17 and their crews transported \n5,500 tons of Air Force and Army equipment, airdropped nearly 770,000 \npounds, including Sheridan tanks and accommodated over 3,000 \nparatroopers of the 82d Airborne from Fort Bragg, NC and I send my \ncongratulations to them as well. The C-17 flew more than 2,250 flight \nhours and 500 sorties with a 99-percent launch reliability rate.\n  We look for jointness in many of our procurements, the C-17 was built \nwith this in mind. Its load capacity has been designed to carry \nPatriots, helicopters, humvees, main battle tanks, multiple launcher \nrocket systems and the Army's huge communications vans. These items can \nnot only be transported but driven on and driven off of the aircraft * \n* * and in an austere environment. It can take the mission essential \nequipment to where the troops need it. It truly can carry the fight to \nthe enemy * * *wherever he is.\n  And so Mr. President, I hope this puts to rest those critics of the \nC-17 who look to less flexible, limited commercial freight haulers to \nsupport the combat requirements of this Nation's military personnel. \nAgain, I pass my congratulations and ``a job well done'' to all those \ninvolved in the C-17 program.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/10/senate-section/article/S12314-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12314]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                              LAURA HUDSON\n\n   Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, for almost 23 years I have been \nprivileged to serve in the U.S. Senate. For some 20 of those years I \nhave been blessed with the able assistance of Laura Hudson, who \ncompletes her Senate service this week, as my legislative director and \nindispensable right hand.\n  In so many ways, Laura personifies the best tradition of Senate \nservice--beginning in one capacity and growing into so many more. The \nyoung history post-graduate, who took a legislative-correspondent \nposition in my office in 1975, quickly grew beyond that and has been my \ninvaluable counsel on a variety of legislative challenges over the \nyears.\n  Her knowledge of the budgetary process is legendary among her \ncolleagues. And her command of the appropriations process has no equal \namong those who serve on personal staffs in the Senate.\n  There are parks and preservation projects, in Louisiana and beyond \nwhich exist solely because of the personal commitment and legislative \nskill of Laura Hudson, whole regions of the globe, such as Micronesia, \nroutinely neglected by many in the Congress, receive a respect and \nrecognition in Washington due heavily to Laura's devotion. That \ncomponent Closeup Program, which brings hundreds of students and \nteachers each year from the former Trust Territories of Micronesia, is \nbut one example of Laura's passion.\n  Moreover, I am convinced that the relationship between our country \nand many of the developing and emerging economies of the world, such as\n China, Viet Nam, and Indonesia, profit in immeasurable ways from the \nunderstanding and leadership of staff persons such as Laura.\n\n  This is a woman, Mr. President, who has forsaken many opportunities \nin the private sector because of a deep belief in the merits of public \nservice, and a belief in the simple tenet that she could make a \ndifference. More than we often acknowledge, it is the Laura Hudsons who \nmade a qualitative difference in our daily work product.\n  I know that Laura will continue to contribute, as only she can, to \npublic policy. But I will miss her in a way immediate and direct, as \nwill so many of her longtime colleagues in the Senate. But I know they \njoin me in expressing appreciation and best wishes as Laura enters an \nexciting new chapter of her life.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/10/senate-section/article/S12314-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12314-S12315]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   JUNEAU DRILL TEAM WORLD CHAMPIONS\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the drill team from Juneau-Douglas High \nSchool in the capital of my State recently won the world championship \nInternational Dance-Drill Competition in Nagoya, Japan.\n  In recognition of their accomplishment, I ask that articles from the \nJuneau Empire detailing the team's achievements be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Juneau Empire, August 6, 1995]\n\n Drill Team World Champs!--Juneau Girls Sweep All Three Categories in \n                                 Japan\n\n                             (By Mike Sica)\n\n       They're the best on the planet.\n       The Juneau-Douglas High School Drill Team dazzled the \n     world, performing the best show, military and prop routines \n     at the International Dance-Drill Competition today in Nagoya, \n     Japan.\n       The girls also received a special award from the mayor of \n     Nagoya.\n       Drill team head coach Leslie Dahl said it was hard to \n     understand what was being said because it was all in \n     Japanese.\n       ``All I know is the mayor thinks we're the best,'' Dahl \n     said.\n       So did the panel of judges who ranked the Juneau girls \n     ahead of hundreds of other competitors spanning the globe.\n       The JDHS drill team finished ahead of two Japanese squads \n     in the show routine, beat California and Australia in the \n     military march, and topped Japan and California in the prop \n     routine.\n       ``This is beyond our wildest imaginations,'' an excited \n     Dahl said over the phone just minutes after the announcement \n     of the winners. ``The girls had to push Jennifer Frederick \n     (team captain) forward because she thought she had heard \n     wrong, she just couldn't believe it.''\n       Neither could Craig Dahl, Leslie's husband and a member of \n     the Drill Team Dads. He didn't expect the girls to win the \n     show routine, only because they had few props compared to \n     their competitors in that category.\n       ``I'm sure they drew the crowd into their routine,'' he \n     figured. ``It's exactly what they did in Long Beach (Calif.), \n     when they won the three national titles'' earlier this year.\n       Craig Dahl said the girls must have turned it on under \n     pressure, captivating the audience with their energy and \n     enthusiasm.\n       ``It's absolutely fantastic, they're as good as we think \n     they are,'' he added.\n       Juneau made the finals, making the first cut with their \n     preliminary performances on Saturday. Leslie Dahl knew they \n     were strong in the prop routine but thought they were shaky \n     in the military march.\n\n[[Page S 12315]]\n\n       She was also concerned about the show routine because \n     Juneau did not have props that the other teams from Japan \n     had. Dahl said it was time to be daring.\n       ``We decided to go for it in finals, show them what we \n     really can do,'' she said. ``We had nothing to lose.''\n       There were about 7,000 people jam-packed in the huge arena \n     in Nagoya, and they responded to the Juneau girls.\n       ``It felt like we were in the Olympics, with the lighting \n     turned down and spotlights flashing,'' Leslie Dahl said. ``It \n     was unbelievable, especially the way the people supported \n     us.''\n       The drill team will head back to Juneau on Monday. But they \n     were off to a reception today, ready to exchange gifts and \n     trade T-Shirts.\n       ``A lot of Japanese students want to take pictures of the \n     girls,'' she said. ``They're not used to seeing girls so \n     tall.''\n       Craig Dahl said the sweep in the International competition \n     was the drill team's way of thanking Juneau for its \n     generosity.\n       ``The whole community supported the girls and they repayed \n     the town with three world titles,'' he said.\n       Leslie Dahl agreed.\n       ``The girls worked so hard, and so did the community,'' she \n     said before rushing to a bus that would take the Juneau girls \n     to the reception honoring them.\n       ``Juneau should be proud!''\n       So should Alaska and the United States.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                [From the Juneau Empire, August 9, 1995]\n\n   The Champs Return--Enthusiastic Crowd Greets Drill Team at Airport\n\n                             (By Mike Sica)\n\n       About 400 people celebrated the Juneau-Douglas High School \n     Drill Team as most of its members returned home after winning \n     three world championship trophies at an international \n     competition in Japan.\n       The enthusiastic crowd at the Juneau Airport Tuesday \n     carried balloons, flowers and placards. One sign said, \n     ``World's Greatest!'' Another read, ``JDHS Drill Team--The \n     Pride of Alaska, The Pride of the USA.''\n       And there was one that said, ``The Best on the Planet,'' \n     which has become the team's rallying cry.\n       Family, friends and fans waited anxiously for the team to \n     arrive.\n       ``I'm here to support my sister,'' 16-year-old James \n     Roberts said of Jodi Timothy. ``I want to congratulate her \n     and give her a Coke.''\n       Drill Team dad Jay Boone paced the floor, waiting to see \n     his daughter Gretchen.\n       And Charlie and Barbara Mitchell joked about living with a \n     world champion.\n       ``We'll have to open our double doors wide enough to fit \n     her head through,'' Barbara Mitchell said. ``But really, \n     we're just very proud of them all. They worked very hard and \n     deserve this.''\n       Linda Egan said she was excited for her daughter Leslie and \n     the rest of the girls, ``not just for winning but for the \n     chance to meet people of different nationalities.''\n       Charlotte Richards said her daughter Erin called about 4 \n     a.m. Sunday (Alaska Standard Time), saying Saturday was the \n     ``the greatest day of her life.''\n       ``She wasn't talking about winning as much as meeting kids \n     from other countries,'' the proud mother explained. ``The \n     amazing thing is that on the same day they won, Japan was \n     observing the end of World War II.\n       ``It's neat that the grandchildren of former enemies can \n     enjoy each other so much.''\n       Bart Rozell made the trip to Japan with his two daughters, \n     Mariah and Rebecca. He said the Japanese were wonderful \n     hosts.\n       ``The atmosphere was so friendly and receptive,'' he said. \n     ``They treated our kids like celebrities, asking for \n     autographs and wanting to have pictures taken with them.\n       ``The girls had to pinch themselves, making sure it wasn't \n     a dream.''\n       There were lots of hugs, kissing and tears as the girls \n     entered the airport lounge. The crowd then moved to the Taku \n     Room for brief presentations.\n       Mayor and drill team parent Dennis Egan told the girls the \n     city, state and country are proud of them. He then told a \n     story about a fax he sent to his daughter Leslie.\n       ``I told her, You still had to clean up your room when you \n     get back, it looks exactly like it did when you left,'' Egan \n     said.\n       The Juneau mayor announced a special community reception \n     for the drill team will be held next Wednesday at 7 p.m. in \n     Centennial Hall\n                                                                    ____\n\n                [From the Juneau Empire, August 9, 1995]\n\n Captain's Comeback Highlights Return--Drill Team Gets Warm Welcome in \n                              Return Home\n\n                             (By Mike Sica)\n\n       Jennifer Frederick typifies the never-say-die attitude of \n     the Juneau-Douglas High School Drill Team, going from \n     wheelchair to world champ in less than a year and helping her \n     teammates become ``the best on the planet.''\n       That phrase--which has become the team's slogan since it \n     won world championships in the show, military and prop \n     routines at the International Dance-Drill Competition in \n     Nagoya, Japan last week--was repeated time and again Tuesday \n     evening at the Juneau Airport as the Drill Team returned home \n     to a hero's welcome.\n       A crowd of about 700 people made up of friends, family \n     members and well-wishers packed the airport to congratulate \n     the Drill Team.\n       Frederick, who almost died in a car wreck last September, \n     was full of life as she addressed the huge crowd Tuesday \n     night at the Juneau Airport.\n       ``Thank you very much from our hearts for giving us this \n     opportunity to go (to Japan)'', said Frederick, who is the \n     drill team captain. ``It was amazing and wonderful, and we \n     couldn't have done it without you.''\n       The team raised about $60,000--mostly in Juneau--to pay for \n     the trip.\n       Carrying three big trophies and a special award from \n     Nagoya's mayor, they stepped into the departure lounge from \n     the Alaska Airlines jet that brought them home.\n       The crowd cheered each team member individually, from \n     coaches Leslie Dahl and Evonne Noonan to 16 of the 20 girls \n     who competed in Japan. Four other drill team members stayed \n     in the Lower 48 on family vacations.\n       Longtime high school basketball coach Jim Hamey was one of \n     many people on the evening to remark in disbelief about the \n     team's success.\n       ``I've seen them quite a bit and they know I'm a big fan,'' \n     he said. ``They work so hard and are disciplined. The staff \n     and students at the high school are very proud of them.''\n       Hamey said whenever he's concerned about the work ethic of \n     his basketball players, he tells them to go watch the drill \n     team practice. He then joked about wishing he coached the \n     drill team after seeing the huge crowd welcoming them home at \n     the airport.\n       After being introduced as the coach of the ``best drill \n     team on the plant,'' Leslie Dahl praised the community for \n     its generosity.\n       ``The people in Japan asked us how many years it took to \n     raise the money for our trip,'' she said.\n       It took less than two months to collect the $60,000.\n       Dahl said the Japanese treated the Juneau girls ``like \n     heroes.''\n       Erin Richards said the Korean and Japanese kids followed \n     the Drill Team everywhere.\n       ``The asked me about my hobbies, kept touching my hair and \n     wanted me to sing a song,'' she explained. I sang `The Rose,' \n     by Bette Midler. They said I had beautiful eyes and that I \n     looked like a movie star.\n       ``They were the sweetest people on earth * * * it's the \n     nicest I've ever been treated by people who didn't know me.''\n       For team captain Frederick, the Japan trip was the \n     culmination of an incredible comeback.\n       She suffered 19 fractures and punctured a lung in a car \n     crash on September 6. She took 18 units of blood and was put \n     on a ventilator as she laid unconscious for several days at \n     Seattle's Harborview Medical Center.\n       Her mother Susan said the first thing her daughter talked \n     about when she came out of her coma was the drill team.\n       ``She woke up in intensive care asking if Leslie and her \n     teammates knew about the accident,'' said her mother Susan.\n       Her father David said the coaches and girls were \n     responsible for his daughter's amazing recovery.\n       ``I can't say enough things about Leslie. Evonne and the \n     girls,'' David Frederick said. They really pulled her \n     through, making her feel like she belonged to the team and \n     was needed.\n       ``There's no doubt in my mind that they made her more \n     determined to recover.''\n       ``I knew I'd be back on the drill team again,'' Jennifer \n     Frederick said Monday night. ``My coaches, my teammates, my \n     family and the community helped me get better faster.''\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.
