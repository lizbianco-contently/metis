Mr. President, as my colleagues know, we have all been \nelected to the Senate to make the difficult policy decisions that \nconfront our Federal Government. Every day on the Senate floor, we \nengage in decisionmaking that is the essence of the legislative \nprocess.\n  Some decisions that come before the Senate are rather commonplace, \nsuch as how much to spend on scientific research or whether we will \nbuild and maintain new highways or ports. Other decisions are much more \nprofound, such as who will become the next Supreme Court Justice, or \nwhether or not our Nation will go to war.\n  No decision a Senator makes it more profound than our vote on an \namendment to the Constitution. Amending the Constitution is an \nextraordinary legislative action that has occurred only a few times in \nour Nation's history.\n  The first 10 amendments, which we know as the Bill of Rights, were \nproposed and ratified almost immediately after the Constitution itself. \nIn the next 200 years, only 16 amendments were proposed by Congress and \nratified by the States.\n  This experience tells us that the balance and compromise crafted \nduring the Constitutional Convention has served us very well. We are \ngoverned by a remarkably resilient document, and it is a tribute to our \nFounding Fathers that the Constitution has been amended so \ninfrequently.\n  I am deeply concerned that the amendment we are now considering will \nupset the delicate balance of power forged during the Constitutional \nConvention of 1787. The balanced budget amendment would transfer \nfundamental spending and taxing authority from Congress to the \nexecutive branch. By this amendment, we would unravel mechanisms that \nour Founding Fathers delicately weaved into the fabric of the \nConstitution to keep the excesses of the executive, judicial, and \nlegislative branches in check. I genuinely fear that the balanced \nbudget \n [[Page S2148]] amendment would give rise to an imperial Presidency. \nAnd let us remember that domination by the Executive is what caused us \nto abandon our relationship with England and establish a great \ndemocracy.\n  During hearings convened by House and Senate committees, many \nprofessors of law and learned constitutional scholars expressed well-\nfounded concerns that, if ratified, the balanced budget amendment would \npermit the President to impose taxes or fees in order to enforce the \namendment. It would also implicitly or explicitly repeal the \nimpoundment control measures contained in the 1974 Budget Act.\n  The notion that the Executive should be allowed to impose taxes \nwithout the concurrence of Congress is a radical proposition. It \nviolates the constitutional principle that Congress alone should have \nthe power to lay and collect taxes.\n  Our Constitution is a remarkable document. As ratified by the States, \nits fundamental elements are now familiar to us all: A government \ndivided into three parts--each part separate and distinct--and each \narmed with tools to defend against the excesses of the other.\n  Yes, our Constitution has been amended over the years. We have 10 \namendments that set forth fundamental rights guaranteed to all. We have \na number of housekeeping amendments which establish the electoral \ncollege, provide for the election of Senators by popular vote, and \nestablish an orderly process in the event of the death of the \nPresident. We have amendments that secure freedom and promote universal \nsuffrage, such as the 13th, ending slavery; 14th, due process, equal \nprotection; 15th, end discrimination; and the 19th and 26th amendments, \nvote for women and 18-year-olds.\n  But none of these amendments reorders the fundamental structure of \npower and authority as would occur under the balanced budget amendment. \nThe balanced budget amendment would tilt the balance of power heavily \nin favor of the Executive, and, as I said earlier, promote an imperial \nPresidency.\n  There are those who argue that a balanced budget amendment is a good \nidea. After all, if families can balance their budgets, why cannot the \nFederal Government? Under the proposed amendment, the Federal \nGovernment would be required to balance its budget every year. The only \ntime a deficit could occur would be during time of war, or when three-\nfifths of the House and Senate agree. While it sounds easy, there \nremains a glaring problem with such a simplistic approach to reducing \nthe Nation's debt. What programs would Congress cut to achieve a \nbalanced budget by the year 2002, the date on which the amendment would \ngo into effect? What Federal agencies would have their budgets\n slashed in order to help the Federal Government meet the requirements \nof the balanced budget amendment?\n\n  Estimates by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office call for \nspending cuts totaling $1.5 trillion by the year 2002. CBO also \npredicts that if Social Security and defense are exempted from the \nbalanced budget numbers then all other Federal programs would be cut \nacross the board by 30 percent. That of course, is assuming that all \ncuts are equal and that partisanship is left out of the mix.\n  Although I wholeheartedly support and endorse efforts to balance the \nFederal budget, I am greatly concerned that the $1.5 trillion in \nspending cuts needed to meet the goals of a balanced budget amendment \nby the year 2002 would have a devastating impact on a wide segment of \nour population. Supporters of the resolution fail to explain where \nthese tremendous budget cuts would fall. Without assurances that \nFederal agencies and programs would be equitably affected, such a plan \nis unworkable.\n  I strongly back Democratic leader Daschle's amendment that would \nrequire Congress to pass an honest, detailed plan to balance the budget \nbefore the balanced budget constitutional amendment goes to States for \nratification. It is irresponsible for us to vote on an amendment \nrequiring a balanced budget which would necessitate draconian budget \ncuts without knowing what we would be cutting and how. We need to know. \nThe American people have the right to know.\n  Let me mention a few more aspects of this balanced budget amendment \nthat concern me. A constitutional amendment to balance the Federal \nbudget could damage the economy more than strengthen it. Greater \namounts of deficit cutting would be required in periods of slow growth \nthan in times of rapid growth--an action which economists predict would \nresult in more frequent and deeper recessions.\n  Such an amendment could also limit public investments that are \ncritical to long-term growth because the amendment makes no distinction \nbetween investments such as education and training and early \nintervention programs for children, and other types of government \nspending. These investments are necessary to ensure the Nation's \ncompetitiveness and help the economy grow.\n  Because the amendment calls for a balanced budget every year, \nregardless of whether economic growth is strong or weak, larger \nspending cuts or tax increases would be needed in periods of slow \ngrowth than in times of rapid growth, further exacerbating an already \ncrippled economy.\n  Mr. President, I know we will have ample time to debate this issue \nfurther, and I look forward to the ensuing debate.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/06/senate-section/article/S2147-7", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2148-S2149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n        ALAN EMORY, DEAN OF WASHINGTON-BASED NEW YORK REPORTERS\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the dean of \nWashington based New York reporters, Alan Emory. Mr. Emory, a writer \nfor the Watertown Daily Times, has been covering Washington for the \nlast 43 years. His personal style and fabled wisdom have allowed Mr. \nEmory to provide his readers in upstate New York with a window to \nWashington.\n  Deemed a small town by some, Watertown's success stories include \nthree former Secretaries of State: John Foster, John Foster Dulles, and \nRobert Lansing. Other notable Watertown residents included Roswell P. \nFlower, former Governor of New York State; and Frank Woolworth, founder \nof the five-and-dime store.\n  Having been voted president of the prestigious Gridiron Club in \nrecognition of his many years of reporting excellence, Mr. Emory now \njoins the list of celebrated Watertown residents. Alan Emory was sent \nto Washington in 1952 when his distinguished publisher, John B. \nJohnson, decided to give his readers more for their money. He has \ncertainly done that. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an \narticle from the Watertown Daily Times celebrating Mr. Emory's \naccomplishments and years of service be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Watertown Daily Times, Jan. 29, 1995]\n\n                Alan Emory, Dean of Washington Reporters\n\n       (The following article by Jonathan D. Salant is reprinted \n     by permission from the January edition of Empire State \n     Report.)\n       At one of U.S. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan's infrequent \n     gatherings for the Washington press corps from New York \n     newspapers, a New York Times reporter attempted to sit in the \n     front row.\n       ``No, no, no,'' Moynihan sputters. ``That's the dean's \n     seat.''\n       The ``dean'' in this case refers to Alan Emory, the 72-\n     year-old correspondent for The Watertown Daily Times. Most of \n     the reporters who join Emory weren't born when he came to \n     Washington 43 years ago, the result of an effort by his \n     publisher to give the readers something more in exchange for \n     a price hike. The rest of the New York press corps watches \n     Emory take his seat in front and pour a cup of coffee for the \n     senator. They sit silent deferentially to allow Emory to ask \n     the first question, much as the senior wire service reporter \n     opens presidential news conferences.\n       Emory began covering Washington before Moynihan, who later \n     served in the administration of four presidents, began his \n     career in public service as an aide to then-Gov. Averell \n     Harriman. Emory has covered Govs. Thomas Dewey, Harriman, \n     Nelson Rockefeller, Malcolm Wilson, Hugh Carey and Mario \n     Cuomo. He has covered Sens. Irving Ives, Kenneth Keating, \n     Jacob Javits, Robert Kennedy, Charles Goodell, James Buckley, \n     Alfonse D'Amato and Moynihan.\n       Emory has reported on the administration of Harry Truman, \n     Dwight Eisenhower, John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Richard \n     Nixon, \n      [[Page S2149]] Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and \n     George Bush.\n       Come March, he'll be dining with Bill Clinton.\n       ``It's a very exciting prospect,'' Emory says.\n       In December, Emory was elected president of the Gridiron \n     Club, an association of powerful Washington journalists. Some \n     of his predecessors include David Broder, Helen Thomas, Carl \n     Rowan and Jack Germond. Emory says he can't remember another \n     reporter from a small newspaper being elected club president.\n       Each March, the Gridiron Club holds an ultra-exclusive \n     white-tie dinner featuring the president, his cabinet, and \n     most of Washington's top public officials and politicians. \n     Like the Legislative Correspondents Association's annual show \n     in Albany, the Washington reporters write parodies poking fun \n     at Republicans and Democrats alike. As club president, Emory \n     gets to dine with Clinton and must keep an eye on him \n     throughout the show, the better to report back to the \n     membership on how he reacted to the skits.\n       Clinton gets to deliver a rebuttal following the show. Next \n     year's speakers also include Moynihan and former Education \n     Secretary Bill Bennett.\n       It's been a long journey between dinner with the president \n     and Watertown, where Emory first was hired in 1947 after \n     graduating from Columbia University with a master's degree in \n     journalism. (He attended Harvard University as an \n     undergraduate.)\n       Emory was covering the Dewey administration in Albany when \n     his publisher, John B. Johnson, called him in August 1951.\n       ``We're going to raise the price of the paper. We owe the \n     readers something,'' Emory recalls Johnson telling him. ``How \n     would you like to go to Washington?''\n       Emory jumped at the chance. He and his wife, Nancy, packed \n     up and moved south. Shortly after arriving in Washington, \n     they found a house on a lake in a Virginia suburb. They've \n     been there ever since, raising three children. They now have \n     four grandchildren as well.\n       He's traveled with presidents, covered the White House, and \n     written on foreign affairs. But his bread-and-butter is the \n     local, day-to-day coverage of New York affairs in Washington. \n     The congressional delegation. The St. Lawrence Seaway. The \n     state lobbying office. Politics. Federal decisions as they \n     affect the Empire State.\n       The New York connection has served Emory well. At the 1960 \n     Republican National Convention, Emory got there a few days \n     early and hung out with aides to then-New York Gov. Nelson \n     Rockefeller. They told him that Rockefeller was not going to \n     be nominated for president against Richard Nixon. A national \n     scoop.\n       ``I got the story long, long before anyone else even came \n     close to it,'' Emory says.\n       Likewise, at the 1968 Republican convention, while waiting \n     to interview with William Miller, the former upstate New York \n     congressman who was Barry Goldwater's running mate four years \n     earlier, Emory found a poll that showed Nixon being more \n     popular than Rockefeller in New York. The two men were \n     competing for the 1968 Republican presidential nomination. \n     Emory gave his story to the Nixon folks with the stipulation \n     that they agree to credit his newspaper if they used the \n     information. Sure enough, there was Nixon a few days later, \n     quoting the Watertown Daily Times.\n       Emory spends much of this time chronicling the Watertown-\n     area congressman, John McHugh, R-Pierrepont Manor. McHugh was \n     3 years old when Emory first went to Washington.\n       ``I took my first lessons about politics from Alan Emory's \n     column,'' McHugh says. ``I've read about his experiences and \n     his observations. I finally had a chance to meet with him \n     face-to-face and work with him. It was a thrill for me. To \n     most people in the north country, Alan Emory is our window on \n     the Capitol.''\n       Many regional reporters in Washington move on to greener \n     pastures. They land jobs at larger papers or enter the \n     government. Emory says he has never tired of his job or the \n     Watertown paper. He once had a shot at a bigger paper, but it \n     fell through. Otherwise, he says, he's never wanted to leave.\n       ``Watertown treats me like a member of the family,'' he \n     says. He goes on vacation when he wants. He has the time to \n     do projects like Gridiron. The paper was very supportive when \n     he underwent cancer treatment a few years back.\n       One of Emory's friends, Allan Cromley of the Daily \n     Oklahoman, walks by. ``Don't believe a word he says,'' \n     Cromley says. Emory smiles and goes on.\n       ``When people play up to the big metropolitan papers, \n     there's that frustration,'' Emory says. ``But there's a \n     counterweight that comes if you luck into somebody from your \n     neck of the woods who gets way up there.''\n       Eisenhower's press secretary, Jim Haggerty, used to work \n     for Dewey. Nixon's secretary of state, William Rogers, was a \n     native of St. Lawrence County. Former Central Intelligence \n     Agency chief Allan Dulles was a Watertown native. All became \n     sources for Emory.\n       Others from the north country have passed through. Former \n     state Sen. Douglas Barclay of Pulaski chaired President \n     Bush's upstate campaign in 1988 and was named to the Overseas \n     Private Investment Corporation. Former north country Rep. \n     Robert McEwen was appointed by President Reagan to one of the \n     joint U.S.-Canadian commissions. Former Assistance Education \n     Secretary Donald Laidlaw was an Ogdensburg native.\n       Another official, former Republican National Committee \n     Executive Director Albert (Ab) Herman, had played \n     professional baseball in Watertown. Emory wrote a story about \n     him, and Herman began hearing from old friends long \n     forgotten. ``He was a fabulous political source from then \n     on,'' Emory recalls.\n       In the 1950s, the federal government used to publish a book \n     listing the home congressional district of numerous federal \n     workers. Anyone hailing from the north country's \n     congressional district could expect a call from Emory.\n       ``I would leaf through that book, call them up and do \n     interviews,'' Emory says. ``These people nobody had every \n     been in touch with before. They started getting mail from old \n     neighbors who saw their write-ups in The Watertown Daily \n     Times. Also, it gave me all kinds of contacts. If the \n     individual didn't have the answer, he could lead me to \n     someone who did.''\n       A U.S. senator named Hubert Horatio Humphrey became a \n     source as well. Humphrey and Emory's mother, Ethel Epstein, \n     served together on the board of the liberal Americans for \n     Democratic Action.\n       Emory lists Humphrey and former Michigan U.S. Sen. Philip \n     Hart as his two favorite politicians. He came to know Hart \n     after an aide to New York U.S. Sen. Herbert Lehman joined the \n     Michigan senator's staff.\n       Among contemporary politicians, it is Cuomo, who Emory \n     landed as the speaker for the 1988 Gridiron show, who is his \n     favorite. Cuomo sent him a note a couple of years back for \n     his 70th birthday.\n       Had Cuomo run for president, he might have been the chief \n     executive accompanying Emory to the Gridiron dinner next \n     March. But Emory says he's not surprised Cuomo never went for \n     the White House.\n       ``I was never totally convinced that he wanted to undergo \n     the battle,'' Emory says. ``He would have loved to be \n     president but he would have hated to be a candidate.''\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/06/senate-section/article/S2148-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2149-S2150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n    UNITED STATES TRADE SANCTIONS ON THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, over the weekend the administration \nannounced its decision to impose trade sanctions beginning on February \n26 on the People's Republic of China in retaliation for the latter's \ndismal failure in safeguarding U.S. intellectual property rights. As \nthe chairman of the Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs, I \nfully support that decision.\n  Since 1992, the PRC has failed to live up to its obligations under \nthe Memorandum of Understanding on Intellectual Property Rights. \nFactories throughout China, especially in the southern and eastern \nprovinces, continue to mass-produce pirated versions of American \ncomputer software, compact discs, CD-ROM's, and video and audio \ncassettes mostly for sale abroad. The USTR estimates that piracy of \naudio-visual works runs close to 100 percent, while piracy of other \ntechnological items such as computer software runs around 94 to 100 \npercent. In addition, piracy of trademarks is rampant.\n  This piracy is much more than a minor nuisance. The sale of these \npirated items has cost U.S. businesses more than $1 billion, a sum \nwhich threatens to increase exponentially as the number of pirated \nproducts swells. It endangers American jobs, as well as our primacy in \nsoftware innovation.\n  What makes the manufacture of these illegal goods even more galling, \nhowever, is the fact that their production is tolerated, if not \nactively encouraged in some instances, by Chinese municipal and \nprovincial governments as well as the central authorities in Beijing. \nThe USTR has complained repeatedly about the problem and United States-\nChina negotiators have been meeting for more than a year and a half in \nan effort to resolve it. Still, the Chinese refuse to stem the flow of \nthese goods out of the PRC.\n  Certainly, the Government cannot claim ignorance of the problem. Even \nif the USTR had not been so thorough in documenting the problem, this \nis hardly a case of a few small ``mom-and-pop'' concerns operating \ncovertly in an open, unregulated economy. Rather, these are large \nfactories--some, enterprises run by governmental entities such as the \nPeople's Liberation Army--operating in a Communist country with an \neconomy that is still largely command-based. The likelihood that, for \nexample, the estimated 75 million compact discs produced illegally in \nChina each year--of which 70 million are exported--could escape the \nattention of the government is about nil.\n  [[Page S2150]] Mr. President, I realize that this is an especially \nsensitive time in Sino-American relations, and that this is not the \nonly thorny issue with which we are presently grappling. Human rights \nissues, trade barriers, Taiwan, the proliferation of weapons to such \nrogue nations as Iran all complicate our relationship. What's more, \nwith an ailing Deng Xiaoping apparently no longer in complete control \nof the party or the government, and the hold of Jiang Zemin and Li Peng \non the reins of power less than firm, we face a possibility that taking \na strong stand on any of these issues with the Chinese could aid in \nbringing in power reactionary hardliners inimical to a beneficial \nrelationship between our two countries.\n  Despite this concern, I believe that the time has come to take a firm \nstand with the PRC on this issue. In the 1960's, Mao Zedong was fond of \nreferring to the United States as a ``paper tiger,'' a fierce \ncountenance but no substance to back it up. In Wyoming we'd say ``all \nbark and no bite.'' In my view we have, unfortunately, all too often \nlived up to that assessment. It is hardly in our own interest to be \nperceived as a paper tiger on this issue. Intellectual property is one \nof the fastest growing areas of the world economy. The PRC is not the \nonly country we are having this problem with: Brazil, India, and others \nare sources for concern with the USTR. By taking a firm position now \nwith the Chinese, I believe we help head off similar problems elsewhere \nin the future.\n  While I will be the first to acknowledge the importance and \ndesirability of a strong relationship--both diplomatically and \neconomically--with the PRC, such a relationship should not be built at \nthe expense of America's businesses, or America's reputation for \nresolve. This administration, I believe, has been too quick to hold us \nhostage in the present in favor of the mere expectancy of an economic \nbenefit in the future.\n  Later this week, I will be meeting with Ambassador Li Daoyu. While I \nintend to reaffirm with him our desire to maintain a strong \nrelationship with Beijing, I also hope to discuss the importance of \nresolving this issue before advances can be made on other fronts. I \nsupport free trade, as long as it is fair trade. In my view, a failure \non the part of the PRC to do so would indicate to me they do not desire \na level playing field. Consequently, I would be hard pressed to \ncontinue to support the present trade relationship with the PRC.\n  Mr. President, the Chinese have a saying: ``Either the East Wind \nprevails over the West Wind, or the West Wind prevails over the East \nWind.'' It seems to me, though, that we should both strive for that \npreferred state where neither wind blows: Calm.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/06/senate-section/article/S2149-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE? THE VOTERS HAVE SAID YES\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I doubt that there have been many, if any, \ncandidates for the Senate who have not pledged to do something about \nthe enormous Federal debt run up by the Congress during the past half-\ncentury or more. But Congress, both House and Senate, have never up to \nnow even toned down the deficit spending that sent the Federal debt \ninto the stratosphere and beyond.\n  We must pray that this year will be different, that Federal spending \nwill at long last be reduced drastically. Indeed, if we care about \nAmerica's future, there must be some changes.\n  You see, Mr. President, as of the close of business Friday, February \n3, the Federal debt stood--down to the penny--at exactly \n$4,804,726,503,001.28. This means that on a per capita basis, every \nman, woman, and child in America owes $18,238.82 as his or her share of \nthe Federal debt.\n  Compare this, Mr. President, to the total debt a little over 2 years \nago--January 5, 1993--when the debt stood at exactly \n$4,167,872,986,583.67--or averaged out, $15,986.56 for every American. \nDuring the past 2 years--that is, during the 103d Congress--the Federal \ndebt increased over $600 billion.\n  This illustrates, Mr. President, the point that so many politicians \ntalk a good game, at home, about bringing the Federal debt under \ncontrol, but vote in support of bloated spending bills when they get \nback to Washington. If the Republicans do not do a better job of \ngetting a handle on this enormous debt, their constituents are not \nlikely to overlook it 2 years hence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/06/senate-section/article/S2150-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                COMMENDING THE CHOIR OF ST.

Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the recent 100 \nyear birthday of Lanett, AL, a small textile city located on the bluffs \nof the Chattahoochee River in Chambers County. Lanett--named for Mr. \nLafayette Lanier, an early councilman and president of West Point \nManufacturing Co., and Mr. Theodore Bennett, a Bostonian who served as \nthe selling agent for West Point Manufacturing Co.--is a town rich with \nhistory.\n  On December 7, 1865, the Alabama Legislature convened in general \nassembly and passed the act of incorporation for the town of Bluffton, \nAL. Twenty-eight years later, a new charter was sought. Bluffton had \ngrown, and the citizens of the town deemed it appropriate to change the \ntown's name. On February 1, 1895, a charter for the newly named town of \nLanett was approved by the State legislature.\n  The new charter provided means by which the town clerk could assess \ntaxes and sell property of delinquent taxpayers after a proper \nnotification. Police were given jurisdiction over areas 1 mile beyond \nthe town boundaries. Road and street work, which previously was \ndemanded of every male over the age of 18, could now be exempted upon \npayment of a $3-a-year street tax.\n  The city of Lanett struggled in its infancy for financial survival. \nEarly records show the city had to borrow money at 8 percent interest \nin order to pay its bills. Happily, in the year of 1902, the treasurer \nreported for the first time that income exceeded the town's debts and \nthat there was even a balance on hand at year's end.\n  Other problems beset the first few years of Lanett. The smallpox \nepidemic of 1903 had a grave impact on the city. Dr. S.H. Newman was \npaid $10 a year by the city to treat the patients. After a long bout \nwith this disease, a fumigation and vaccination program was begun.\n  The city of Lanett has come a long way over the past 100 years. \nToday, it is a healthy city of over 9,000 residents. It owns and \noperates its own electrical, natural gas, water, an sewage treatment \nsystems. It has a street department and collects its own garbage. \nFurthermore, it has one of the most modern police, fire and emergency \nmedical service departments in the State. As you can see, Mr. \nPresident, Lanett has a lot going for it.\n  The centennial celebration committee has chosen as its theme, \n``Remembering the past as we prepare for the future.'' Mr. President, I \nbelieve that \n [[Page S2151]] Lanett, AL, is evidence that small town America is \nalive and well.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/06/senate-section/article/S2150-3", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n              VOLUNTARY SCHOOL PRAYER: IT MUST BE RESTORED\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the U.S. Senate, since the inception of the \n104th Congress, has thus far participated in two significant debates. \nThe first determined the role of the Federal Government in the affairs \nof the States; and the second will decide whether, after decades of \ninsane spending of the American taxpayers' money, the U.S. Congress \nwill finally get around to controlling itself with a balanced budget \namendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n  All of us should recognize the importance of these significant \nissues. Certainly, I do. However, one wonders whether liberal \npoliticians, who time after time have beaten back attempts to restore \nmoral and spiritual principles to our society, are not content for \nCongress to focus its attention on the Nation's economic woes while \nspiritual issues--for example, protecting unborn life and restoring \nschool prayer--are being sidetracked with harsh rhetoric such as \nextreme, worthless, and insignificant.\n  Mr. President, lest our leftward-tilted friends become too satisfied \nwith the neglect of religious and spiritual values in America, they \nshould be reminded of what our Nation's first President acknowledged--\nand what so many in Congress have disregarded--that our Nation's \nmaterial and spiritual wealth is bestowed by the Creator only when we \nseek His guidance in our Nation's affairs. George Washington stated:\n\n       * * * the propitious smiles of heaven can never be expected \n     on a nation which disregards the eternal rules of order and \n     right which heaven itself has ordained.\n\n  Mr. President, in 1962, the Supreme Court forfeited by judicial fiat \nthe rights of millions of American children to invoke in their schools \nthe blessings and guidance of God. Consequently, this act begat a \npopular culture, the values, discipline, and moral standards of which \nare devoid of God and laden with relativism. A greater crime against \nour children could hardly be conceived.\n  Today, all of us should take note of the desperate need to return to \nour Nation's children their constitutional right to voluntary prayer in \nthe\n public schools. In this regard, a guest column published by the \nCharlotte (N.C.) Observer and authored by Dr. Norman Geisler, dean of \nSouthern Evangelical Seminary in Charlotte, NC, is very worthy of broad \nconsideration. Dr. Geisler titled it ``10 Reasons for Voluntary School \nPrayer.''\n\n  Dr. Geisler is a foremost theologian as evidenced by his impressive \ncatalog of degrees and achievements. He has lectured and traveled in 50 \nStates and 24 countries on 6 continents. Dr. Geisler has been honored \nand listed in many leading publications including ``The Who's Who in \nReligion,'' ``The Writer's Who's Who,'' and ``Men of Achievement.'' He \nhas authored or coauthored 45 books on a wide range of social, moral, \nand religious issues.\n  Mr. President, I fervently hope that all Senators will spend a few \nminutes reading Dr. Geisler's convincing defense of the right of \nchildren to pray in public schools. His defense of one of our Founding \nFather's rule(s) of heaven has never been more needed nor more \neloquently stated.\n  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that the January 30 guest \ncolumn in the Charlotte Observer, ``10 Reasons for Voluntary School \nPrayer,'' be printed in the Record.\n\n              [From the Charlotte Observer, Jan. 30, 1995]\n\n                 10 Reasons for Voluntary School Prayer\n\n                         (By Norman L. Geisler]\n\n       There are many good reasons for a constitutional amendment \n     to permit voluntary prayer in the public schools. Ten come to \n     mind.\n       1. Our government was based on religious principles from \n     the very beginning: The Declaration of Independence says: \n     ``We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are \n     created equal, that they are endowed by God with certain \n     unalienable rights . . . .'' Indeed, it speaks of God, \n     creation, God-given moral rights, the providence of God, and \n     a final Day of Judgment--all of which are religious \n     teachings. Indeed, the Supreme Court affirmed (Zorach, 1952) \n     that ``We are a religious people whose institutions \n     presuppose a Supreme Being.'' And school prayer has been an \n     important part of our religious experience from the very \n     beginning.\n       2. The First Amendment does not separate God and government \n     but actually encourages religion. It reads: ``Congress shall \n     make no law respecting the establishment of religion, nor \n     prohibiting the free exercise thereof.'' The first clause \n     merely declares that the federal government cannot establish \n     one religion for all the people. It says nothing about \n     ``separation of church and state.'' In fact, five of the 13 \n     states that ratified it had their own state religions at the \n     time. The second clause insists that the government should do \n     nothing to discourage religion. But forbidding prayer in \n     schools discourages religion.\n       3. Early congressional actions encouraged religion in \n     public schools. For example, the Northwest Treaty (1787 and \n     1789) declared: ``Religion, morality, and knowledge being \n     necessary for good government and the happiness of mankind, \n     schools and the means of learning shall forever be \n     encouraged.'' Thus, religion, which includes prayer, was \n     deemed to be necessary.\n\n\n                      presidents encouraged prayer\n\n       4. Early presidents, with congressional approval, made \n     proclamations encouraging public prayer. President Washington \n     on Oct. 3, 1789, declared: ``Whereas it is the duty of all \n     nations to acknowledge the providence of Almighty God, to \n     obey His will, to be grateful for His benefits, and humbly to \n     implore His protection and favour, and Whereas both Houses of \n     Congress have, by their joint committee, requested me `to \n     recommend to the people of the United States a day of public \n     thanksgiving and prayer. . . .'''\n       5. Congress has prayed at the opening of every session \n     since the very beginning. Indeed, in a moment of crisis at \n     the very first Continental Congress Benjamin Franklin urged \n     prayer and observed that ``In the beginning of the Contest \n     with G. Britain, when we were sensible to danger, we had \n     daily prayer in this room for Divine protection.--Our \n     prayers, Sir, were heard, & they were graciously answered. . \n     . . And have we now forgotten that powerful Friend? or do we \n     imagine we no longer need His assistance? . . . I therefore \n     beg leave to move--that henceforth prayer imploring the \n     assistance of Heaven, and its blessing on our deliberations, \n     be held in this Assembly every morning before we proceed to \n     business, and that one or more of the clergy of this city be \n     requested to officiate in that service.'' Congress has begun \n     with prayer ever since. If the government can pray in their \n     session, why can't the governed pray in their (school) \n     sessions?\n       6. Public schools had prayer for nearly 200 years before \n     the Supreme Court ruled that state-mandated class prayers \n     were unconstitutional (Engel, 1962). The fact that prayer was \n     practiced for nearly 200 years establishes it by precedent as \n     a valid and beneficial practice in our schools.\n       7. Since the court outlawed prayer, the nation has been in \n     steady moral decline. Former Secretary of Education William \n     Bennett revealed in his cultural indexes that between 1960 \n     and 1990 there was a steady moral decline. During this period \n     divorce doubled, teenage pregnancy went up 200%, teen suicide \n     increased 300%, child abuse reached an all-time high, violent \n     crime went up 500% and abortion increased 1000%. There is a \n     strong correlation between the expulsion of prayer from our \n     schools and the decline in morality.\n       8. Morals must be taught, and they cannot properly be \n     taught without religion. There cannot be a moral law without \n     a moral Law Giver. And there is no motivation for keeping the \n     moral law unless there is a moral Law Giver who can enforce \n     it by rewards and punishments.\n\n\n                      secular humanism established\n\n       9. Forbidding prayer and other religious expressions in \n     public schools establishes, in effect, the religion of \n     secularism.\n       The Supreme Court has affirmed that there are religions, \n     such as ``secular humanism,'' which do not believe in God \n     (Torcaso, 1961). Justice Potter (Abington, 1963) rightly \n     feared that purging the schools of all religious beliefs and \n     practices would lead to the ``establishment of a religion of \n     secularism.'' In fact, the beliefs of secular humanism are \n     just the opposite of the Declaration of Independence. By not \n     allowing theistic religious expressions, the courts have \n     favored the religious beliefs of secular humanism, namely, no \n     belief in God, God-given moral laws, prayer and a Day of \n     Judgment.\n       10. To forbid the majority the right to pray because the \n     minority object, is to impose the irreligion of the minority \n     on the religious majority. Forbidding prayer in schools, \n     which a three-quarters majority of Americans favors, is the \n     tyranny of the minority. It is minority rule, not democracy. \n     Why should an irreligious minority dictate what the majority \n     can do? The majority wishes to preserve our moral and \n     spiritual values and, thus, our good nation.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/06/senate-section/article/S2151-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2151-S2156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  ``MEET THE PRESS''--FEBRUARY 5, 1995\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

The date: December \n     2nd, 1951.\n       And joining me in the questioning today, Lisa Myers of NBC \n     News and Robert Novak of the Chicago Sun-Times. And with us \n     now, Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat from West Virginia.\n       Senator, welcome back to Meet the Press.\n       Senator Byrd. Thank you.\n       Mr. Russert. We have a $200 billion deficit, a $4 trillion \n     debt. Why wouldn't you be for a law forcing Congress to \n     balance the budget?\n       Senator Byrd. You say, ``for a law.'' This is not a law. \n     This amendment will amend the basic organic law of this \n     country, which is above an ordinary statute. There are two \n     reasons it's in the main: It is bad constitutional policy and \n     it is bad economic policy. As to its being bad constitutional \n     policy, the Constitution is a charter of government. It is a \n     charter of certain basic, individual rights. It is decidedly \n     not a charter of economic policy, and for the first time, if \n     this amendment were adopted, it would be writing into the \n     Constitution economic policy.\n       Also, this amendment would interfere with the majoritarian \n     democratic control of the Congress. It would institute \n     minority rule by imposing supermajorities, supermajority \n     requirements on the development of fiscal policy. It would \n     also tamper with all three parts of the tri-part \n     constitutional structure of government that was set into \n     place by the framers 206 years ago.\n       As to its being bad economic policy, it would severely \n     damage the Nation's ability to develop a sane, sensible \n     fiscal policy. It would cripple efforts to stabilize the \n     business cycle in that it would create a severe fiscal drag \n     on the economy at a time when the economy may already be \n     weak.\n       It would hamper the capacity of the nation to make long-\n     term investments in fiscal and human infrastructure. It would \n     make it almost impossible for our nation to coordinate its \n     economic policy with the economic policies of other nations. \n     Moreover, it would put into the hands of the courts the \n     management of macroeconomic policy. And finally, it would be \n     devastating for a group such as the elderly. It would \n     devastate Medicare, other programs that aid the elderly such \n     as Meals on Wheels, veterans' programs, veterans' pensions, \n     veterans' compensation, veterans' health care, and it would \n     also\n      be very destructive of environmental policy and other social \n     policies which the nation--which are good for the nation \n     and good for its people.\n       Mr. Russert. Senator----\n       Senator Byrd. So these in the main are the fears that I \n     have concerning this amendment. Now if it didn't do any of \n     these--if it didn't do any of these, it would mean that it \n     does nothing, in which case it would be but an empty promise \n     in the Constitution, and that would undermine the faith of \n     the American people and the Constitution.\n       Mr. Russert. Senator Dole, our next guest, said that \n     there'll be a vote within the next three weeks on the \n     balanced budget amendment. Will there be?\n       Senator Byrd. I hope we'll not rush this matter. Sixty-\n     eight percent of the Republicans, 77 percent of the Democrats \n     and 83 percent of the Independents feel that the American \n     people ought to know what's in this amendment before we adopt \n     it. It takes time, and I hope that Mr. Dole will give the \n     Senate time to inform the American people. Woodrow Wilson \n     said that the informing function of the legislative branch \n     was as important as the legislative function.\n       The American people don't know what's in this measure, and \n     we senators who vote on it ought to also be told what the \n     plan is, what the details are for achieving a balanced budget \n     in seven years. The American people are entitled to that.\n       The American people are smart consumers. When they go to \n     the store, they press and squeeze the tomatoes and the \n     cantaloupes and the vegetables; they look under the hood when \n     they buy a car, they kick the tires. They need to know what's \n     in this amendment. They're entitled to know. We shouldn't \n     distrust them. We shouldn't treat them like children, and we \n     should let them know what's under the hood. They want to know \n     that.\n       Mr. Russert. Do you have the 34 votes necessary to block \n     the amendment as of now?\n       Senator Byrd. It's a very close call right now. It could go \n     either way, but I believe that if the American people are \n     informed as to what's in this plan, they're going to be so \n     concerned that, ``the knees of senators will buckle,'' in the \n     words of one of the House leaders. So I think the American \n     people are entitled to know, and we're treating them like \n     children if we don't tell them.\n       Mr. Russert. Will you use every tactic you know to stop \n     this?\n       Senator Byrd. I'm glad you asked me that. I'm not \n     interested in dilatory tactics. I'm only interested in the \n     American people having the information that they ought to \n     have. And I hope that we would debate this sufficiently for \n     them to be informed. And I believe that Mr. Dole, the \n     majority leader--and he's a very capable majority leader; I'm \n     very fond of him--I hope that he will give the Senate ample \n     opportunity to debate this matter so that the American \n     people, who send us here, will be informed.\n       Mr. Russert. What's ample opportunity? Weeks, months?\n       Senator Byrd. We've got to remember that the constitutional \n     convention met behind closed doors. It met for almost four \n     months to write this Constitution. Now surely we shouldn't be \n     in a hurry to vote on something that is going to deliver \n     irreparable injuries to the basic organic document. It would \n     seem to me that anything less than 3 weeks for debate--from 3 \n     to 4 or 5 weeks ought to be sufficient time in which to \n     inform the American people and inform ourselves. We're \n     entitled to know what the details are of the plan which would \n     achieve this goal.\n       Mr. Russert. Are you concerned, Senator, that by putting \n     forth the Democratic Party as the party that blocks a \n     constitutional amendment, you're going to give the \n     Republicans a huge political issue in the presidential race \n     in '96?\n       Senator Byrd. I'm not concerned in this instance so much \n     about party as I am about the Constitution of the United \n     States. And what this amendment will do to the institutions \n     of government, the three branches of the government--it will \n     impact on the executive, on the judiciary and on the \n     legislative. And it will change forever. It's not like a \n     statute which can be repealed later in the same year by the \n     Congress. It's an amendment which will change the \n     Constitution we'll be delivering to our children, a \n     Constitution that is far different from the one which was \n     handed down to us by our forefathers.\n       Mr. Russert. Lisa.\n       Ms. Myers. Senator, you have said that this amendment would \n     mean radical changes in people's lives, that it would be \n     devastating to the elderly, to the environment, to veterans, \n     to a whole series of people. What about the devastation to \n     your five grandchildren, though, of continuing to pile up \n     these mountains of debt? Aren't these deficits that we're \n     running today tantamount to stealing from them?\n       Senator Byrd. I agree that we have to do something about \n     the deficits. We have to reduce them, and we have done \n     something. I think we ought to stay on a steady, strong \n     course such as the one we set in 1990 at the budget summit \n     when we passed a bill that would reduce the deficits by $482 \n     billion over five years, and again in 1993 when we passed a \n     package with President Clinton's help that would reduce the \n     deficit over $432 billion over the next five years, and it \n     has done better than that.\n       And remember this, that in the case of the 1993 budget \n     deficit reduction package, not one Republican in the Senate, \n     not one Republican in the House, voted for that budget \n     reduction package because it increased taxes some and it cut \n     programs and it inflicted some pain. Now that's the course we \n     should stay on: additional multifaceted budget deficit bills. \n     And let's don't tamper with the Constitution, because I don't \n     want to pass a Constitution on to my children that is a \n     different Constitution, providing for a different form of \n     government, than we have had in our time.\n       Ms. Myers. Senator, President Clinton is sending up a \n     budget tomorrow which projects $200 billion deficits as far \n     as the eye can see, at least for the next decade. How soon \n     are you willing to commit to balance the budget?\n       Senator Byrd. I began my commitment in 1990 at the budget \n     summit under Mr. Bush and under a Democratic Congress. I \n     continued my commitment in 1993 with the deficit reduction \n     package that I've already described. We ought to stay on that \n     course.\n       I'm concerned about the President's budget which will be \n     sent to the Congress tomorrow. I'm not in favor of the $63 \n     billion tax cut over a period of the next five years. I'm \n     also not in favor of the $205 billion tax cut which is in the \n     so-called Contract With America. I think we shouldn't be \n     cutting taxes now. I must say that Mr. Clinton is going to \n     pay for his tax cut with reductions in programs. But the \n     monies that are saved from reductions in programs ought to go \n     toward balancing the budget and reducing the deficit.\n       Now as to the Contract With America, let me tell you what \n     my contract is. There's my \n      [[Page S2153]] contract with America. This is the \n     Constitution of the United States of America. That's the only \n     contract I have with America. That contract was written 206 \n     years ago. It didn't suddenly bloom in the last election. So \n     I'm concerned about these proposed tax cuts. I think it's \n     folly at a time like this when we ought to be doing \n     everything we can to reduce the deficit to be talking about \n     cutting taxes.\n       Ms. Myers. Senator, one last thing. The Washington Post--\n     I'm sure you're familiar with this headline--has called you \n     ``the king of pork.'' Given your commitment to balance the \n     budget, are you now willing to tell the people of West \n     Virginia that they're going to have to settle for less?\n       Senator Byrd. I took an oath to uphold the Constitution of \n     the United States 13 times in the last 48 years. I took that \n     oath, I swore to God and I put my hands on God's Gospel when \n     I did it. Now I am of a generation that believes in keeping \n     one's oath. I'm talking about my oath to the Constitution in \n     this situation here. I'm talking about this immortal document \n     that was written by men. And I think it's somewhat a pretense \n     for those of us in our generation to assume that we're wiser \n     than the framers of that constitutional document who lived \n     200 years ago.\n       Mr. Novak. Senator Byrd, tomorrow the House of \n     Representatives will pass a line item veto which would give \n     the president authority to veto individual items in bills \n     instead of the whole bills. You oppose that. Now you have \n     said that when Robert Byrd does a filibuster in the Senate, \n     you will make it clear that it is a filibuster. Are you ready \n     to filibuster the line item veto?\n       Senator Byrd. Bob, there are people in this town who \n     wouldn't know a filibuster if they met it on the street. I \n     don't intend to engage in dilatory tactics, dilatory quorum \n     calls and so on. Now that's the way of the old filibuster. \n     But there is such a thing as an unlimited debate, and that's \n     one of the two things in particular that makes the Senate the \n     premier upper body in the world today, the right of unlimited \n     debate and the right to amend. Now we owe it to the American \n     people to debate these matters.\n       There are people, I think, who have the attitude, it seems \n     to me, that if we debate a bill three days or a week or two \n     weeks, that we're filibustering. Now a line item veto, again, \n     would shift power from the legislative branch to the \n     president. It disturbs the balances of powers, the separation \n     of powers, the checks and balances in the Constitution. And \n     we ought not to alter that Constitution lightly. So I will \n     fight that, again, as I have fought it before. But I don't \n     intend to engage in dilatory tactics, that kind of \n     filibuster.\n       Mr. Novak. Senator Byrd, you have also said that you \n     thought perhaps the Republicans, who have been in opposition \n     in the minority much more than the Democrats, know how to be \n     a minority party more in the Senate. Are you attempting to \n     guide the new Democratic leader, Senator Thomas Daschle, in \n     how to be an opposition party, because at times you seem more \n     like the opposition leader than Senator Daschle?\n       Senator Byrd. Well, let me tell you about that. The two \n     things that we've had up in the Senate, in which I've taken a \n     little time on, were the so-called unfunded mandates. Now \n     Congress can't bind the next Congress. Congress can change \n     that law even in this Congress. And I felt that the Congress \n     ought to take more time to debate. I'm not in favor of \n     ramming things through just because there's a so-called \n     charter, Contract With America, that somebody signed. I \n     didn't sign it.\n       So I was on the Senate floor at a time when I wanted to \n     stop that contract--so-called contract--from being rammed \n     through, or one of its parts, and I also saw coming behind \n     that this constitutional amendment on the balanced budget. \n     And, no, Tom Daschle's doing a good job. I want to see him \n     succeed. I want to help him. I think he's off to a good \n     start. I walked away from the leadership. I could have had it \n     again, I knew where the votes were. But I'm not interested in \n     being the leader of the Senate. I'm interested in doing my \n     job as a senator, which I came here to do.\n       Mr. Novak. Senator, you've been quoted, sir, as saying you \n     thought the Senate has lost its soul. Why do you think it's \n     lost its soul?\n       Senator Byrd. Well, one reason why I say that is that we \n     seem to have lost our sense of history. We have no \n     institutional memory in the Senate, it seems to me. We ought \n     to understand that it is our responsibility to defend the \n     institution, to defend the Constitution and to take the time \n     to do it. I think sometimes we bend whichever way the wind \n     blows. We don't realize that being a United States senator is \n     the highest public office that this country can give. \n     Presidents come and presidents go, but senators don't fade \n     away very easily sometimes.\n       Mr. Russert. Senator, is the Senate less civil now than it \n     was?\n       Senator Byrd. Yes, it is far more partisan now than it was \n     when I came here.\n       Mr. Russert. Why?\n       Senator Byrd. I think there are too many who put party \n     first, last and always. Party is important, but I don't rank \n     it as the first thing in my life or in the history of this \n     country. I believe that we have a duty to study as \n     legislators, to try to know what we're doing and to try to do \n     what's right for the country. And that's what I see, what I \n     think is wrong. We're too partisan. There are some who seem \n     to think that the Senate is a crucible that was intended to \n     enable us to forge the party's fortunes for the next half-\n     century. But I believe--getting back to this situation, I \n     believe and hope that we'll have the time--we'll take the \n     time to study this matter carefully. It's going to come to a \n     final vote. It'll be voted up or it'll be voted down. I hope \n     we'll take the time because it's far too important to rush \n     through.\n       Mr. Russert. Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, we \n     thank you for joining us this morning.\n       Senator Byrd. Thank you.\n       Mr. Russert. Coming next, Bob Dole. He wants to be your \n     president. We'll find out why after this message.\n       (Announcements.)\n       Mr. Russert. We're back with the Republican leader of the \n     U.S. Senate, Bob Dole.\n       Senator, lots of speculation about you.\n       Senator Dole. Really?\n       Mr. Russert. The week of April 14, 1945, 2nd Lieutenant Bob \n     Dole, 10th Mountain Division, trying to take Hill 913 in \n     Northern Italy, wounded. Fifty years later, the week of April \n     14, 1995, what will Senator Bob Dole do?\n       Senator Dole. Will probably make--well, we'll make a formal \n     announcement that we're a candidate for president of the \n     United States. Can't do it on the 14th, that happens to be \n     Good Friday. But it will be that week.\n       Mr. Russert. That week. And why are you picking that week?\n       Senator Dole. Well, it will be warmer. It also, I think, \n     has some--you know, that's a week that meant a lot to me a \n     long time ago. And I think it puts a focus on America and \n     what's happened in the past 50 years, some of us who were \n     involved and where we intend to go from here. But, you know, \n     we haven't picked a definite date, but I assume it's going to \n     be that week.\n       Mr. Russert. The week of April 14th. Will it underscore the \n     difference in your military experience as opposed to Bill \n     Clinton's?\n       Senator Dole. That's not the purpose, but I assume some \n     people might suggest that. But I picked it because I thought \n     it was a fairly important experience in my lifetime, and it's \n     not aimed at anyone else.\n       Mr. Russert. You're going to challenge Bill Clinton for the \n     presidency. It's an intensely----\n       Senator Dole. Well, if I get the nomination. But if you \n     want to bestow it on me today----\n       Mr. Russert. I'm a registered Independent. I don't have \n     that power, but----\n       Senator Dole. That's all right.\n       Mr. Russert. It's an intensely personal choice for a voter \n     to make. How is Bob Dole different than Bill Clinton?\n       Senator Dole. Well, I don't want to describe Bill Clinton, \n     but I would just say as far as Bob Dole is concerned, if \n     people are looking for someone with experience and someone \n     who's been tested in a lot of ways and somebody who gets up \n     every morning and knows that people can have difficulties--\n     because I have a little difficulty dressing and things like \n     that--that being sensitive, I guess, to people's concerns, \n     who I think has a good record of conservative views on taxes \n     and spending and--but also understands that we need to reach \n     out as a party. You know, that's where I come from. Much like \n     Jack Kemp, I must say, when dealing with black Americans, \n     Hispanics, it seems to me that if we're going to be a \n     majority party, it's going to be up to us to make that \n     happen. That means we reach out to people.\n       Mr. Russert. You're 71 years old. In 1996----\n       Senator Dole. That's chronological. I'm probably about 55, \n     otherwise. I know, I always subtract the four years I spent \n     in the hospital, so that gets me down to 67 right there.\n       Mr. Russert. In 1996 you'll be 73 years old, which would be \n     the oldest for any man to begin his first term as president. \n     In light of that, would you commit to the American people \n     that you would only serve one term as president?\n       Senator Dole. Well, I must say that's an option that people \n     have talked about. But we haven't made a decision. I assume \n     we will make that decision before we announce so the American \n     people will know. Some people might like it; some might say, \n     ``Well, you're a lame duck on day one.'' There have been a \n     lot of one-term presidents in the past few years, in the past \n     two decades or so, but it's a judgment we haven't made.\n       Mr. Russert. You have been in Washington for 36 years?\n       Senator Dole. I guess that's right. Not quite--34 years.\n       Mr. Russert. Why wouldn't people say, ``Bob Dole, you \n     created this mess. Who are you to suggest you can fix it?''\n       Senator Dole. Well, I think basically I've tried to keep in \n     touch with real people all the time I've been in Washington. \n     I know where I'm from; I've never forgotten my roots in \n     Kansas. And secondly, again. I think many of us have been \n     fighting the battle. We're happy to have the replacements, \n     the troops, the cavalry come riding in as they did last \n     November. Now we have a majority in the House and Senate, we \n     can really make these things happen.\n       Mr. Russert. Lots of discussion about President Clinton and \n     the so-called character issue. How big of an issue do you \n     think that would be in a presidential race?\n       Senator Dole. I don't know. I mean, I think the media, \n     others--certainly we're all going to be subject to total \n     scrutiny. But my \n      [[Page S2154]] view is maybe it's an issue; I think the \n     overriding issue should be where will this person--this \n     nominee, whoever--take us or take America and does he or she \n     have any ideas? So it's going to be a difficult race. We have \n     a number of outstanding Republicans, you know, going to be \n     involved in the primary process. So anybody who's thinking \n     about it is going to have to give up about a year and a half \n     of their life.\n       Mr. Russert. Your wife Elizabeth Hanford Dole, former \n     secretary of labor, secretary of transportation, educated at \n     Duke, Oxford and Harvard Law. Will she be an activist first \n     lady like Hillary Rodham Clinton?\n       Senator Dole. Not in that sense--not in the policy sense. \n     But Elizabeth certainly has her own career and would like \n     to--you know, I haven't discussed this with her and you're \n     going to get me in trouble. I mean, I can handle most things, \n     but I want to be careful here. So it would be--obviously, she \n     would want to be doing something, maybe more traditional \n     first lady efforts. But she's been involved in the Red Cross. \n     She likes it. It's a public service, making a difference in \n     people's lives.\n       Mr. Russert. But you don't think the first lady should be \n     involved directly in policy formulation?\n       Senator Dole. I think it's a very high risk. I said that \n     when Hillary Clinton was assigned health care. It's a high \n     risk. If it fails, A, and, B, if it--to keep it from failing, \n     how much do you give way? I think it was a mistake then and I \n     think it would be a mistake for any future first lady or \n     first man.\n       Mr. Russert. One issue that is going to be on the ballot in \n     1996 in California, you were talking about the politics of \n     inclusion, reaching out to black Republicans, like Jack Kemp, \n     is a proposition or referendum which is going to say that, \n     ``Race or color will not be a criteria for either \n     discriminating against or granting preferential treatment to \n     anyone.'' Would you be in favor of such a referendum or \n     proposition?\n       Senator Dole. Well, right now we've asked the Congressional \n     Research Service to send us all the bills that involve--with \n     preferences, and we're looking at it. I mean, it--again, with \n     my record, I think I can look at it with some credibility. \n     Has it worked? Has it had an adverse or reverse reaction? Why \n     did 62 percent of white males vote Republican in 1994? I \n     think it's because of things like this, where sometimes the \n     best qualified person does not get the job because he or she \n     may be of one color, one--and I'm beginning to believe that \n     may not be the way it should be in America.\n       Mr. Russert. So that this referendum, which would, in \n     effect, eliminate affirmative action, is something that you \n     could support?\n       Senator Dole. Well, you know, I haven't read that. It's \n     something that we're looking at. Let me say that. I want to \n     be fair. I want people to have opportunities in America by \n     creating more jobs and not having to struggle every time. If \n     you have somebody that wants a raise, ``Well, what's your \n     color? What's your ethnic background?'' You know, the people \n     in America now are paying a price for things that were done \n     before they were born. We did discriminate; we did suppress \n     people. It was wrong. Slavery was wrong. But should future \n     generations have to pay for that? Some would say yes. I think \n     it's a tough question.\n       Mr. Russert. Lisa.\n       Ms. Myers. Senator, the balanced budget amendment--you just \n     heard Senator Byrd.\n       Senator Dole. Yes.\n       Ms. Myers. Why don't Republicans just get it over with and \n     lay out a seven-year plan on how you would accomplish a \n     balanced budget?\n       Senator Dole. Well, we were sort of hoping the president in \n     his budget would give us some clues on a seven-year plan. He \n     didn't give you any clue on anything. He didn't cut spending. \n     It's--doesn't even cut the deficit. All he does is extend \n     these caps and there's no real spending cuts. But I'm going \n     to say a thing about Robert Byrd. He's the master of the \n     game. And I say that with admiration. He knows the Senate \n     rules. He knows it will not have a--vote very soon on a \n     balanced budget amendment because he knows every trick in the \n     book; in fact, he wrote the book. So I believe it will pass \n     by a very close vote. And we'll lay out all we can. We'll be \n     as specific as we can. But it's like a seven-year weather \n     forecast. You know, we don't know what's going to happen. \n     What may sh--we don't know what economic--maybe there'll be \n     some calamity somewhere in the world, maybe some conflict \n     we're involved in.\n       But that--in my view, this is a way to, in effect, skirt \n     responsibility. If we don't do anything, we're going to \n     increase spending in the next--the deficit by 18 percent in \n     the next 20 to 30 years. We're never going to have a balanced \n     budget. We have to make tough decisions. It's going to affect \n     everybody, and we ought to be prepared for it.\n       Ms. Myers. When will you lay out as much as you can?\n       Senator Dole. Well, Senator Domenici, chairman of the \n     Budget Committee, is working on that now.\n       Ms. Myers. So the Republicans will have at least an outline \n     on how you balance the budget over seven years?\n       Senator Dole. Well, we'll have as much information as we \n     can, but with the und----\n       Ms. Myers. While the amendment is being debated?\n       Senator Dole. Sure, with the understanding that, you know, \n     we can't be certain of anything.\n       Ms. Myers. Right.\n       Senator Dole. These are all economic assumptions. The \n     economy may go up or down. But I think we'll do the best we \n     can and this so-called ``right to know'' amendment--we've \n     offered an amendment called the ``need to lead'' amendment. \n     It's about time the Democrats started some leadership around \n     here instead of trying to scare people on Social Security or \n     veterans or everything else. We'll never have a balanced \n     budget if everybody is going to be exempt.\n       Ms. Myers. All right. Let's talk about the nomination of \n     Dr. Henry Foster to be surgeon general, President Clinton's \n     choice. Are you troubled by the fact that Dr. Foster now says \n     he performed as many as a dozen abortions?\n       Senator Dole. I'm troubled by the fact that we were not--\n     more troubled by the fact that we were not given that \n     information before the nomination was sent up. I think the \n     administration, maybe they should have known; they surely \n     asked the question. That troubles me almost as much as \n     knowing they've sent up this nomination. Will it be in some \n     difficulty? Yes.\n       Ms. Myers. How much difficulty?\n       Senator Dole. I don't know yet. It depends on--I know \n     Senator Coats, of Indiana, a member of the Labor Committee, \n     has indicated strong opposition. We haven't had a discussion \n     of it, a so-called ``conference level'' where all Republicans \n     were present.\n       Ms. Myers. Will you oppose the nomination?\n       Senator Dole. I'm not certain. I don't like what I hear or \n     what I read. I haven't met with the nominee.\n       Ms. Myers. But you don't like it because he performed a \n     dozen----\n       Senator Dole. That's right. I think it's one thing to be an \n     obstetrician, but, again, it's sort of--I think again, it \n     doesn't show--well, I think they should have checked it more \n     carefully.\n       Ms. Myers. But even though that Dr. Foster says that he--\n     most of these abortions, less than a dozen over, I think, \n     some 30 years of practice, were performed in cases of rape--\n     --\n       Senator Dole. Right.\n       Ms. Myers [continuing]. Incest or danger to the life of the \n     mother.\n       Senator Dole. Again, let's get him on the record and let's \n     see what the testimony is. My view is, we shouldn't shoot \n     down somebody before they've even had a hearing, and you may \n     decide that based on everything that is laid out and his \n     record in other areas, his record on teen pregnancy--he's \n     done a lot\n     of good things, don't misunderstand me--that maybe he should \n     be confirmed. The general rule is that the president is \n     entitled to his nominees. And that's been the general rule \n       around here forever.Ms. Myers. So you do not agree, then, \n     with some anti-abortion activists who say the very fact that \n     he performed abortions is a disqualifying factor?\n       Senator Dole. I may turn out to be that way, but, again, \n     I--since I get to vote and they don't, I want to see the \n     evidence.\n       Ms. Myers. Well, if you feel that strongly about it, if \n     you're elected president, would you then promise to never \n     appoint anyone who favors abortion rights to any judicial \n     position?\n       Senator Dole. Well, I'd rather wait until I get elected to \n     answer that, but----\n       Ms. Myers. But if you feel that strongly about it, Senator, \n     doesn't it carry over----\n       Senator Dole. No, I feel strongly about hearing the facts. \n     I mean, it's--I know it's not--a lot of precedent for it in \n     this town, but I'd like to have the facts laid out--\n     everything he's done. If that one thing disqualifies him, \n     we'll see what happens.\n       Mr. Novak. Senator Dole, since neither you nor any other \n     Republicans leaders are planning to do anything on abortion \n     in this Congress, which would satisfy the strong pro-life \n     constituency you have, critics say that taking off on Dr. \n     Foster is a cheap way out of that predicament, instead of \n     trying for a human life amendment, which you probably \n     couldn't get through the Senate at all, you can just satisfy \n     the pro-lifers by attacking Dr. Foster. Is there some \n     validity to that?\n       Senator Dole. Well, I must--I haven't thought of that. I \n     mean, I happen to be pro-life. I think we agree with Ralph \n     Reed when they ask about prayer in school and these other \n     issues, and he's the executive director of the Christian \n     Coalition, that we need to address jobs and welfare reform \n     and tax cuts. This should be our priority. It doesn't mean \n     we're not going to address these issues some time in the next \n     two years.\n       Mr. Novak. Senator, you have been known for scathing \n     criticism of supply side, as you once said that--had a little \n     joke with the----\n       Senator Dole. That wasn't my joke. I repeated it and it \n     became my joke.\n       Mr. Novak. But the--the good----\n       Senator Dole. Good news, bad news.\n       Mr. Novak. The good news was, a bus full of supply siders \n     crashed; the bad news was some of them survived. With that \n     background----\n       Senator Dole. No, there were three empty seats.\n       Mr. Novak. Three empty seats, all right. Well, you can tell \n     it better than I can.\n       Senator Dole. Yeah.\n       Mr. Novak. With that background, sir, how can you hope to \n     get support from the supporters of Jack Kemp who has now \n     dropped out of the presidential race?\n       Senator Dole. Well, we've already picked up his supporters \n     in Iowa. Darrell Carney is \n      [[Page S2155]] on the Dole team. He was Kemp's chairman. \n     We're going to pick up a lot of support of Iowa. Plus, I \n     think, people looking at Jack Kemp and Bob Dole's records, \n     they find them fairly consistent, plus the effort to reach \n     out to other people to broaden the party. But I must say, if \n     you look back when we were saying those things--and that was \n     not my joke, but--pretty good--always got a laugh, so I kept \n     repeating it. Bob Hope still uses some of his stuff he had 25 \n     years ago. So what we were saying then is what Republicans \n     are doing now.\n       Ten years ago when we had to fight and win by one vote, the \n     budget battle is 1985, House Republicans were saying, ``We \n     don't want to cut spending, just cut taxes.'' Now they're \n     saying. ``Cut spending first.'' That's been my position ever \n     since I've been here. So I think its consistent. I don't \n     think--I think it's going to appeal to many people who say, \n     ``Cut spending first before we have a big tax cut.''\n       Mr. Novak. In line with Mr. Russert's question about \n     whether you would only serve one term, there's also been \n     speculation that you might name your selection for vice \n     president and run as a tandem as Ronald Reagan did with \n     Richard Schweiker in 1976. Are you considering Jack Kemp for \n     that?\n       Senator Dole. Well, certainly Jack would be on any list I \n     put together, along with Pete Wilson and Colin Powell and----\n       Mr. Novak. In advance of the convention?\n       Senator Dole. Well, if I did that, we have--again, that's a \n     decision that hasn't been made. I think some think it's a \n     plus and some think it's a minus and some haven't thought \n     about it.\n       Mr. Novak. But it's possible?\n       Senator Dole. Yeah.\n       Mr. Novak. And you also had--who else----\n       Senator Dole. You know, it's not really a short list. It \n     includes a number of people. We have a number of outstanding \n     governors--Governor Voinovich; Tommy Thompson, who's thinking \n     about running; Jim Edgar; Bill Weld; Governor Whitman. You've \n     got this whole list of people that I think would be \n     outstanding running mates. And some may run for president.\n       Mr. Novak. You would include General Power on that list, \n     though?\n       Senator Dole. Oh, yes.\n       Mr. Novak. Colin Powell.\n       Senator Dole. I had a good visit with him two or three \n     weeks ago. We didn't talk about this specific thing, but----\n       Mr. Novak. Did he say he was a Republican?\n       Senator Dole. No. But he--the thing that encouraged me--he \n     did know that polling was going on in America and that his \n     name was in the polling.\n       Mr. Novak. Let me ask you two quick questions on issues, \n     sir.\n       Senator Dole. Thank you. He knew he was running ahead of \n     me.\n       Mr. Novak. Let me ask you two quick questions on issues. \n     The minimum--President Clinton has asked for an increase in \n     the minimum wage; Speaker Gingrich and the House leadership \n     is against it. You have now taken a position. Do you see any \n     kind of a tradeoff where the Republicans support an increase \n     in the minimum wage and the Democrats support a cut in the \n     capital gains tax?\n       Senator Dole. I knew that would occur to you. I haven't \n     thought about it fully--might be a good trade. But I think \n     first we want to take a look at the minimum wage. He goes \n     back and says, ``Well, Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich supported \n     one before.'' But we also had a sub-minimum wage--a training \n     wage and we also excluded certain size companies. Where has \n     he been the last two years with the increase in min--why did \n     we wait until now? Maybe because he made the deal with Mexico \n     and there's all the criticism with that, he thought maybe he \n     ought do something for low-income people.\n       My colleague, Senator Kassebaum, is very wary of increasing \n     the minimum wage. She thinks we ought to have, if anything, a \n     targeted minimum wage that goes to low-income people, that \n     most of this is not going to people in the poverty level, \n     it's going to go to, you know, job entrants, young people and \n     some whose families make $50,000, $60,000 a year.\n       Mr. Novak. But you don't rule it out. You don't rule out \n     supporting it.\n       Senator Dole. With the deal you've suggested, I'd--you \n     know, that throws some new light on it. That might make it \n     very attractive.\n       Mr. Novak. One last thing. You wrote in a letter--you and \n     several of your colleagues wrote a letter to Secretary of the \n     Treasury Rubin a couple weeks ago asking, ``What was the role \n     of the U.S. Treasury and the International Monetary Fund in \n     the devaluation of the Mexican peso, which has led to all \n     this trouble?'' Are you going to pursue that? Are you going \n     to ask for hearings? Just what do you have in mind? Is there \n     some scandal involved there?\n       Senator Dole. Well, we don't know. I mean, there could be \n     because there's a feeling that somebody was feasting off \n     these devaluations around the world forever. It might be some \n     of the big concerns on Wall Street. We don't know the facts, \n     but we're going to try to find out.\n       Senator D'Amato is very determined, and he told Secretary \n     Rubin just last week, he's going to monitor this almost on a \n     daily or weekly basis. And we're going to continue to push to \n     sort of peg the peso to the dollar at 3.52.\n       Mr. Novak. You are going to push for that?\n       Senator Dole. Sure.\n       Mr. Novak. When will those hearings be held, sir?\n       Senator Dole. Well, I know--whenever--I know Senator \n     D'Amato and Secretary Rubin met last week. I think it's going \n     to be an ongoing thing at a staff level and at the necessary \n     time maybe have hearings.\n       Mr. Russert. Finally, Senator, our colleague Mark Shields, \n     talking about Newt Gingrich the other day, said, quote, \n     ``Imagine a Republican leadership team comprised of a good \n     guy and a bad guy and Bob Dole is the good guy?''\n       Senator Dole. That shows you can finally make it in this \n     town.\n       Mr. Russert. Has Newt Gingrich's rhetoric softened Bob \n     Dole?\n       Senator Dole. I don't think it's so much that, it's been--\n     everybody's been comparing Gingrich and Clinton, and I've \n     been able to be the spectator and people have sort of \n     forgotten about me. And they say, ``Gee, well, it's not the \n     same fellow I met last week.'' So maybe some of the things \n     that have been said--but I think it's been more the \n     comparison. Let's face it, Newt is in line to be president. \n     He's in the line of succession, which is more than most of us \n     can say. And he and Clinton--the speaker is very powerful, \n     the most powerful speaker we've had in a long, long time; \n     doing a good job and we're working closely together.\n       Mr. Russert. Should he temper his rhetoric?\n       Senator Dole. Well, I think things are settling down. I've \n     noticed a little different--you know, I look down the hall \n     now and then from the Senate over to the House and I don't \n     hear anything. Used to be able to hear it, just putting your \n     hea--so I think it's settling down on the House side.\n       Mr. Russert. In 1976, When Bob Dole ran, he was described \n     as a hatchet man, and accused the Democrat wars--World War I, \n     World War II, Korea, were Democrat wars.\n       Senator Dole. It was in my briefing book.\n       Mr. Russert. Well, it--in 1988, you said to George Bush, \n     ``Stop lying about my record.'' In 1996----\n       Senator Dole. See. I only made two mistakes.\n       Mr. Russert. Well--but in 1996, will there be a different \n     Bob Dole running for president?\n       Senator Dole. I think--well, I hope so. I mean, you try \n     to--if you don't try to learn from your mistakes, you ought \n     to get out of the business, whatever it is, whether it's \n     media or politics. And certainly I've said things I shouldn't \n     have said. Now I've never been more relaxed about what I'm \n     doing now. I mean, it seems to me that, you know, I'm at sort \n     of peace with myself. I know what I want to do. I'm not going \n     to be around criticizing any of my running mates or--not \n     running mates, but anybody out there running on the \n     Republican side. I've never personally attacked President \n     Clinton or Mrs. Clinton. I gave that up. I had a round of \n     that several years ago.\n       Mr. Russert. Senator Dole, thanks for joining us.\n       Senator Dole. Thank you.\n       Mr. Russert. And we'll see you in Russell, Kansas, in \n     April.\n       Senator Dole. I hope so. That's right, Meet the Press will \n     be there, right?\n       Mr. Russert. Well, I lost the Super Bowl bet; I'll be \n     there.\n       We'll be right back with William Safire.\n       (Announcements.)\n       Mr. Russert. Welcome back to Meet the Press. With us now, \n     William Safire.\n       Bill, welcome. We have a trade war with China?\n       Mr. Safire. Yeah. We weren't able to apply human rights to \n     the Chinese, and so the Clinton administration said, ``We'll \n     do anything you want, we'll give you MFN, we'll trade with \n     you,'' and that policy has been a big flop. And what has \n     happened is now American business has said, ``Well, we can't \n     fight on human rights grounds, but we're certainly ready to \n     fight on CD grounds.'' And I think that's kind of sad to see. \n     We should be standing for principle rather than just saving \n     $300 million on a--on the trade war.\n       Mr. Russert. Who's going to lead China in the next century?\n       Mr. Safire. Big question. It can go any one of four ways. \n     If it goes the establishment way, Xiang, then China will hold \n     together the way it is now. I don't think that'll happen. \n     He's a transitional figure. If it goes to Lee, he's the tough \n     guy of Tiananmen. And then you would have repression and a \n     very tough dictatorship. If it goes to Xu Rangzhi--he's the \n     economist; he's more the good guy, looks like Mayor Koch \n     actually, but a sound citizen. And then there's a dark horse, \n     Xiao Zhou, who is the Newt Gingrich of China, the head of the \n     legislature there, and nobody knows what he stands for.\n       Mr. Russert. Who's going to lead the United States of \n     America in the next century?\n       Mr. Safire. In the next century----\n       Mr. Russert. Well----\n       Mr. Safire [continuing]. Are you talking about--you \n     skipping over 1996 and----\n       Mr. Russert. All right, we'll start at '96. I was trying to \n     let you off the hook, but got to '96, Safire.\n       Mr. Safire. OK. We see Dole, who is awfully good as a \n     majority leader, and that's the big weakness. He's a \n     compromiser. And when you asked earlier, what about a one-\n     term commitment, the very fact that they're talking about \n     that, and he's allowing the talk to continue, suggests that \n     perhaps he's better off in the job he's in. He looked over \n     his shoulder sort of on today's program and \n      [[Page S2156]] I think mentioned Pete Wilson out there. So \n     if Gingrich goes for it, that would weaken Gramm and help \n     Dole. It's a wonderful business.\n       Mr. Russert. We have to take a quick break. We'll be back \n     with more Bill Safire after this.\n       (Announcements.)\n       Mr. Russert. Bill Safire, we've talked with you about \n     Russia quite a bit on this program. President Clinton said at \n     the State of the Union, ``American children go to bed now and \n     there's no nuclear missiles from Russia aimed at them.'' But \n     what is this real situation in Russia?\n       Mr. Safire. Things are in terrific turmoil at the moment \n     because of the Chechnyan war. Boris Yeltsin's popularity has \n     gone right into the tank. I mean, he's in single digits. He's \n     below--you know, way below any other major leader. That's \n     because the reformers have deserted him, or they think he's \n     deserted them. And the Zhirinovsky nationalists have also \n     deserted him, because he's brought discredit on the armed \n     forces, and he's got nobody, except he's got himself \n     surrounded with about 70,000 or 80,000 soldiers who answer \n     directly to him around Moscow. The big question--here we are \n     talking about American elections and who's going to be the \n     candidate. The question in Russia is: Will there be an \n     election in 1996?\n       Mr. Russert. Well----\n       Mr. Safire. There are some good men around, Yavlinsky and--\n     you know, it's coming along. But if the popularity of Yeltsin \n     stays so low, he may not want to have an election.\n       Mr. Russert. And cancel the election.\n       Mr. Safire. And postpone it for a few years, and that will \n     be terrible.\n       Mr. Russert. A chilling thought to end our roundtable this \n     morning. Bill Safire, Bob Novak, Lisa Myers, thank you very \n     much. We'll be right back with our Meet the Press Minute.\n       (Announcements.)\n       Mr. Russert. Deja vu: December, 1951, President Truman was \n     in the third year of his term, there was widespread \n     speculation about another Democrat challenging him. And the \n     big unknown: the plans of General Dwight David Eisenhower. \n     Let's take a look.\n       (File footage from December 2, 1951).\n       Mr. Ernest Lindley. Who, in your opinion, would make the \n     strongest Democratic nominee for the presidency next year?\n       Representative John F. Kennedy (Democrat, Massachusetts): \n     Well, as--I've only heard of one or two men discussed, and as \n     it seems fairly inevitable that if President Truman is a \n     candidate for reelection, he will receive the nomination. I \n     would say that he would be probably the strongest. Now \n     there's been some talk of General Eisenhower running. I don't \n     know whether General Eisenhower's a Republican or a Democrat.\n       Ms. Martha Rountree. You're not convinced that he is a \n     Republican, though, are you?\n       Representative Kennedy. I have no reason to be convinced \n     he's a Republican or a Democrat, as he's ignored politics for \n     a long time, quite rightly, in his military career. But there \n     are those who say they know, and in view of that, perhaps we \n     can accept their opinion.\n       Once General Eisenhower takes off his uniform, leaves a \n     very critical situation in Western Europe and takes a \n     position on issues like civil rights and labor legislation, \n     etc., and becomes a candidate and runs for office, I think \n     we'd get a better idea of whether he is going to be able to \n     sweep the country or not.\n       (End of footage.)\n       Mr. Russert. Hmm. General Colin Powell, are you listening?\n       That's all for today. Join Giselle Fernandez later tonight \n     for the ``NBC Nightly News.'' And tomorrow on ``Today,'' \n     continuing coverage of the O.J. Simpson trial. Tomorrow night \n     on the ``NBC Nightly News'' with Tom Brokaw, remarkable \n     advances in the treatment of strokes.\n       We'll be back next week when our guest will be another \n     presidential hopeful, former Vice President Dan Quayle.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of House Joint Resolution 1, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (H.J.

The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to say a few words about the \namendment filed by the distinguished minority leader Thursday or Friday \nof last week. Actually, he called it the right-to-know amendment. I \ncall it the right-to-stall amendment because that is what it amounts \nto.\n  The balanced budget amendment represents the kind of change that the \nAmerican people asked for last November. The American people know the \nFederal Government, they know the bureaucrats who run it, and they know \nthat those bureaucrats need to be put on a fiscal diet.\n  In contrast, the proposal offered by the distinguished minority \nleader, with all due respect, is offered in defense of the status quo \nand business as usual. If my colleagues supporting the Daschle proposal \nhad been in the first Congress, we never would have adopted the first \namendment of the Bill of Rights. Just imagine James Madison defending \nthe free speech clause of the first amendment to some of our colleagues \ntoday:\n  ``Does this mean you can't yell `fire' in a crowded theater,'' they \nwould ask?\n  ``Does it protect obscenity? If not, what is the line between \nobscenity and protected free speech? We cannot accept the free speech \nclause without these details spelled out,'' they would say.\n  ``Does the free-speech clause protect the American flag from \ndesecration? If so, we cannot accept the first amendment.''\n  Some of my colleagues made that very clear when they turned down the \nflag amendment twice a few years ago.\n  What about the religion clause, the free-exercise clause and the \nestablishment clause of the first amendment, would the supporters of \nthe Daschle proposal, had they been in the first Congress, have \ndemanded an accounting of just when and how the Government can aid \nreligious schools?\n  Would they have insisted on knowing all of the circumstances under \nwhich citizens or local governments can put a menorah or a creche on \npublic property?\n  Would they have turned down the first amendment because the first \nCongress would not fulfill the ludicrous task of answering these \nquestions? Or would they have accepted the principles contained in the \nfirst amendment and have allowed those principles to develop as they \nhave over the years?\n  Just imagine if the following clause in article I, section 9 came \nbefore the Constitutional Convention of 1787 in Philadelphia:\n\n       No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in \n     Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; * * *\n\n  ``Oh, no,'' my colleagues of today would have said had they been \nthere, ``tell us how much the appropriations will be over the next 7 \nyears or we cannot adopt this provision in the Constitution.''\n  What about the clause in article I, section 8 giving Congress the \npower to regulate foreign and interstate commerce? ``Oh, no,'' some of \nour colleagues, had they been in Philadelphia in 1787, would have said, \n``we cannot give Congress the power to regulate commerce until we know \nthe tariffs and the interstate regulations Congress will enact over the \nnext 7 years.''\n  Here and now let us adopt the principle of a balanced budget with the \ncareful exceptions of wartime or when a supermajority consensus is \nreached for a pressing national purpose on a rollcall vote. Then, after \nwe adopt the principle, we can implement it over the next 7 years, \nadjusting the budget to take into account changing circumstances during \nthat time.\n  Yesterday, on the Frank Sesno show on CNN, I debated with Alice \nRivlin. It was interesting to me that at the very time that we are \nmaking the case on the floor that the Federal Government is not serious \nabout balancing the budget, that unless we have a balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment, we will not get to a balanced budget by the \nyear 2002, the President is filing his \n [[Page S2157]] budget for this next year, a budget which, by the way, \nproves our case.\n  By their own reckoning, that is those in the White House--and Mrs. \nRivlin did have a difficult time really supporting their position--by \ntheir own budget, we will face deficits for the next 12 years that \naverage no less than $190 billion a year. There is no desire to get to \na balanced budget by the year 2002. In fact, they say by the year 2005, \n2006, or 2007, the average deficit will be $190 billion a year. In \nfact, the President's own budget will increase the national debt from \n$4.8 trillion to a little over $6 trillion in the next 5 years. If \nthere ever was a case made for the need for a balanced budget \namendment, it has to be this budget which has been delivered today.\n  How ironic it is that they would deliver that budget at the very time \nwhen we are arguing that the only way to get to a balanced budget by \nthe year 2002 would be to put some fiscal mechanism into the \nConstitution that will help us to get there.\n  What do we face? Why, we have an amendment filed by the minority \nleader that is so defective that it is even constitutionally unsound. \nIn fact, some authorities are now calling it unconstitutional because \nit would add to section 5 of the Constitution another reason, another \ndebate before we could have a constitutional amendment.\n  I just have to say, after all, this is the Constitution that we are \namending, not budget legislation. In fact, as I read the Daschle \nproposal, it requires that we pass a resolution laying out the details \nof a plan starting in fiscal year 1996, even though that requirement \nwould be contained in an amendment that does not become effective until \nthe year 2002, ignoring the fact that there will be three intervening \nCongresses before we get to the year 2002.\n  To require that a constitutional provision be fully implemented \nbefore it is adopted puts the cart a long way before the horse. After \nall, the whole problem is that Congress has not been able to balance \nthe budget in the absence of a constitutional requirement to do so. For \n26 years, Congress has failed to balance the budget. Mrs. Rivlin said \non that program yesterday--and I have admiration for her, she is a fine \nwoman. If she had her way, she would get to a balanced budget by the \nyear 2002, but she was unable to get this administration to do it. Mrs. \nRivlin basically said yesterday we just simply should do it.\n  I remember the distinguished Senator from West Virginia saying we \nshould just do it. It is odd to me how those who are always saying we \nshould just do it right here in the Congress, we have the power to do \nit now, it is odd to me how many of those who are saying that are \npeople who are opposed to the balanced budget amendment and, in the \nprocess, are dedicated to the same old order that has put us in this \nfinancial difficulty that we are in right now--$4.8 trillion in \nnational debt, going to $6.3 trillion in just 5 years under the \nPresident's so-called deficit reduction plan.\n  I do give the President some credit for at least trying. He is \nconsolidating programs; he is recommending cutting out some programs. \nBut those are minuscule efforts in comparison to what needs to be done \nand what will be done if we pass a balanced budget constitutional \namendment.\n  To require that a constitutional provision be fully implemented \nbefore it is adopted is really, really something that nobody should be \ndeceived by reading. It seems to me that the people who really have the \nburden of showing us how they will balance the budget are the ones who \nclaim we do not need the balanced budget amendment. We say the budget \ncannot be balanced without a constitutional requirement. It is that \nsimple, and the President's budget makes our case.\n  To those who think we can balance the budget without the balanced \nbudget amendment, I say to them, ``Show us how; you tell us how you \nwant to do it. If you cannot show us the way to a balanced budget \nwithout the amendment, this suggests one of two things: Either you \nagree with us that it cannot be done without the constitutional \nrequirement or you are simply against balancing the budget at all.''\n  Now, if the truth be known, there is a lot of mouthing about \nbalancing the budget, but the very people who are doing it most of the \ntime are those who are against the balanced budget amendment, except \nthose who want a balanced budget amendment so we can get to a balanced \nbudget.\n  Now, that brings me to the President. If President Clinton gets his \nway and defeats the balanced budget amendment this year as he did last \nyear, what is his purpose? Does he not want a balanced budget? Does he \nstand for the status quo of ever-higher taxes and ever-higher deficits? \nOr is his point that we can balance the budget without the \nconstitutional mandate?\n  The fact is, his own budget will increase the deficit by $1 trillion \nover the next 5 years, and that is assuming the optimistic economic \nassumptions in that budget will remain optimistic and will actually \noccur.\n  Or is his point that he can balance the budget without the \nconstitutional mandate? If so, I would expect him to release his plan \nfor a balanced budget this week.\n  Well, his plan is anything but a plan for a balanced budget. For the \nnext 12 years he admits that under his budget, as much as he has \ntried--and I give him credit for that--we will have an average of a \n$190 billion deficit every year for those 12 years--again, if all the \neconomic assumptions they make are correct, and they have never been \ncorrect yet. It is always higher.\n  Where is this Presidential leadership we have been hearing about? I \nguarantee you there will be no efforts, really successful efforts made \nwithout a balanced budget amendment and without both the President and \nthe Congress working together to get there. And that is what the \nbalanced budget amendment will bring about. It will force us to work \ntogether to get a balanced budget by the year 2000.\n  The President's deficit reduction tax plan has failed to control even \nthe growth of annual budget deficits which continue to rise during the \nlatter years of the plan, surpassing $200 billion as early as 1996. And \nif his old plan is correct, they would reach the record level of $297 \nbillion in the year 2001 and would top $421 billion in annual deficits \nin the year 2005.\n  Now, he claims this new budget, by cutting some programs and \nconsolidating others, will get it down to only a $190 billion deficit \neach year through the year 2005. That is 10 years from now.\n  The President's so-called deficit reduction plan, which included \nmassive tax increases on working people, retirees, and other Americans, \nneither stops the growth of the national debt nor balances the budget. \nThe fact is that if House Joint Resolution 1 passes in its current \nform, we can and will balance the budget. It is not the lack of plans \nthat has prevented us from balancing the budget. It is the lack of \nwill.\n  We do not claim to have the perfect, painless way to balance the \nbudget, but there are quite a number of options for us to examine and \ndraw from, at least in part. In fact, over the last few years, we have \nseen a number of plans released from both sides of the aisle from both \nbodies and from outside organizations. I will just hold up a few:\n  The Concord Coalition zero deficit plan, the Republican alternative \nto the fiscal 1994 budget, the Congressional Budget Office's \nillustration of one path to balance the budget in their Economic and \nBudget Outlook 1996-2000, just to name a few. There are others.\n  Senator Domenici has said that if we would allow the Government to \nonly grow 2 percent a year--now, 2 percent of $1.5 trillion is still a \nlot of billions of dollars. We would still be increasing spending, but \nif we would only allow it to grow 2 percent a year and you totally \nexclude Social Security from any cuts and keep it just totally \ninviolate, we would reach a balanced budget by the year 2002.\n  So the fact is we have the way to get there, a variety of ways of \ngetting there. We just do not have the votes right now without a \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment. Even the current White House \nChief of Staff Leon Panetta submitted a balanced budget proposal during \nhis tenure in the House, but they have not been able to do it since his \ntenure in the White House.\n  Like I say, other ideas include limiting the growth of spending to 2 \npercent without touching Social Security or cutting just 4 cents a year \noff every \n [[Page S2158]] dollar of planned spending except Social Security. That \nwould get us to a balanced budget in the year 2002.\n  Unfortunately, a lot of the people who are arguing that we ought to \nlay out in detail how we get there in 7 years are the people who would \nvote against that type of an approach as they are voting against the \nbalanced budget amendment. Furthermore, there are many proposals out \nthere to reduce spending significantly and reduce the deficit: the Dole \n50-point plan, the Penny-Kasich deficit reduction plan, the Brown-\nKerrey bipartisan cutting plan, the prime cuts list prepared by \nCitizens Against Government Waste, the Kasich budget alternatives for \nfiscal year 1994 and fiscal year 1995, and the Brown deficit reduction \nplan by our distinguished Senator from Colorado, who made that point in \nthe last year or so.\n  Now, I do not think that any one of these proposals is necessarily \nthe ultimate solution, yet they all have some ideas worth considering. \nI certainly believe that we could evaluate and analyze proposals in \nthese plans as well as other ideas that I guarantee will be forthcoming \nfrom both sides of the aisle if we pass this balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment.\n  Let me say it one more time. The problem is not the lack of ideas. It \nis the lack of will. House Joint Resolution 1 in its current form will \nprovide that will.\n  Now, the Daschle proposal itself raises more questions than it would \nanswer. We are talking about this amendment that now has been amended \ntwice by Senator Dole, or at least has two amendments pending against \nit. For example, the Daschle amendment would require a statement of new \nbudget authority and outlays only on accounts which were over $100 \nmillion in 1994.\n  Well, what about accounts that were under $100 million in 1994 but \nhave grown? What about new accounts? The Daschle proposal would also \nrequire an allocation of Federal revenues among major resources of such \nrevenues, but what qualifies as major?\n  The Daschle proposal would further require a detailed list and \ndescription of changes in Federal law required to carry out the plan. \nSuch information is currently in a document separate from the budget \nresolution. That document for President Clinton's 1993 budget plan was \nover 1,000 pages long. Do we really want to increase the already \nmammoth budget resolution? Besides that, I really do not understand the \nDaschle provision. Are we supposed to predict over the next 7 years not \njust the changes in law Congress may ultimately pass but the date upon \nwhich Congress will pass them?\n  The Daschle proposal creates additional problems by making \nconstitutional references to statutory law. It incorporates section \n310(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 by reference. Now, what \nhappens if Congress amends that section? The balanced budget amendment, \nit would seem to me, would allow that amendment any time Congress \nchooses to do so, which, of course, makes the balanced budget amendment \ntotally worthless. I guess that is, after all, what the Daschle \nproposal is trying to do, make it so it is impossible for us to ever \nbalance the budget.\n  If Congress amends that section, would that qualify as a \nconstitutional amendment itself or does it qualify just as an amendment \nwithin the constitutional amendment that is permitted because section \n310(a) is merely mentioned by point of reference in the balanced budget \namendment? That is, if Daschle would pass. And I cannot believe anybody \nwould be serious about voting for something like that.\n  Similarly, the Congressional Budget Office is explicitly referred to \nin this proposal. That means that the Constitution would now refer to \nfour branches of Government--the Congress, the Supreme Court, the \nExecutive or President, and the Congressional Budget Office. What \nconstitutional thinking is that? How in the world could they put that \ninto the Constitution? We know the Congressional Budget Office has been \nwrong more than it has been right. So we are going to write it into the \nConstitution? We will if the Daschle amendment is passed. I cannot \nimagine anybody really voting for an amendment that would put the \nCongressional Budget Office into the Constitution.\n  Now, here we are in the new Congress trying to reduce the Federal \nGovernment, the Federal bureaucracy, and the Daschle proposal attempts \nto enshrine a part of it in the Constitution.\n  Those of us on both sides of the aisle who have worked for years to \npass this constitutional amendment have consistently heard from our \nopponents that we are trivializing the Constitution with budget \nmatters. Talk about trivializing the Constitution--the Daschle proposal \nwould have us add a new section to the Constitution, longer and \nextraordinarily more detailed and technical than the proposal that has \nbeen the subject of hearings, a committee debate and vote, and a \ncommittee report. It adds new terms to the Constitution like \n``aggregate levels of new budget authority.'' What does that mean? It \nmeans whatever Congress says it means. I guess that is the genius of \nthis proposal. Because Congress will make it very clear they are never \ngoing to get serious about a balanced budget until it is defined.\n  The first term on that list is ``aggregate levels of new budget \nauthority.'' This phrase, like many of the terms on this list, is \ntechnical budgetary and accounting jargon. This proposal asks us to put \ninto the Constitution a phrase that means the total levels of new \nspending Congress will allow for the next 7 years.\n  Can you believe that? Determining new budget authority is a part of \nthe budget and appropriations process we go through every year. This is \nnot the type of timeless language that enunciates broad, immutable \nprinciples as does the language of the Constitution. Adding this type \nof language will only demean and trivialize the Constitution.\n  But look at the next one. Here is another one: ``major functional \ncategory.'' Functional categories are part of the system we use to \nclassify budget resources and activities to reflect the national \npriorities and needs being addressed. The proponents of the Daschle \namendment, or proposal, appear to be asking us to freeze one portion of \nour current budget policies and national priorities by adding them to \nthe Constitution.\n  Mr. President, balancing the budget is not a one-time event. It is a \ndynamic process. This amendment asks us to put one or two 30-second \nspots from a 2-hour movie into the Constitution. This is not the \npurpose of our Constitution.\n  But look at this one: ``account-by-account basis'' is going to be \nwritten into the Constitution. This is another of the technical \naccounting terms used to define our budget. These accounts represent \nagencies and programs that reflect our national spending priorities. \nThis type of language may be wholly appropriate for implementing \nlegislation but it is wholly inappropriate for inclusion into our \nConstitution.\n  Look at this one: ``allocation of Federal revenues.'' This is just \nanother way to define and present our budget information. I feel a bit \nas though I am repeating myself, but this is not the type of language \nwe should be adding to our Constitution. I cannot believe that the \nproponents of this proposal could mean to use this type of language to \ndrive constitutional policy. Nor can they mean to freeze current \nbudgeting terms and techniques in the Constitution.\n  What about this one: ``reconciliation directives\"? These are all part \nof the so-called Daschle amendment. These ``reconciliation directives'' \nare the tools used during the budget process to instruct the committees \nto report legislation changing existing laws or pending legislation in \norder to bring spending, revenues, or debt limit into conformity with \nthe budget resolution. Can you imagine the games that could be played \nwith that? This amendment calls for a budget resolution extending out \nto the year 2002. Are we really going to ask our committees to change \ncurrent or pending laws that far out into the future? Again, I remind \nthe Senate that the budget is a process which proponents of this \namendment are asking us to significantly slow down and freeze. This \njust does not reflect reality.\n  Look at this one, No. 6: ``section 310(A) of the Congressional Budget \nAct.'' This ``reconciliation directives'' is a serious issue, but this \nis even more \n [[Page S2159]] serious, and it is raised by the reference to section \n310(A) of the Congressional Budget Act. This could have far-reaching \nimplications. Not only do we have the unprecedented step of referring \nto a statute in the Constitution, but a particular section of that \nstatute. This raises a serious question about our ability to reform the \nbudget process through legislation. Will this proposal of having that \nwritten into the Constitution constrain our ability to amend that \nstatute or that section through legislation? Or would we need a \nconstitutional amendment to do so? Would this proposal lock Congress \ninto the budget process status quo?\n  A lot would argue it would. There has been a lot of discussion about \nreforming the budget process to streamline it and make it more \nresponsive to national priorities. I would hate to see us constrain \nourselves to such a point that this would be next to impossible, by \nwriting section 310(A) of the Congressional Budget Act into the \nConstitution.\n  What about this one? ``Omnibus reconciliation bill'' is mentioned in \nthe Daschle constitutional amendment language. The reference to omnibus \nreconciliation bill once again puts a budgetary process into the \nfundamental charter of our Nation.\n  Once again, I want to say this type of language does not belong in \nthe Constitution. This is coming from those who say we are trivializing \nthe Constitution? Ms. Rivlin, the leading budgeteer in this \nadministration and a person for whom I have great admiration, said that \nshe does not think we should put these types of things--she is against \nthe balanced budget amendment because it puts, in her eyes, some \neconomic matters into the Constitution. She must be sick at heart at \nwhat they are trying to do here.\n  Look at this one: ``Congressional Budget Office.'' This is perhaps my \nfavorite of all of the references in the Daschle amendment. Here we \nare, in this Congress, trying to cut bureaucracy, and the Daschle \nproponents are attempting to enshrine the bureaucracy, the \nCongressional Budget Office, in the Constitution of the United States \nof America.\n  We now have four branches of Government, if they get their way: the \nexecutive, legislative, judiciary, and the accountants. If they get \ntheir way. The Congressional Budget Office? Will that be the fifth \nbranch of Government? What about the FDA? Should we not enshrine the \nFDA in here and make it the sixth branch of Government? This is what \nthe folks who are pushing this mean. Of course, we will have to say no. \nNo, that will simply not do.\n  Look at this one: ``Economic and technical assumptions.'' Once again, \nwe have the example of technical jargon being put into the \nConstitution. ``Economic and technical assumptions'' are the tools used \nin determining the basis of our budget activities. They are vital in \ndetermining forecasts of our future events. Yet, I do not think they \nbelong in the Constitution. This phrase, indeed this whole proposal, is \nbetter addressed in implementing language which could be changed by a \nsimple majority vote. It just does not belong in our Constitution; and \nthat is why we have implementing language.\n  So when you hear them saying we should exclude Social Security from \nthe balanced budget amendment, I say how could anybody really seriously \nargue that? The balanced budget amendment should be written like a \nconstitutional amendment, which it is, the House resolution. It is, and \nwe should not trivialize it by putting all kinds of jargon into the \nConstitution.\n  My friend, Senator Domenici, may like this last one. It is a \nreference to the ``Committee on the Budget.'' It may mean that his \ncommittee now has constitutional status and cannot be eliminated \nwithout a constitutional amendment. I fear he may be pleased with the \ncommittee's new power to trigger constitutional law.\n  But, seriously, I hope we will all agree we should not be enshrining \ncongressional committees in the Constitution by reference. They are \nestablished by internal rules and can change title or function, or even \ncease to exist, as we have already seen in this new Congress. Would \nthis proposal make us pass a constitutional amendment just to change \nthe name of a committee? This is what I call really trivial stuff.\n  Mr. President, just look at that, ``constitutional language?'' \nAggregate levels of new budget authority? Major functional category? \nAccount-by-account basis? Allocation of Federal revenues? \nReconciliation directives? Section 310(A) of the Congressional Budget \nAct? Omnibus reconciliation bill? Congressional Budget Office? Economic \nand technical assumptions? Committee on the Budget? All to be enshrined \ninto the Constitution in what will be one of the largest constitutional \namendments in history.\n  I notice Senator Domenici is here. Let me just finish my remarks with \njust a couple of other comments.\n  I daresay that James Madison and the Founding Fathers must be turning \nover in their graves. They must be.\n  In testimony by Alice Rivlin before the Senate Committee on the \nJudiciary, where she said she was against the balanced budget amendment \non behalf of the administration, she had this to say:\n\n       Consequently, the administration continues to oppose the \n     effort to write fiscal policy into the Constitution. The \n     Constitution should establish principles that are basic and \n     necessary at all times, not fiscal policies like a balanced \n     budget that may not be appropriate in every year under every \n     condition.\n\n  One can only imagine what she thinks of the Daschle amendment. At \nleast a constitutional amendment to balance the budget is written in \nconstitutional language, language that would get us all there, if we \nhave that fiscal mechanism in the Constitution.\n  So to write all of this other stuff in is to trivialize and demean \nthe Constitution of the United States. And, frankly, I hope all of our \ncolleagues will vote to keep that out.\n  I notice the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee is here. \nWe look forward to hearing his remarks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Shelby). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Hatch for yielding.\n  Mr. President, I thought he might be interested in my analysis of the \nPresident's budget. If there is anything that ought to convince us that \nwe need a constitutional amendment for a balanced budget, it is the \nPresident's budget that he put out officially this morning.\n  It is hard to have all the details. But I would like to state for the \nSenate and for the American people just a few observations and \nperceptions about this budget which the President has presented.\n  First, I want to say that, to the extent that we can, we ought to \nwork with the President. We ought to try. Normally, President's budgets \nhave been declared dead on arrival. When the Republicans were in the \nWhite House the Democrats said that.\n  I do not want to say that. But I would say that this budget is on \nlife supports. There is no question about that. It is not dead, but it \nis on life supports. There are a few concepts in it that we ought to \nbuild on. There is no deficit reduction of any significance; nothing \nfor our children at all. The President in his remarks on this says this \nis good for the American dream, and then proceeds to talk about middle-\nclass Americans who will be helped, et cetera. But he forgets to say \nthis budget is an antichildren of the future of America budget.\n  Right now we believe every man, woman, and child is indebted $18,000 \nfor the debt that we have been incurring without regard to their \nfuture--man, woman, and child. This deficit produced in 5 successive \nyears, as he puts them together--the added deficit--will add $2 \ntrillion, I say to the occupant of the chair, to the debt; $2 trillion. \nWe think by that time the children of America will be saddled with a \n$24,000 to $26,000 debt. So let us use $26,000. It is $18,000 now. It \nwill be $26,000 because of this budget, and worse than that--which is \nignored in the comments from the White House today--while the deficit \nstays steady but does not go down, it will go skyrocketing up again. \nAnd whose responsibility is it to address that? Do we wait for our \nchildren to address that, or do we address it now? There is no question \nthat the deficit of the United States by the year 2002 will be back up \nto $321 billion.\n   [[Page S2160]] So that is what this amendment on the floor is about. \nRemember we were going to have a balanced budget by 2002. Under the \nPresident's budget it will be $321 billion. The President talks about \ngetting the deficit down, and since I was on the floor for maybe 5, 6, \nor 10 days--I do not even remember talking about the budget which the \nPresident produced the last time--in 1993 when he takes credit for \ngetting the deficit down--my projections then are now coming true. The \nnightmare that I predicted is true. It is upon us. What was the \nnightmare? The nightmare was that we will raise taxes on the American \npeople, the largest tax increase package in history, and we will not \nget the deficit under control. That is true. Most of the deficit \nreduction heretofore are tax increases and defense spending cuts. What \nabout the rest of Government? There were no cuts then, and no cuts now.\n  First of all, the President had a good handle when he ran for this \noffice, a good fix on the deficit. In 1993, when he talked to the \nAmerican people about getting it under control, he understood it very \nwell for he said we will never get the deficit under control until we \nget the health-care programs of the U.S. Government under control. That \nwas true then. That is true today.\n  The President's budget, which I have just indicated while not dead on \narrival certainly takes a walk on the important issues of our day, \ntakes a walk on the importance deficit reduction issues of our day \nbecause none of the health-care programs of the Government are \naddressed. There are no reductions in them of any significance. They \nare left to carry right on growing at somewhere between 10.5 and 11.5 \npercent a year. So why should anyone believe that this budget is a good \nbudget for America?\n  Frankly, in the midst of a solid recovery, when the signs are there \neverywhere that we have to have major reform, that we have to reduce \nthe size of our National Government, the President proposes in his \nbudget that we ought to put 300 programs together and block them into \n27 programs. Will not one think that there would be an effort to \nstreamline Government, and what else? Save money? Actually, the block \ngrants go up. Unless I can be informed to the contrary, the best I can \nfind is after going through this exercise and streamlining of \nGovernment--which is not much streamlining because you still have 27, \nyou do not give many of them back to the States--but even it is \nsupposed to be an efficiency in delivery of service measure. To improve \nthe delivery, you ought to get some savings out of it. It goes up.\n  Let me go through and quickly talk about a couple of other things \nbecause, obviously, we want to have a very constructive year. We do not \nwant to have a year when all we do is argue. But I do not believe we \nshould leave some of the things that the President talks about already, \nand in his budget, I do not believe we should leave them unanswered, \nfor when Republican Presidents issued budgets the opposition party was \nquick to talk about what was wrong with them.\n  So I repeat. This budget is a white flag on entitlement spending. \nSurrender, or at least it says, as the President of the United States, \n``I do not want to do it. It is too hard. Maybe you ought to do it, \nRepublicans.'' I think those commenting on it are already sort of \nsaying that. The President said, ``I do not want to do anything that is \ntough. Why don't you do it, Republicans? Then we will negotiate.''\n  I submit that one is contrary to what this President says all the \ntime. I mean he talks about leadership. Where is the leadership when \nyou put a white flag up to surrender to that part of the budget that \nyou know you must get under control and in doing that you kind of \nhoodwink the public that you are really getting the deficit under \ncontrol?\n  Let me move on.\n  You know, there used to be the magic asterisk, the question of \nveracity; the question of, How truthful is the budget? I would like to \njust raise a question of veracity in this budget.\n  First of all, significant problems occur in the President's budget \nproposal related to a concept that has worked heretofore. Everybody \nacknowledges that there is a new portion of the budget called pay-as-\nyou-go procedures and savings adjustments from adjusting and extending \ndiscretionary spending limits established in the current budget. So \nwhat the President has done relates to this pay-as-you-go. Let me talk \nabout it.\n  The President's budget does not reduce direct spending programs \nenough. I spoke of that on the white flag of surrender.\n So let me talk a minute. He will claim there is $28.7 billion there to \noffset reductions in tax receipts of $54.7 billion. Instead, it \nattempts to close this gap with what I will call creative accounting, \n$101 billion in discretionary spending cuts, creative accounting as to \n$101 billion in discretionary spending. In truth, the $101 billion \nsavings is overstated by nearly $90 billion. Mr. President, he takes \ncredit, through creative accounting, for $101 billion in discretionary \nspending reduction, and $90 billion of that is overstated. Following \ncurrent budget rules, the net result of the President's budget is not a \nreduction in the deficit claimed as $80 billion over 5 years, but \nrather is an increase in the deficit of between $15 billion and $20 \n  billion over that 5 years.Current law defines pay-as-you-go \nenforcement procedures that apply to direct spending and receipts. The \nPresident's budget assumes the law is changed to include discretionary \nspending in the definition of pay as you go to offset reductions in \ntaxes. Even so, the discretionary cuts are significantly overstated \nfrom inflating spending caps from 1996 to 2000. Let me repeat. Savings \nfrom discretionary spending cuts are overstated from inflating spending \ncaps from 1996 to 2000.\n  You see, if you have in place caps at this level and those caps as a \nmatter of law expire, the President lets it go back up and then claims \nthe savings. And that is $90 billion of the $101 billion. So, in \nessence, they go up and he reduces them back to where they are, and \nthrough creative accounting, that is the big savings in the budget.\n  We will get that from the Congressional Budget Office. We will ask \nthem for that. It is not Senator Domenici who ought to be saying this, \nit is officials who have at least as much prowess as the President's \nexperts but are neutral and not part of any political presentation of a \nbudget.\n  So creative accounting has created a very big credibility gap in \nterms of whether or not there are any cuts in this President's budget.\n  Let me wrap this up again by saying the deficit, under the \nPresident's proposal, will increase each year, and the public debt--\nwhich we are talking about in the constitutional amendment--will go \nfrom a 1995 level of $4.9 to $6.6 trillion--from $4.9 trillion to $6.6 \ntrillion--and the debt on each man, woman, and child will go from \n$18,000 to $26,000. The dream of our children and for our children is \ngetting stepped on once again. No action now because it is too tough; \naction later when it is too late, when the children are bearing the \nburden when we leave them little of a legacy because we do not have the \ncourage to do what we ought.\n  Frankly, without the President's leadership, I do not know where we \nare going. Frankly, I have told this Senate and the public in the \nUnited States that you will not get a balanced budget unless the \nPresident wants to cooperate with the Congress. I can tell you \nunequivocally, unabashedly, you cannot get to a balanced budget without \nthe leadership of a President. Second, you cannot get there without \nboth parties participating. It is too tough, really and politically.\n  So when you have a President who takes a walk and opposes the \nconstitutional amendment for a balanced budget, it would seem to me \nthat the expectations and hopes of the American people that we might \nfinally have arrived at a point in history when we are serious about \nthis, when we might get the deficit under control, get a balanced \nbudget, I want to warn them that the will may be there on the part of \nmany of us, but we may indeed not win this constitutional amendment \nthat would have made the President join in the team that wants to get \nit done. Obviously, some Members on the other side and this President \ndo not choose that. I think they do not choose it for a number of \nreasons. But I tell you unequivocally, absolutely, when they say they \nwill not choose it, we will never get there, and certainly we will \nnever get there with budgets like this one.\n  I yield the floor.\n   [[Page S2161]] Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Craig], is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, we have just heard Senator Domenici from \nNew Mexico, chairman of the Budget Committee here in the Senate, \noutline for us what many of us feared we would hear from this President \nas he presented his budget to the Nation which will now be presented \ntoday--statistics and facts and figures that I do not think any of us \nwanted to hear or that the American people can even begin to fathom as \nit relates to what it all means.\n  Certainly, this chart I have with me reflects exactly what the \nSenator from New Mexico, the chairman of the Budget Committee, said. \nFrom a debt structure for our country at the end of fiscal 1995 \nsomewhere in the $4.9 trillion mark to, by this President's own \nadmission with the submission of his budget today, a deficit out here \nin the outyears around the year 2002 of $6.6 trillion. What does all of \nthat mean?\n  I find it also very unique that as we debate the balanced budget \namendment here on the floor--as we have been now for well over a week, \nand as we will, maybe, for the next several weeks--that the leader of \nthe Democratic Party would come to us with an amendment that, in \nessence, says: Submit a budget in all of the detail of how you want to \nbalance the budget, and if you do not, we cannot submit a balanced \nbudget constitutional amendment as a matter of principle to the people \nfor their consideration.\n  I say that is an interesting combination, Mr. President, because as \nour colleagues on the other side of the aisle are now saying that, the \nvery leader of their party has presented a budget today that looks like \nthis as it relates to debt structure. Not even their President was \nwilling to talk about a reasonable approach toward the kind of deficit \nreduction that he himself pledged to us as a country but 1 year ago. In \nless than a year, this President has moved away from the very premise \nhe ran on, on the very budgets he proposed, on the very premise by \nwhich he pushed through one of the largest tax increases in the history \nof the country, and that is, that we would have continually declining \ndeficits toward a balanced budget, with a progressive reduction in the \nrate of debt growth for our country.\n  Mr. President, what happened? Where are you? Why did you forsake us? \nWhy did you say one thing in one budget year and now come forth with an \nentirely different approach in another budget year?\n  Well, I may sound a little hard on the President this morning. Let me \nback off a little bit and say I guess I am not surprised, because for \nthe last two decades, other Presidents have been making similar \npromises, and many of those Presidents have been Republican Presidents. \nYet, we saw the deficit and the debt structure of our country grow from \n1990, where we had a debt of around $3 trillion, now to a President \nwalking before the cameras and talking to the American people and, in a \nstraight-faced way, suggesting that this budget projected outward will \nproduce a $6.6 trillion deficit.\n  This morning in the Wall Street Journal, Stephen Moore, who is the \ndirector of fiscal policy at the Cato Institute here in Washington, \ntried to put these kinds of analyses and projections in perspective for \nthe American people. I recommend to my colleagues that they read that \narticle, because it begins to cause us to focus about why we are here \non the floor of the U.S. Senate and will be here for the next 3 weeks \ndebating a balanced budget amendment to our Constitution.\n  I ask unanimous consent that that article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From the Wall Street Journal]\n\n          If You Bought 2 Trillion Copies of This Paper * * *\n\n                           (By Stephen Moore)\n\n       Today, President Clinton releases his fiscal 1996 budget. \n     Already the Associated Press is reporting that officials \n     claim the budget ``proposes to abolish or consolidate \n     hundreds of government programs, reducing federal spending by \n     $144 billion over the next five years.'' No doubt the \n     president will firmly insist that this is the most tight-\n     fisted, penny-pinching budget in 20 years.\n       Why is this so predictable? Because this is what every \n     president since Richard Nixon has said. But 20 years ago the \n     federal budget was $370 billion. Today, Mr. Clinton will \n     request almost $1.6 trillion. Even adjusting for inflation, \n     the federal budget is twice as large as it was during the \n     last years of the Nixon presidency. Besides, without the \n     sleight of hand of baseline budgeting, President Clinton's \n     new budget calls for a $50 billion increase in spending from \n     the current budget. And that was $70 billion more than was \n     spent the year before that. Yet the budget-busting news is \n     bound to be greeted with a national yawn of unconcern.\n       Why is there more public outrage when we learn that \n     Washington wastes $100 on Al Gore's famous ashtray than that \n     it wastes nearly $1.6 trillion on everything else? Much of \n     the problem seems to be that 1\\1/2\\ trillion is an \n     incomprehensibly large number. So here are some simple ways \n     to picture how enormous the U.S. government is today:\n       One trillion dollars--$1,000,000,000,000.00. That's 12 \n     zeroes to the left of the decimal point. A trillion is a \n     million times a million. It would take more than 1\\1/2\\ \n     million millionaires to have as much money as is spent each \n     year by Congress.\n       One of the highest-paid workers in America today is \n     basketball superstar Shaquille O'Neal, who reportedly earns \n     about $30 million a season in salary and endorsements. He is \n     rich beyond our wildest imaginations. But he'd have to play \n     33,000 seasons before he earned $1 trillion. It would take a \n     Superdome full of Shaquille O'Neals to have enough to pay all \n     of Congress's bills each year.\n       Here's an experiment. What if we were to try to pay off the \n     $4 trillion national debt by having Congress put one dollar \n     every second into a special debt-buy-down account? How many \n     years would it take to pay off the debt? One million seconds \n     is about 12 days. One billion seconds is roughly 32 years. \n     But one trillion seconds is almost 32,000 years. So to pay \n     off the debt, Congress would have to put dollar bills into \n     this account for about the next 130,000 years--roughly the \n     amount of time that has passed since the Ice Age.\n       Even if we were to require Congress to put $100 a second \n     into this debt-buy-down account, it would still take well \n     over 1,000 years to pay the debt down.\n       Try this one on for size. Imagine a train of 50-foot \n     boxcars crammed with $1 bills. How long would the train have \n     to be to carry the $1.6 trillion Congress spends each year? \n     About $65 million can be stuffed in a boxcar. Thus, the train \n     would have to be about 240 miles long to carry enough dollar \n     bills to balance the federal budget. In other words, you \n     would need a train that stretches the entire Northeast \n     corridor, from Washington, through Baltimore, Delaware, \n     Philadelphia, New Jersey, and into New York City.\n       Former Office of Management and Budget Director Jim Miller \n     calculates that if a military jet were flying overhead at the \n     speed of sound and spewing out a roll of dollar bills behind \n     it, the plane would have to fly for more than 15 years before \n     it reeled out 1.6 trillion dollar bills.\n       Here's a challenging one: If you laid $1 bills from end to \n     end, could you make a chain that stretches to the moon with \n     1.6 trillion? Answer: without a sweat, with billions and \n     billions of dollars left over. In fact, they would stretch \n     nearly from the Earth to the sun.\n       The newspaper tabloids report that O.J. Simpson is paying \n     some $55,000 a day in legal fees. The trial would have to \n     last 26 million days, or almost 100,000 years, before the \n     lawyers earned $1.6 trillion.\n       This year the White House want to spend three times as much \n     as America did to win World War I, which cost roughly $500 \n     billion in today's dollars. Adjusted for inflation, the \n     combined cost of defeating the Nazis and the Japanese in \n     World War II and winning World War I was $4.5 trillion. This \n     is what Washington will spend in peacetime in just the next \n     three years to continue losing the war on poverty, drugs, \n     illiteracy, homelessness and so on.\n       So far, we've just been counting the amount Washington \n     spends each year. When state and local expenditures are \n     included, total annual government spending now surpasses $2.5 \n     trillion. That's more than $23,000 of government for every \n     household in America. In constant dollars government spends \n     twice as much per household as it did in 1960--though most \n     Americans believe that government services have deteriorated \n     since then.\n       With the $2.5 trillion government spends each year, you \n     could purchase all of the farmland in the U.S. (market value: \n     $725 billion), plus all of the stock of the 100 most \n     profitable U.S. corporations today ($1.6 trillion). You would \n     then still have just enough money left to pay the advance on \n     Newt Gingrich's book deal.\n       All of this points to one conclusion: The budget that Bill \n     Clinton is presenting today is not lean; it is not efficient; \n     it is not frugal. It is a monstrosity. It should be greeted \n     with heaps of ridicule and scorn. No matter how you stack it, \n     $1.6 trillion is a whole lot of money--even in Washington.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me take from Stephen Moore's article \nthis morning some of the examples he used as to what all of this means, \nbecause I really do believe that every Senator has been lost in the \nwoods of trillions and trillions and trillions of dollars and no longer \ndo we really understand \n [[Page S2162]] what it means for this President to come forth with a \nbudget of $1.6 trillion. And we turn and say, Mr. President, what does \nthat mean? What kind of impact will that have on the economy of this \ncountry? What does it mean to every American? Well, you heard the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee say it meant a debt structure per \ncapita in this country, per individual citizen, going from $18,000 to \n$26,000.\n  Here is another figure: A $1.6 trillion budget is representative of \nspending $23,000 for every household in America. Can you imagine that \nthis President is saying to every American who owns a home or \nhousehold--and that could be an apartment--that this Government is \ngoing to spend $23,000 per household? Well, that is what this $1.6 \ntrillion budget represents. Here is another fascinating figure. We are \nall riveted--at least some are. In all fairness, I am not too riveted \nto the television set these days watching the O.J. Simpson trial. But \nwe are told that O.J. is paying something like $55,000 a day in legal \nfees, at least that was a figure that came out several days ago.\n  Well, here is an interesting figure--$55,000 a day, that is what O.J. \napparently is paying his lawyers. Compare that to a $1.6 trillion \nbudget, the American people would be privileged to watch O.J.'s trial \nfor how many days? Twenty-six million days to get to a $1.6 trillion \nprice tag. Again, that is 100,000 years of watching O.J. and the trial. \nDoes that begin to focus what our President has just announced or will \nbe announcing today with a $1.6 trillion budget? Twenty-six million \ndays of O.J., 100,000 years at $55,000 a day.\n  Have we lost our senses? Have we lost our perspective? Yes, we have. \nAnd that is why the House 2 weeks ago, by a very large and historic \nvote, passed a balanced budget amendment to our Constitution. And that \nis why myself, the Senator from Utah, the Senator from South Carolina, \nand others for so many years have led the issue on the balanced budget \namendment. And it is why we introduced House Joint Resolution 1 here on \nthe floor and we are debating it today, because this Congress and this \nGovernment has lost its perspective. We do not know what a $1.6 \ntrillion budget is all about or what a $6.6 trillion debt is all about.\n  One trillion--12 zeros behind the deficit figure. That is equivalent \nto 1.5 million millionaires all giving up their fortune for 1 year of \nFederal budget. That is another perspective that Stephen Moore put in \nhis article that I think begins to cause us to focus on what this \nbudget is all about.\n  Now, here is another good example. I am using these this morning \nbecause I think the American public's eyes glaze. They hear us talking \nabout section 3, subsection (a). They hear us talking about the kind of \nlanguage that the Daschle amendment has in it--``aggregate levels of \nnew budget authority.'' I have a feeling that they do not understand \nthat. Frankly, not many of us understand it.\n  How about ``major functional category''? I doubt that they understand \nit. But, believe it or not, that is what the opponents to a balanced \nbudget amendment want to put in the Constitution of our country today.\n  Now here is an analysis that the American people will understand. \nAgain, it is an analysis of what $1.6 trillion means. Imagine a train, \na freight train, 50-foot boxcars, crammed with $1 bills, each boxcar \n50-foot long, crammed with $1 bills. How long would that train have to \nbe to house $1.6 trillion or President Clinton's budget?\n  Well, here is an interesting statistics. You can get about $65 \nmillion in a boxcar. Now if any of you are quick with mind and \ncalculate that, you may well be ahead of me. But my calculations and \nthe calculations of Stephen Moore of the Cato Institute suggest that \nthat is a train that is 240 miles long.\n  So, in other words, if you are thinking of the Northeast corridor \nhere of our rail system--that is from Washington, DC, through \nBaltimore, through Delaware, through Philadelphia, through New Jersey \nand into New York City--one train all hooked together, not moving, each \nboxcar 50-foot long, crammed with $1 bills, $65 million per boxcar, and \nMr. President, you got your budget--$1.6 trillion.\n  Now, I think the American people understand that analysis. I do not \nthink they understand ``aggregate level of budgetary authority.'' I \ndoubt that they understand ``account by account basis.''\n  Many Americans have read our Constitution and they understand what a \nbeautifully simple and clear document it is. They understand the \npurpose of why it is clear, so that it cannot be reinterpreted and \nmisinterpreted and reinterpreted again. And what is also very important \nis that every word that is in that Constitution does not allow the \nCongress, on a daily or yearly basis, to change the game plan or the \ndefinition of the words or the description of the program or the policy \nthat might be enshrined within the Constitution.\n  And, of course, that is exactly what the amendment that has been \npresented and is now known as the Daschle amendment does. And that is \nwhy there is no doubt that this Senate has to vote it down. We cannot \ntrivialize our Constitution. We must stay on focus as to why the \nAmerican people sent us here and to what they so profoundly said on \nNovember 8 of last year.\n  Well, let me give you another analysis. If you do not understand what \n$1.6 trillion is all about, what $6.6 trillion of debt is all about, \nwhat a debt per every American of $26,000, as their share of the \nnational debt, or a budget that spends $23,000 per American household \nis all about, here is a quote from the former Office of Management and \nBudget Director Jim Miller, who I believe headed that up under Ronald \nReagan.\n  He calculates that if a jet airplane were flying overhead at the \nspeed of sound and spewing out a roll of $1 bills behind it--that is, \nall connected together, open up the side door and drop it out and let \nit roll out across the skies of America--what would happen. Well, that \nplane would have to fly more than 15 years nonstop, airborne, \nconstantly spewing out those $1 bills all connected together to get to \n$6.6 trillion.\n  Well, people are probably beginning to say, ``Senator Craig, we have \nhad enough of that.'' But I think those are important visuals for the \nAmerican people to begin to understand what we are talking about and \nwhy a balanced budget amendment to our Constitution is so critically \nimportant.\n  Now let me for the next few minutes talk about the kind of impact \nthat this will mean to the American people, our ability as a Government \nto establish priorities and to determine those areas where Government \ndoes have a legitimate role and a responsibility to spend the tax \ndollars of this country for a variety of purposes and priorities that \nthe American people believe are necessary and essential.\n  Here is one of the greatest problems we have today with a constantly \nmounting debt. This chart represents interest on the Federal debt \nthrough the year 2005. Yes, we do borrow money and, yes, that money is \ndebt. It is real money. We owe it to someone.\n They expect a return from the money that we have borrowed from them. \n  We do pay interest.This year in the budget that the President has \njust proposed, $1.6 trillion, that ``.6,'' ``.3 of the .6'' is interest \non debt, now the second largest item in the Federal budget. It is now \ncrowding out defense, crowding out discretionary spending, like the \nmanagement, running of our Forest Service, our Department of \nAgriculture, and a variety of other programs that a lot of Americans \nthink are pretty important and pretty essential. It is just interest on \ndebt.\n  It is not buying any program. It is not putting any food in any poor \nchild's mouth. It is going out to pay for the amount of money that the \nFederal Government has already borrowed. That figure, as we know it, is \ntoday around $300 billion annually. Of course, with the growth from 4.9 \nto 6.6 in Federal debt, as this President has now sanctioned, that \nfigure will progressively grow over the next good number of years.\n  The gross interest payment exceeded, as I mentioned, in 1994, nearly \n$300 billion. This is the greater of the total outlays of the Federal \nGovernment in 1974. That is an interesting piece of history: That the \ninterest on debt in 1994 was greater than the total outlays of the \nFederal Government in 1974. Is there any reason to try to understand \nwhy the American people spoke in the election of November of last year \nwith \n [[Page S2163]] such alarm, why they rejected those who were there \nrunning again for reelection, who tried to defend the status quo?\n  I believe the American people are growing frightened of this kind of \na debt structure, fearful that their Government and its spending are \nout of control, and that there is no way to rein it in and; as a result \nof that, we could risk out here, at a $6.6 trillion debt, loss of our \nability to control our Government or our ability to pay interest, if \nnot principle, on debt.\n  Those are very real facts. That is why I believe the balanced budget \namendment passed so soundly in the House for the first time in history, \nand why I believe it can pass here in the U.S. Senate.\n  There is no doubt that we have our work cut out for Senators. As we \nwatched some of the leaders of the Senate talking on national \ntelevision in the news shows yesterday, one of them, strongly opposed \nto this, said he will speak weeks and weeks on the floor, convincing \nthe American public that what we are doing is OK, that somehow we ought \nto just keep on doing what we are doing; while he, of course, \nrecognized that reduction in deficit and control of debt was important \nand he said we ought to try to do that, too, and we ought to work \ntoward that, and he even suggested that all of the successes of the \nlast several years were producing a substantially better budget.\n  Well, I am sorry, that Senator was not right. He was wrong, if we use \nthe example of the very budget that the President is producing today, \nwhich is a reflection of the spending programs of the last several \nyears. In other words, anyone who stands on this floor in the next 3 \nweeks and opposes a balanced budget amendment to our Constitution or, \nmore importantly, the right of this Senate to agree with the House and \nsend out to the American people a balanced budget amendment for them, \nthe American people, to decide whether it ought to be a part of the \nConstitution, and whether it ought to control or bring into control the \ngrowth rate of our Federal budgets, what those people are simply \nadvocating is the status quo. They are trying to avoid the people of \nour country taking their Government back. They do not want to give up \nthe power they have: The power to spend, the power to go home and say, \n``Look what I have done for you.''\n  Well, I think the message is changing. I think the American people \nare saying something entirely different from what they have said in the \npast. The reason is very simple: They now see, as far as the eye can \nsee, the red of debt; or as far as the plane can fly, billions of \ndollars spewing out of it, year after year. Or to imagine that $1.6 \ntrillion budget really is beyond the ability of any Member to imagine \nhow much that kind of money really is.\n  We are talking about a fundamental change in the course of our \ncountry that can be produced if the Congress of the United States is \nwilling to address the demand of the public they were sent to \nrepresent. That, of course, is to pass a balanced budget amendment, and \nto send it forth to the States, and to begin a national debate across \nour country in every capital city of every State as it relates to the \nratification of that amendment, where every citizen and every State \nlegislator will begin to understand exactly what the Federal budget is \nall about and the kind of impact it has on the general economy of our \ncountry.\n  Those are the issues. Over the next several days, as we look at the \nPresident's budget, as we hear the rhetoric from the other side, \nsaying, ``We don't want a balanced budget amendment. We want business \nas usual,'' and more importantly, ``We want you to show every cut you \nwould make to balance your budget.'' We cannot even get from this \nPresident the commitment that he told Members he would honor last year \nand the year before with his budget messages, and that was to reduce \nthe deficit and to keep the deficit declining. Even this President has \nbegun to walk away from it, so reflected by his proposal and by the \nbudget that he is now presenting.\n  There will be adequate time for me to discuss other issues over the \ncourse of the next several weeks. Several other Senators are joining me \non the floor, and I certainly hope our colleagues from the other side \nwill find it today in their ability to come to the floor and defend \ntheir amendment, their motion to recommit, their motion to duck and run \nfrom a balanced budget amendment, their motion that would muddy up the \nConstitution of our country with language like ``aggregate levels,'' \nand ``major functional categories,'' language that has no business in \nthe Constitution.\n  But, more importantly, the American people cannot even begin to \nunderstand. We know what the American people understand. They \nunderstand that every day and every week and every month and every \nyear, they have to balance their checkbooks. Their budgets have to \nbalance. They have to pay their bills, or they are in trouble. And they \nare now growing fearful that our unwillingness to do so could bankrupt \nour country, their country, their future.\n  Now, that is very simple, and the American people clearly understand \nthe importance of that kind of basic economic simplicity--balancing \nbudgets, controlling debt, spending within your means.\n  I am sorry, Mr. President, your budget just does not get it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington State.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I wish to express my admiration to my \ncolleague from Idaho on the quality and clarity with which he has \noutlined both what the President proposes to Members, and the way in \nwhich that proposal illustrates better than almost anything we can say \nthe need for this constitutional amendment.\n  Last week, Mr. President, we ended the week in a debate over a motion \nby the distinguished leader of the Democratic Party that would have the \neffect of adding to this constitutional amendment for a balanced budget \na detailed set of requirements, the net result of which would be to \nmandate that the Congress pass binding laws which would lead to a \nbalanced budget by the year 2002 before the amendment itself would be \nsubmitted to the States.\n  Those requirements themselves were to become, according to the \ndistinguished Democratic leader, a part of the Constitution of the \nUnited States. Thus, they would preempt to this Congress not only the \nstatement of a general principle, but an outline of the precise \nblueprint by which a balanced budget would be reached, taking that \npower away from three Congresses that are to convene between now and \nthe year 2002, and ignoring totally whatever dynamic changes may and \nwill take place both in our economy and in our situation in the world \nduring that period of time.\n  The proposal was an improvident and unreasonable proposal, in any \nevent. The illustration as to why it was so unreasonable is best drawn \nby the budget submitted by the President of the United States since the \nDaschle motion was laid before this body.\n  The view of those of us who favor the constitutional amendment, of \ncourse, was that it was more the duty of those who defend the status \nquo, those who feel that Congress has operated responsibly, along with \nthe President, over the course of the last many years, those who feel \nthat the situation is not broke, that we do not need dramatic change, \nthat it was more their duty to tell us how they would reach a goal to \nwhich all of them give lipservice--the goal of a balanced budget--\nwithout any fundamental change in the Constitution than it was for \nthose of us who feel that the situation is flawed at the present time, \nthat the discipline that will lead to a balanced budget will not be \nimposed internally by either the President or the Congress of the \nUnited States and that, therefore, we need to change the Constitution \nitself to mandate that all of us--Republicans and Democrats, \nconservatives and liberals, Presidents and Members of Congress--work \ntogether to reach a balanced budget.\n  We attempted to make that position clear last week. I think to a \ncertain extent we did so. But the President has ended that argument for \nus by the submission of his budget. His budget, for all practical \npurposes, never, never, never will result in a budget with a deficit of \nless than $200 billion. And using the figures of the Congressional \nBudget Office, which all agreed to use earlier \n [[Page S2164]] during the course of this year, that deficit, in fact, \nwill increase very substantially, upward of $400 billion either at or \nnot long after the time that this constitutional amendment will become \neffective if promptly ratified by the States.\n  So we now have before us two starkly differing views of the fiscal \nand financial future of the United States: First, represented by those \nwho back this constitutional amendment, whose view it is that as \ndifficult as it may be it is important 7 years from now to have reached \na balanced budget or at least to make it more difficult thereafter to \nvote an unbalanced budget, as against those whose view it is that the \nFederal debt can keep on increasing by $200 billion a year, $300 \nbillion a year, $400 billion a year to infinity. These are the two \ndistinctly different points of view represented in this body that will \nbe validated, that will be evidenced by votes on final passage on this \nconstitutional amendment.\n  Once again, it is important to point out that even this amendment, \nshould it be enshrined in our Constitution, will not under any and all \ncircumstances require that the budget be balanced every year. It will \nsimply make it considerably more difficult to vote for an unbalanced \nbudget because that unbalanced budget will have to be, under almost all \ncircumstances, at least bipartisan in nature; that is to say, it will \nhave to get a 60-percent majority vote in both Houses of Congress and, \nof course, be approved by the President.\n  But the opposing point of view was outlined by the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Idaho magnificently in his remarks, as it was by my \nsenior colleague from the State of New Mexico. The opposing point of \nview is essentially: Let us give it up; let us pass a budget which does \nnot deal with entitlements in any respect whatsoever; let us pass a \nbudget which admits that even if everything comes out as favorably as \nthe administration hopes, there will never be a deficit significantly \nless than $200 billion a year.\n  To this Senator at least, that strips away the disguise that \nopponents to this constitutional amendment do wish for a balanced \nbudget but just feel that to require it by passing an amendment to the \nConstitution is too drastic a remedy. In fact, those who will support \nthe President's budget this year will be ratifying his decision that a \nbalanced budget is not necessary, is not appropriate, never needs to \ncome into being at all.\n  I may be overstating the case. It may very well be that there are \nopponents to this amendment in this body who themselves disagree with \nthe President's budget. If so, I hope that during the course of this \ndebate they will tell us how they disagree with the President's budget \nand how they propose to bring the budget into balance without the \ndiscipline of this constitutional amendment.\n  So far, no one has spoken up to that point of view. Nothing more than \nlip service to fiscal responsibility has been heard from our opponents. \nMaybe, perhaps there is an outside chance that we will hear how that \ncan be done without this joint resolution having passed, but in the \nmeantime, while our opponents have the opportunity to come up with \ntheir contrasting ideas, in the meantime, we are dealing with the \nDemocratic leader's motion to recommit and to send back out to this \nfloor not just the constitutional amendment for the balanced budget, \nbut two additional pages of material, Mr. President--two whole \nadditional pages of material--which are to go into the Constitution of \nthe United States with topical references to the Budget Act of 1974, \nwith specific requirements related to statutes--not constitutional \nprovisions--but statutes on the books at the present time, outlining in \ndetail how the Congress must reach the goal of a balanced budget by \nlaw, by changes in our fiscal policies today that will be impossible or \nat least extremely difficult to change at any time during the next 7 \nyears before this constitutional amendment is even submitted to the \npeople.\n  Leaving aside, Mr. President, the aesthetic considerations of whether \nsuch purely statutory material should ever, under any circumstances, be \nincluded in the Constitution, a proposition which I find to be \noutrageous and which I believe most constitutional scholars would find \nto be outrageous, leaving that aside, the proposal of the distinguished \nDemocratic leader is itself unconstitutional on its face.\n  As I did on Friday, I should like to leave with this body the \nspecific provisions of article V of our Constitution which deal with \nthe way in which constitutional amendments are to be added to that \ndocument. Article V, and its material portions, reads as follows:\n\n       The Congress, whenever two-thirds of both Houses shall deem \n     it necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution * \n     * * which shall be valid * * * when ratified by the \n     Legislatures of three-fourths of the several States * * *.\n\n  Mr. President, that provision does not allow for conditional \nconstitutional amendments. This motion proposes a conditional \nconstitutional amendment. It envisages, it imagines that both Houses of \nCongress with two-thirds votes will pass a long, long constitutional \namendment, far longer than any other amendment to be found in that \ndocument, but that it would not be submitted to the States until \nCongress had passed, and the President had signed, another law--a very \nlong and complicated law, a reconciliation bill--thus bringing the \nPresident into the process of amending the Constitution, something \nwhich the people who wrote the Constitution specifically ignored, \nspecifically barred.\n  This proposal says that the constitutional amendment will not be \nsubmitted to the States until that complicated reconciliation bill is \npassed, signed by the President and becomes law. That, Mr. President, \nis a clear, open and blatant violation of article V. Under article V, \nthe Congress of the United States passes a constitutional amendment. \nThe States ratify it. Nothing happens in between, no conditions \nsubsequent, no statement that this amendment will not really go to the \nlegislatures of the several States unless we do something or someone \nelse does something in between.\n  Mr. President, not only does the proposition that we should include \nsuch language in the Constitution offend the sensibilities of everyone \ndeeply concerned with that document, it is in and of itself \nunconstitutional. I believe that it should be dealt with by a \nconstitutional point of order. I am convinced that not only will all of \nthe supporters of the constitutional amendment in its present form \nuphold that constitutional point of order, but I think many of the \nopponents to the constitutional amendment would do so as well because \nthey have a deep respect, a deep respect which they have spoken to \neloquently and at length on this floor, for the Constitution, and I \ncannot imagine that they would wish to engage in such a blatantly \nunconstitutional procedure and clutter up our magnificent founding \ndocument with such language.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GORTON. I will be happy to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Let me thank the Senator from Washington for his very \nclear explanation of why so many of us are frustrated by this motion by \nthe Democratic leader and the rewriting, almost instant rewriting of an \namendment that the Senator from Washington and I and others have spent \nalmost a decade with constitutional scholars writing to make sure that \nit was extremely accurate and that it fit the mode and the style of our \nConstitution, an amendment that was thoroughly reviewed by the \nJudiciary Committee of both Houses and now all of a sudden this massive \nnew amendment with all kinds of language in it.\n  I truly appreciate, first of all, the Senator's legal mind and the \nclarity with which the Senator has spoken to this issue and pointed \nthis out. I am amazed, and I think most Senators that are now examining \nthis motion are extremely amazed, as to why would they do something \nlike this. It is not even a very good diversion. It is a tragically \npoorly written document, and they are proposing by its presentation \nthat it become a part of the Constitution. So I thank the Senator very \nmuch for that explanation and going into that kind of detail. I think \nit is terribly frustrating to the American people but, more \nimportantly, I think now Senators on this floor are becoming extremely \nfrustrated over why this kind of amendment.\n  Mr. GORTON. My friend from Idaho is entirely correct. I think in \nrecap we \n [[Page S2165]] have to say about this motion, first, the motion \nproposes that the Congress of the United States act in a profoundly \nunconstitutional manner. Second, it proposes that we add to the \nConstitution of the United States language which no serious person \ncould ever consider ought to be a part of our fundamental document of \nGovernment. Third, it proposes a course of action which is \nirresponsible. We are dealing with a general principle that budgets \nought to be balanced. Obviously, if Congress and the States put that in \nthe Constitution, everyone--Presidents, Democrats, Republicans--\ntogether will have to work to meet that constitutional obligation. The \ndetails of one particular method of reaching that goal, when there are \na multitude of such matters, should play no role in this debate.\n  But, fourth, it seems to me it was designed to hide what many must \nhave known would be the President's total and abject failure to come up \nwith an alternate method of reaching this goal without a constitutional \namendment. We now know that the alternate method is never to have a \nbalanced budget--in fact, never to get the budget deficit significantly \nbelow $200 billion a year.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield again? Is it not true that as we \nwrite proposed constitutional amendments, the one concern we have is \nthat the wording that goes into those amendments is not something that \nfalls within the purview of the Congress on a daily basis? By that I \nmean they could simply rewrite or change a law and it would change the \nmeaning of it. The Constitution, as we know it and as we are certainly \npledged to uphold, is a document that we are constantly trying to \ncomply with instead of change.\n  The language that is put in the Daschle amendment used, as I \nmentioned earlier, and as the Senator has mentioned, and the Senator \nfrom Utah mentioned--the word ``aggregate'' sums, and it used a variety \nof other words that, is it not true, every year the Congress could pass \nby a majority vote here in the Senate and the House and change the \ndefinition and therefore change the approach of the amendment itself?\n  Mr. GORTON. We could certainly do so, and undoubtedly we could \nprovide employment to numerous constitutional scholars and courts to \neither interpret what we had said in the constitutional amendment and \nwhat we said in the later statute, or whether or not the two \ncorresponded with one another. We have examples of this kind of \nConstitution writing in many States which have constitutions that did \ngo into statutory detail that are 4, 5, 10 times longer than the \nConstitution of the United States and are universally criticized as not \nstating general principles.\n  The original House Joint Resolution 1, on which the Senator from \nIdaho has worked so diligently over the years, is cast in Constitution-\ntype language. Members can agree or disagree with the fundamental \nprinciple that it establishes, but it does deal with a fundamental \nprinciple. This proposal by the Democratic leader deals with nothing at \nall that is fundamental, and it takes its language out of a statute \nwhich has been changed several times since it was originally passed in \nthe mid-1970's. It does not belong in the Constitution of the United \nStates.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator for yielding and responding.\n  Mr. GORTON. And I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, one message that Tennessee has conveyed to \nme in very clear terms over the past years and most recently over the \nweekend as I traveled in east Tennessee is that they want a balanced \nFederal budget, and they believe and they know that the only way to \naccomplish this is through passage of the balanced budget amendment.\n  Tennesseeans and the American people in general understand full well \ntoday the consequences that will result from further irresponsible \ndeficit spending--rising long-term interest rates, lower productivity, \nand deteriorating living standards. They understand full well that with \nFederal spending on auto pilot, the debt continues to grow, interest \nrates will continue to escalate, and we cannot guarantee that in the \nfuture there will be enough money to fund Social Security.\n  Gross interest on the debt is now the second-largest single Federal \nspending item after Social Security. Mr. President, the American people \nunderstand full well that balancing the Federal budget will not be \neasy; there will be tough choices to make. But their message to \nWashington is that they as individuals make tough choices every day. \nThey balance their own budgets and they expect the Federal Government \nto do likewise.\n  Mr. President, this is not a problem that will disappear. It must be \naddressed now, by this Congress. The last vote on the balanced budget \noccurred in March 1994, just last year. Since that time, just a year \nago, the national debt has increased by more than $160 billion.\n  We spent almost six times as much on net interest payments on the \ndebt in 1994 as we did on total outlays on all Federal job training, \neducation, and employment programs combined.\n  Mr. President, we have two choices. We can continue the reckless and \ndestabilizing policy of deficit spending as we have seen in the \nPresident's budget as proposed today, or we can reverse our course and \nbegin pursuing a responsible fiscal agenda. The first important step \ntoward restoring fiscal discipline is to adopt a balanced budget \namendment.\n  But there are those who oppose the balanced budget amendment. They \nsay if our Founders had intended a constitutional requirement for a \nbalanced budget they would have put it in the original document. This \nargument ignores history. The writings of some of our early leaders \nlike Thomas Jefferson revealed that paying off the Federal debt and \nbalancing the budget was critical to them. It was second nature. It was \nsomething they took as a given. They did not and could not anticipate \nthe gross fiscal irresponsibility of future generations of Congress. If \nthey had, I believe they would have included in the Constitution a \nrequirement that the Federal budget be balanced each year.\n  Still others who oppose the balanced budget amendment say, ``Well, \nfirst tell us what you will cut before we vote on it.'' But this \nargument misses the point. If Congress had the discipline to decide and \nagree upon where the cuts would be made without being forced to do so, \nthe budget would be balanced today and we would not need a balanced \nbudget amendment. That is precisely the point. Congress cannot agree \nand Congress does not have the discipline and the American people today \nrecognize that. That is why they demanded that the balanced budget \namendment be passed. Moreover, we will learn as we go. We will \ndetermine what reforms work, which programs should be repealed. The \nplan will be flexible, designed to deliver Government services as \nefficiently as possible. We should not tie our hands before we decide \nto pass the balanced budget amendment.\n  I spent the last 18 years of my life in medicine, transplanting \nhearts and lungs into patients who were dying, whose futures had been \ndestroyed. Many of my heart transplant patients recognized that they, \ntoo, faced a choice. They could undergo an enormously difficult \nsurgery, endure tremendous pain and a long and difficult recovery but \nthey would have a chance at a good future. They would have the \nopportunity to live. Or, on the other hand, they could decide to forgo \nsurgery and die--with no future, no opportunity.\n  Those patients did not ask me to describe to them what would happen \non each day of that difficult recovery period after surgery, after \ntheir operations. They knew it would be tough. And they knew they had \nno choice if they wanted that new opportunity, if they wanted a new \nfuture. They first made the decision to undergo the operation. Then \nthey dealt with the day-to-day hardships of recovery.\n  Our situation today is somewhat analogous. Our country is literally \nhemorrhaging from the enormous debt under which we labor. We are \nthreatening future generations. We are threatening the future of our \nchildren. We are threatening our Social Security system. And we are \nthreatening our ability to lead the way in the global economy of the \n21st century.\n   [[Page S2166]] Individual Americans and most State governments live \nwith a balanced budget. It is time the Federal Government do likewise.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the balanced budget \namendment, not only because I favor the concept of a balanced budget \namendment but because, it seems to me, it is one of the building blocks \nof the kind of change that American voters asked for in November; a \nprocedural change that not only will change the specifics of what is \ndone but, over time, will change the character of this Federal \nGovernment and will deal with the basic question, How do we achieve \nless Government and a less expensive Government? It is one of the \nprocedural changes I think is necessary, one of the procedural changes \nthat will have to be dealt with--some of which we have already dealt \nwith.\n  We need a balanced budget amendment to put some honesty and truth \nback into our budgeting, too, to deal with the question of whether or \nnot it is morally right to spend more than we take in. The answer, of \ncourse, is it is not.\n  The other, of course, is unfunded mandates, which this body has dealt \nwith, as has the House. We will soon be reconciled in conference \ncommittee.\n  I think a line-item veto is another of these building blocks, along \nwith congressional accountability, which has also been passed here. So \nwe are making real progress toward fundamental change, the kind of \nchange that will have long-range impacts on this Government, that will \nhave a long-range impact on the transfer of power to local and State \ngovernments, that will have a long-range impact on transferring power \nto individuals as this Government was set up to do.\n  So I rise in favor of this as one of the building blocks. It is not a \nnew idea. It is something many of us have favored for a very long time. \nIt is basic to change. We can talk a lot about the details, as the \nSenator from Tennessee pointed out. The real question, of course, is \nshould we balance the budget? Should we be fiscally responsible? Should \nwe pass along debts to our children and our grandchildren? Or should we \nbe responsible for them ourselves? Should we take account of the fact \nthat our credit card is maxed out and be responsible for the decisions \nwe make? Should we be forced to have a cost-benefit ratio on the issues \nwe talk about? If they are worth having, they are worth paying for. If \nwe are only willing to put them on the credit card, then we cannot do \nthat. That is what balanced budget amendments are all about, to bring \nabout the fundamental change.\n  However, and I take a little from Bill Bennett when he said: We, now, \nin this new Congress, are allowed to consider the concept that \neverything that is worthwhile, everything that is good has to be \ncontrolled and funded by the Federal Government. That is a concept that \nhas slipped into our society that does not need to be there.\n  So I rise in strong support of the balanced budget amendment. We \nhear, of course, it is not needed. The evidence is that it is. We hear, \nof course, there are tools there to accomplish that without a balanced \nbudget amendment. There is no evidence of that, even in the President's \nbudget, which was made public today. There is no evidence of that.\n  One of the things we seem to lose sight of as we talk about the \ndeficit--and talk about it we should--is the fact that spending has \nincreased each year. Spending increases to $1.6-plus trillion under the \nPresident's budget. The President talks about the administrative \nefforts to reduce the deficit, which have been useful. Nevertheless, \nspending has continued to increase all throughout that. We seldom hear \nthe reduction in deficit is generally a one-time proposition, where \nthere was a revision of some projected spending that gave us most of \nthe deficit reduction. So people ask for change. People want less \nGovernment, less spending, and lower taxes. This will help do that.\n  We hear we need more time. This is not a new idea. This is one we \nhave talked about for years. Most people have known this has been \nnecessary for years. I have no objection to full discussions. I begin \nto wonder whether this is full discussion or simply delaying. \nNevertheless we are here, prepared to do that.\n  We hear occasionally if we have an amendment, judges will be setting \nthe budget. There is no evidence of that. I think 49 States have \nbalanced budget amendments. My State of Wyoming has a balanced budget \namendment. It has a balanced budget amendment in the constitution. It \nis very simple. In section 1 of article 16 it says:\n\n       The State of Wyoming shall not in any manner, create any \n     indebtedness exceeding 1 per centum on the assessed value of \n     the taxable property in the State * * * except to suppress \n     insurrection or to provide for the public defense.\n\n  It has been very satisfactory. The legislature knows this is your \nincome, this is your expenditure. You have to make it fit.\n  The balanced budget, I believe, was one of the primary reforms we \nwere sent here to consider, that we were sent here to pass. We are not \nmoving toward it without the balanced budget amendment--$1.6 trillion \nin spending next year more than last year, with a projected deficit of \napproximately $200 billion until the year 2002 with no appreciable \nchange of where we have been. This is not the kind of change that \npeople asked us for when we were sent here in November. Those of us who \njust ran this year I think have a particularly clear picture of what \nvoters were talking about. There are 11 new freshmen in this body, all \n11 of whom support the balanced budget amendment. I think that says \nsomething about it.\n  Mr. President, I hope we continue to work on this issue. I hope we \ncome to a resolution before long. I think there is a limit to the \nproductive discussion and debate. We need to consider those things that \nare real. We do not need to spend a great deal of time simply \npostponing a decision that needs to be made, and which needs to be made \nfor the good of this country.\n  There are additional Senators on the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate the Senator from \nWyoming for his excellent statement on the issue of a balanced budget \namendment. It is one which I hope Senators will listen to closely. The \nSenator has I think outlined some critical issues that this Senator is \ndiscussing as we move down the road to determine whether or not we are \ngoing to pass this critical piece of legislation.\n  I want to rise on an ancillary issue dealing with the balanced budget \namendment, dealing more importantly with the budget which we are going \nto have to pass this year as the Senate and as a Congress.\n  Today, the President laid before the American people his budget \nproposal, and, to say the least, it was not a document that would \nexcite a whole lot of interest or enthusiasm from a variety of \ndifferent quarters, including many within his own party it appears.\n  It is difficult to presume that here in the late 20th century a \nPresident of the United States could be deemed irrelevant, and \ncertainly some of the pundits in the national media, however, have \nreflected on that question. I do not believe that can occur to a \nPresidency in the late 20th century; become irrelevant.\n  Yet, when you read this budget proposal that the President has put \nforward, you have to say that he has left the field of play on what is \nprobably the most important issue which we have to face as a nation and \nas a people; that is, how we manage our fiscal house, and what we do \nfor our children relative to managing our fiscal house, or, more \nappropriately, what we do to our children in managing our fiscal house.\n  As we all know, because this debate on the balanced budget has been \ngoing on for a considerable amount of time, and regrettably will \nprobably go on for an additional period of time--a couple of weeks--the \ndebt of this Nation has exploded. And it is a debt which is going to be \nborne by the next generation. As we allow it to expand further and \nfurther by each year running a Federal deficit, we put a greater burden \non the next generation.\n   [[Page S2167]] It is getting to the point where many of the economic \nscholars who are leaders in this country are concluding that as we move \ninto the period 2010 to 2020 this Nation will face financial \nbankruptcy. Our children, instead of being raised in a country which is \nthe force, the economic engine of the world, will find themselves in \ntheir earning years in a nation which is scrambling to keep up, a \nnation which is feeding itself from hand-to-mouth potentially. \nPotentially we could end up like Mexico is today, as a nation whose \ndebts have skyrocketed so quickly that it is no longer able to service \neven an interest on its debts.\n  It is a fact that, if we continue to drive the debt, the present \ndeficit which we have in the budget as proposed by the President is \nexactly what will occur: That some time around the year 2020 we simply \nwill not be able to finance the Government of the United States because \nso much of the funds of the Government of the United States and \nrevenues will be absorbed by interest costs on the Federal debt. Around \nthe year 2015 or 2017 the revenues of the Federal Government will only \nbe enough to cover four items in the Federal budget: Social Security, \npension benefits, health care, and interest on the national debt. And \nall other functions within the Federal Government will not be paid \nfor--national defense, education, caring for the sick, the elderly, \ncaring for the less fortunate. All of those items will be beyond our \nmeans to pay for. We will as a nation be bankrupt.\n  If you are going to address that issue in the outyears, you have to \naddress it beginning today. Yet, this President has consciously decided \nto put forward a document which makes absolutely no substantive attempt \nto address the deficit which we are confronting as a nation. Not only \ndoes it not attempt to address it and to reduce it, it actually accepts \nas a fait accompli that we will have deficits for as far as the eye can \nsee of a dramatic nature.\n  The number that they use is $200 billion a year for 5 years every \nyear; $200 billion a year. Even I, in my elementary level of \nmathematics, recognize that is $1 trillion of new debt that this \nPresident has decided is acceptable to pass on to our children. That is \na huge cost and a huge burden to put on them. But worse than that, no \nattempt is made in the budget proposal of the President to address the \nunderlying structural causes which are driving that debt. No attempt is \nmade to address those elements of the Federal budget which are causing \nus to run the $200-plus billion deficits. As a result, when you get \npast that 5-year window that is the timeframe that budgeteers use \naround here, that $200 billion debt starts to geometrically progress, \nand we find that we have a deficit in terms of $300, $400 billion, \npotentially even $500 billion, as we move into the next decade because \nnothing is being done to slow that growth in the budget proposed by the \nPresident.\n  It was a conscious decision. That is I think what bothers me the \nmost. It was a conscious decision made by the leader of this Nation to \nwalk away from seriously addressing how we deal with this, the most \ncritical issue that we as a nation have relative to passing on our \nconcerns and well-being to the next generation. It was a conscious \ndecision.\n  The President has decided--and I find this ironic because he has \ndecided to do this in the context of raising the visibility of the \nbaseball strike while he moves onto the back burner his budget plan. \nThe President has decided to walk away from the budget process, the \nissue of addressing the deficit, and, as his smokescreen so that \nhopefully the public will not notice this most egregious act of \nmalfeasance he has raised the visibility of his participation in the \nbaseball strike.\n  Well, that is very nice. We all want to see baseball played again in \nthe United States. I am sure we will, and we will probably see it \nsooner rather than later. But I have to say that for the children of \nthis country who enjoy baseball, much more important to their future is \ntheir capacity to have a job, to raise a family, and to live in a \nprosperous nation when they reach adulthood. And by walking away from \nthe field of addressing the budget deficit, the President has gone well \ndown the road toward undermining the future of those children.\n  Baseball terms do come to mind when you think of what is happening \nhere, when you think of what this administration is doing on the issue \nof debt, terms like ``walk,'' ``strikeout,'' ``whipped,'' ``misplay,'' \n``wrong field.'' I think the one that probably most aptly describes it, \nhowever, is ``another down the first baseline.'' That is what this \nbudget is, another down the first baseline--$200 billion of deficit \nbeing accepted as a fait accompli for the next 5 years, $1 trillion in \nnew debt added to the Nation's already staggering debt for our children \nto pay. That certainly is not even a single. It is not even a double \nplay. It is another down the first baseline of the budget.\n  Worse than that, they could not even come to $200 billion without \nusing gimmicks. They claim $100 billion of spending cuts in this \nbudget, with great fanfare. I heard the Director of the Office of \nManagement and Budget today saying we have saved $100 billion in this \nbudget, and we are going to take $63 billion, and we are going to give \nit to a tax deduction. Well, $100 billion is not saved in this budget. \nIt is an accounting adjustment, a game of numbers shift.\n They take the caps off, then they put the caps on. These are technical \nterms, but basically what it is, is a shell game of maneuvering numbers \n  around, which produces $90 billion in savings--allegedly.They are not \nreal savings. They are savings we are going to incur anyway. We have \nalready taken credit for them, and as a practical matter we would take \ncredit for them. The fact that they are scoring them is a reflection of \ntheir insincerity in the entire process, which I guess is driven by a \ndesire of this administration for reelection, exceeding its desire to \naddress the issues it was elected to address. That is unfortunate. \nIrrelevant? No, but clearly not participating in its opportunities to \nlead, would be a way to define this administration's proposal on the \nbudget.\n  So what do we do? Well, we have a Republican Congress now and, \nobviously, the pollsters for the President have said to the President, \nlet us just leave it to them, let them do it. Then we will play off the \nthings we like and the things we dislike, we will attack and set up a \npolitical confrontation and, as a result, we will gain many points from \nthe American people because we will be on the offensive against the \nRepublicans, who are attempting to address the deficit responsibly.\n  I suppose our response in the Senate or in the House could be, well, \nwe can play that game, too. We can put forth budgets which are \nstructured on poll numbers versus being structured on the need for the \nfuture of our country and our children. But I hope we will not. I hope \nthat, as a party, we will come forward with an aggressive budget and I \nexpect we will because we have the type of leadership it takes to do \nthat, leaders in the House and in the Senate. Senator Domenici and \ncertainly the majority leader of the Senate, Senator Dole, I do not \nthink, are going to opt to bunt, hit a number, to balk, or leave the \nfield. I expect we will come forward with a very aggressive proposal to \ntry to address the deficit. It will be one which has to address, if it \nis going to be successful, the core issues of what is driving spending \nin the country today, as far as Federal accounts are concerned.\n  Fifty-five percent of the Federal Government today is represented by \nentitlements. Entitlements are programs where you have a right as a \ncitizen to receive a payment under that program because you meet \ncertain qualifications under the law. Discretionary spending represents \na significantly smaller percentage of the Federal budget. You cannot \nbalance this budget, or even make a significant downpayment on the need \nto balance the budget, or at least bring down the deficit, \nunless you are willing to address entitlement spending--\nsomething which the President has absolutely refused to recognize or \nacknowledge or do in his own budget, and which reflects the cynical, \nreally, approach that his budget takes toward addressing the financial \nconcerns of this country.\n  How do you address entitlements? Well, we have, for a variety of \nreasons, taken Social Security off of the table--probably the real \nreason is because every time it is put on the table, one side or the \nother demagogs the issue so \n [[Page S2168]] badly that somebody ends up a terrible loser in the \nfight over how you address Social Security. As a practical matter, \nSocial Security is not driving the deficit, so there is no huge \nmomentum to take it up. It is not like in 1983 when the Social Security \ntrust fund was about to go bankrupt and we were able to put together a \nbipartisan effort under the leadership of President Reagan and \nCongressman Pepper and came forward with the Pepper Commission, which \nmade the fund not only solvent but put it into a position of surplus, \nas it is today. Today because the fund is actually putting in more \nmoney than it is taking out, there is no immediate need to address \nSocial Security. And we will not, for political reasons and because of \nthat substantive reason, other than, I hope, we will look at the \npayroll tax, because we are generating these huge revenue surpluses and \nthere is no reason to be subjecting people to what is one of the most \nregressive taxes we have in this country at its present level, when it \nis generating surplus. We should be considering reducing the payroll \ntax, at least for low- and moderate-income individuals.\n  But there are other entitlement accounts which have to be addressed. \nLook at them. Independent of Social Security, 55 percent of those \naccounts are health care accounts, 20 percent are pension accounts, \nabout 20 percent are welfare accounts, and about 10 percent are the \nrest, including agriculture. There are significant things that can be \ndone in all of those areas, which would dramatically reduce--especially \nin the outyears--the rate of growth of the cost of those programs and \nin many instances would also significantly improve the quality of those \nprograms and the beneficiaries' lifestyle under those programs.\n  Take, for example, the issue of welfare. The Governors have come to \nus and said, essentially--this is a capsulization--all right, if you \nwill give us control over the welfare programs, which have been an \nabject failure--has anything been more of a failure in the liberal \nwelfare state than welfare itself? I am not aware of anything else, if \nit has. After 40 years of the most expansive Federal control over \nwelfare, we have seen a society where we have more poor, more \nillegitimate births, more women living in poverty, where we have more \nbureaucracy, and where we have more disillusionment and lack of hope \namongst those on welfare than we started out with 40 years ago. That \nhas been a function of the liberal welfare state applying its largess \nand compassion to a system in a manner which has failed miserably.\n  So the Governors came to us and said: Give us these programs and \nallow us to manage them, give us flexibility, and we will take less \ndollars. That sounds like a pretty good deal to me. What we have now is \nnot working and is costing a lot more. So let us take the Governors up \non their offer.\n  Did the President do that in his budget proposal? No. Even the \nPresident, who is a former Governor and who made welfare one of his \nprimary concerns, did not have the fortitude to take that step. Why? \nBecause his pollsters probably told him: You are going to upset one of \nconstituency groups, so let us stay away from that and let the \nRepublican Congress handle that and make the tough decisions. If they \ncome up with a program that works, we will put our imprimatur on it and \nget credit for it. If not, we will use it in the next campaign. That is \nnot what you call leadership, to say the least.\n  As a practical matter, we, as Republicans, can take the Governors up \non their offer. We can save considerable money, and I will guarantee \nyou that a welfare program--at least in my State, administered by my \nState--free of Federal oversight, Federal regulation, bureaucracy and \nthe incredible costs and inefficiency. The Federal Government will be \nable to deliver more dollars to the welfare recipient in a more \nefficient and better way than we do today. Welfare recipients will \nbenefit dramatically from that system. We can take the issues of what \nwe do in the future as part of the entitlement question.\n  Prospectively, programs can be changed around here to make them more \ncost-efficient. In the area of new hires coming into the Government, \nnew hires coming into the military, we can change the retirement system \nto make it more reasonable and more in line with what the private \nsector has and save considerable money in the outyears.\n  In the area of health care, there is a great deal that can be done. I \nknow we are going to have a lot of discussion about this. There is a \ngreat deal that can be done that will positively impact--\nespecially the senior citizens who take part in the Medicare Program \ntoday--and still save money. Well, of course, everyone from the liberal \ncamp says that cannot be; you cannot save money and positively impact \nsomebody. Yes, you can. You can create incentives in the marketplace, \nwhich give senior citizens better health care, more comprehensive \nhealth care than they are getting today, which saves money for the \nsenior citizen and for the Federal Government.\n  There will be proposals along that line. One that I happen to like is \none where I have coined a phrase called ``choice care,'' where we \nactually give seniors significant choices. We do not take away any \nchoices they presently have; we give them more choices. When they make \nchoices that are cost beneficial to us and them, we do not allow them \nto lose their present health care plans. We add to them with this \nchoice care. When they make those choices, we see savings, they see \nsavings and better care, and we get some controls over the cost of the \nentitlements.\n  Well, how can that be? Because there are senior citizens who come \nfrom a culture of fee-for-service that is the most significant and \nexpensive form of health care. To the extent we can change that culture \nand encourage our seniors, through incentive systems of better care and \nlower costs which they benefit from, to move into other forms of \ndelivery than fee-for-service, we save money and we reduce the cost of \nentitlements.\n  And in the area of Medicaid, which goes to people who are essentially \non welfare, as health care coverage, again we can join with the States \nas partners and Governors and come forward with a proposal and save a \ndramatic amount of money.\n  Again, the President has ignored all these fields of opportunity for \nthe sake of putting forward a political budget.\n  In the area of farm price control supports, we can also do a \nsignificant amount, although this is not a large part of the budget.\n  In the area of pensions, we can do a significant amount, and we will. \nThat is our purpose. We have an obligation to do this. If we do not do \nit, it will be our children who will pay the price and it will be a \nprice which will be unconscionable, unthinkable to have passed on to \nthem. So we must do it.\n  You know, over the last month, I have listened, from the other side \nof the aisle, to a number of presentations made very well and very \neloquently, I think, especially from the Senator from North Dakota, who \nhas come down here a couple of times with a number of charts and made \nextraordinarily strong presentations on the size and the projection of \nthe Federal deficit. And it is staggering.\n  I say to those Senators, they must be embarrassed by this \npresentation by the President. Those folks who are trying to \nconscientiously raise the issue of how bad the deficit is and how \nsomething must be done about it must be embarrassed that the President \nof the United States would present a budget which essentially accepts \n$1 trillion of new debt over the next 5 years as an acceptable event \npassed on to our children.\n  The President of the United States would walk off the playing field \nof responsible activity in the area of trying to manage this deficit \nand, as the Wall Street Journal said, punt the ball. It is not really a \npunt. It is a punting punt. It does not even qualify as a punt; more \nlike a missed kick. But it is inappropriate, whatever it is, because if \nthis Nation is not going to be able to survive as a prosperous and \ndecent place in which to raise and have a family, it is not going to be \nable to fulfill the American dream or even hold out the American dream \nto its people unless we address this deficit.\n  Regrettably, this President has decided that he, as the leader of \nthis country, has no obligation to lead in this area. And that is a \nmistake\n  Mr. President, I yield back my time.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n   [[Page S2169]] Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, the Senator from New \nHampshire laid down eloquently the problems that we have with respect \nto spending. I think it is interesting and informative, however, to \nknow that those are not new problems. Those are problems that were \nthought about by those who fashioned this Constitution.\n  Let me read a couple of quotes from Thomas Jefferson that seem to me \nto be relevant.\n\n       The question whether one generation has the right to bind \n     another by the deficit it imposes is a question of such \n     consequence as to place it among the fundamental principles \n     of Government. We should consider ourselves unauthorized to \n     saddle posterity with our debts, and morally bound to pay \n     them ourselves.\n\n  That question continues today. That is what we are talking about.\n  Further, he said:\n\n       I wish it were possible to obtain a single amendment to our \n     Constitution. I would be willing to depend on that alone for \n     the reduction of the administration of our Government to the \n     genuine principles of the Constitution; I mean an additional \n     article, taking from the Federal Government the power of \n     borrowing.\n\n  Thomas Jefferson indicated that.\n  Mr. President, I yield back my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to continue the debate on \nthis historic opportunity to adopt House Joint Resolution 1, the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  Over the past week we have heard many eloquent speakers on the need \nto pass a balanced budget amendment and bring this Nation's fiscal \npolicy under control. It has been especially encouraging to see our \nfreshman colleagues take to the floor and urge this body to adopt a \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. President, I am opposed to the motion to recommit with \ninstructions offered by the minority leader, Senator Daschle. The \nlanguage of his proposed substitute amendment would be a cumbersome \naddition to the U.S. Constitution. His proposed amendment to the \nConstitution reads more like Federal regulations or a statute rather \nthan part of the great document which governs this Nation.\n  Undoubtedly, it is the desire of every Member who supports the \nbalanced budget amendment to see the Federal budget deficit eliminated \nthat we may begin to cut away at the Federal debt which currently \nstands at $4.8 trillion--I repeat, $4.8 trillion. Without a balanced \nbudget amendment, there has been little pressure on the Congress to \nmake tough legislative choices on Federal spending and the Federal \ndeficit has continued to grow. With a balanced budget amendment as part \nof the Constitution, the Congress would understand the reality that \nthere are a finite number of tax dollars available for public spending \nand various proposals would compete on merit and need, not popularity.\n  The balanced budget amendment would instill an urgent need for \nlegislative accountability as Congress considers various proposals for \nincreased Federal spending. Currently, there is no real check on \nrunaway Federal spending, and there will never be a shortage of \nlegislation creating new Federal programs or efforts to increase \nspending in existing programs. Without a balanced budget amendment, \nbudget deficits over the long term will continue to rise and the \nFederal debt will continue to grow. The Congress has not shown the \nfortitude to address, in a meaningful way, the budget deficit and the \nFederal debt. There have been times when gestures were made to bring \nspending within our means but those efforts were short lived. Statutes \nto reduce Federal spending have not been enough. They are too easily \ncast aside and the Congress rolls along on its path of fiscal \nirresponsibility.\n  I am convinced that without the mandate of a balanced budget \namendment, Federal spending will continue to eclipse receipts and the \nAmerican people will continue to shoulder inordinate tax burdens to \nsustain an indefensible congressional appetite for spending. In 1950, \nan average American family with two children sent $1 out of every $50 \nit earned to the Federal Government. Today, the average American family \nis sending $1 out of every $4 it earns to the Federal Government. Under \ncurrent budget projections, there is no reason to believe that these \nstatistics will improve.\n  Mr. President, we can trace the debate on a balanced budget amendment \nback in our history for 200 years. A defining moment may well have been \nthe appointment of Thomas Jefferson as Minister to France. Thomas \nJefferson was abroad when the Constitution was written and he did not \nattend the Constitutional Convention. If Jefferson had been in \nattendance, it is quite possible that he would have been successful in \nhaving language placed in the Constitution to limit the spending \nauthority of the Federal Government. Upon studying the Constitution, \nThomas Jefferson wrote in a letter of a change he so fervently believed \nshould become part of the Constitution. He wrote the following:\n\n       I wish it were possible to obtain a single amendment to our \n     Constitution. I would be willing to depend on that alone for \n     the reduction of the administration of our Government to the \n     genuine principles of its Constitution. I mean an additional \n     article taking from the government the power of borrowing.\n\n  Further, Jefferson stated:\n\n       To preserve our independence, we must not let our rulers \n     load us with perpetual debt. We must make our election \n     between economy and liberty, or profusion and servitude.\n\n  Another former President, Andrew Jackson stated the following:\n\n       Once the budget is balanced and the debts paid off, our \n     population will be relieved from a considerable portion of \n     its present burdens and will find * * * additional means for \n     the display of individual enterprise.\n\n  Preisdent Harrison described unnecessary public debt as ``criminal.''\n  Mr. President, early American Presidents and public leaders \nunderstood the dangers of excessive public debt. For almost 150 years, \nbalanced budgets or budget surpluses were the fiscal norm\nfollowed by the Federal Government. The unwritten rule followed by \nPresidents and legislators until recently in our Nation's history was \nto achieve balanced budgets except in wartime. But the role and the \nsize of the Federal Government has grown out of control. In the past \nthree decades, the Federal Government has run deficits in every year \nexcept one. Further, the Federal Government has run deficits in 56 of \n  the last 64 years.Mr. President, during the 1960's, deficits were \naveraging around $6 billion per year. The following decade, the 1970's, \nsaw deficits rise and they averaged $36 billion per year. In the last \ndecade, the 1980's, deficits continued to rise and averaged $156 \nbillion per year. So far, in the 1990's, deficits have averaged $259 \nbillion per year.\n  The Federal debt has grown as deficits have continued to grow and the \ndebt now stands at $4.8 trillion. It took this Nation over 200 years to \nrun the first trillion-dollar debt yet we have recently been adding \nanother trillion dollars to our debt about every 5 years.\n  I have been deeply concerned during my time in the Senate over the \ngrowth of the Federal Government. It has been too easy for the Congress \nto pass legislation creating new Federal programs and spending more tax \ndollars whenever there is a call for Federal intervention. Of course, \nthe Federal Government has an appropriate role to protect the citizens \nof this Nation, but it is not realistic to believe that Washington \nshould respond to every perceived problem with a new Federal approach. \nThis Nation has drifted from its original foundations as a national \ngovernment of limited authority. I believe the adoption of a balanced \nbudget amendment will do much to return us to a more decentralized \nFederal Government of limited authority and the mandates of such an \namendment will increase legislative accountability. A balanced budget \namendment is the single most important addition we can propose to the \nConstitution to begin reducing the size of the Federal Government.\n  Mr. President, we have seen the national debt and deficits rise \nbecause in large part, the Federal Government has grown. The first $100 \nbillion budget in the history of the Nation occurred in 1962. This was \nalmost 180 years after the Nation was founded. Yet, it took only 9 \nyears, from 1962 to 1971, for the Federal budget to reach $200 \nbillion. \n[[Page S2170]] Then, the Federal budget continued to skyrocket; $300 \nbillion in 1975, $500 billion in 1979, $800 billion in 1983, and the \nfirst $1 trillion budget in 1987. The budget for fiscal year 1995 was \nover $1.5 trillion. Federal spending has gripped Congress as a narcotic \nbut it is time to break the habit and restore order to the fiscal \npolicy of this Nation.\n  It is incumbent upon this body to send the balanced budget amendment \nto the American people for ratification. The vote on final passage on \nHouse Joint Resolution 1 could well be the most important vote we will \nface as Senators as its adoption is essential for protecting our \nliberties as a free nation. I hope we don't fail the American people on \nthis historic opportunity and instead present to the States our \nproposed amendment to mandate balanced budgets. it is time to act to \nsecure the future for all Americans.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, efforts have been made to portray the \nright-to-know amendment as constitutionally questionable. Those claims \nare driven by politics. The argument is not compelled by the \nConstitution.\n  The Constitution sets out two requirements for the approval of an \namendment. It must be approved by two-thirds of each House of the \nCongress, and it must be ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths \nof the States.\n  The Constitution sets no other limits.\n  All we are proposing is that the Constitution be amended in the same \nway it has been amended 27 times before, with a two-thirds \ncongressional majority in each House.\n  Ironically, the underlying proposal itself contains a clearly extra-\nconstitutional provision: That if it is not ratified within 7 years, \nits provision will not take effect, no matter how many State \nlegislatures thereafter desire to approve it. It is a time-limited \nproposal.\n  The time limitation is not a constitutional requirement. It is a \ncustomary requirement.\n  There is no warrant in the Constitution for such a time limit or \nagainst such a time limit. It has been used in this century as a way to \nensure reasonably contemporaneous consideration of proposals to change \nthe Constitution. It is a good idea, but it is not a constitutional \nrequirement.\n  Indeed, if we look at the 27th amendment, having to do with \ncongressional pay, which was revived and ratified by the States 200 \nyears after first being proposed to them, and which is now part of the \nConstitution, it is quite clear that there is no constitutional \nimpediment to ratifying an amendment outside the time constraints that \nhave been common in our century.\n  Opponents of the right-to-know amendment claim that, by imposing a \nduty on Congress before the proposal is submitted to the States, it \nsomehow contravenes the Constitution. At the same time, those opponents \nclaim that imposing a time limit on the States after the proposal is \nsent to them does not contravene the Constitution. I do not think this \nargument holds up very well.\n  The right-to-know amendment falls squarely within the constitutional \npurview of the Congress, an article I power that permits each House to \nestablish its rules of procedure.\n  The right-to-know amendment is an exercise in the article I power.\n  It in no way affects the ratification process. I think most people \nwould concede that. It in no way affects the congressional approval \nprocess, and I think most people would concede that. Again, those are \nthe only two constitutionally established requirements to amend the \nConstitution.\n  In fact, the right-to-know amendment, by requiring that the House and \nSenate first adopt a budget path leading to a balanced budget, and then \nsend the proposal to the States for their consideration, impinges less \nupon the Constitution's requirements than the 7-year deadline contained \nin the language of the proposed amendment itself.\n  In short, this argument against the right-to-know amendment is a \nsmokescreen. It is meant to shift attention from the issue, the \nquestion of specifically how to cut spending, to a dry debate over \nconstitutionality. I am not a constitutional lawyer. In fact, I'm not \nany kind of a lawyer at all, but I can read.\n  The Constitution very clearly and plainly says, in language that can \nbe understood by anyone, that there are two requirements to amend the \nConstitution when you choose the route of moving through the Congress: \nTwo-thirds of the Congress must pass it, and three-fourths of the State \nlegislatures must ratify it.\n  The Constitution says absolutely nothing else on this particular \nsubject. All of the sophisticated arguments in the world will not \nchange the plain language of our Constitution. The document speaks \nplainly, and where it is silent, it is silent. It does not, by \nimplication, permit a time limit on constitutional amendments and then \nbar a prior congressional action. It is silent on both counts. I think \nthat is an important issue. It does not, by implication, permit a time \nlimit on constitutional amendments and then bar a prior congressional \naction.\n  The proposal before us has a time limit. I have not heard one Senator \nargue that this is unconstitutional because it is not mentioned in the \nConstitution. My amendment adds a prior requirement that doesn't \ninterfere with either of the constitutionally sanctioned requirements \nor the extra-constitutional requirement of a 7-year ratification \ndeadline.\n  If Congress can limit the time within which a proposed constitutional \namendment may be ratified, nothing prevents Congress from adopting an \ninternal procedure before we send a proposed constitutional amendment \nto the States in the first place. That is all that the right-to-know \namendment seeks to do.\n  Each House of the Congress has parliamentary rules, established under \narticle I, to expedite or retard the movement of legislation in various \nways. All these rules have full force whether we are debating an annual \nappropriations bill or a proposed constitutional amendment.\n  The only thing the right-to-know amendment seeks is a prior \ncongressional action before the proposal is forwarded to the States, \nunder Article I rules. It does not impinge on the provisions that deal \nwith a proposed constitutional amendment. It is well within the power \nof the Congress to determine that a prior action be taken. The \nconditions in the right-to-know amendment are no less constitutional as \napplied against the Congress, which is how they would apply, than a \ntime limit applied against the States, which is how a time limit is \napplied.\n  The argument that the right-to-know amendment is in some way \nunconstitutional is not a serious argument. It is an effort to divert \nattention from the bottom line, and because we are talking about a \nbalanced budget requirement, the bottom line is the only line that \nmatters.\n  The right-to-know amendment asks that the Congress tell us how, over \nthe next 7 years, it will reduce spending in 48 percent of the budget \nby enough to balance the budget in 7 years' time. That is all. It does \nnot tie future Congresses to a particular line of action. One Congress \ncannot bind another. It simply asks the responsible Congress--this one, \nthe one that would vote on the constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget--to tell the citizens and the States what the spending \nreductions must be to comply with the mandate that is being proposed to \nthe States.\n  The mandate is to cut spending to reach budgetary balance in 7 years' \ntime without cutting defense spending and without cutting Social \nSecurity. The only thing my amendment demands is that we tell the \npeople, the States and the cities how we plan to achieve this goal. \nThis is neither unfair nor onerous. When Congress debated the 14th \namendment in the wake of the Civil War, Members of Congress were \nrequired to step up to the plate and give their views on what those \nproposals would mean.\n  [[Page S2171]] Congressmen of the time did so. They stood up and \nsaid, plainly enough, that they did not intend that the 14th amendment \nbe read to require voting rights for black Americans or integrated \neducation.\n  A hundred years later, the Supreme Court ruled against them. What \nthey said and meant did not stop the march of time. Neither will any \nwords of ours. There is no need for exaggerated concern about the \nability of some future Congress to steer its own course. The right-to-\nknow amendment does not dictate to a future Congress, because that is \nimpossible. It simply asks those who today claim we can easily and \npainlessly reach a balanced budget in 7 years' time to tell us how this \nis to be done.\n  Some of the most fervent advocates of this approach will be long gone \nfrom here when the time comes to bite the bullet, just as the writers \nof the 14th amendment were not around when the Supreme Court said we \nhad to end de jure segregation.\n  I do not think that in 2002 voters should have a right to call up \nretired Senators and Members of Congress and demand to know what we \nwere thinking in 1995. But I think it is eminently fair to ask those \nwho are our contemporaries, who say this can be done now and that it is \ngoing to be relatively easy, to tell us how it can be done now, how it \nis going to be done easily. This is not an intellectual exercise in \nabstract economics. We are talking about issues that are going to \naffect the way real people live their lives--this year, next year, in \nthe year 2002, and beyond.\n  I want to make it plain that I am a supporter of a balanced budget \namendment. I have been for a balanced budget amendment for many years, \nbecause I believe Government can and should operate within its revenue \nbase. I think it is doable. I think it ought to be done. But as we \ndebate that issue, let us be honest with the people; let us tell them \nwhat this means, not in abstract, general terms, but in concrete, \nspecific terms, because those are the only terms on which we can cut \nspending. There is no abstract, general spending in the budget. It is \nall concrete. It is all specific.\n  Past Republican budget proposals have gutted student loans, cutting \nthem by over $12 billion. Middle-class parents planning to send their \nchildren to college or vocational school have a right to know whether \nwe will eliminate student loans.\n  Republican budget proposals have slashed Medicare benefits by $30 \nbillion. Senior citizens who count on Medicare have a right to know \nwhether we will make it even more costly to get health care. Republican \nbudget proposals have slashed spending on public education by $3 \nbillion. American school children and their parents have a right to \nknow whether we will limit their opportunity to learn and succeed. The \nAmerican people have a right to know--and the majority has a \nresponsibility to tell us--specifically what will be cut, who will be \nhurt, who will be helped, and how and when this will be decided.\n  That is the purpose of the right-to-know amendment.\n  The President's budget was submitted this morning. It contains $140 \nbillion in spending reductions. It has been under attack by some \nMembers of Congress beginning last Friday, when details first began to \nleak to the media. I understand the partisan desire to attack, I do not \nunderstand how people think they can posture on a balanced budget \namendment, denounce the President's plan, offer nothing themselves, and \nstill have credibility. We have been hearing since last November that \nthere would be a Republican spending cut plan in the public arena \nshortly. It is now February. News reports now tell us that we're not \nactually going to get this plan until perhaps April or May.\n  We are being asked to pass unfunded mandates legislation, line-item \nveto legislation, a balanced budget constitutional amendment, all sorts \nof procedural proposals, but where's the beef? Where's the long-\npromised budget plan itself? We have a very modest proposal--the right-\nto-know amendment. It simply requires us to produce the beef, what we \nhear is that we are contravening the Constitution and ignoring the \nsacred trust handed on by the Founding Fathers. Perhaps some are \nprotesting too much.\n  We are engaged in a serious enterprise. We are trying to remake a \nsystem inherited and modified over 200 years. We cannot guarantee that \nthe next Congress will follow in our footsteps. But we can't be \nimmobilized by that, either. Americans vote every 2 years. They expect \neach new Congress to deal with the problems that arise within each 2-\nyear cycle. If we come up with a good plan, the next Congress is very \nlikely to follow it. All we ask is that we come up with a plan. If the \nnext Congress improves it, all the better. We cannot control the \nfuture. We can control what we are willing to do now.\n  The right-to-know amendment is targeted to now. The balanced budget \namendment asks some future Congress, some years down the road, to do \nsomething. That is fine.\n  This amendment asks this Congress to do something now. That is the \ndifference. Frankly, I do not understand the reluctance to act. I \nespecially do not understand the reluctance based on the criticism of \nthe President's budget. Clearly, all the critics have better plans, \nless costly, more effective, less painful, easier. That is great. Let \nus see these plans. Let us lay them out. Let us hear how the easy \nalternatives really are. I want to hear what, in detail, these painless \ncuts are. If we can learn this, we can go ahead with the right-to-know \namendment because it will be painless.\n  I understand the effort to drag the Constitution into this. It is an \neffort to change the subject. The subject is still on the table, and it \nis very straightforward. Americans have the right to know what we \npropose to do because it will affect their lives. It will affect their \nState and local tax burdens. It will affect the environments of their \ncities and the kind of country their children will inherit. It will \naffect all of us--our futures. Given that, we cannot let this \nopportunity pass.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, there is not a single Senator who can rise \nin this Chamber and come out solidly for an unbalanced budget, for \ngoing further into debt than we already are. Every person, including \nmyself, knows that we have to get to a balanced budget. We cannot \nafford to keep on, year after year after year after year, going deeper \ninto debt and, along with it, deeper into the interest payments, \nincreased interest payments on that debt.\n  We have to resist what I would call ``secret agent'' budgeting. The \nproposal on the Republican side this year is you appoint me your agent, \nand I cannot tell you how I am going to balance the budget but in \nsecret I will decide whether your Social Security is going to be cut, \nwhether Medicare is going to be cut, whether your pension protections \nin the pension benefit guarantee are going to be cut, and on down with \na whole host of things.\n  I desperately want to achieve a balanced budget, but a little later \nin my remarks here I will point out what the Democrats did back in 1993 \nwhen we faced up to, in advance, laying out exactly what we were doing, \nwhat the cuts were going to be, what the tax increases were going to \nbe. It was honesty in budgeting. It was truth in advertising, honesty \nin budgeting.\n  I feel the only way to achieve a balanced budget, whether you have \nthe balanced budget amendment in place or not, is to approach this \ndifficult issue openly and honestly. How on Earth can we talk about the \nbalanced budget amendment without talking about what is necessary to \nbalance the budget?\n  Let us say we vote this out of here; we are going to put out a \nbalanced budget amendment, have the two-thirds vote here, put it out to \nthe States; the States within a couple of months come back--surprising \nspeed for the States. They are allowed 7 years to consider this but \ninstead of that they all right down the line 39 or 40 States--it takes \n38 to approve this. But let us say they come right back to us in 60 \ndays, 90 days. They say we voted for it. We think it is a great idea. \nWe have to do that in our States. How are you going to do it \nnationally? And we approve it. It is now part of the \n[[Page S2172]] Constitution. We no longer have an option then. We have \nto balance the budget.\n  That is pretty straightforward, really. All the people of the country \nwant to know how the balanced budget amendment will affect them if it \nis passed. What is it going to do to them? What services will be \nreduced? What taxes will be increased? That is what they want to know. \nWhat is really going to happen? In theory, do we all want a balanced \nbudget amendment? Yes, we do. But in practice, how do we get there?\n  I do not think that secret agent budgeting is the way we should get \nthere. The people of Ohio, the people of America are the taxpayers of \nthis country and they deserve to know. If I go back home to the people \nof Ohio and I go to a discussion with some of the elderly people in our \nState, or I go to a nursing home or I go to a meeting of the AARP, the \nAmerican Association of Retired Persons, and I point at them and I say, \n``They are going to cut your Social Security, make no mistake about \nit,'' the first person up would say, ``Oh, no, wait a minute. They have \nguaranteed they are going to take that off budget. They are going to \ntake that off budget. They are not going to touch Social Security over \nhere.''\n  I say: ``Oh? OK. I am glad to know that. Let me tell you something. \nThey are going to cut your Medicare.'' The next person up would say, \n``Oh, no, wait a minute. They have guaranteed they are not going to cut \nMedicare. That is going to be off base over here.'' So we have those \ntwo things now, Social Security and Medicare, which are not going to be \ntouched by our new budgeting procedures here. Then we add a couple of \nother things to that. We cannot ignore interest on the national debt. \nThat is running over $100 billion a year plus--$200 billion a year now. \nSo we say OK, the interest on the national debt. Here we have Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and we have interest on the national debt. Then we \nsay, ``How about defense?''\n  No, we think we are a little thin on defense already. In fact, the \nRepublican side is saying we have to add money for defense. We cannot \nget any further down. And I do not necessarily disagree with that. I am \non the Armed Services Committee. It has given me some concern, too, \nabout how far we have cut, particularly in the area of personnel. I am \nnot sure we could take care of two emergencies, as we are supposed to \nbe able to do, with regard to Korea and the Persian Gulf. I am not at \nall sure we could do those right with the forces we have right now. \nYet, we are the only power in the world that could do that.\n  We have a lot of people who say, ``Yes but we are spending more than \nall the rest of the world put together on defense.'' And that is true, \nwe are. But I also say we are the world's leader and we have greater \nresponsibilities than anyone else, too.\n  So you take Social Security--that is off over here. Then take \nMedicare--that is off base. We cannot cut into those two things, Social \nSecurity and Medicare. We have to pay interest on the national debt. \nThe good faith of the U.S. Government is behind those payments. Then we \ntake defense off. OK. We have those four items off budget. I do not \nquarrel one iota with taking all those off budget. But where does that \nleave us?\n  I will tell you where it leaves us. It leaves us with everything else \nin the budget being cut about 30 percent. Everything else in the \nFederal budget has to average a cut of 30 percent if we are going to \nleave those four items off budget. Let me give an example of some of \nthis. If you leave all spending programs on the table, the across-the-\nboard cut for everything else is 13 percent, if you are going to \nachieve a balanced budget by fiscal year 2002; a 13-percent cut in \neverything across the board: Social Security, Medicare, defense, the \nwhole works.\n  If you take Social Security off the table then cut across the board \nfor everything else, it goes up to 18 percent. If you take defense off \nthe table, the across-the-board cut for everything else is 22 percent. \nIf you also assume the tax cuts that the House Contract With America \nproposed, if you put that in, the across-the-board cut for everything \nelse is 30 percent. And if you also take all veterans programs off the \ntable, an across-the-board cut for everything else is 31 percent. If \nyou take military retirement off the table--which has been proposed by \nsome people--it goes up to 32 percent, as a cut that would have to be \ntaken on everything else. If you take civilian retirement off the \ntable, it goes up to 34 percent. And if you add Medicare to that, you \ntake that list I just named there and you add Medicare onto it, it \nmeans everything else in the Federal budget--everything has to be cut \nby 50 percent.\n  Let us go back just to the four basics I mentioned: Medicare, Social \nSecurity, interest on the national debt, and the defense budget. Just \ntake those off and everything else in the budget has to be a 30-percent \ncut.\n  Let us look at that a little bit. Do you want AIDS research cut by 30 \npercent? Oh, no; we cannot cut that. We are going to put that off \nbudget here so we will have to consider that, of course. We are not \ngoing to that. So that means something else has to be cut more than its \n30 percent.\n  How about cancer research? No, we cannot cut cancer research.\n  Let us get over in another area. How about air traffic control? We \nall fly airliners on occasion, some of us more than others. How about \nair traffic control? Are we going to cut out 30 percent of the \ncontrollers; 30 percent of the budget the FAA uses for air safety? No, \nI think we have to exempt that.\n  How about the Food and Drug Administration? Do we want some more \nthalidomide tragedies contemplated in our future? Do we want to avoid \nthose? Do we want the FDA to be cut by 30 percent? How about \nAlzheimer's research? Do you want that cut 30 percent? How about meat \ninspection, poultry inspection, salmonella prevention programs? Cutting \nout 30 percent of all agricultural research? How about your money in \nthe bank? Do you want bank regulatory authorities to have their budgets \ncut by 30 percent? How about Americans on pensions? Do we want the \nPension Benefit Guarantee Program that the Government has as a backup \nin case the pensions are not funded properly--do we want that to go?\n  If we are cutting all these things, too--you know, we just passed an \nunfunded mandates program here--how about the States out there? They \nget about $230 billion a year for environmental programs. That is going \nto be pretty attractive for cutting, it seems to me, if we are forced \nto go into a 30- percent cut on everything else.\n  We can name a whole host of things: Food stamps; highway money; \nhigher education; Social Security for the blind and for the disabled; \nthe Head Start Program; school lunch; the Special Supplemental Food \nProgram for Women, Infants, and Children; all farm support; nuclear \nregulation--nuclear regulation for those places around the country \nwhere there are nuclear plants--nuclear cleanup; research funds; \nvaccines for children; dollars to track down the fathers of children of \nunwed mothers; veterans hospitals; eliminating deductions on \nmortgages--everything.\n  All the other functions of Government, all of those and far, far \nmore--that is not even beginning to be a complete list--would have to \nbe cut 30 percent. If they are not cut 30 percent, then something else \nhas to make up more than their 30 percent change. And that is only if \nwe put off budget Social Security, Medicare, interest on the national \ndebt, and the defense budget.\n  No one will tell us what is going to be in this, what is going to be \nin the budget if we go ahead and pass a balanced budget amendment and \nit is placed into effect more rapidly than most people think. I want to \nknow up front what is going to be cut. I think that is only reasonable. \nWe did it on the Democratic side back in 1993, when we had the \nreconciliation bill on the floor. Yet the Republicans in 1995 tell us, \n``Just trust us, somehow we are going to work this thing out. We are \nnot going to name all these things, as Democrats did back in 1993.'' We \nnamed them in detail. We gave specifics of exactly how we were going to \ndo this, including tax increases. We were honest about this thing. It \nwas truth in budgeting.\n  There have been a number of estimates of just how this amendment will \naffect Ohio in specific terms. It is all speculation because Ohioans \nare not being told what is going to be cut.\n  [[Page S2173]] I say to my constituents back home in Ohio who may be \nwatching this today, they are not willing to tell us, on the other \nside, what will be cut or how much your taxes will be raised, or \nanything about either one of those issues.\n  We should be able to tell you back home how you are going to be \naffected by the balanced budget amendment. But we are not. Let me give \nyou just a little bit of speculation on how this might impact Ohio. \nHere is the speculation.\n  The Contract With America calls for balancing the Federal budget by \nthe fiscal year 2002 while cutting some taxes. Experts estimate that \ndoing so without cutting Social Security or defense spending or raising \ntaxes would require slicing all other Federal expenditures by 30 \npercent. Children's programs could suffer even more, if cuts in such \nprograms as Medicare or veterans' services were limited, as is likely. \nCosts might be cut in several ways: By dropping groups of children from \nprograms, putting them on waiting lists, and reducing benefits or \nquality of services. For example, by ending Medicaid coverage for some \nhealth treatment, cutting AFDC grants by 30 percent, or by requiring \nfamilies to put up more costs through copayments and cost sharing.\n  Let me get down to the nut of this for Ohio. The following estimates \nhow many children would be affected in fiscal year 2002 if costs were \ncut solely by reducing program enrollments. This is just Ohio alone. \nNo. 1 on our list, 74,800 babies, preschoolers and pregnant women would \nlose infant formula and other WIC nutrition supplements; 183,350 \nchildren would lose food stamps; 291,800 children would lose free or \nsubsidized school lunch programs; 284,400 children would lose Medicaid \nhealth coverage, those poorest of the poor, those who can afford to \nlose it the very least; 287,150 cases now served by the State child \nsupport agency would lose help to establish paternity or collect child \nsupport, something we all want to see happen; 141,900 children would \nlose welfare benefits under the Aid to Families with Dependent \nChildren; 11,500 blind and disabled children would lose the help we \ngive them under supplemental Social Security income; 10,150 or more \nchildren would lose the Federal child care subsidies that enable \nparents to work or get an education and training; 10,200 children would \nlose Head Start early childhood services; 20,950 children in child care \nand Head Start would lose child and adult care food program meals; and, \n56,300 children would lose remedial education through title I.\n  We hear the screams obviously from the other side saying we do not \nwant to cut those programs. Let me repeat again, those estimates are \nfor programs to be cut just for my home State of Ohio. Those are not \nnational figures. We have just under 11 million population in Ohio. \nThose figures are the ones that would apply to just our people in Ohio.\n  They say we are not going to cut all those things. All right, if you \nare not going to cut all those things, if they are off limits, tell us \nand tell us now so we do not have all the uncertainty that people have \nabout which programs are going to be cut. Just tell us. That is all. \nJust be honest enough to do this up front. That is all we are asking.\n  If you do not cut Social Security, Medicare, interest on the national \ndebt, and national defense, then you have the across-the-board 30-\npercent cut that I mentioned earlier. What does this do to a State like \nOhio? If the same services are to be provided as are provided now--\nmaybe some of those would be eliminated, I do not know--but if the same \nservices are to be provided while we protect the programs at the \nFederal level, if Ohio is to pick up that difference, it would mean \nthat the State taxes in Ohio would have to go up 14.4 percent to \nmaintain services. If we are going to cut services, OK, those decisions \nwould have to be made. But let us know in advance what we are doing so \nwe know which people are going to be hurt.\n  Other States get hit even more than Ohio. Some are around 19 percent; \nNew York 17.4; Tennessee, 19.5; Mississippi, 20.8 percent. Their State \ntaxes would have to be increased just to maintain the services.\n  Mr. President, time and time again I have received letters from my \nconstituents in Ohio asking why the Congress cannot act like the \naverage citizens, why we cannot look at how much money we have, what \nthe programs are, why we cannot in Congress sit down like the people do \nat home at the kitchen or dining room table and lay out all of the \npapers and act and decide how they are going to go about balancing the \nbudget. Why cannot we in Congress in effect sit down at our table here \nand balance a budget and live within our means as every other person in \nthis country has to do?''\n  If an average middle-class taxpayer can simply state that kind of a \ngoal at home, like sitting there saying I want to pay off all my debts, \nI want to stop spending more than I am taking in and they look at all \nthe papers in front of them on the dining room table. They say, ``Well, \nthe first thing you have to do is--I am glad I sat down here. Now I \nhave to plan out exactly where my belt is going to have to be \ntightened. I am going to have to decide where I am going to cut back. I \nam going to have to decide what my income is going to be, and then I am \ngoing to have to determine what sacrifices will have to be made so that \nI am planning for the future in a more realistic way than I have done \nin the past.''\n  Now, to carry out what the taxpayer sitting at the table back home \nhas to do, the American taxpayers are really in a terrible debt. If \nthey individually at home are in a terrible debt like the Federal \nGovernment and they individually end up in bankruptcy court, you can \nbet that taxpayer, he or she, will be forced to sit down and draw up a \nfinancial plan for the future. I would say today should we not do the \nsame right here in the Senate? Should we be required to do exactly the \nsame thing and not do it with blue smoke and mirrors, not hiding behind \nsomething that says we have to have a balanced budget amendment and \nthen we are going to tell you how to balance this thing. Why not do it \nnow?\n  The Houston Chronicle had a recent editorial that commented on this \ntype of situation. They said a citizen purchasing an automobile might \nreasonably be expected to be informed of such basics as what type of \nmotor the car has, if it has one at all, what color the auto is, the \ndrive-out price, et cetera. ``Would we not take the same or greater \ncare with our Constitution than we would in buying a car?\n  Mr. President, I have not given a commitment to either side in this \nissue about how I will vote on a balanced budget amendment. I frankly \nwould like to be able to vote for it. But I would like to do it on an \ninformed basis that tells me what is going to happen if the balanced \nbudget amendment happens, if it comes back approved, if the States say \nyes, we want you to act this way. All the services that now we get from \nthe Federal Government, are we going to cut those things out? Or are we \ngoing to alter them? And how are they going to be altered? If they \nwould tell me ahead of time what is going to happen, I might assess \nthat with regard to the whole country and my home State of Ohio and \nsay, yes, maybe I can be for that balanced budget amendment. Maybe if \nthat is where they want to cut and they specify those cuts and where \nthe tax increases will be--and I have no doubt there will be some \neventually--tell me what they are going to be before, not after I voted \nfor it, tell me before so I know what I am getting my people of Ohio \ninto. How could anything be more fair than that?\n  Going back to the Houston Chronicle article, I want to make sure \nbefore this amendment leaves the lot that we know if we have a real \nlemon on our hands. Let us have truth in advertising. Let us check the \nsticker price.\n Let us look under the hood; let us kick the tires. If everything \nchecks out, we will move down the road to our final destination to a \nbalanced budget, which I absolutely think we have to get to. Above all, \nMr. President, let us not embark on this trip without knowing the \ndirection we will take to get there. Let us not do it with blue smoke \nand mirrors. Let us not hide our intentions.\n\n  I think sometimes our fears are not well justified here. I do not \nthink our knees will buckle if somebody says what we have to cut. We \nwill consider it. I do not think the knees of the American people will \nbuckle if somebody is honest with them and says: \n[[Page S2174]] Here is exactly how we are going to get to this laudable \nobjective.\n  There is an old Shakespeare quote, and I do not know what play it was \nin, but it said:\n\n     Our doubts are traitors, And make us lose the good we oft \n           might win\n     By fearing to attempt.\n\n  Never is that more applicable or more true than in our budgeting \nconsiderations here. We have to have guts enough to allay those fears \nand be willing to attempt a balanced budget by telling the American \npeople exactly how we are going to get there.\n  Mr. President, here we are discussing the balanced budget amendment, \nand in the immortal words of Yogi Berra: It is deja vu all over again. \nThe first time I was part of the debate on the balanced budget \namendment here in the Senate was in 1982. That was the second year of \nour grand experiment with supply side economics. Remember that, where \nif we just cut taxes it was going to result in such an economic \nincrease of our general economy in the country, the new revenue would \nmore than make up the cuts in what revenue we lost with the cut. We \nreduced taxes 25 percent over a 3-year period; a 5-percent cut on \nincome tax 1 year, and 10 percent each of the next 2 years. What \nhappened? What happened on that was that the new economic level did not \nincrease the way it was supposed to increase. We could not get those \npercentages changed through the years, and we wound up with another \n$3.5 trillion added to the $1 trillion in debt we had that had been \naccumulated from every single President from George Washington through \nJimmy Carter. In the last 12 years, the deficit or the debt has gone up \nto a little over $4.5 trillion. That is what happened with supply side \neconomics.\n  Even back then, when we were talking about all this, like today, \nthere was a lot of talk about balancing the budget but almost no talk \nabout how to get there. Instead, we preferred to talk about tax cuts. \nCut taxes, smile, be happy, it is morning in America; in the city set \non a hill, we can make no mistakes.\n  After 12 years of feel-good budgeting, we found ourselves with a $4.5 \ntrillion debt; $4.5 trillion. It was a credit card. It was all done on \na credit card, a great big national plastic credit card. Well, then \nwhat happened? We came along with the Presidential candidate who vowed \nto take the deficit seriously, not by talking about magical fixes, \nabout supply side economics, about Laffer curves, and all the other \nthings we heard about back in those days, but by presenting real \noptions to reduce the deficit.\n  Luckily for our Nation's fiscal health, that candidate's message of \ntruth-in-budgeting resounded with the American public, and that \ncandidate, of course, now occupies the White House, President Clinton. \nPresident Clinton showed us that his campaign commitment on deficit \nreduction was not just election-year rhetoric.\n  I referred a little earlier here to what the Democrats did in 1993, \ncontrasted to what the Republicans are proposing to do in 1995, and \nwhat happened. In the first year of the Clinton Presidency, he \npresented a clear agenda for deficit reduction. He offered us real \nspecifics, but he offered us very tough choices, also. I mean, they \nwere tough choices. Congress responded and assigned specific cuts, cut \nobjectives, to the committees of the Senate here, in particular, and \nthe committees went to work on this plan. We came up with a program at \nthat time that was tough, tough, tough. And we made more tough voting \ndecisions back in the summer of 1994 than almost any time since I have \nbeen in the Senate.\n  Why can the Republicans not do the same thing right now that we did \nback in 1993? They are not giving specifics. Our program back then gave \nspecifics. It was not hidden. It did not say, ``Trust me and I will \ntell you later about how we are going to get to these ends.'' It was \ntough. Do you know what happened? The Omnibus Reconciliation Act of \n1993 was a major component of President Clinton's overall economic \nstrategy to reduce the deficit by nearly $500 billion, half a trillion \ndollars, in 5 years, to create jobs and invest in the American people. \nIt was the largest deficit reduction package in history. The \nPresident's deficit reduction and economic growth package, as reported \nby the House-Senate conference we voted on, was the largest deficit \nreduction in U.S. history.\n  When the savings from this reconciliation bill were coupled with the \nsavings on caps on discretionary spending and interest savings, deficit \nreduction would total almost $500 billion over the next 5 years.\n  These historic reductions were achieved through spending cuts and by \nasking wealthy Americans, those who benefited through the 1980's, to \nmake their fair contribution to make sure of the Nation's economic \nsecurity. Was there a tax increase? Of course, there was. But there \nwere tax cuts, also, in trying to get at least toward a balanced \nbudget.\n  The President's plan, though, as agreed to with the House and Senate \nconference, relied more on spending cuts than revenue increases. Under \nthe plan, Federal revenue would be increased by $241 billion and \nFederal spending would be cut by $255 billion over a 5-year period, \nwith every penny locked in a deficit reduction trust fund. The deficit \nreduction and economic growth package contained $88 billion in \nmandatory spending cuts over the next 5 years. In addition, with \ndiscretionary spending caps, there was a net savings of $102 billion \nthrough the regular annual appropriations process, and the resulting \nlower annual deficits and improved debt management will reduce interest \npayments by $65 billion over that same 5-year period.\n  Those were laudable objectives and we put them into effect. We made \ntough judgments in such areas as agriculture, nutrition, forestry, and \nthey were assigned to that committee to report a savings of $3.2 \nbillion over 5 years. And they did that. They met their goal--$3.2 \nbillion out of one committee. They modified the so-called Pay-92 \nprograms and had changed some of the cotton targets, dairy products, \ntobacco assessments, sugar, oilseed, peanuts, home loan rate, wool and \nmohair programs, refinancing and prepayment of Federal financing, bank \nborrowing to finance and prepay loans subject to certain penalties, \nFederal crop insurance, CRP enrollment, Forest Service recreation \nfees--those were all tough votes and they were taken in committee and \nbrought out here for discussion on the floor. Some were contested on \nthe floor, and we stood up and made our votes on those subjects.\n  The Armed Services Committee was assigned $12.63 billion over 5 \nyears. That was tough to meet. We asked military retirees to forgo \nCOLA's. That is a tough vote when you vote on something like that. It \nis very tough telling the veterans that, no, they are not like some \nother people who would get cost-of-living increases. We are asking \nthem, in the interest of the national good, to forgo that for a little \nperiod.\n  The reason I am pointing out some of these is we are being asked to \naccept this proposal on the other side as a pig in a poke. The veterans \nwould not know now what was going to happen to them.\n  The Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee was instructed to \nreport savings of $3.31 billion over 5 years, and they met that goal. \nDepositor preference changes; transfer of Federal reserve surpluses; \nHUD-IRS income verification; Ginnie Mae REMIC's, the real estate \nmortgage investment conduits; and FHA premiums--all of these things \nwere tough votes in committee and out here on the floor.\n  But we did them back in 1993 as part of that reconciliation package.\n  The Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee. They were \nassigned $7.405 billion in cuts over 5 years and they achieved that \ngoal, with some of the communications Spectrum auctions, as they are \ncalled, and user fees. And those are tough votes.\n  The Energy and Natural Resources Committee, they were able to report \nsavings of $737 million over 5 years. They came out $77 million under \nthe target that was set out for them, but they still made major cuts. \nAnd they made controversial votes such as on recreation fees in \nnational parks; some changes in the hard rock mining holding fees; \nstate royalty collection costs.\n  The Environment and Public Works Committee was assigned $1.254 \nbillion over 5 years. They went into this on Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission user fees, the Army Corps of Engineers user fees, and a \nseries of other things I will \n[[Page S2175]] not even mention here. NRC's operating budget was \nanother one, requiring nuclear utilities to pay fees to cover all of \nNRC's operating budget.\n  The Finance Committee was given a big target and they had to make a \nnumber of changes. They did some of these in changing tax rates for \nhigh-income earners. They changed gift and estate taxes, meals and \nentertainment, club dues, executive pay, moving deductions, individual \nestimated tax simplification, Social Security benefit changes, \ncorporate income tax changes affecting business, lobbying expenses \nchanges, corporate estimated tax rules, treatment of passive loss, \ncredits and AMT credits. And in international businesses, excessive \naccumulated foreign earnings; research and experimental expenses \nallocation changes; oil, gas and shipping income foreign tax credit. \nTransportation fuels tax increase, 4.3 cents a gallon on all \ntransportation fuels currently subject to the leaking underground \nstorage tank trust fund; extension of transfer of current 2.5-cent-per-\ngallon tax. Other intangibles, change of appreciation of intangible \nassets; change in charitable contributions, change in expanding the 45-\nday interest rules for tax refunds, denying business travel deductions \nfor spouses, increasing withholding rates on bonuses to 28 percent.\n  They had more under the Finance Committee--education and training \nprovisions, and extension of target job tax credit; research and \ndevelopment, R credit; targeted capital gains tax cut; real estate \ninvestment provisions: Permanent low-income housing credit, passive \nloss relief for real estate provision, exclusion for discharge of real \nproperty business debt. Luxury excise tax changes. Extension of the \nAMT, alternative minimum tax, provision. Changes in how we would treat \nempowerment zones and enterprise communities and some other changes \nalso.\n  They changed some of the things in Medicare and Medicaid also as to \nhow those programs were to be treated. All these under the Finance \nCommittee. Medicaid, some of the changes were made there.\n  And let me add a couple others here. The food stamp program was \nchanged. States had to match food stamp administrative costs; shelter \nexpense; earned income tax credit. Human resources.\n  I read all these not to bore my colleagues or to bore those watching \nbut to point out that there were hundreds, literally hundreds, of \nchanges made, hundreds of changes made that we voted up front in \ncommittee and/or out here on the floor in advance letting people know \nexactly how their future would be affected by the votes that we are \nwere going to make on that reconciliation bill.\n  Now, I submit to my colleagues and anyone watching or listening, if \nit was important enough on a reconciliation bill, just on a \nreconciliation bill, that we go through all that and let people know \nspecifically how they were going to be affected and be up front about \nit on letting everyone know what the votes were, then that is the least \nwe can do if we are taking up something so much more fundamentally \nimportant to our whole Government, our whole Constitution as a balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  The Foreign Relations Committee was assigned a savings of a $5 \nmillion target over 5 years. They met it.\n  The Governmental Affairs Committee, which I chaired at that time, was \nassigned a $10.668 billion in savings. And I can tell you, we sweated \nover that one in committee and we made it. Once again we had to delay \nsome retirement cost-of-living increases, the lump sum retirement \noption was knocked out for Civil Service employees, Medicare part B fee \nlimits were changed, changed the extension of the proxy premium law, \nthe D.C.-Federal Employee Health Benefits, payments by the U.S. Postal \nService.\n  All of these things were tough votes, and I hate to keep just saying \nthat, but they were, but we did it up front and let people know exactly \nwhat was going to happen to them.\n  Even the Judiciary Committee a $345 million target over a 5-year \nperiod, and they met that.\n  The Labor and Human Resources Committee, $4.5 billion over 5 years, \nand they met that goal. They brought up such things as student benefits \nand cost savings that came from the Federal student loan programs being \nadministered differently.\n  The conference agreement also would require States to be responsible \nif a default rate for borrowing that attend institutions of higher \neducation located in their State exceeds 20 percent. Those were hard \nvotes--Home loan program changes.\n  In other words, I bring up all these--and this is just a sampling; \nthis is not a whole listing of everything, but I bring these up to \nindicate the tough votes.\n  Now we put this whole package together. President Clinton led the way \non this. He sent up where he felt we could cut; took the political heat \nfor this. We joined him in taking the political heat for saying up \nfront how we were going to vote on these things, laid it out. \nEverybody, all the special interest groups, crowded out here by the \nelevator, called on us in our offices and said, ``You can't touch this. \nYou can't touch that.'' Yet we did. We made the tough votes.\n  And there were several hundred votes, either in committee or out here \non the floor to put this thing into effect.\n  Let me come down to the bottom line. And here was what happened out \nof all that reconciliation bill. Here is what happened.\n  Our budget deficit, at the time we passed that, was approaching $300 \nbillion, just the budget deficit. We put that reconciliation bill into \neffect. The next year it went down to somewhere around $250 billion. \nThis year some of the original estimates were that we were going to be \ndown to a budget deficit of only $168 billion. I think it is back up a \nlittle bit now. I think the refined estimate is about $190 billion. But \nwe have gone from around $300 to $250 to $190 billion. That is heading \nin the right direction with the budget deficit.\n  You know, the last time that ever occurred, where we had 3 years \nwhere the budget deficit went down 3 years in a row, was under Harry \nTruman. Clear back to the time of Harry Truman, the last time we had \nthe budget deficit go down 3 years in a row. It is working. That \nreconciliation bill that we made those tough votes on did have an \neffect.\n  Now some of the forecasts are that it is going to level off or it may \neven turn up again, but let us modify that. Let us take action to \ncorrect that. We have it heading in the right direction. Why would \nanybody want to throw that out now and say we are in effect going to \nput a gun pointed at us all and say we have to do something that may \ncut the things I have mentioned earlier.\n  Social Security, Medicare, no, those are off base; interest on the \nnational debt, no, that is off base; the defense budget, no, that is \noff base. Take those four items off base and everything else in the \nbudget has to average a 30-percent cut.\n  And we are not willing to tell people up front what is going to \nhappen, as we were back in 1993. Now in 1993, I say there were tough \nvotes.\n  When this bill went to conference with the House back in 1993, there \nwere some changes made in the conference. When it came back out here on \nthe Senate floor, it was one of the more dramatic moments I have seen \nin my 20 years here in the Senate. What happened over in the House was \nthat not one single Republican voted for that conference package in the \nHouse. Not one single Republican.\n  What happened here on the Senate floor? Not one single Republican \nvoted for that conference package that has resulted in the first 3 \nyears of continual budget deficit reduction since the days of Harry \nTruman. Not one single vote.\n  The Vice President is the Presiding Officer in the Senate. He shows \nup quite often when there may be a close vote. That day there was a 50-\n50 tie. The Vice President voted as is his constitutional duty to do. \nHe broke that tie, and so we had a 51-50 vote to put that \nreconciliation bill into effect.\n  We had been up front in telling people what the effect was going to \nbe. What programs--all those that I went through. I did not go through \nall the litany of the committees here just to fill up time here on the \nSenate floor. I wanted to point out we went through things that \naffected every single man, woman and child in this country. We did it \nupfront. We did it to try and get to a balanced budget. We are trying \nto do it without a balanced budget amendment.\n  [[Page S2176]] Now we are told, ``We will not tell you how we will do \nit. We will not tell you what will happen. We will not tell you what \nthe estimates are going to be, or how it will be implemented if the \nbalanced budget amendment passes, and if it is ratified by the States. \nWe will figure it out. Just trust us. Then we will figure out some \nthings.''\n  Back in 1993 with that reconciliation bill we figured it out in \nadvance and got it started on the right track, honestly and openly, and \nupfront, by telling every person in this country how they would be \naffected.\n  That reconciliation bill of 1993 became law despite the lack of \nbipartisan support. So we are now seeing our third year of declining \ndeficits. There were dire predictions then by some of our Republican \nfriends. I will not quote names but we have the quotes available. There \nwas going to be a recession and massive joblessness, a dire thing for \nthe economy, we would go downhill because of what we are doing, because \nwe increased taxes in some areas just on that top 1.2 percent of the \nwealthiest of this country, I would add, was most of it. None of these \ndire predictions panned out. The economy recovered, remains in good \nshape, and in Ohio, my home State, as near as we can calculate it has \nmeant over the past several years about an average of 43,000 new jobs \nevery year.\n  Remember all the talk about how the cuts in that deficit reduction \nbill were not real? Over a quarter of a trillion dollars in spending \nhas been cut. Has been cut. We are not talking about prospective. We \nare talking about what has happened. It has been cut.\n  Fiscal year 1994, 342 Federal programs were reduced before the prior \nyear spending levels. Fiscal year 1995 just ended in October, more than \n400 Federal programs were reduced below their prior year's spending \nlevels and another 40 were eliminated entirely. People talk about \ndownsizing Government. Starting to cut back on Government, cut down on \nthe size of the Government.\n  Know what happened as a result of the programs voted back in 1993? We \nare doing that. The President set out a goal of cutting the Federal \nemployment by 272,000 people. I thought that was a lot. In the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee we oversee the civil service. We are the \ncommittee of jurisdiction that looks into matters involved with civil \nservice. I thought when they talked about cutting back 272,000 people, \nthat was a big cut. I did not quite know how we would do that. We went \nto work with the administration, at that time, when a lot of people \nwere rolling their eyes and saying they would believe it when they see \nit. Well, just look at it now. People can believe it because they do \nsee it. I think a lot of people still do not believe it.\n  Of that 272,000, just over 101,000 positions have already been cut. \nThis is not prospective. This is not looking on down the pike \nsomeplace. They have been cut. I worked with them on setting up \nprograms that would help accomplish that on Governmental Affairs \nCommittee. We passed that legislation. It helped them achieve those \ngoals. There are early buyouts, early retirements. All sorts of things \nwe put in to help get to that end. We were very, very successful.\n  Know what else we did? We tailored that program at the time. And let \nme add a side bar: One of the problems in the Federal Government is \nthat we have had too many bosses and too few employees carrying out the \nwords of those bosses or the directions of those bosses. In private \nindustry, across the country, the average is one boss for every 12 to \n15 employees. What is it in the Federal Government? One to seven.\n  While we are getting people out, we tailored these so that the \ndifferent branches and agencies and departments of Government had some \nleeway, had some discretion to tailor these programs for the GS 13's, \n14's, and 15's. So we got more of those people out who are the bosses. \nSo we are at the same time reducing the overall size of Government, we \nare correcting some of this imbalance on the ratio between the \nsupervisors and the employees. That means a more efficient Government \nas we go down the road to the future.\n  So about 101,000 jobs have been cut from the Federal work force. We \nare ahead of schedule. We want to continue to work with the \nadministration to make sure that the cuts continue and we get to the \nobjective of 272,000.\n  All of these things were accomplished because we made the tough cuts. \nWe made the tough votes. We did not ask people to say ``Well, just \ntrust us and somehow we will get around to this in the future. Somehow \nwe will get to this end eventually.'' No, we made the tough votes. We \nDemocrats stood up and took the heat. I would repeat, all these \nprograms that we put through in that reconciliation bill, we did not \nhave one single, not one, Republican vote across the aisle. The Vice \nPresident had to break the tie.\n  There were probably a number of people, judging by what happened in \nlast year's election, who stood up and made some of those tough votes \nwho are not here today. It may have been a factor in why they are not \nhere. I do not know. They had the political courage to stand up and \ntell people what was going to happen to their lives if we made the tax \nincreases or made the cuts in programs that affect those people across \nthe country. And they did it. And they had political courage, whether \nthey are here today or not. We need to have that same kind of political \ncourage today.\n  There has been a lot of criticism about the tax increases that were \npart of that program back then to balance the budget. There is a good \narticle in the Washington Post on the first of February by Judy Mann, \nentitled ``Fiddling With the Numbers.'' I will not read the whole \narticle.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Feb. 1, 1995]\n\n                       Fiddling With the Numbers\n\n                             (By Judy Mann)\n\n       Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, the Republican meteor from New \n     Jersey, had the unusual honor for a first-term governor of \n     being asked to deliver her party's response to President \n     Clinton's State of the Union message last week.\n       And she delivered a whopper of what can most kindly be \n     called a glaring inaccuracy.\n       Sandwiched into her Republican sales pitch was the kind of \n     line that does serious political damage: Clinton, she \n     intoned, ``imposed the biggest tax increase in American \n     history.''\n       And millions of Americans sat in front of their television \n     sets, perhaps believing that Clinton and the Democrat-\n     controlled Congress had done a real number on them.\n       The trouble is that this poster lady for tax cuts was not \n     letting any facts get in her way. But don't hold your breath \n     waiting for the talk show hosts to set the record straight.\n       The biggest tax increase in history did not occur in the \n     Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. The biggest tax \n     increase in post-World War II history occurred in 1982 under \n     President Ronald Reagan.\n       Here is how the two compare, according to Bill Gale, a \n     specialist in tax policy and senior fellow at the Brookings \n     Institution. The 1993 act raised taxes for the next five \n     years by a gross total of $268 billion, but with the \n     expansion of the earned income tax credit to more working \n     poor families, the net increase comes to $240.4 billion in \n     1993 dollars. The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of \n     1982, by comparison, increased taxes by a net of $217.5 \n     billion over five years. Nominally, then, it is true that the \n     1993 tax bill was the biggest in history.\n       But things don't work nominally. ``A dollar now is worth \n     less than a dollar was back then, so that tax increase of, \n     say, $10 billion in 1982 would be a tax increase of $15 \n     billion now,'' says Gale. In fact, if you adjust for the 48 \n     percent change in price level, the 1982 tax increase becomes \n     a $325.6 billion increase in 1993 dollars. And that makes it \n     the biggest tax increase in history by $85 billion.\n       Moreover, says Gale, the population of the country \n     increased, so that, on a per person basis, the 1993 tax \n     increase is lower than the one in 1982, and the gross \n     domestic product increase over the decade, which means the \n     personal income rose. ``Once you adjust for price \n     translation, it's not the\n      biggest, and when you account for population and GDP, it \n     gets even smaller.''\n       He raises another point that makes this whole business of \n     tax policy just a bit more complex than the heroic tax \n     slashers would have us believe. ``The question is whether \n     [the 1993 tax increase] was a good idea or a bad idea, not \n     whether it was the biggest tax increase. Suppose it was the \n     biggest? I find it frustrating that the level of the debate \n     about stuff like this as carried on by politicians is \n     generally so low.''\n       So was it a good idea? ``We needed to reduce the deficit,'' \n     he says, ``we still need to reduce the deficit. The bond \n     market responded positively. Interest rates fell. There may \n     be a longer term benefit in that it shows Congress and the \n     president are capable of cutting the deficit even without a \n     balanced budget amendment.''\n       [[Page S2177]] Other long-term benefits, he says, are that \n     ``more capital is freed up for private investment, and \n     ultimately that can result in more productive and highly paid \n     workers.''\n       How bad was the hit for those few who did have to pay more \n     taxes? One tax attorney says that his increased taxes were \n     more than offset by savings he was able to generate by \n     refinancing the mortgage on his house at the lower interest \n     rates we've had as a result. The 1993 tax increase did \n     include a 4.3-cent-a-gallon rise in gasoline tax, which hits \n     the middle class. But most of us did not have to endure an \n     income tax increase. In 1992, the top tax rate was 31 percent \n     of the taxable income over $51,900 for single taxpayers and \n     $86,500 for married couples filing jointly. Two new tax \n     brackets were added in 1993: 36 percent for singles with \n     taxable incomes over $115,000 and married couples with \n     incomes over $140,000; and 39.6 percent for singles and \n     married couples with taxable incomes over $250,000.\n       Not exactly your working poor or even your average family.\n       The rising GOP stars are finding out that when they say or \n     do something stupid or mendacious, folks notice. The jury \n     ought to be out on Whitman's performance as governor until we \n     see the effects of supply side economics on New Jersey. But \n     in her first nationally televised performance as a \n     spokeswoman for her party, she should have known better than \n     to give the country only half the story. In the process, she \n     left a lot to be desired in one quality Americans are looking \n     for in politicians: honesty.\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I quote just a short part of this, talking \nabout a writer who commented on this and said:\n\n       He raises another point that makes this whole business of \n     tax policy just a bit more complex than the heroic tax \n     slashers would have us believe. ``The question is whether \n     [the 1993 tax increase] was a good idea or a bad idea, not \n     whether it was the biggest tax increase. Suppose it was the \n     biggest? I find it frustrating that the level of the debate \n     about stuff like this as carried on by politicians is \n     generally so low.''\n       So was it a good idea? ``We needed to reduce the deficit,'' \n     he says, ``we still need to reduce the deficit. The bond \n     market responded positively. Interest rates fell. There may \n     be a longer term benefit in that it shows Congress and the \n     President are capable of cutting the deficit even without a \n     balanced budget amendment.''\n       Other long-term benefits, he says, are that ``more capital \n     is freed up for private investment, and ultimately that can \n     result in more productive and highly paid workers.''\n       How bad was the hit for those few who did have to pay more \n     taxes? One tax attorney says that his increased taxes were \n     more than offset by savings he was able to generate by \n     refinancing the mortgage on his house at the lower interest \n     rates we've had as a result.\n\n  I hope, in addition to that, people can read the whole article.\n  I do not want my speech today to be taken wrong. I am not looking for \na job in the President's communications office to try to put out rosy \nscenarios for the White House. I am trying to make a very simple point. \nWe have seen the wrong way to approach balancing the budget, and we \nhave seen the right way, the honest way, the straightforward way for \nthe American people.\n  The wrong way led us to a $4 trillion debt, $4.6 trillion, I think, \nis the best estimate right now of what we actually owe. The right way \nof making the tough votes around here is such as we did in that \nreconciliation bill of 1993. That put us back on the track.\n  What are we being told on the other side today? ``No, we won't put \nout any figures, just trust me.'' We are going back into supply-side \neconomics again, that which gave us an additional $3.5 trillion in \nnational debt that we now have to pay interest on. We are going back to \nsome reconsideration of the Laffer curve. It was a ``laugher,'' all \nright, the way it worked. We have a new name for it; now we are going \nto rely on dynamic economics. That is what we hear from the House side. \nWe are going to rely on dynamic economics, which is supply-side \neconomics revisited. It says the dynamism comes from the fact that if \nyou cut taxes, it gives more money to the people who will invest, move \non to a new, higher level of economics; we will recoup a lot from that, \nand that will help mitigate the tax loss to begin with. That is exactly \nwhat we went through--exactly what we went through--in the early \neighties, only then it was called supply-side economics.\n  We are being asked today to vote on a balanced budget amendment \nwithout being told what the cuts are going to be, what the tax \nincreases may have to be, what plans will be cut. Will it be Social \nSecurity, Medicare? ``No, those are off limits,'' we are told, ``we \ncan't interfere with those.'' Interest on the national accident? ``Oh, \noff limits.'' Defense budget? ``Oh, off limits.'' And I favor that \ndefense budget. I agree we probably cut a little further than I would \nlike to see us cut on that.\n  Take those four things off and everything else in the Federal budget \nis going to have to be cut by 30 percent if we are going to meet the \nobjectives. And yet we are not told, they refuse to tell us how we are \ngoing to do this.\n  If I ever saw peekaboo budgeting, this is it. Peekaboo budgeting. We \njust give you a little hint here that we are going to do dynamic \neconomic modeling, or something, and that is supposed to quiet our \ncuriosity, I guess, a little bit. Now you see it, now you do not. But \nwe do not have any plan that lays out for us in this proposal, nothing \nthat even comes close to the type of definition and specificity that we \nhad the guts to vote back in 1993.\n  As we debate the balanced budget amendment, let us do it the right \nway. I would like to vote for a balanced budget amendment. I truly \nwould. And I have not said yet that I will vote against the balanced \nbudget amendment positively. But I cannot vote for a balanced budget \namendment that just asks the American people and the people of Ohio and \nall of us to just somehow accept this without any definition whatsoever \nof how we are going to get there, what is going to be cut, what \nprograms people rely on now are going to be axed out of the program, as \nwe have to get into doing this.\n  So let us let the taxpayer know what is ahead. Let us lay out a 7-\nyear plan. Let us present it to the American people. Let us make it in \ncomparable specificity to what we did back in 1993, which had not one \nsingle Republican vote when we passed that. Then we will all know \nwhether this balanced budget amendment is a good idea.\n  In 1993, the Democrats in the Senate showed that we could lay out a \nplan. We did the hard work in committees, we did the hard debate, the \nhard work here on the Senate floor.\n  In 1995, the process that is being proposed from the Republican side \nbasically says they either cannot or will not give us any information \non how we are going to achieve this balanced budget, if it passes. They \nsay just, ``Trust us, we will somehow figure it out. We will force \nourselves. We want a forcing mechanism here with a balanced budget \namendment. We have to have that or we cannot get around to saying what \nthe tough decisions are going to be and acting on them.''\n  And yet we have the history just 2 years ago in 1993 when we did \nthis. We did have the guts to do it then. So it is possible in the \nSenate of the United States to have some political courage and say in \nadvance what is going to happen.\n  But the saying goes, or what we hear all the time is, if we force \nourselves with a balanced budget amendment, then I think we will have \nan excuse, we will have an excuse for cuts that we would not have the \nguts to make otherwise, and we would tell the people back home, ``I'd \nhave liked to have kept your veterans' benefits, I'd have liked to have \nkept Social Security, I'd have liked to have kept your Medicare, but we \nhad the balanced budget amendment and so it forced me to vote to do \nthis to you.'' So we are looking for cover.\n  Do you remember the comedian Flip Wilson a few years ago? I remember \nhim very well. I thought he was very good. He had this character called \nGeraldine. Every time Flip Wilson had something with this character of \nGeraldine that somebody was criticizing him for doing, he would say, \n``Oh, the devil made me do it; oh, the devil made me do it.'' Remember \nthat?\n  It seems to me that is a little of what we are talking about here. \nThe Republicans seem to want this, and some other people, too--not just \nRepublicans--they want this balanced budget amendment so when we have \nto tell the elderly that we may have Social Security cuts, may have \nMedicare cuts, defense, may have cuts in women's and infants' programs, \nmay have cuts in a lot of other things, ``Oh, the balanced budget \namendment made me do it.'' In other words, not my fault, we have the \ncover of a balanced budget amendment.\n  I do not think we need that for political courage here. That is sort \nof getting your courage out of a bottle or courage out of something \nfalse when we are not willing to say what the cuts are going to be, not \nwilling to say what \n[[Page S2178]] we will do if a balanced budget amendment passes.\n  Let us say we pass it here and the States ratify it within about 2 \nmonths. Then what are we going to do? Where will the cuts have to be \nmade? ``Oh, the balanced budget amendment made me do this thing.'' \nSupposedly that gives us political cover.\n  But I will say, in the meantime, let us not be reckless. I would like \nto call on my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to show some \nguts and tell us where you will cut, tell us how much taxes will have \nto be increased when the balanced budget amendment passes. Tell us now. \nTell us up front. Let us be honest. Let the American people know. Let \nthe States know what they are going to have to pick up on this if it \npasses.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. GLENN. Not right now. I am just about to end, and then I will \ntake any questions.\n  If we are honest, I say let us get started and do it now. So why \nwait? Why do we need to wait for a balanced budget gun, in effect, \npointed to force us to action? We can take that action right now.\n  So let us not be reckless. Our Constitution has been amended only 27 \ntimes in well over 200 years, and before we amend it again, we ought to \nat least know what the ramifications will be; for after all, none of us \nwants the 28th amendment to turn out like the 18th amendment did. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, if I may respond to my friend from Ohio \nvery briefly--and he is my friend and he is one of the most valued \nMembers of this body. Digressing just a moment, if anyone ever \nquestions John Glenn's courage, take a look at that small little thing \nthat he got into--``thing'' is the wrong word, but he knows what I am \ntalking about--that went into space.\n It is incredible that anyone would get into that and get tossed into \nspace.\n\n  But any way, I think there are some answers for the questions of my \nfriend from Ohio. One is that we know from the General Accounting \nOffice if we balance the budget--and they suggested by the year 2001. \nThat is now 2002--that by the year 2020 we would have an average \nincrease in income per American, inflation adjusted, of 36 percent--\nthat is a huge increase--or, as they say, we are going to continue to \ngo downhill.\n  Second, we do know some of the options. And we have not spelled them \nout in detail. One is the Concord Coalition put together a package. CBO \nhas suggested--and they have the most conservative estimate in terms of \nwhat the savings would be on interest--the savings would be $140 \nbillion on interest.\n  We could follow the present limitations we have through fiscal year \n1998 and then put together for fiscal years 1999 through 2002 a \ncombination of the last Bush package and the package that we voted for \nin 1993. I was pleased and proud to join the Senator from Ohio in \nvoting for that. That is not that onerous. That is doable.\n  What I do favor--and I have discussed this just very informally with \nmy colleague from Utah, who is the chief sponsor--I favor, once this \npasses, asking the two leaders to put together a task force to outline \nin broad terms where we are going so that the States can know with some \nmore specificity. But I would add that you cannot--the Daschle \namendment has us down to $100 million for 7 years out. That is just not \nrealistic. But I think in terms of billions you can do that.\n  I would add the CBO figure on savings on interest is the most \nconservative. The Wharton School estimates the savings on interest will \nbe 4 percent; Data Resources, Inc., says a savings of 2.5 percent. \nTheir estimate is that half the savings that we will need by the year \n2002 can come out of interest. This is Data Resources, Inc. They also \nestimate if we do it we will have 2.5 million more jobs in this \ncountry. How many that will be in Ohio and Illinois, I do not know. But \nit is a very substantial amount.\n  I would add two other points here. One--and my colleague from Ohio \nmay differ with me as well as my colleague from Utah--I happen to think \nwe would not be in a bidding war on tax cuts right now if we had a \nbalanced budget amendment. I do not think it makes any sense, real \ncandidly, for us to say let us give ourselves a little bit of a tax \nbreak and impose a further burden on our children and our \ngrandchildren. I think that is a good example of why we need this. We \nare not going to be able to do everything we want. We are going to be \nforced to make some tough votes. But I think we have to be forced to do \nthat. And I hope they will be bipartisan.\n  Let me just add one final point. Those who say we can balance the \nbudget without a constitutional amendment have two things going against \nthem. One is that for 26 years we have not done it. That is a pretty \npowerful record. And second, they are saying to us you spell out in \ndetail what is going to happen, but they are not spelling it out in \ndetail. And at least we have, by all estimates we are going to save a \nhuge amount of money with interest. Whenever interest rates go down, \nemployment goes up. So there is a revenue plus in addition to the \ninterest savings.\n  So I hope my colleague from Ohio will continue to keep an open mind \non this because I think it is really essential for the future of our \ncountry.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SIMON. I yield to my colleague from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. We both value our great friend from Ohio, and I have to \ntell you that there is an offer by the other side and that is by the \nPresident. It is right here, the budget for this year.\n  I have to say I give him credit for certainly bringing the deficit \ndown from the almost $300 billion that it was--$279 billion--to $190 \nbillion. But from here on in, through the year 2005, this budget, using \noptimistic economic assumptions that we all know are going to \nfluctuate, is admitting that the deficits will be $190 billion at least \nfor every one of those years over the next 10 years. So they are not \ndoing anything to get down to a balanced budget.\n  If I could just add one other thing to my friend from Ohio. Back in \nthe early 1960's, when President Kennedy said we need to put a man on \nthe Moon, he set that as a goal. Nobody then was fully cognizant of \nwhat it was going to cost or what we were going to do to get that man \nthere. But we also know that our friend from Ohio was one of the \nearliest pioneers in that field. He is a hero to all of us, to \neverybody who understands space and what it took to get there.\n  But if before the President could even set the goal, before the \nPresident could even get it done, Congress had said we have to know \nevery detail on how you do it before we do anything, we would not be on \nthe Moon to this day.\n  The fact of the matter is all we are saying here is that if we pass \nthis amendment--and I appreciate my friend keeping his options open on \nthis amendment. That means a lot to me. I know it means a lot to my \nfriend and colleague from Illinois, and I think it means a lot to \neverybody in this body who is for a balanced budget amendment and maybe \nsome who are not. But the fact of the matter is it is important that we \nnot have to plug in every detail over three successive Congresses, \nwhich can change drastically on how we get there, when we have at least \n10 programs that have been advanced and there have not been the votes \nfor any one of those without a balanced budget amendment forcing the \nissue. And that is what this amendment does.\n  I just cite with particularity that sometimes we have to set the goal \nout there and provide the mechanism to reach that goal just like we did \nin space. Had we demanded that we have every detail of how you do it \nover three successive Congresses, we would not be in space to this day.\n  So I just cite that as an illustration that in budgetary parlance \nthose who are criticizing the amendment by demanding to know now how we \nare going to get there--we can give you 10 plans--they are the very \npeople who have never gotten us there for 26 years and who, it seems to \nme, are not going to get us there if the President's budget is any \nindication, and this is reality. This is tangible. This is something \nthat all of us got today.\n  I happen to have Alice Rivlin's copy of this because she gave it to \nme last night. I did not use it until right now because I did want to \nuse it without \n[[Page S2179]] her permission, but she gave me permission to use it \nonce it was distributed.\n  Frankly, here is tangible evidence that they are not going to do it \nthemselves. But if we put this balanced budget into place, we are going \nto do it. We will get it done just like we got it done in space.\n  They are not particularly analogous, I acknowledge that, but still I \nthink there is a point that for three Congresses the only way we get \nthere is to modify this, and the only way we are going to do that is if \nwe have a balanced budget amendment that gives us the incentives to do \nthe same.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. I appreciate the comments of my colleagues here, but I \ndisagree on what happened. We have not gone 26 years without action. I \ndisagree with that.\n  In 1993, we took action that headed our budget deficit downhill. We \nwere up to almost 300, we went down to around 250, one estimate this \nyear was for 168. It is back up around 190 now. But the point is we \nhave cast tough votes. We took tough action. We told the American \npeople in advance how we were going to do it so they knew how they were \ngoing to be affected.\n  We had things headed in the right direction. We can make all we want \nout of the President's budget that was submitted today, but let us \ncontinue on the track that we are on. And if there is to be, as my \nfriend from Illinois says, a task force appointed to tell us how to do \nthis, let us form the task force now. Hold up the balanced budget \namendment. Let the task force get together and tell us where the cuts \nare going to occur it if it passes. Then I would be much more happy \nwith this proposal.\n  I think we are reading so many things off the record here. I started \nout my remarks this morning by saying if I go home to Ohio and I point \nto somebody and I say, ``Your Social Security is going to be cut,'' \nthey say, ``Oh, no, wait a minute now, the other side says we are going \nto put Social Security off limits. That is not going to be cut.'' Then \nI say, ``They are going to cut your Medicare.'' And they say, ``Wait a \nminute, Medicare is going to be off budget here. We cannot cut that.'' \nThen we say, ``Interest on the national debt, we cannot cut back on \nthat because that would destroy the trust in our Government. And \ndefense is not going to be cut--probably it is cut a little too far \nalready given our worldwide responsibilities.''\n  If you take those things off budget, then everything else in the \nFederal budget--Alzheimer's, cancer, AIDS--everything else, unless you \nmake up the difference, is going to have to be cut by over 30 percent. \nThose are the facts.\n  So back in 1993, I think we took real action. We took action that \nshowed we can lay out these tough choices in advance and then have the \npolitical courage to enact them. And we did. Why do we say we cannot \npossibly make these decisions without a balanced budget amendment, when \nwe did it 2 years ago?\n  So I say once again, I would love to vote for a balanced budget \namendment, but I am not going to vote for a pig in a poke that may \nwreck the support system for a lot of people in Ohio and across this \ncountry without knowing the details of what we are voting for.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I will just take a couple of minutes. I \nagree with my colleague from Ohio, to the great credit of President \nClinton and to the credit of 50 Members of this body, we did start down \nthe right path.\n  What I also would have to acknowledge, as our colleague from \nNebraska, Senator Kerrey, said, is that it was a first step. But we \nhave not for 26 years balanced the budget. To go back to another time \nwhen, as was pointed out in your remarks, we had that kind of decline, \nyou have to go back to Harry Truman's day. I think we have illustrated \nwe just are not doing it on our own.\n  I finally point out we can change a lot of things in this body. We \ncannot change history. And the history of nations is, as they pile up \nthis debt, they keep piling it up because it is politically attractive \nto do so, and then they end up monetizing the debt. They just start the \nprinting machines running.\n  That is where we are heading if we do not adopt this amendment, in my \nopinion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, while the Senator from Illinois is on the \nfloor, I wonder whether he might be willing to engage in colloquy with \nme about the implementation legislation that would be required under \nthis amendment.\n  Before I ask him about that implementation legislation, however, I \nwas intrigued by his comment last time that we cannot change history. I \nagree with that. We can interpret history, but we cannot change it.\n  Part of the history of this body is that if we put the onus on future \nCongresses to do something instead of doing it ourselves, it is \nunlikely to get done. We pass legislation here--see, I remember in \n1980--that says, ``Congress will balance the budget.'' I think it \nbecame law. We did not. It was in the law, the law that we obligated \nourselves to comply with. We took an oath to uphold the Constitution of \nthe United States and the laws created pursuant thereto.\n  The Senator from Illinois, who is a dear friend of mine, and I had a \ncolloquy back in 1986, I believe--1986--about this same issue. This is \nabout 8 years ago, 9 years ago, when a similar amendment was pending \nbefore us.\n  I asked the Senator from Illinois these questions.\n\n       How would the monitoring of the flow of receipts and \n     outlays be done to determine whether the budget for any \n     fiscal year is on the track of being balanced? Would this \n     require implementing legislation?\n       Mr. Simon. There would have to be monitoring, and future \n     legislation would have to take care of the implementation of \n     that monitoring.\n       Mr. Levin. What exactly is the definition of receipts and \n     outlays? Specifically, would the receipts and outlays of \n     Bonneville Power Administration be receipts and outlays of \n     the United States pursuant to this constitutional amendment? \n     Would the answer to these questions require implementing \n     legislation?\n       Mr. Simon. Implementing legislation will be needed on some \n     of these peripheral questions, but the intent is clear.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Mr. Levin. * * * In an instance in which the President's \n     Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget \n     Office disagree with each other on what a level of outlays \n     is, how will the dispute be resolved so that it can be \n     determined whether or not outlays exceed receipts?\n       Mr. Simon. Future legislation will have to take care of \n     this.\n       Mr. Levin. Who will determine the level of receipts and \n     whether a revenue bill is ``a bill to increase revenues''? * \n     * * My question is, What happens if the revenue estimaters in \n     the Treasury Department say the bill is revenue neutral, and \n     the Joint Committee on Taxation say the bill will result in a \n     net increase in revenues? Whose estimate will prevail? How \n     will the dispute be resolved?\n       Mr. Simon. That will also have to be determined through \n     future legislation.\n\n  And on and on.\n  I am going to read into the Record, now, dozens of questions which \nhave to be answered by implementation legislation which we are not \ngoing to answer, we are not going to adopt legislation which will \nanswer them, but which are left up to a future Congress.\n  The Senator from Illinois and the Senator from Utah both said this is \nnot a self-executing provision. This provision requires Congress to act \nsometime between the year 1995, or whenever we adopt it and the States \nratify it, and the year 2002.\n  The Senator from Illinois has said over and over again courts cannot \nimplement it, cannot enforce it. There is no impoundment here for the \nPresident to enforce it. It is up to us to adopt implementation \nlegislation sometime in the next 7 years.\n  My question of my friend from Illinois, and I do not know he is going \nto be able to stay on the floor while I read through a whole host of \nquestions which are not answered by this amendment--but which are \nsimilar to the ones which we talked about in 1986 is--would he agree \nthat this amendment requires congressional legislation as a practical \nmatter in order to be enforced?\n  I understand putting the language in the Constitution will make it \nmore likely in his opinion that Congress will \n[[Page S2180]] act. He is optimistic Congress will read this language \nand do, by the year 2002, what it has not done up until now. I \nunderstand that he feels there will be a political onus of some kind \nthat will be borne if some Congress does not put together a majority in \nthe next 7 years to adopt that implementation legislation.\n  But specifically, does he not agree that in order for this amendment \nto have effect, implementation legislation is going to be required?\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, if I may respond to my colleague, the \nanswer is yes and no. The answer is the amendment itself has the \nrequirement for 60 percent to extend debt. So that is self-executing. \nAnd if Congress would not pass a single bill to implement, that would \nbe the power that is there. But there is no question that we have to \npass legislation to implement. I would not wait for future Congresses \nto act. I think we ought to start right away. I see my new colleague \nfrom Maine nodding in agreement here.\n  But let me make one other point, and that is we can nitpick here and \nthere on this. But the real important question and point is, that \ndialog took place in 1986. We missed by one vote, passing that in the \nU.S. Senate. At that point, the debt of this Nation was $2 trillion. \nNow it is $4.6 trillion. What if we had picked up one more vote? We \nwould have more people working; we would have a higher standard of \nliving; we would have lower interest rates; we would have more homes \nconstructed; we would have a much lower trade deficit; we would have \nmillions more jobs in our country.\n We would have millions more jobs in our country. And so we failed to \nact in 1986. There is no question.\n\n  There are things that we are going to have to work on. I know my \ncolleague from Michigan well enough to know that even though he opposes \nthis, if we have the votes, he is willing to dig in and work on the \nimplementing legislation. He will be a valued Member in doing that. But \nwe should not fool ourselves. We should not nit-pick here and not \nrecognize the basic principle, and that is that we are doing harm to \nour country in not facing up to our problems.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If my friend would again be willing to yield, obviously if \nwe had adopted a constitutional amendment 6 years ago, or 60 years ago, \nwhich led to a balanced budget we would probably be in better shape \nthan we are now depending on whether or not there was an opportunity \nduring a recession to be flexible.\n  But the issue I am raising is the opposite of a nit-pick. The issue \nthat I am raising goes to the heart of this amendment. This amendment \ndoes not assure us that we will achieve a balanced budget. That is not \na nit-pick. That is a statement that goes straight to the heart of this \namendment.\n  I want to get to the language that my friend from Illinois pointed \nto. The only language which the sponsor has pointed to that appears to \nbe self-enforcing is in section 2, having to do with the debt of the \nUnited States. But section 2 says that ``the limit on the debt of the \nUnited States held by the public shall not be increased.''\n  Does the Senator from Illinois know whether or not we have adopted a \nstatute which sets a limit on the publicly held debt of the United \nStates?\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, in response to my colleague, I think those \nterms are fairly clear. We had testimony on that very question from the \nformer Attorney General of the United States, Bill Barr, who believes \nthat language is very clear.\n  Mr. LEVIN. No. But my question to the Senator from Illinois--by the \nway, it is not that clear. But assuming for the moment it is clear as \nto what is meant by ``publicly held debt,'' assuming for a minute it is \nclear--I do not think it is; I will accept the statement--my question \nis: Do we have a statute now which sets a limit on the publicly held \ndebt of the United States?\n  Mr. SIMON. We have a statute that limits the debt of the United \nStates.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I understand. But my question is not that, because this \nsection 2 does not say that limit of the debt of the United States \nshall not be increased unless three-fifths vote. The sponsors have gone \nover the words very carefully. This is an amendment to the \nConstitution. They have gone over each word. I assume that it is very \nclearly their intent that it not be the limit of the debt of the United \nStates, but just a part of that debt which they say will not be \nincreased except by three-fifths vote.\n  So my question again to my dear friend from Illinois is this: Is \nthere currently a statutory limit on the debt of the United States \nwhich is held by the public?\n  That is my specific question.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, if we had changed the language so it just \nsays ``debt'' instead of ``publicly held debt,'' there would be \nquestions about that. Our intent is clear. When my good friend--he is \nmy good friend--from Michigan implies that we are not going to pay \nattention to this, the Senator from Michigan, the Senator from Maine, \nthe Senator from Wyoming, and the Senator from Illinois stood over \nthere right to the left of the Presiding Officer. We held up our right \nhands and we took only one oath--to uphold the Constitution. I do not \nthink this body is going to ignore that. I think that is the real \nquestion. I am not suggesting that my colleague from Michigan is not \nsincere. But we can nit-pick. The principle is clear. The language, \nconstitutional scholars have told us, is clear.\n  I hope we move ahead and not get sidetracked on this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me answer my own question since my \nfriend from Illinois has not; that is, there is no limit that I know of \nin statute on the publicly held debt. So when the Senator from Illinois \npoints to that provision as being the self-executing provision of this \nlanguage, and there is none other that could be pointed to, he is \npointing to a limit which does not exist currently in law which would \nrequire the Congress to enact a limit. Each one of us upholds the \nConstitution of the United States within the best of our ability. We \neach have taken that oath. We each raise our hands. The Senator from \nMaine did it just a few weeks ago in this body. She has done it many \ntimes in the other body. We do not raise our hands as a group. It is \nnot a group oath. It is an individual oath. We can carry out that oath \nwhile not agreeing with each other. As a matter of fact, we carry out \nthat oath all the time while not agreeing with each other. If we always \nagreed with each other because we took an oath, there would be \nunanimity in this Senate instead of division. We do not always agree, \nalthough we have all taken the oath.\n  This constitutional amendment does not require us to balance the \nbudget in a way which can be enforced. It simply requires us to try to \npass a statute within the next 7 years. There is a lot of difference. \nIt basically takes us off the hook for 7 years because it raises the \nsuggestion, it purports to state that we are going to balance the \nbudget by the year 2002 but has no enforcement mechanism in there to \nachieve it; none. So for the next 7 years we are off the hook, and then \nthere is no hook.\n  The Senator from Illinois says, yes, there is because there is this \nlanguage in section 2 which says that the debt limit will not be raised \nunless 60 percent of the whole Members of each House vote for such an \nincrease.\n  That is not a hook for two reasons. No. 1, there is no debt limit for \npublicly held debt that is currently in law, and, therefore, the \nCongress is going to have to pass a statute setting a debt limit for \n``publicly held debt.'' So even that language requires the Congress to \nestablish a publicly held debt limit which is a subpart; by the way, a \nsubpart that is in dispute as to exactly how much it is of the current \ndebt limit.\n  But it is also not a hook for another reason; that is, that it simply \nsuggests that somehow or other we are not going to pay our debts, that \nhaving run up debts, the Congress of the United States is not going to \npay our bills. That has historically not worked, and it should not work \nbecause we should pay our bills. We should not default on obligations \nof the United States of America. Catastrophe would result if we did not \npay our debts.\n  I quoted a colloquy between myself and the Senator from Illinois \nabout the 1986 version in which repeatedly the Senator from Illinois, \nas always, is candid in saying that is going to require implementing \nlegislation, and \n[[Page S2181]] that is going to require implementation legislation and \nthat is going to require implementation legislation. There are a lot of \nother ``that's''; probably 30, 40, or 50 other important issues which \nwould require Congress somehow or other to reach agreement as to how to \ndo something.\n  What is the definition of ``receipts\"? Do receipts include receipts \nfrom the Postal Service, TVA power savings, Medicare premium payments, \nreceipts of government corporations, deposits in non-Treasury accounts? \nI am sure implementation legislation is going to have to be used for \nthat.\n  What is the definition of ``outlays\"? Do they include Federal loans, \nfederally guaranteed loans? Do they include spending by government \ncorporations, quasi-Federal agencies which pay for their activities out \nof user fees? It goes on and on and on. Will we use estimates or actual \nexpenditures and actual receipts?\n  What happens if the OMB and CBO disagree with each other on what the \nlevel of outlays and receipts are? How is the dispute going to be \nresolved? What is a bill to increase revenues? It sounds easy. It is \nnot. It is a very difficult question, as a matter of fact. At what \npoint will it be determined that outlays will in fact exceed receipts, \nwhich triggers remedial action? Are we going to do it early in the year \nor in the middle of the year? The answer is we will resolve all that by \n2002.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na list of questions, the answers to which I believe--but we will wait \nand see--will be left up to implementation legislation.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                  Balanced Budget Amendment Questions\n\n       1. What exactly is the definition of receipts? For example, \n     do receipts include the receipts from Postal Service stamp \n     sales and TVA power sales? Do they include Medicare premium \n     payments. Do they include the receipts of government \n     corporations and quasi-federal agencies which deposit money \n     in non-Treasury accounts? Who will make this determination?\n       2. What exactly is the definition of outlays? For example, \n     do outlays include federal loans and federally-guaranteed \n     loans? Do they include spending by government corporations \n     and quasi-federal agencies which pay for their activities out \n     of user fees instead of out of Treasury accounts? Who will \n     make this determination?\n       3. Will estimates or actual levels be used for receipts and \n     outlays? In an instance in which the OMB and the CBO disagree \n     with each other on what the outlays or receipts are, how will \n     the dispute be resolved so that it can be determined whether \n     or not outlays exceed receipts?\n       4. Who will determine whether a bill is `a bill to increase \n     revenues?' For example, what happens if OMB says the bill is \n     revenue neutral, and CBO says the bill will result in a net \n     increase in revenues? Whose estimate will prevail? How will \n     the dispute be resolved?\n       5. At what point will it be determined that outlays will in \n     fact exceed receipts, triggering remedial action? August 1? \n     September 15? Who will make that determination--OMB or CBO?\n       6. At whatever point it is determined that outlays do or \n     will exceed receipts, will automatic spending cuts or tax \n     increases be triggered? When would that happen, and who would \n     be responsible for making it happen? Will cuts affect all \n     programs equally across-the-board, or will certain programs \n     be exempt?\n       7. Would it violate the language of the amendment if \n     Congress passes, with less than 60% of the votes, a budget \n     resolution that is not balanced?\n       8. Would it violate the language of the amendment if \n     Congress passes, with less than 60% of the votes, a bill to \n     increase spending from some base level without off-setting \n     spending cuts or revenue increases? Would it matter whether \n     this was the last appropriations bill of the year, and would \n     result total appropriations exceeding expected receipts? If \n     not, how will we ensure that Congress does not increase \n     spending without paying for it?\n       9. Would it violate the language of the amendment if \n     Congress passes, with less than 60% of the votes, a bill to \n     cut taxes without off-setting spending cuts or revenue \n     increases? If not, how will we ensure that Congress does not \n     cut taxes without paying for it?\n       10. What happens if Congress passes a budget resolution \n     which is in balance, that enacts appropriations bills on the \n     basis of that resolution, but part way through the year it \n     appears that outlays will exceed receipts? Would Congress be \n     required to vote separately on whether to authorize or \n     eliminate the excess, even through it voted for budget and \n     appropriations bills in the believe that the budget would be \n     balanced? What mechanism would be created to ensure that such \n     a bill would be considered?\n       11. At what point during the fiscal year would Congress be \n     required to voter to authorize an excess of outlays or to \n     eliminate that excess? What would happen if Congress did not \n     approve either such measure?\n       12. Would the amendment be enforced through sequestration \n     of impoundment? If so, when and how would that action take \n     place?\n       13. What happens if Congress approves a specific excess of \n     outlays over receipts by the required three-fifths vote of \n     each House, but the projection turns out to be wrong--the \n     deficit is greater than expected. Would a second vote be \n     required to approve the revised estimate of the deficit? Who \n     determines the dollar amount of excess that Congress will \n     vote on in each case? Who determines that the estimated \n     excess was wrong? How often would such determinations be \n     made, and such votes be required? Who determines when the \n     votes must take place?\n       14. The resolution requires that three-fifths of each House \n     vote to approve an excess ``by law''. Does this mean that the \n     President must sign a bill to approve an excess? What happens \n     if three-fifths of the Members of each House approve a \n     deficit, but the President vetoes the bill? On the other \n     hand, what happens if Congress passes a reconciliation bill \n     to balance the budget and the President vetoes it and there \n     are insufficient votes to override the veto? For example, \n     what if Congress votes to increase taxes to eliminate the \n     deficit and the President says he prefers spending cuts and \n     vetoes the bill. If there are insufficient votes to override \n     the veto, who has violated the Constitution--the Congress or \n     the President?\n       15. Could Congress shift receipts or outlays from one year \n     to another to meet balanced budget requirements? For example, \n     could paydays for government employees be put off a few days \n     into the next fiscal year to achieve a balance between \n     receipts and outlays? What mechanisms will prevent this type \n     of abuse?\n       16. Section 2 of the resolution provides that ``the limit \n     on the debt of the United States held by the public shall not \n     be increased'' without a three-fifths vote. What is the \n     current statutory ``limit on the debt of the United States \n     held by the public'', if any? If there is currently no such \n     limit, how will such a limit be established?\n       17. What does the debt of the United States held by the \n     public include? Specifically, does it include the debt of \n     wholly-owned government corporations (like the Commodity \n     Credit Corporation and the Overseas Private Investment \n     Corporation)? Does it include the debt of mixed-ownership \n     government corporations (like Amtrak and the Federal Deposit \n     Insurance Corporation)? Does it include loans guaranteed by \n     the federal government, such as guaranteed student loans, \n     guaranteed agriculture and export loans, or Mexican loan \n     guarantees? If not, could additional government corporations \n     and quasi-governmental agencies be created to conduct federal \n     programs off-budget to evade the amendment? Could new \n     government guaranteed lending programs replace government \n     spending? How would this be prevented?\n       18. May the President transmit a proposed budget which is \n     not in balance in addition to his balanced budget proposal? \n     May the President transmit a balanced budget, but recommends \n     against its adoption? Can he submit the balanced budget at \n     any time before the fiscal year begins?\n       19. The Committee report states that the words ``bill to \n     increase revenue'' covers ``those measures whose intended and \n     anticipated effect will be to increase revenues to the \n     Federal Government.'' Does this mean net revenue? Over what \n     period of time would this be judged?\n       Would the revenue provision apply to a bill that increases \n     revenues for three years and reduces revenues for the \n     following three years, with a net change of zero over the \n     six-year period? What happens if the amendment is repealed \n     after three years, because it would result in a deficit?\n       Would a bill to increase the capital gains tax be exempt, \n     since many argue would have the effect of reducing revenue in \n     at least the early years after enactment?\n       20. Does ``revenue'' include fees? How do we tell the \n     difference between a revenue measure increasing fees and a \n     spending measure decreasing outlays by requiring users to pay \n     for services provided to them instead of funding the services \n     out of tax revenues?\n       What about a bill to raise the federal share of receipts \n     from concessions in our national parks?\n       What if the bill simply required regular competition for \n     national park concessions? Would that be a bill to increase \n     revenue, since it would have the ``intended and anticipated \n     effect'' of increasing the federal share?\n       21. Does revenue include tariffs? Would a trade measure \n     which authorizes use of retaliatory tariffs in certain cases \n     be considered a ``revenue measure'', since it would arguably \n     have the ``intended and anticipated effect'' of increasing \n     revenues? Who will make this determination?\n       22. Does revenue include civil and criminal penalties? \n     Would a bill that establishes a new civil or criminal penalty \n     be considered a ``revenue'' measure? How about a bill that \n     indexes certain penalties for inflation? How about a measure \n     to toughen enforcement of criminal or civil penalties? Would \n     a bill to tighten enforcement of the tax laws or provide more \n     personnel to the IRS be covered, \n     [[Page S2182]] since it would have the ``intended and \n     anticipated effect'' of increasing revenues? Who will decide \n     what is covered by this provision?\n       23. Would a statute that requires a new, lower measure for \n     inflation, be considered a bill to increase revenue, since by \n     slowing the adjustment of tax brackets it would have the \n     ``intended and anticipated effect'' of increasing taxes? \n     Would the elimination of a special, targeted tax break be \n     covered by this provision? Would it cover a bill authorizing \n     the sale of buildings or land?\n       24. Sponsors of the amendment have said that the social \n     security trust funds will be protected in implementing \n     legislation and that the budget will not be balanced at the \n     expense of the States. How will this result be ensured?\n       25. The term ``fiscal year'' is not defined in the \n     amendment. The report indicates that Congress has the power \n     to define the term ``fiscal year.'' Does this mean that \n     Congress could change the effective date of the amendment by \n     legislation, passed by majority vote, which changes the \n     statutory time at which a fiscal year begins and ends?\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. There are about 50 questions here which will determine \nwhether or not in fact this constitutional amendment can be implemented \nin a way to achieve a balanced budget.\n  I will submit a copy of these to the sponsors of the legislation so \nthey can give us an answer to the question.\n  The bottom line for me, Mr. President, is that this proposed \nconstitutional amendment does not balance the budget. It dodges the \nissue because it depends on Congress passing implementation legislation \nby the year 2002. What if it were fully implemented? The sponsors are \noptimistic that it will be fully implemented. I think they are overly \noptimistic, for all the reasons which I have stated and a whole bunch \nmore.\n  It is going to be very difficult for Congress to agree on how to make \ncuts in legislation which will automatically sequester, which will \ndetermine who will make the cuts, which will determine what all of the \nhundreds of other decisions are that have to be made so that we can \nhave a balanced budget assured. Let us assume for a minute that the \nsponsors' optimism is borne out and we kick the can down the road to \nthe Congress 7 years from now and we say: You folks pass implementation \nlegislation.\n  I do not think that is a responsible thing to do. In fact, I think \nwhat we are likely to do by kicking the can down the road to a future \nCongress, instead of acting ourselves on either the implementation \nlegislation or the cuts, is to increase the deficit.\n  So the answer to my friend from Illinois as to whether or not we \nwould not have been, 6 or 8 years ago, had we passed the amendment is \nprobably we would be worse off because probably then we would have \nsaid, oh, they will take care of that in that future Congress. We would \nnot have done the hard work necessary a couple of years ago when we \nfinally decided to make some cuts in the deficit. We would have ducked \nand said, oh, the Constitution will take care of that. A future \nCongress will take care of that. That is what this amendment does.\n  But, for the moment, let us say that this legislation, which this \namendment relies on--this implementation legislation--in fact will be \npassed, that somehow or other a majority of individual Members of the \nHouse and the Senate will be able to agree on a process to make the \ncuts that are necessary; what would be the impact? Should we know about \nthem?\n  I was interested when the Senator from Illinois said: ``Well, after \nwe pass the amendment, the leaders ought to get together and give us \nsomething of a roadmap--not too specific, but so the States will know \nwhat the cuts are.''\n  Why should we wait? The Senator from Ohio asked the Senator from \nIllinois: ``Why are we waiting for whatever roadmap and whatever \nspecificity we are going to get from the leaders? Why do we wait for \nthe roadmap until after we have voted on the amendment? Why not adopt \nit now and why not see it now? Why not have the benefit of knowing what \nthe impacts will be now, again assuming that this legislation is going \nto be fully implemented?''\n  There was no answer to that question that was forthcoming, because I \nthink the same logic that says that the States should have some idea as \nto what the impacts are would lead to the conclusion that we should \nknow what the impacts are--again, under a very big assumption, the \nassumption being that this will indeed be fully implemented.\n  There are two problems with this constitutional amendment that have \nbeen pointed out--two big ones. One is that the cuts will be massive \nand should be known in advance. Another problem that others hold more \nclosely is that in fact it will not be implemented. Neither one of \nthose are particularly desirable outcomes. If it were not implemented, \nif this is a dodge, if there are so many loopholes in this language \nthat it will not be fully implemented, it would be tragic to use the \nConstitution that way. We would then be using the Constitution as a way \nof avoiding our own responsibility of saying that Congress, by 2002, \nshould do something that we are unwilling to do, thereby evading what \nwe should be doing ourselves. I do not think the public is telling us \nto pass language in a Constitution which says to a future Congress, \n``Do something.'' I think the public wants us to do it and not dodge \nit. That is my view as to what the likely outcome is of adopting this \nconstitutional amendment.\n  But there is another view which also has a lot of support, it seems \nto me, behind it, which is that, yes, this thing could be fully \nimplemented, and then we should know what the cuts are prior to our \nadopting the language of this constitutional amendment. We should know \nand the States should know before they are sent an amendment for \nratification.\n  Whether we pass this amendment or not, it is still going to take a \nmajority of the votes of the Members of each House to make the tough \nchoices that are needed to cut spending and raise taxes. But unless and \nuntil we make these choices, we are not going to have a balanced budget \nregardless of whether we pass this resolution and regardless of whether \nthe States ratify.\n  Saying that we have to balance the budget cannot make it happen. \nUnless and until we do the hard work of budgeting, or at least unless \nwe adopt the implementation legislation, it is all a dodge. It \nencourages us to say that we have a cure before we have taken the \nmedicine. That, to me, is the irresponsible part of this amendment, \nthat it allows us to say that we have cured something before we have \neither taken the medicine or at least adopted the implementation \nlegislation that will lead us to a certain result.\n  Every one of us in this body knows that we are not going to get to a \nbalanced budget without real sacrifice. One plan which was put forth by \nsome House Republicans last March would have cut spending on the \nenvironment by 44 percent, spending on agriculture by 72 percent, \nspending on energy by 65 percent, and cut the defense budget by $83 \nbillion. I give those sponsors of that amendment credit for laying out \nwhat the impacts would be--at least what they were willing to support. \nThey are entitled to credit, I believe, for what they did. But are we \nall willing to do that? I hope we have the same kind of courage. It may \nlead to different kinds of cuts or a different balance of cuts, but at \nleast I hope we will have that courage.\n  Yet, the reason we are told we should not adopt this roadmap, that we \nshould not lay out what the impacts will be in advance, was set forth \nby the House majority leader, Dick Armey, who said that once Members of \nCongress know exactly, chapter and verse, the pain that the Government \nmust live with in order to get to a balanced budget, their knees will \nbuckle.\n  Think about that for a minute. What he means is if you look at real-\nworld numbers, if we level with the American people about what it will \ntake to balance the budget, in his assessment, it will not pass. I \nthink that is an ostrich-like way of legislating, and far worse.\n It is an ostrich-like approach to amending the Constitution. And we \nought to be much more serious about the Constitution than to pass \namendments which do not tell us either what the process will be to \nachieve it or at least have an enforcement mechanism to achieve it.\n\n  I do not know of any other provision of the Constitution--there may \nbe one; I cannot find it--that is not enforceable, either in court or \nby the executive branch.\n  Now, we do not want this enforceable in court because we do not want \ncourts deciding to raise taxes or making us do it, and we do not want \nit enforceable \n[[Page S2183]] by the executive branch. And we are sure we do not \nbecause we do not want to give the President impoundment authority.\n  If it is not going to be enforceable by either the courts or the \nexecutive through impoundment--which, by the way, I agree with that \nconclusion that we ought to make it very specific in this amendment \nthat that cannot be, either have courts telling us where the cuts are, \ncourts adopting taxes, or the President impounding--but if it is not \ngoing to do that, if the intent of the sponsors is that it not lead to \neither impoundment or court enforcement, it then totally depends upon \nCongress implementing and enforcing it. In that case, one of two things \nis necessary: Either it is not going to be implemented, which would be \nirresponsible and a misuse of the Constitution; or it will be, in which \ncase the American people and the States should know what the impacts \nare.\n  It is one or the other. It either is going to be implemented by the \nCongress--and I do not share the optimism of my friend from Illinois \nthat a Congress 6 or 7 years from now will adopt implementation \nlegislation. I think it is wrong for us to pass the buck to them. But \nif it is not going to be implemented by them, it is wrong. If it is \ngoing to be implemented by them, we should know the impact and the \nAmerican people and the States should know the impact.\n  We have been down this road before. This is not new, that we \nconsidered constitutional amendments before.\n  We actually put into our laws before that Congress shall balance the \nFederal budget by a certain year. We put in our laws the Gramm-Rudman \nmechanism which did not work, and it did not work because it did not \nhave an enforcement mechanism which assured that we would get to a \ncertain point by a certain time. It was left to future Congresses. \nAlways future Congresses.\n  But what is unique about this legislation is that this is not a bill. \nThis is a constitutional amendment which fundamentally says, ``Congress \nshall do something.'' It leaves it to a future Congress to pass the \nimplementation legislation to do it instead of us doing it.\n  And, I must say, I am intrigued by reference to the Founding Fathers. \nIt is unthinkable to me that those Founding Fathers of this country, in \na constitutional convention, would pass language that says a future \nCongress should do something. Not that we should do it, not that we \nshould take the responsibility, not that we should be accountable, not \nthat we should act, but we should put into the document which is nearly \nsacred for every American, the Constitution, language which says \n``Congress, by a certain year, should adopt a law which will achieve \nsomething.''\n  Would any of us vote for a constitutional amendment which reads \nsomething like this: ``Congress, within the next 7 years, shall adopt a \nlaw which will make racial, religious, or ethnic discrimination \nunlawful''? Would we put that in the Constitution? ``Congress, within \nthe next 7 years, will adopt a law to prohibit religious, racial, and \nethnic discrimination''? I cannot believe we would do that. I think we \nwould pass the law to prohibit the discrimination. We would take the \nresponsibility.\n  The Founding Fathers would take the responsibility for passing the \nlaw or they would put into the Constitution a right or a prohibition \nwhich is enforceable.\n  The Constitution is the place where we put in rights and prohibitions \nwhich are enforceable. They are not a place where we put in language \nsuch as this which allows us to kick the can down the road for 7 years \nwhich allows us to tell a future Congress to do what we are unwilling \nto do, either to make the cuts or to adopt a process which will lead to \nit.\n  There is no other constitutional amendment like this, and for a good \nreason.\n  We should face up to the obligation. We either should adopt the cuts \nor adopt the process. Either make the cuts or adopt the implementation \nlegislation so we all know what it is. We should not simply say, ``We \nare going to amend the Constitution to tell a future Congress that they \nshould do something,'' knowing full well the difficulties for any \nCongress to do it.\n  Now, Senator Simon and others are optimistic that a future Congress \nwill do it, much more optimistic in those future Congresses being able \nto do things that we have been unable to do, frankly, than I am. But \ntheir optimism should be tested now. We should adopt the implementation \nlegislation. If a future Congress can do it, we can do it, and that is \nthe test of their optimism.\n  In the absence of our doing it, either making the cuts or adopting \nthe implementation legislation which their language requires a future \nCongress to do, this balanced budget amendment is, I am afraid, going \nto be little more than a feel-good amendment which purports to address \nthe problem of Government spending and deficits without actually \naddressing the problem.\n  The people want us to move to a balanced budget. They want us to do \nthat. They do not want us to push the responsibility off to a future \nCongress, as this amendment would do. They want us to do it.\n  The proposed amendment is full of loopholes and ambiguities. For \nexample:\n  The implementation of the amendment depends on economic estimates \nthat can be made overly optimistic if that is what is necessary to \nproject a balanced budget. We have seen enough rosy scenarios in the \nbudgets of both Republican and Democratic administrations to know how \nthis game is likely to be played.\n  The amendment requires a balanced budget in each fiscal year. \nThroughout the 1980's Congress and the President artificially lowered \nthe reported deficit and met Gramm-Rudman targets by shifting the \ntiming of spending from one fiscal year to another. Under the proposed \namendment, we can expect similar budgetary shell games.\n  States with balanced budget requirements have frequently avoided them \nby creating independent or quasi-public agencies and placing their \nexpenditures off-budget. We did much the same thing in the 1980's with \nthe costs of the savings and loan bailout. Because the amendment does \nnot define key terms such as ``receipts'' and ``outlays,'' it is \ncertain to lead to similar manipulations.\n  Costs could be shifted from the Federal Government to State and local \ngovernments by simply reducing funding for existing programs. Reduced \ngrants to the States would shift the burden of the deficit from the \nFederal Government to State and local governments but would not shrink \nthe overall gap between Government revenues and Government spending.\n  The authors of the amendment have acknowledged that the proposed \namendment would be unenforceable without further legislative action by \nthe Congress. If outlays exceed receipts, they say, neither the \nPresident nor the courts could step in to address the problem. I am not \naware of any case in which we have enacted a constitutional amendment \nwhich the sponsors themselves claim to be unenforceable, but that is \nwhat the authors of this resolution have said.\n  This resolution does not tell us what an ``outlay'' is. It does not \ntell us what a ``receipt'' is. It does not tell us how Congress, which \nenacts appropriations and revenue measures, will regulate the precise \nlevel of outlays and receipts. It does not tell us how Congress will \nmonitor the flow of outlays and receipts. It does not tell us who will \ndetermine the levels of outlays and receipts, whether it is CBO or OMB. \nAnd it does not tell us what will happen if outlays in fact exceed \nreceipts.\n  The answers to all of these questions are left to a future Congress. \nBut, Mr. President, amending the Constitution is far too important an \nundertaking to be done in the dark.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I think it is about time for us to start voting on \nthis amendment. After a week of talking about the balanced budget, I \nbelieve that just about every argument against it is pointless, except \nmaybe one. The opponents' arguments are just many different ways of \nsaying, ``I don't want a balanced budget amendment, because I don't \nwant a balanced budget.''\n   [[Page S2184]] The one I had to research to respond to is that the \namendment is nothing more than a gimmick. After the fourth or fifth \ntime I heard this, I stopped assuming that I knew what a gimmick is and \ndecided to look it up.\n  One dictionary says a gimmick is ``A trivial or unnecessary \ninnovation added to enhance appeal.''\n   The opponents of this constitutional amendment say we are supposed \nto pass responsible budgets without constitutional requirements.\n  Now, how would you explain that, when we have run deficits in this \ncountry for 34 of the last 35 years? When were they planning to start \nbeing responsible? Mr. President, when were they planning to say we are \ngoing to be serious without a balanced budget amendment that says we \nare going to be serious and there is no wiggle room?\n  The opponents also say this amendment is a gimmick and we should not \nmess with the Constitution. The Framers expressly provided for \nconstitutional amendments.\n  We have been debating this proposal for over 12 years. The entire \nConstitutional Convention took about 4 months in 1789. We are not \nproceeding recklessly. We are acting after careful deliberation. We \npassed a balanced budget amendment here in the Senate in 1982. We \nfailed in 1986, 1992, and 1994 by a handful of votes. The House tried \nin 1990 and 1992.\n  A few days ago, with its new Members elected by a public demanding a \nreal change in Washington, the House passed the amendment for the first \ntime. With so many years of debate and preparation, Mr. President, we \ncannot throw away this opportunity to put America on a new course. I \nbelieve this is the most important vote that we will take in our terms \nin the Senate.\n  Now, the opponents say, ``We should not legislate on the \nConstitution.'' Well, I agree, we should not legislate on the \nConstitution. It is a framework for Government and it should not spell \nout particular policy choices. But the same opponents that make this \nclaim also propose amendments to this resolution which legislate \nexemptions into the Constitution for high-priority items.\n  Such exemptions would, themselves, create gimmicks. Every possible \nprogram would get squeezed into the off-budget constitutional \nexception. Such exceptions, Mr. President, would require future \nCongresses and future generations to follow our priorities. They would \nhave to use our programs instead of setting their own priorities and \nusing their own plans, public or private, to address them.\n  Even the minority leader's motion to recommit with instructions \nprovides for a balanced budget amendment that says, ``The directives \nrequired by subsection A-3 shall be deemed to be directives within the \nmeaning of section 310(A) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. Upon \nreceiving all legislative submissions''--now, does that sound like \nJames Madison? It sounds an awful lot like legislation to me. It sounds \nlike the Budget Act, something no Member really wants to see enshrined \nfor all time in our Constitution. If we start amending the Constitution \nwith sentences like that, people will not be able to carry our \nConstitution in their vest pockets anymore.\n  Now, my dictionary has another definition for gimmicks. It says it is \n``a significant feature that is obscured, ordinarily misrepresented; a \ncatch.'' Now, the opponents of this amendment keep trying to say there \nis a catch. They are trying to scare the public into thinking that all \nof the services that the Federal Government provides will be \neliminated. Of course that is not true. To balance the budget by 2002 \nwe only have to slow down future increases in total spending, not cut \nspending below its current level.\n  We can cut the bureaucracy and the redundancy of the Federal \nGovernment while preserving our most important programs. That is \nprioritizing. We must provide the programs that help those who cannot \nhelp themselves. We have always done that in this country. What is to \nchange? We will feed the hungry. We will care for children and disabled \npeople who cannot help themselves. And we can do it while continuing to \ncut waste, and do it more efficiently.\n  Like all bureaucrats whose kingdoms are threatened, the opponents of \nthis amendment claim that any cut would destroy the most popular \nprogram, while they hide the waste, fraud, and abuse in the back. Now, \nI have heard this argument before. It is called the ``We are going to \nhave to close the Washington Monument argument.'' They show us the most \npopular program and they say, ``This is what is going to be cut.'' They \nare acting like we do not have the sense or the commitment or the \nability to prioritize what are the most important uses of taxpayers' \ndollars.\n  They are like the boy who cried wolf one too many times. We do not \nbelieve them anymore. We do not believe that the Government cannot \nreally operate with a few cents less on the dollar. That is what \nbalancing the budget comes down to. Pennies on the dollar. We can reach \na balanced budget by the year 2002 without cutting Social Security or \nMedicare.\n  (Mr. THOMPSON assumed the chair.)\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, will the Senator from Texas yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I yield.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Senator.\n  I think the Senator is raising some very significant issues \nconcerning this constitutional amendment to balance the budget. The \nSenator was mentioning the fact that so many of the opponents of this \nbalanced budget amendment call it a gimmick. My response has always \nbeen if it were a gimmick, Congress would have passed it long ago.\n  As the Senator knows, over the years we have had a number of \nstatutory approaches. Now there have been suggestions under the Daschle \namendment and the so-called right to know that somehow we should pass \nimplementing legislation to tell the American public how we plan to \nbalance the budget over the next 7 years. But that is also statutory \nlanguage.\n  On the other hand, they are saying the constitutional amendment we \nwould not necessarily have to enforce. How do we know the Congress in \nthe year 2002 will actually enforce a constitutional amendment? Would \nthe Senator not agree that this is the only way, given your experience \nhere in this institution, to get a balanced budget for the American \npeople and for future generations, is through a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Maine has \nmade the most important point. Gramm-Rudman was a wonderful idea that \nshould have worked. But what happened? Congress came along and bypassed \nit, and bypassed it again, and bypassed it again. So it meant nothing.\n  That is exactly the point that I was making about having an exception \nto the amendment. Any exception. What will happen? Congress will start \nputting more things into what we except, and it will bind future \ngenerations to say, ``That is the area that you must except out.'' It \ncould be that in 20 years Social Security or whatever exception they \nare going to put forward may be taken care of. It may not even be an \nissue at all. Why would we put that in the Constitution and take away \nthe ability of future generations to just act within a framework?\n  It is clear that we have to have a framework in the Constitution. \nSaying that there would be this exception or that exception does not \ntake into account the changes in our society that might happen in the \nnext 50 or 100 years.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, would the Senator further yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I yield.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as the Senator was mentioning, the \nconstitutional amendment establishes a very important framework, as our \nforefathers established through our Constitution. We obviously take an \noath of office, individually; we take an oath of office, on behalf of \nthis institution and on behalf of the American people. So, we logically \nwould follow up in enforcing that constitutional amendment.\n  As the Senator was mentioning about the various pieces of legislation \nthat have been enacted over the years in Congress, for example, in the \nGramm-Rudman-Hollings to which she was referring, again, numerous \nadjustments were not made. It gets back to the \n[[Page S2185]] issue of whether or not we would be able to balance the \nbudget through the Constitution, statutory approaches. But we know the \nstatutory approaches have already failed on numerous occasions, \nstretching back to the year 1921.\n  We had the Budget Accounting Act, the Revenue Act, the Byrd Act. We \nhave adjusted the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act on numerous occasions \nbecause we could not meet the requirements within that legislation for \nbalancing the budget, believe it or not, by 1993 and then again in \n1995, and in the 1990 revision of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. So it is \nclear that that has not worked.\n  Now, as the Senator knows, this amendment that is before the Senate \nconcerning the right to know, I think the American people do not agree \nthat we are right in terms of what we are enacting in this hypothetical \nbudget that has been suggested here, that we would pass accompanying \nthe Constitution an amendment which would somehow be the budget that \nwould be operative in the year 2002. Of course it would hot.\n  Would the Senator not agree that this approach is somewhat of a \ndilatory action, or hypothetical sideshow not to enact a constitutional \namendment, knowing full well that we will get a balanced budget through \na constitutional amendment and not through a statutory approach?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I think the Senator from Maine is making an important \npoint. When you are doing something that is as important as this, we do \nneed to do it right because it is going to be an amendment to our \nConstitution that will last. Our Constitution has prevailed over the \ncenturies because we have been very careful not to bind future \ngenerations. With the Constitution, less is more.\n  There is one thing that we have to do, and that is make a bottom \nline. We have to say, like every business in America, like every \nhousehold in America, like every State government and every local \ngovernment in America, there is an end. We must set our parameters and \nthen work within those parameters to set our priorities. That is what \nevery other entity in America does.\n  As the Senator from Maine has said, this is the time. It is a very \nshort window that we have to make a difference in the direction this \ncountry is going, and we have the mandate.\n  For the first time, the House of Representatives has passed a \nbalanced budget amendment, and if we miss this opportunity, it may be \nthat the window will not return.\n  I wonder what all of these people who are convinced we should not \nhave an amendment, I wonder what they are going to say to the American \npeople about how they will balance the budget if they do not want it in \nthe Constitution and they say, show me first. Show me what you are \ngoing to do if we do not have it. What is going to be different today \nthan 34 out of the last 35 years? Isn't that really the question?\n  Ms. SNOWE. Will the Senator yield? I think that is exactly the \nquestion. Would you not agree that those who are opposed to a \nconstitutional amendment have a greater burden to prove how they could \nenact a balanced budget statutorily, because all previous attempts have \nfailed time and again?\n  There has been obfuscation, diversion, delays, distraction, and, in \nthe final analysis, we have only seen our debt grow. We have heard some \ndiscussions how the deficit has come down in recent years, but what we \ndo not hear is the fact the deficit is going to go back up for the \nremainder of this decade. In fact, since the last time the Senate \npassed a balanced budget amendment in 1982, the debt has grown 309 \npercent.\n  Even the President's own budget, interestingly enough--we hear so \nmuch talk about the President's tax package in 1993, and I well recall \nthat because I served on the House Budget Committee. We were challenged \nto bring up our own specific line-item cuts. As Republicans on the \ncommittee, we did. We did $435 billion worth of specific line-item \nreductions in the budget.\n  Guess what? They were all rejected. So we got a tax increase, which \nhappens to be the largest tax increase in the history of the country. \nIt was supposed to reduce the deficit. To some extent it did, but, \nagain, what happened is the deficit continues to rise. In fact, one of \nthe reasons why it is rising is that the revenues projected from that \ntax increase are less than had been anticipated and projected by the \nadministration. As a matter of fact, the Congressional Budget Office \nhas recalculated the deficit by $25 billion for each of the next 5 \nyears, and that is based on an 11-year economic expansion. That would \nbe 3 years longer than the longest postwar expansion.\n  And so we can understand what is going to happen; we are just going \nto see more debt. There will be obfuscation here about the right to \nknow, what we ought to do, we should do implementing legislation. But \nthe bottom line is, are we willing to balance the Federal budget?\n  As the Senator has mentioned, the only way that can be done is \nthrough a constitutional amendment because we have all taken an oath of \noffice. That is why the opponents of this amendment do not want this \namendment enacted, to become law, because they know that we will take \nour responsibilities seriously and we will be obligated to balance that \nbudget.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Since the Senator brought up the President's budget \nand the inability of Congress to deal with this issue in the past, I \nshould say that the budget did come out today from the President, who \npromised to cut the deficit in half, and it actually spends $200 \nbillion more than we have in revenue this year.\n  After the Clinton administration is over, he will have added $800 \nbillion to the national debt. The debt today is about $4.7 trillion. \nThat is $18,500 for every man, woman and child in this country. So \nevery baby that is born can be welcomed into our country knowing that \nthat poor baby has an $18,500 debt hanging over his or her head the \nminute he or she comes into the world.\n  They talk about not putting it in the Constitution and yet as \nrecently as today, a budget is submitted that is again not in balance. \nI think it is time for us to say enough is enough.\n  They talk about the sky is falling if this is passed, but do they \nrealize what we are going to have to do to get to a balanced budget by \nthe year 2002? According to the Joint Economic Committee, we can \nbalance the budget without cutting Social Security or Medicare and \npermitting Medicaid to grow by 5 percent if we just limit the growth of \nall other programs to 2 percent a year--that's the growth, not current \nspending.\n  If we exempt only Social Security, we can balance the budget in 6 \nyears by cutting projected spending by 4 cents on the dollar.\n  We are talking about limiting the amount of growth. We are talking \nabout prioritizing within our budget to limit the growth. If you set \naside Social Security and Medicare, you can still grow 5 percent in \nMedicaid and 2 percent in all other programs and balance the budget.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Yes.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Again, I think the Senator is focusing on some key issues \nthat I think are important focal points for this debate. The Senator \nwas referring to the President's budget. Were you not surprised to see \nthe President did not sufficiently address spending reductions in his \nbudget, basically accepting the economic status quo? In fact, the \nvariances in his package on projected deficits between now and his \npackage of 1993 is more than an 11 percent change in the deficit, for \nthe worse.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. You say you were not surprised. Well, after seeing \nthe State of the Union Message where he challenged Republicans to come \nup with spending cuts and yet did not offer spending cuts for us to \nconsider, it is really not a big surprise.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Will the Senator further yield? I think the President has \nin the past, as the Senator referred to, challenged us to offer \nspecific cuts. As I said, I served on the House Budget Committee for \nthe last 2 years and the last two budgets that we presented had very \nspecific cuts of $435 billion in reduction in spending over 5 years. \nAnd then for the 1995 budget, we proposed an additional $150 billion. \nThe fact is, there was another budget that was offered on the floor, in \naddition to the Republican-offered budget, and that was a budget that \nwould have provided additional spending cuts over the \n[[Page S2186]] President's by $182 billion for a total of $682 billion \nworth of spending reductions in the Federal budget over 5 years.\n  But the fact is, no one is prepared to accept those spending \nreductions and recommendations unless we are forced to because there is \nno discipline, and I think the American people are savvy enough to \nrecognize that we are not going to take that self-enforced action \nunless we are required to.\n  That has been the past and clearly will be the future without a \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  The Senator was referring to the issue of restraining growth as \nproposed by the Joint Economic Committee in terms of what we could do \nto balance the budget just by restraining the growth in Federal \nspending. It is remarkable. If we were to restrain growth in spending \nby 2.4 percent exempting Social Security, we could save $28 billion in \nnew spending every year. That is $28 billion. Increased spending based \non growth is $420 billion over the next 7 years and we can increase \nspending by half that amount. I do not think there is anybody in \nAmerica who would not think that is a substantial amount or sufficient \nenough to address some of the issues and some of the programs and the \nneeds of this country and our changing priorities because over the next \n7 years I would expect that we would have some changing priorities and \nneeds and concerns as they arise.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I think the Senator from Maine is making an important \npoint. We are starting to talk about prioritizing--what can we cut in \norder to put more in the programs that we need, the ones that are \nreally essential. In the President's budget he says he is going to look \nat reinventing Government by paring down HUD and the Department of \nTransportation, and I applaud the President and I wish to give him \ncredit for taking that step.\n  However, I think what we have to do is to start looking at how we can \ndo things in a different way. Maybe it is not just cutting down \ndepartments. Maybe it is cutting down the infrastructure. Why do we \nnecessarily have to keep the entire infrastructure of the Department of \nTransportation and the infrastructure of the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development?\n  Perhaps we could take away some of the bureaucracy by having fewer \ndepartments, by streamlining Government, by terminiating some programs, \nsuch as the ICC, which the President has proposed again to eliminate \nand which I am going to support, and by handing power back to the \nStates. Handing power back to the states is very important in the \noverall effort to make the Federal Government smaller. When we do that, \nlet us not keep all of these massive bureaucracies in place. Let us \nconsolidate some departments--maybe the Department of Education.\n  I think the Senator from Maine would probably agree with me that if \nwe are going to get this country going in a different direction, the \none most important thing we can do is to pass a balanced budget \namendment and force ourselves to stop deficit spending. Let us start \nworking toward the balanced budget and then eventually we will be able \nto start working on paying down the $4.7 trillion debt.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Will the Senator yield? I think the Senator is absolutely \ncorrect in referring to performance-based budgeting which was part of \nthe testimony that was submitted to the Senate Budget Committee \nrecently.\n  The Senator is correct in suggesting that what we should do is look \nat every Federal agency, look at Federal programs, examine how we can \ndeliver them more efficiently. Perhaps they are best delivered by the \nStates and local governments. How can we be innovative and creative \nrather than just accepting the status quo.\n  We have hundreds and hundreds of programs that we have been \ndelivering for years and years in pretty much the same manner, and \nthere has been no incentive to address them differently or to rework \nthem in a way where it could save taxpayers money.\n  I think the taxpayers of this country understand full well that the \nFederal Government should be balancing its revenues with its \nexpenditures because ultimately that debt is being passed on to future \ngenerations.\n  So the Senator is correct in saying that we should examine--and I \ngather that is what the Senator is recommending--all of these Federal \nprograms and agencies so that we have a better understanding of what we \ncan afford, what is best left to the States to address and perhaps the \nFederal Government should not be implementing some of the services \nprograms that we currently do.\n  We have never looked at it from that standpoint in the past. It has \nnever been a performance-based driven budget, and we have no innovation \nand creativity delivered in a way that will save taxpayers money. The \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget will clearly be \nincentive considering there has been no incentive in the past other \nthan to divert and avoid the statutory requirements of balancing the \nbudget.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I think the Senator from Maine would agree that for \nus to be able to put our best creative efforts forward, to decide how \nwe can go forward into the 21st century by doing things a different \nway, doing things more efficiently, and giving the States back the \npower that they had when our Founding Fathers made the Constitution, we \nhave to say there is a limit. The Government, like everyone else in \nAmerica, will have to live within a budget.\n  We are not going to cut everything. The sky is not falling, as you \nhave heard on this floor day after day after day. We are going to make \nresponsible expenditures.\n  The Federal Government needs to do what it does well. It needs to \nhave a strong national defense. We need to have big science projects to \ncreate the new technologies that create the new jobs for the future and \nimprove the quality of life. We need to deliver our mail; that is one \nof the things that everybody assumed the Federal Government would do. \nWe are not doing it very well. We could do it a lot better. We need to \nhave foreign representation. We need to have foreign policy.\n  There are many things that the Federal Government should do and do \nwell, and we need to appropriate the money to do that. We need to \nappropriate the money for closing our borders to illegal immigrants. \nThere are many things that we will need to fund. But the difference is, \nfrom the debate we have heard between the two parties disagreeing on \nthis issue, with some exceptions, of course, are we going to live \nwithin the budget and are we going to make those tough decisions? It is \nnot a cart before the horse--you tell me what the decisions are going \nto be and then I will decide if I am going to do the responsible thing \nby saying you have to live within your budget.\n  There can be no question that we must live within our budget. And it \nis irrefutable that for 34 of the last 35 years we have not lived \nwithin a budget. We are going to have to take the necessary precaution \nof making parameters, and in this case the parameter is a balanced \nbudget amendment which says Congress, you are going to live with a \nbudget, and you can decide the priorities.\n  I think we should give Congress the freedom through the generations \nof the future to decide its priorities. But for heaven's sake, let us \nnot miss this opportunity to promise to the American people that we are \ngoing to stop putting an $18,000 debt on every child born in this \ncountry.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I will be happy to yield.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Would the Senator be surprised to know that half of the \ncitizens of this country, half under the age 35 have only witnessed \nCongress balancing the budget just once? I guess it would not be \nsurprising, given the fact we have seen on so many occasions Congress \nhas avoided that responsibility.\n  As the Senator knows, before the Senate is pending the Daschle \namendment, the right-to-know amendment. Do you think it is fair, I \nwould like to ask the Senator, that we would present a budget, \naccording to the Daschle amendment, a balanced budget plan to the \nAmerican people knowing full well that that might not be the plan in \nthe year 2002 because we have three intervening elections with two \nPresidential elections, different makeups of Congress, different \npriorities, different emergencies that might arise? If we only recall \nwhat has happened in the 7 years since 1988, we can only appreciate \n[[Page S2187]] what might happen over the next 7 years.\n  Under the Daschle amendment, we are being asked to set forth a \nbalanced budget plan, right to know, send it out to all the States \naccompanying the ratification of the constitutional amendment. People \nwill be making their decisions thinking that this will be the balanced \nbudget plan in the year 2002 when in fact, of course, it would not \nbecause in the meantime Congress will be making all kinds of changes to \nthat balanced budget plan.\n  So, Mr. President, I would ask the Senator, do you think it is fair \nto present that kind of plan to the American people knowing full well \nthat that will not be the plan ultimately in the year 2002?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I would only say to the Senator from Maine that I \nthink it would be more fair if the minority leader would put forth in \nhis right to know to the American people what they are going to do to \nbalance the budget if we do not pass the constitutional amendment to \nrequire it.\n  I think that is what the American people would like to know. What are \nyou going to do differently today than you did 34 out of the last 35 \nyears? That is a right I think the American people have, to know before \nsomeone votes to kill this opportunity to have a balanced budget \namendment for this country for the future, to know what they would do \nif it is defeated.\n  We must make sure that our future generations do not carry the debt \nof overspending and the excesses of the present day. We should not have \nthe right to bind future generations from any present point by not \nliving within our means. That is the bottom line.\n  It is not fair to say you are going to kill this amendment with a \nright-to-know provision if you are not going to say to the American \npeople what they have a right to know, and that is what are you going \nto do to balance this budget if you do not have the amendment? That \nwould be the responsible approach. Does my colleague not agree with me?\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I certainly do \nagree. I am sure that she will agree the fact is these amendments that \nare being offered--certainly the Daschle amendment is an attempt \nultimately to kill the constitutional amendment to balance the budget. \nWhich, as the Senator has mentioned, this will be our last occasion. \nThis is our window of opportunity, because we have seen a historic vote \ntake place in the House of Representatives last week. For the first \ntime, that body enacted a constitutional amendment.\n  The last time the Senate enacted a constitutional provision and the \nHouse did not was in 1982. As I said, since that time, we have seen a \n309-percent growth in the debt. That is $3.5 trillion since the last \ntime the U.S. Senate enacted a constitutional provision.\n  We certainly cannot put that onto future generations by failing to do \nwhat is important here today. I think all of these amendments that are \nbeing offered are being offered in the spirit of killing the \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget, because they know full \nwell we will in the final analysis balance that budget because we will \ntake that action now.\n  Does the Senator not agree we would obviously begin that process to \nachieve that goal of balancing the budget so we can be prepared for \nmeeting the final goal in the year 2002?\n  I know when I was in the House working on this issue, and we worked \non to 1992, and in 1994 we in fact had planned to begin to set the \nprocess forward, in the first year and the second year, of course, as \nwe are here, to begin the process of gliding us toward that path of a \nbalanced budget in the year 2002, in anticipation of and presuming the \nStates would ratify the constitutional amendment.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Maine has \ncome to the bottom line. The amendments that are being offered are \nbeing offered to kill the amendment. I hope the American people will \nsee this debate for what it is.\n  I have so much faith in the American people, in the good common sense \nof the people of this country. They can see the people who are being \nsincere about wanting to change the course of America, and those who \nare throwing up the roadblocks in the name of--whatever. Whatever \nexception they would like to have. It is a smokescreen. It is an effort \nto keep us from doing what really will get this country back on track.\n  We will have to make very tough choices. There is no question about \nthat. Everyone knows that. But as I go out in my State and in the other \nStates I am able to visit, I think people are ready. I think people \nmore than ever are ready to say, ``You know, I would really like to \nhave that expenditure, or some other program, but if it takes not \nhaving that particular program in order to balance our budget, we are \nwilling to say in the scheme of things this may not be as important as \nthe big things that only the Federal Government can do and do well.''\n  I am sensing that.\n  Does the Senator sense that in the State of Maine as she goes home \nand talks to the good, commonsense folks of Maine?\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I certainly do. \nHaving been involved, of course, in this last election, I certainly \nunderstood the concerns of the people of my State of Maine, which was \nthat we needed to be accountable for our actions and to be fiscally \nresponsible.\n  People are no longer prepared to accept the notion we were going to \ncontinue with the economic as well as the political status quo. They \nunderstand we have not been accountable fiscally in the past. They are \nconcerned not only about their own futures; they are concerned about \ntheir children's futures, as well. They know the impact of the deficit \nhas affected their standard of living, whether it is through loss of \njobs, the loss of productivity, the loss of savings that allowed this \ncountry to grow--it has prevented us from making the necessary \ninvestments in our infrastructure so we can invest in the future of \nthis country. We cannot grow if the pie is getting smaller because we \nare consuming greater and greater pieces of that pie to pay the \ninterest on our growing national debt.\n  The American people understand that. I know my constituents in the \nState of Maine understood that. For those people who are not involved--\nand I know the Senator was involved in an election last November--but \nfor those who were not involved, they clearly misunderstood the message \nif they think the American people do not want a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget. They do. They do not understand, as \nthe Senator has mentioned, that the Federal Government does not balance \nits budget. Because everybody else in America does. They cannot \nunderstand why the United States Congress is not required to meet the \nsame bottom line as every State save one in America, every family, and \nevery business.\n  So in the election last November, that was the message. I think, in \nthe final analysis, if we fail to pass this constitutional amendment, \nit really will send a message to the American people that somehow we do \nnot get it. I think that would be unfortunate.\n  As the Senator from Texas would agree, the American people deserve \nmore than that.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Maine has hit \nthe nail on the head. Those of us who were in the election, an election \nthat I think was to change the course of this country, do get the \nmessage. We got the message from the American people that they want a \nbalanced budget amendment. Probably of all the issues they were voting \non, this was among the very top.\n  I saw a poll in the Washington Post that showed 4 out of 5 Americans \nwant a balanced budget amendment. Of course, the people will have \nanother say in this. They do have the right through their legislatures \nto act on this balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. It does \nnot just automatically go into the Constitution if we do pass this \namendment by our two-thirds vote here. It will go to the States and \nthree-fourths of those State legislatures must ratify the amendment.\n  So the people are going to have their say. They will be able to have \nthe final word. I think it is very important for us, because of the \nmessage the people sent so loud and clear, that we are required to send \nit to the States to let \n[[Page S2188]] people have their say. I think the people will feel much \nbetter if they have the opportunity to act in this way on a very \nimportant part of the election of 1994; the election in which they said \nwe want a more accountable Government, we want a more accountable \nCongress, and we want responsibility to be shown by our leaders.\n  That is exactly what we are trying to do. As the Senator from Maine \npointed out, I think the people are going to send another very clear \nmessage in 1996, if they do not see that things are being done \ndifferently in the Halls of Congress. I think particularly because the \nHouse has acted on this already, it is very important the Senate, \nhearing the people's voices, give them a chance to let their \nlegislatures ratify this amendment, or not ratify it, as they see fit. \nThat is their voice.\n  But I think it is incumbent on us to let the people speak, through \ntheir legislatures, exactly what their feelings are on this issue.\n  We have the opportunity of a lifetime. For the first time in years, \nthis Congress has the opportunity to change the course of this country \nby letting people have their say. I think we must do it. We really must \ndo it. If we do not, if we did not get the message, I think that the \npeople in the U.S. Senate who are now representing the people of our \nNation will hear a lot more from the people. I got the message. I think \nthe Senator from Maine got the message. But I am not sure that \neverybody that I have heard debating for the last week has gotten the \nmessage. I certainly hope for everyone's sake that we do the right \nthing.\n  Last year, when we were debating this amendment, Senator Simon from \nIllinois, who was the sponsor of the balanced budget amendment and who \ndid a wonderful job, was talking about the importance of this balanced \nbudget amendment. He said the reason there were so many heroes in the \nAlamo is because there was no back door. Well, of course, no Texan \ncould let that pass because I had to defend the honor of the heroes at \nthe Alamo. I had to set history straight and say to the good Senator \nfrom Illinois there was a back door at the Alamo. The back door was \nwhen the line was drawn in the sand and every man at the Alamo was \ngiven a choice to cross the line and stay and fight or not to cross the \nline. Any man that did not cross would have been able to leave the \nAlamo before the siege began and go to the rear. Of course, everyone \nknows that every man crossed the line, including Jim Bowie, who had to \nbe carried across the line in a stretcher. In effect, the Senator from \nIllinois was correct. The back door was a line in the sand. The line in \nthe sand gave them the escape but the great heroes at the Alamo chose \nto close that door.\n  What the Senator was saying was we have a balanced budget amendment \nthat is closing the door. We are not going to have heroes because we \nare going to close the back door, and we are going to do what is right. \nIt is not heroic. It is just good common sense. Every person in America \nshould know that it does not take a hero to do what everybody else in \nAmerica is already doing, and that is living with a balanced budget; \nsetting the parameters of what they think is best, and, saying, OK, \nthis is what I have and I am going to prioritize with the resources \nthat I have.\n  That is what we are asking the Congress of the United States to do, \nnot just for today, but for our future generations. It is right that we \namend the Constitution because this is a very important policy. It is \npart of our structure of government that we say we will live with a \nbalanced budget.\n  Just about every State in this country has a balanced budget \namendment in its constitution. It is the framework of government, \nwhether you live with a debt or not. It is right to put it in the \nConstitution. What is not right is to legislate on the amendment by \nsaying we are going to balance the budget but we will have these \nexceptions. That is not a document that will live through the centuries \nas our Constitution has.\n  Our Founding Fathers created a living document because they put the \nframework in place. It is a giant step to amend this wonderful \ndocument. That is why it has not been done very often. But it has been \ndone when there was a need to continue to make it a living document, \nand that is why our Founding Fathers gave us a chance to amend it. They \nknew things would change in the course of our country's history. They \nknew that they would have to provide some way for us to be able to add \nto it so that it would continue to live, so that our people would not \nbe oppressed with the document that did not protect them from the \nchanges that they could not even envision.\n  I think a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution is very \nproper because it says this is going to be part of the framework of our \nGovernment, that we will live within our means and that we will not put \na debt on the heads of our children for the spending that we do today.\n  It is pretty simple, and I think the American people understand that. \nI think the American people are a lot smarter than the politicians give \nthem credit for. I think the American people are going to understand in \nthis vote exactly whether the Senate of the United States got the \nmessage from November 8, 1994. They are going to be able to determine \nfrom this vote whether they need to send another message in 1996, or \nwhether we are going to get this country back on track. Whether we are \ngoing to do responsible budgeting for our future and for the future of \nour children and grandchildren.\n  We must pass this amendment if we are going to take that first step \ntoward bringing our country back to what our Founding Fathers thought \nit should be; that is, a very strong Federal Government that is limited \nin its powers and very strong States that can make the decisions for \ntheir people because they are closer to the people.\n  So I hope the Senate of the United States does the right thing for \nthe people who have voted for us and who sent a clear message on \nNovember 8, 1994.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let me just take a few minutes. I want to \nreply to the distinguished minority leader who took time to come to the \nfloor and chat about some of the arguments that we have been making. I \nwant to point out that the distinguished Senator from North Dakota \nmistakes my arguments.\n  I pointed out that article V sets forth the exclusive conditions for \npromulgation of a constitutional amendment. The distinguished Senator \nfrom North Dakota brought up that there is a 7-year time limit and that \nis a condition on ratification. Promulgation and ratification, of \ncourse, are distinct acts and are two different acts. They should not \nbe confused. Under article V once Congress has passed an amendment by \nthe necessary two-thirds margin in both Houses, the amendment must be \npromulgated to States for ratification. There is nothing in the text of \narticle V nor in the constitutional history that suggests that Congress \ncan play slick games with the States by passing an amendment but \nkeeping it from going to the States.\n  The act of promulgation is a ministerial act that must be performed \nonce the two-thirds vote has been obtained. By contrast, there is ample \nreason why Congress should be permitted to include additional terms and \nconditions on ratification such as the 7-year time limit.\n  Article V makes it clear that it is up to Congress to specify the \n``Mode of Ratification.'' There is also substantial precedent in our \nconstitutional history for Congress to specify time limits on \nratification. In INS versus Chadha, a 1983 case--the case that struck \ndown the legislative veto--the Supreme Court expressed the principle \nthat when the Constitution sets out a methodology, Congress cannot \nexpand on it, contract it, or otherwise alter it. Article V provides \nthat a Constitutional amendment that is passed by both Houses shall be \nproposed to the States for ratification. The Daschle substitute is \nunconstitutional in that it would place an additional condition on, and \nthereby delay, Congress' promulgation of the balanced budget amendment. \nSo I wanted to point out that difference.\n  In the meantime, what I would like to do, Mr. President, is just \npoint out what is happening as we debate the balanced budget amendment. \nWe call this chart the balanced budget amendment debt tracker. In other \nwords, this is the \n[[Page S2189]] increase as we debate. On day one of the debate, the \nAmerican taxpayers were called on to pay $829,440,000 in additional \ndebt. That is day one of the debate. Now we are in day eight since the \ndebate started. I have to tell you that if we put day eight down and \naccumulate it up to today's date, we are talking about a $6,635,520,000 \nincrease in the national debt as we have debated the balanced budget \namendment. In just 8 days, we shot up from here to here. We have gone \nup from a little less than a billion dollars to almost $7 billion--\n$6,635,520,000--in just 8 days. We intend to put this balanced budget \namendment debt tracker on the floor every day. Day 9 will go up even a \nlittle bit more, and we will keep that going on as we go through each \nday of debate, because there are those who think that a prolonged \ndebate and a defeat of the balanced budget amendment in the end, of \ncourse, is a good thing for America. We think a prolonged debate and \ndefeat of the balanced budget amendment is a disaster for America, and \nthis shows us the difference in just 8 days of debate, what it means to \nthe American taxpayers.\n  According to the Concord Coalition, our national debt increases at \n$9,600 a second. That is $576,000 a minute, $34,560,000 per hour, and \n$829,440,000 a day.\n  So as this chart shows, the national debt on January 30, 1995, the \nday we began debating this amendment, was in excess of $4.8 trillion. \nThat is what this red line means. On the first day of that debate, we \nadded $829,440,000 to the national debt, all while we are standing here \ntalking about the balanced budget amendment.\n  By 2 o'clock today, 7 days later, the eighth day, the debt has \nincreased by $6,635,520,000. So as I have said, beginning today, I will \npost on this chart how much the debt has increased since the debate \nbegan. As you can see, the amount is tremendous.\n  Mr. President, we have been debating day in and day out, for the 19 \nyears that I have sat in this body, how we should balance the budget. \nWe ought to have the guts to do it and we should do it. Yet, every day \nwe are going up $1 billion in national debt while Washington spins \naround and does business as usual. Mr. President, that is what is \nhappening here--business as usual, the old order, the old way of doing \nthings. I loved James Q. Wilson's article in the Wall Street Journal. \nHe has never been a believer in the balanced budget amendment, but he \nhas come to the conclusion that it is the only thing that politically \nwill work. I think this type of a chart helps him to understand why it \nhas to be.\n  Mr. President, I am tired of the old order. I am tired of the old \narguments. I am tired of the excuses. I am tired of the American \ntaxpayers having to live with our profligacy. I am tired of your \nchildren and my children, your grandchildren and my grandchildren, \nhaving to pay for the profligacy of people who do not have the guts to \ndo what is right here. We have a population out there, in part, that is \ndemanding that we cut the deficit but the reason we do not do it is \nthat we are demanding tax cuts while they want more spending. If \nsomeone tries to bring fiscal order around here, many of these people \nwill scream that it may hurt my program.\n  That is why we need a balanced budget amendment. We have to do \nsomething in the best interest of the country as a whole, of our \nchildren and our grandchildren. This chart, I think, as well as \nanything I know, shows us where we are going. Each one of these days we \nwill put up how much, since the first day of debate, spending and the \ndeficit has gone up.\n  The best argument I know to make for the balanced budget amendment is \nto read this budget of the administration that they just handed out \ntoday. I know the administration tried to do its best, but even it has \nthrown its hands in the air and said we cannot do any better than \nalmost $200 billion deficits every year for the next 12 years.\n  I have to tell you, that is not the answer, Mr. President. The answer \nis the balanced budget amendment that says, look, the game is up, \nfiscal responsibility is finally here, or else you are going to have to \nvote to not be fiscally responsible and face the wrath of the \ntaxpayers. That is what this amendment will do. That is why our \ncolleagues should vote for it. I hope they all will.\n  I yield the floor to my colleague from Alabama.\n  Mr. HEFLIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, there is certain language in the \nresolution calling for a constitutional amendment to balance the budget \nthat I think needs some explanation and may throw some light on some \naspects of our Government that we need to be informed about.\n  Section 2 speaks of the debt of the United States. This is a section \nthat I believe should be very strongly included because I think it \ngives enforcement power. It reads as follows:\n\n       The limit on the debt of the United States held by the \n     public shall not be increased, unless three-fifths of the \n     whole number of each House shall provide by law for such an \n     increase by a rollcall vote.\n\n  Now, the particular language that I want to direct the attention of \nthe Senate to is ``the debt of the United States held by the public.'' \nIn the committee report, which I intend to offer in its entirity into \nthe Record, there are explanations on various aspects of the language \nfound in the resolution. Let me direct your attention to these words\n\n       * * * debt of the United States held by the public * * * a \n     phrase which is a widely used and understood measurement \n     tool. The General Accounting Office, in its ``Glossary of \n     Terms Used in the Federal Budget Process'' [(Exposure Draft, \n     January 1993)], defines ``Debt Held by the Public'' as ``That \n     part of the gross Federal debt held outside the Federal \n     Government. This includes all Federal debt held by \n     individuals, corporations, State or local governments, the \n     Federal Reserve System, and foreign governments and central \n     banks. Debt held by government trust funds, revolving funds, \n     and special funds is excluded from the debt held by the \n     public.''\n       The current, accepted meaning of ``debt * * * held by the \n     public'' is intended to be the controlling definition under \n     this article.\n\n  I think it is very important, relative to trust funds, that we \nunderstand that the debt held by Government trust funds, revolving \nfunds, and special funds is excluded from the language ``debt held by \nthe public.''\n  Now, under section 2, it takes a three-fifths vote to be able to \nraise the national debt held by the public. I interpret this to mean \nthat in the event that we did not raise the national debt, we did not \nvote by the three-fifths vote to do it, then trust funds, revolving \nfunds, and special funds that are in surplus could continue to be paid.\n  Normally, in the course of events, if the U.S. debt is not raised, \nyou have reached the maximum of the debt. Therefore, you cannot borrow. \nWhen you cannot borrow and do not have funds to operate on, the Federal \nGovernment comes to a halt.\n  But by this language, ``trust funds, revolving funds, and special \nfunds'' are excluded from this. Therefore, if there is surplus in those \ntrust funds, then payments can be made to the recipients of those trust \nfunds or those revolving funds. Now, that would apply to Social \nSecurity funds. That would apply to highway trust funds. That would \napply to aviation trust funds and others, according to the way I read \nthis, relative to the operation of the Federal Government in the event \nthat a debt limit is not raised in order for the government then to \ncontinue to borrow.\n  I want to also speak briefly on trust funds and to some of the other \naspects of this language. Under section 1, we have a situation where \nthe total outlays shall not exceed the total receipts for the fiscal \nyear unless you have a three-fifths vote. In the definition as to what \n``receipts'' means, under section 7, it is defined in the language and \nit is the explanation given in the committee report that:\n\n       Total receipts * * * is intended to include all moneys \n     received by the Treasury of the United States, either \n     directly or indirectly through Federal or quasi-Federal \n     agencies created under the authority of acts of Congress, \n     except those derived from borrowing. In its present usage, \n     ``receipts'' is intended to be synonymous with the definition \n     of ``budget receipts,'' which are not meant to include \n     offsetting collections or refunds.\n\n  The exception to total receipts is ``except those derived from \nborrowing.'' And this ``is intended to exclude from the receipts the \nproceeds of debt issuance. To borrow is to receive with the intention \nof returning the same or the equivalent. It is intended that those \nobligations, the title to which can be transferred by the present owner \nto \n[[Page S2190]] others, such as Treasury notes and bonds, be excluded \nfrom receipts.''\n  Now here is an important aspect of this explanation: ``Contributions \nto social insurance programs, though also carrying an implied \nobligation, are not transferable and should be included in receipts.''\n  Basically, I interpret this language to mean that trust funds, like \nSocial Security, which take in contributions, should, therefore, \nconsider those contributions as receipts within the meaning of the \nforegoing language. Therefore, they are not excepted from the \ndefinition of total receipts. Actually, I believe the way this is \nwritten, ``to include all moneys received by the Treasury of the United \nStates,'' will mean that Social Security funds and other trust funds \ncannot legislatively be declared to be off-budget. I believe that the \nway this language is written constitutionally requires that trust funds \nbe on-budget as opposed to being off-budget.\n  Now, trust funds are in instances loaned to the Government where \nthere is a surplus like in the Social Security trust fund or in the \nhighway trust fund or in the aviation trust fund, and so forth. They \nare placed in Government securities, as required by Federal law. Being \nplaced in Government securities, therefore, they are not transferable, \nbecause they are a unique type of obligation that is required for the \nGovernment to purchase.\n  Therefore, a surplus that is invested from the Social Security trust \nfund can be repaid under the language of this amendment and the \ndefinition of outlays has to be considered. In the definition of \noutlays, the amendment says, ``Total outlays shall include all outlays \nof the United States Government except for those for the repayment of \ndebt principal.''\n  So, in regard to the application of the balanced budget amendment and \nthe balancing of the budget to require a three-fifths vote, we see \nthat, first, trust funds surpluses are included in the total receipts \nbut for the pay-back of the trust funds. Therefore, there is the \nexception that excludes it from the three-fifths vote in that it is a \nrepayment of debt principal. And the repayment of debt principal allows \nthe borrowing that is done from trust funds to be repaid without having \nto go through the three-fifths votes or to be, in effect, on budget in \nthat manner.\n  Now, there is a problem, as I see it, where the Social Security trust \nfund or any other trust fund with a surplus, is taken and put into the \nspecial types of instruments by which the Government invests in \nGovernment securities. But there is a problem in that attributable \ninterest is not included in the ``total outlays'' exception.\n  As the attributable interest on the debt principal becomes due and \npayable, therefore, a question is raised as to whether or not it has to \nbe paid through the regular budget and could Congress, by law, refuse \nto pay the interest due on the principal debt? These are questions \nwhich must be answered in the days ahead as we debate the implications \nof whether or not there should be a Social Security exclusion within \nthe proposed constitutional amendment to balance the Federal budget.\n  A similar question is raised in regard to an issue pertaining to a \ncapital budget. As I interpret the language, the definition of total \nreceipts excepts from the total receipts those that are derived from \nborrowing. If we borrow, then we would have the right for that income \nnot to be included in regard to total receipts.\n  Then, on outlays where we have an exception for the repayment of debt \nprincipal, we have an exception which can apply to a capital budget. \nBut again, the attributable interest has to be handled through the two-\nthirds vote and through the three-fifths vote in a manner that it is \nbrought up.\n  I do not think the language of this excludes a capital budget, but on \nthe other hand there is the question pertaining to the interest that I \nthink is a matter that ought to be considered and about which we ought \nto be knowledgeable as we further debate this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee report \nfiled on this proposed resolution be considered, as fully printed, a \npart of the debate at this point in my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Now, Mr. President, we know all the statistics and have \nheard all the arguments for and against an amendment requiring a \nbalanced Federal budget on numerous occasions over the years. It \nappears, however, that this body will finally get its best chance yet \nto draw upon the potential of this Nation and finally adopt a balanced \nbudget amendment resolution and send it to the States for ratification.\n  The 104th Congress has seen a confluence of political and fiscal \ndevelopments that makes the amendment's chances of passage this year by \nboth Chambers of the Congress better than ever before. The House has \nalready acted, and has said emphatically that this is the discipline we \nneed. The intense concern to do something about the deficit has become \npart of the national psyche: It is on the mind of every person who \nthinks and cares about the future of America. This resolution enjoys \nbroad bipartisan support.\n  For most of our history, a balanced budget at the national level of \ngovernment as an unwritten part of our Constitution. A balanced or \nsurplus budget was the norm for the first 100 years of the Republic. In \nrecent decades, however, Americans have witnessed a continuing cycle of \ndeficits, taxes, and spending. We tend to look at each program in \nisolation, not realizing how each appropriation affects an already \nstrained treasury.\n  Alexander Hamilton, while serving as Secretary of the Treasury, once \nsaid: ``Public debt swells 'till its magnitude becomes enormous, and \nthe [burdens] of the people gradually increase 'till their weight \nbecomes intolerable. Of such a state of things great disorders in the \nwhole political economy, convulsions, and revolutions of government are \na natural offspring.'' Hamilton made this observation nearly 200 years \nago, but it is surely instructive to us as we debate the balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  Similarly, once our Constitution was finally adopted, Thomas \nJefferson warned, ``The public debt is the greatest of dangers to be \nfeared by a republican government'' Jefferson knew the long-term evils \nof deficit spending.\n  Over the course of history, we have lost sight of our Forefathers' \nwarnings. I am firmly convinced that the Federal Government does not \nhave the will power to reduce spending and balance its budget without a \nconstitutional amendment mandating that it do so.\n  Yes, this amendment's opponents argue that if we possessed and \npracticed a stronger discipline, such a drastic measure would not be \nneeded. I do not dispute that sentiment. I wholeheartedly wish that we \ndid not need this amendment. I do not take amending the U.S. \nConstitution lightly. But I do dispute the sentiment's reality. \nIncredibly, the last balanced budget came 25 years ago under President \nJohnson. The haphazard fiscal policies of the last 20 years or so show \nthat the problem goes much deeper than individual or collective \nresolve. We have to admit that simple collective will power will not \nsolve this dilemma, regardless of who is responsible for the state of \naffairs as it now stands. We all must accept responsibility. It is the \ninstitutional structure of government that encourages short-term \nresponses to individual need, rather than their implications for the \ngreater good and the future.\n  Others argue that such an amendment would alter forever the balance \nof power between the executive and legislative branches. But under this \namendment, each branch will retain its constitutional powers. The \nstalemate we have now with regard to national fiscal policy would be \nbroken without significant changes in the balance of power.\n  Other opponents say that this amendment will result in economic \npolicy and budgeting by court decree, significantly higher taxes, and \nsevere cuts in important programs. The provisions in this resolution \naddress each of these arguments and provide safeguards against them. \nThe bottom line is that the amendment will impose upon the executive \nand legislative branches the discipline needed to set priorities.\n  It is important to understand what will happen if we do not get our \nnational deficits and debt under control. Increased debts leave smaller \nsafety margins necessary to deal with possible \n[[Page S2191]] economic adversity. This poses a certain threat to our \neconomy, leaving it highly vulnerable to increases in interest rates or \nshortfalls in income.\n  Moreover, should interest rates rise during this period of high \npersonal and corporate debt, many individuals and businesses would be \nunable to meet the high interest payments to follow. Bankruptcy and \neconomic instability would become widespread.\n  If we look back just a few years, we can see that the refusal of the \nexecutive branch and Congress to take seriously the mounting deficit \nwas one reason the American economy faltered during the period before \nthe 1992 elections. As our national savings pool shrank, our rate or \ngross investment became too low, our interest rates too high, and job \ncreation too slow. The favorable economic conditions we have now are \nencouraging, and proof that the omnibus bill we passed in August 1993 \nwas the right thing to do. But this should in no way absolve us from \ntaking further, more definitive action by passing this resolution.\n  We should not fear the State's approval of an amendment to balance \nthe Federal budget, as over 30 have already signaled a willingness to \ndo. The State legislatures are where the heart of this debate should \nbe, since more than 40 out of 50 have already learned to operate under \nlaws mandating balanced budgets.\n  There is no doubt as to what our responsibilities as national leaders \nare in this regard. There is also no question as to what the American \npeople want and deserve. The only question is whether we are willing to \nrespond affirmatively by accepting the challenge. What this debate \nboils down to is the very future of this country. A constitutional \namendment to require a balanced budget is the only way to once and for \nall control spending and eliminate record high deficits. It is time to \ntake decisive action rather than to continue divisive rhetoric.\n  Indeed, we have already exhausted a wealth of different options to \nbring our finances under control, but they remain out of kilter. The \nright thing to do is to amend the Constitution so that Congress and the \nPresident are required to balance the budget.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BREAUX addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). The Senator from Louisiana.\n  MR. BREAUX. I thank the President for recognizing me.\n  Mr. President, we are engaged in debate on the question of whether we \nshould submit to the States a constitutional amendment to ask them to \napprove that which would require the Federal Government to balance the \nbudget. You would think that on such a historic debate people in the \ngalleries would be falling over themselves to listen to the words of \nall of the Members of the Senate because, indeed, this is a very \nimportant debate. But I do not see there is that great interest in what \nwe are doing on the floor of the Senate this afternoon, and that is \nunfortunate, because I think it is very, very important that Members of \nCongress, not only in Washington, but elected officials in our States, \nalso reflect on what we are doing because it, indeed, will affect them \ndirectly.\n  I take this time to call to the attention of my colleagues a very \nexcellent editorial which appeared this morning in the Baton Rouge \nMorning Advocate, one of the, I think, outstanding papers that covers \nthe State of Louisiana. I will ask that it be made part of the Record. \nIt addresses what I think is a key part of this debate.\n  We, in the Senate, cannot pass a balanced budget amendment by \nourselves. I want to say very clearly, I support a balanced budget; I \nsupport a balanced budget amendment. I think it should be part of the \nConstitution. But I think that we should recognize that there is a \npartnership arrangement here. We cannot do it by ourselves. A balanced \nbudget amendment can only be part of the Constitution if 38 States \nratify it. Then it is going to be incumbent upon them to look at the \nbalanced budget when they get it, say, my State of Louisiana, and say, \n``All right, what does this mean? How is it going to affect the people \nof Louisiana?'' not just how does it affect Congress or how does it \naffect Washington, because the real effect is going to be on the people \nin the various States.\n  The editorial is headlined ``People Deserve an Explanation.'' And it \nsays:\n\n       House majority leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, is right when he \n     says spelling out necessary spending cuts will make it tough, \n     maybe impossible, to enact a balanced budget amendment.\n       However, Armey and his party are wrong to refuse to level \n     with the people about what this would entail.\n\n  The editorial continues:\n\n       As Armey has suggested, knees are likely to buckle in \n     Congress if the pain this will cause is detailed. Many \n     citizens also will lose zeal for fiscal responsibility when \n     they discover that it is likely to affect them.\n       The Republicans' refusal to say how they propose to balance \n     the budget sends a clear message that they believe the \n     cowards among us, in Congress and elsewhere, outnumber those \n     who are willing to face unpleasant facts and do what is \n     necessary to correct this problem. Recent history supports \n     that premise, but this can change with responsible national \n     leadership in the White House and Congress.\n       In a representative democracy the people deserve to be \n     given information they need to make up their minds about \n     vital issues. Given that information, the people might well \n     make the wrong decision, but that is the privilege of a free \n     society.\n       Furthermore, the political strategy of refusing to divulge \n     details, as smart as it might seem to congressional leaders, \n     could backfire on them.\n       The public's appetite for detail is not always keen, but \n     the American people don't appreciate politicians who \n     deliberately keep them in the dark.\n\n  The editorial concludes by saying:\n\n       We want the budget balanced and the national debt reduced, \n     but we cannot support the notion that what the people don't \n     know won't hurt them.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire editorial be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         [From the Baton Rouge Morning Advocate, Feb. 6, 1995]\n\n                     People Deserve an Explanation\n\n       House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, is right when he \n     says spelling out necessary spending cuts will make it tough, \n     maybe impossible, to enact a balanced-budget amendment.\n       However, Armey and his party are wrong to refuse to level \n     with the people about what this would entail.\n       As Armey has suggested, knees are likely to buckle in \n     Congress if the pain this will cause is detailed.

As columnists Jack Germond and Jules Witcover recently \n     noted, Democrats realize details would bring out special \n     interests in opposition to the amendment. They correctly \n     observed that details of President Clinton's health-care \n     proposals were ``the ammunition for their rejection'' last \n     year.\n       On the other hand, we are convinced that Hillary Rodham \n     Clinton miscalculated mightily when she and a legion of \n     advisers undertook to draft those health-care proposals in \n     secrecy. That tactic might have delayed attacks by special \n     interests regarding the specifics, but it also aroused \n     considerable public suspicion about what was being fashioned \n     behind closed doors.\n       The Democrats' motivation might be petty indeed, but their \n     position is quite correct. As the saying goes, the devil is \n     in the details, and that is precisely why the public is \n     entitled to know them.\n       A balanced-budget amendment has been approved in the House \n     and likely will come to a vote in the U.S. Senate shortly. \n     U.S. Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., has announced his \n     opposition to the amendment. Sen. John Breaux, D-La., says he \n     is undecided.\n       Breaux, Johnston and 39 other senators support a ``right-\n     to-know'' provision for the amendment. We don't necessarily \n     favor putting that language in the amendment, but we do \n     support the concept behind it.\n       Breaux says Congress cannot spell out every projected \n     budget cut in every federal program over the seven years \n     Republicans \n     [[Page S2192]] want to gradually balance the budget. However, \n     he says Congress can pass a seven-year outline of general \n     intent and budget-writing methods.\n       Breaux is right.\n       We want the budget balanced and the national debt reduced, \n     but we cannot support the notion that what the people don't \n     know won't hurt them.\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, the point that the editorial attempts to \nmake, and I think does a good job of doing, and the point I have been \ntrying to make is that we are, in effect, by this amendment, without \nthe right to know accompanying it, sticking it to the States and doing \nit in the dark. We are saying to the States that you should trust us to \ndo the balanced budget efforts that are necessary in Congress in a way \nthat you are going to like or a way that you can handle it or in a way \nthat you can support, but do not make us tell you how we are going to \ndo it.\n  We are saying, we are going to give you the balanced budget and you \nshould ask your State legislators to vote for it, make it part of the \nConstitution. And then sometime later, the Congress is going to tell \nyou, after you have already voted for it, after the fact, we are going \nto tell you what it is going to mean to your State.\n  But I suggest at that point it is too late, they will have already \nvoted. They will have already voted to cut programs, they will have \nalready voted to have to raise taxes, if they are going to keep a level \nof program funding for their respective States. But then it is going to \nbe too late.\n  So I say, what is wrong with trying to require that, when we submit \nthe balanced budget amendment to the respective States, it is \naccompanied with a budget resolution that says to the States that if \nyou adopt this, here is what it is going to mean to your State? Like \nthe editorial said, they might not vote for it, they may make the wrong \ndecision, but at least they will have made the decision knowing what \nthe implications are.\n  I asked the National Governors Conference when I spoke to them last \nweek: ``Governors, how are you going to answer the question of your \nspeaker of the house or your president of the senate when he or she \ncomes to you and says, `Governor, if I ask our colleagues to vote for \nthis, what is it going to mean to the people of our State?'''\n  And the Governor is going to have to say: ``I don't know. Trust \nCongress.''\n  That is not a sufficient answer. It is like Ronald Reagan used to say \nwhen he talked about the Soviets, he said trust, yes; trust but verify. \nI suggest that if the only verification we can give the States is to \ntell them how we are going to reach that time in the year 2002, in \neffect achieve a balanced budget in 7 years, what is wrong with telling \nthem how we are going to do it?\n  Some of our colleagues say, ``We can't do that, we can't do a 7-year \nbalanced budget amendment; it is too difficult, it is too hard to do \nit.'' I suggest we did it 2 years ago when we passed a 5-year \nreconciliation. We cut the Federal deficit by over $500 billion. It was \nnot easy. Not a single Republican voted for it, but we did it for 5 \nyears. And if my Republican colleagues say, ``Well, we can't do it for \n7; that is just impossible,'' how about 5? Make me an offer. Let us do \nit for 5. I will go along with 5. But at least give the States some \ninformation so they can cast an intelligent vote when we ask them to \nvote for the balanced budget amendment.\n  Like the editorial said:\n\n       We cannot support the notion that what the people don't \n     know won't hurt them.\n\n  I suggest that as the States become more concerned about what this \nreally means, they will demand that the Congress give them an \nindication of what we are going to do, how we are going to do it, \nbefore we ask them to vote for it. I think that is fair. I think it is \nthe right thing to do.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to address the Senate, \nnot only as a Senator representing the State of West Virginia, but also \nin my capacity as ranking member of the Senate Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  To repeat a point I made before this body last Thursday, I still do \nnot understand why so many of my colleagues want to add another page or \neven more to the U.S. Constitution to force us to do the job we were \nsent here to get done.\n  From the day I entered the Senate, and saw the way the Federal \ndeficit was growing out of control, I braced myself for the decisions \nand the public, out-in-the-open votes that would be required to deal \nwith our budget crisis. Making actual cuts in programs and benefits is \nhardly ever easy--they almost always take something away from someone. \nbut that's what our job requires. And that is why just 50 of us voted \nless than 2 years ago to enact a record level of real, actual deficit \nreduction. We did not need to clutter the Constitution to enact a more \nresponsible and fair budget.\n  And to speak to today's question, I cannot emphasize enough how \nenormously troubled I am by the idea of using the Constitution to force \n$1 trillion or even $1.4 trillion in more cuts without West Virginians \nor the rest of the American people having any idea where those cuts \nwould be made.\n  At the moment, I want to speak not only for the people of my State, \nbut for the 202,200 West Virginians who are veterans--and for the \n26,364,900 veterans across the country.\n  Mr. President, the veterans of West Virginia and the United States of \nAmerica have the right to know. They have the right to know what this \nproposed amendment to the Constitution will do to the services and \nbenefits that come to them because they once served, or fought, or even \nphysically suffered to stand up for the very rights that our \nConstitution stands for. What a cruel irony it will be if Congress \nrevises the Constitution to break faith with the very men and women who \nhave served their country so faithfully.\n  It is not that veterans have excluded themselves from dealing with \nthe country's fiscal problems. Sitting on the Veterans Affairs \nCommittee, I have heard the leaders of veterans organizations \nrepeatedly tell us they are willing to do their fair share in solving \nthe Nation's problems, and that includes the Federal deficit. In fact, \nveterans made a major contribution to the package that we enacted in \n1993. That deficit reduction plan required $2.6 billion in savings in \nveterans' programs, spelled out on paper for anyone and everyone to \nevaluate, debate, support, or oppose.\n  The difference between the 1993 deficit-cutting plan and this \nconstitutional amendment is that the former told veterans, in my State \nand across this country, what Congress felt had to be done to cut waste \nand reduce Government spending--where the latter, this balanced budget \namendment, may as well say, ``Sign now, pay later.'' There is not a \nclue in this amendment to even hint at what will happen to veterans' \ncompensation, pensions, health care, widows' benefits, prosthetics, \neducation, and claims processing. Not one word.\n  That is why we want to attach a Right-to-Know ``rider'' on the \nbusiness before us. We are simply saying a better, more honest policy \nis for the proponents of the balanced budget amendment to first show \nupfront who will pay, and when and how, and then we can talk about \nsigning at the bottom line.\n  I have said before, and I continue to say, that we in this body owe \nthe American people a clear explanation of where the trillion dollars \nor more of cuts will come from, not vagueness about where they might \ncome from or whether taxes will be increased or decreased. We owe those \nwho have served and sacrificed for this country, the more than 26 \nmillion veterans from coast to coast, a clear explanation. They have at \nleast earned the right to hear the full truth.\n  The Federal Government's agencies and experts are struggling to \nforecast what impact this constitutional amendment might have on \nAmericans. Most sources from the Government or private organizations \nsay that the size of the cuts required will be unprecedented--immense \nin scope. Because the budget would have to be balanced in 7 years, one-\nthird of programs from anticrime efforts to Medicare may have to be \neliminated. That is a figure, a number: one-third.\n  In the real world, that figure translates into less police and fewer \nprison cells. It means seniors finding out their \n[[Page S2193]] doctor cannot see them anymore because Medicare has \nstopped paying. It means rural hospitals going under when payments \naren't keeping up with the cost of providing the world's greatest \nmedical care I always hear about on this floor when we try to enact \nhealth care reform.\n  And today, I want to talk about what all this might mean to our \nNation's veterans.\n  I have sometimes told veterans that when you are a veteran yourself, \nor when you work at the VA or volunteer for a veteran's service \norganization, you do not need to be reminded about the sacrifices of \nthose who served in our Armed Forces. It is part of your daily life--\nand it is very easy, Mr. President, to begin to think that everyone \nthinks about veterans, and the veterans community. But it is not always \nthe case.\n  Veterans have carried the torch of freedom proudly from one \ngeneration of Americans to the next, by their courage in war, in \ndefense of America--and by their dedication in peace to keeping America \nstrong.\n  So how exactly will this constitutional amendment affect veterans? I \ndo not see a single provision in this proposal to exempt veterans' \nbenefits and services, like monthly compensation for disabled, service-\nrelated veterans. I cannot find any large or even fine print that gives \none single clue on how veterans' programs will be cut, where they will \nbe cut, when they will be cut.\n  Make no mistake about it. Veterans' benefits will have to be on the \ncutting table under a balanced budget amendment that tries to get the \njob done in the next 7 years. The contract made to veterans will have \nto be rewritten to rush this quickly and this blindly toward the \nPromised Land.\n  Let us talk just a minute about veterans' benefits, Mr. President. We \nhear a lot about them. What exactly do we mean when we say ``veterans' \nbenefits''?\n  First, there is service-connected disability compensation. This \ncompensation is paid to veterans who were injured while in service to \nthis country. It is a benefit valued perhaps more than any other in VA. \nWhy? Because our Nation recognizes and respects, as we should, the \ncommitment we made to those who gave up their livelihood, left their \nhomes, agreed to risk their lives for their country, and suffered an \ninjury while doing it. Many never came home. Who here intends to break \nour contract with the disabled men and women who have served their \ncountry and risked so much?\n  When commenting recently on the Contract With America, the Secretary \nof VA, Jesse Brown, said, ``America already has a contract, if not a \nsacred thrust, with its 26 million veterans who have honorably and \nfaithfully served their country.''\n  Veterans with low incomes get help through a pension program. It \ndiffers from compensation in that it is a needs-based program. It is \navailable only to a totally disabled veteran who served during wartime \nand though not injured while in service, suddenly finds himself or \nherself in need of help just to survive. And with the amount of money \nthe Government pays them under this program now, it is all they can do \nto survive.\n  Jesse Overbaugh and his family in Richwood, WV, are a good example of \nhow a pension works. Jesse was ill this past year with serious \ncirculatory problems and unable to work. He and his wife, Lucena, still \nhad four children living at home. Jesse is a Vietnam combat veteran who \nwas awarded the Bronze Star. The VA was able to help the Overbaughs \nuntil they began receiving other help. The family received a monthly \ncheck for $1,296 from VA. Not much money for a family of six, but it \nwas all the help they could get at the time--and the least our \ngovernment could do for a man who risked his life in Vietnam.\n  Do the proponents of this constitutional amendment want to tell Jesse \nOverbaugh and his family to expect to lose a third of that pension? Or \nwhat does the Senator from West Virginia tell them about how this \namendment will affect them? They have a right to know, and I would like \nto know.\n  When we combine the amount of money VA spends on compensation, \npension, and education, it makes up almost 50 percent of the total VA \nbudget. Many people do not realize that.\n  Yes, the budget can be balanced in 7 quick years through a plan that \nincludes slashing veterans' benefits by 30 percent. That is, indeed, an \noption. But it is not this Senator's idea of a just or responsible \nplan.\n  The veterans and families of my State and this Nation have a right to \nknow what exactly is being contemplated to get the budget balanced this \nquickly. Is one idea to break promises--our contract--with the men and \nwomen who agreed to risk their lives for freedom at home and around the \nworld?\n  As I stand here today, let us think about reducing our debt--by a \nthird--to the veterans of the 11th Airborne who 50 years ago this past \nweekend parachuted into the mountains outside of Manila as part of the \noperation to liberate the Philippines. What do the proponents of this \namendment have to say to these veterans and their families, as we \ndebate a constitutional amendment to balance the budget that does not \ninclude a single detail on how the job will get done?\n  Last year, we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the GI bill, often \nreferred to as the most comprehensive legislation ever passed. Twenty \nmillion veterans benefited from its programs.\n  In keeping with that tradition, over 380,000 service members and \nveterans received benefits from the Montgomery GI bill just in 1994. \nThe veterans still counting on this help to attend\n college or more education have a right to know. It is time to tell \nthem, many of them Persian Gulf veterans, to give up on that hope? If \nthis program is cut by a third, there will be $258 million less in \nreturn for the contributions they made to their education. Shouldn't \nsomeone be telling them that Congress may be on the verge of breaking \nthis contract with them?\n\n  How about our contract with America's military widows? How do you \ntell the widow of a disabled veteran who died as a result of his \nservice-connected injuries, that her monthly income will be cut from \n$769 a month to $539? That is less than $7,000 a year. These are not \nrich people--these are the sons and daughters of America, people often \non the margin. We need to remember the price that is paid by those who \nare left behind during a time of war and world conflict, those left \nbehind to worry--to wonder--to wait. The wives, daughters, and mothers; \nthe fathers, sons, and brothers. War leaves its mark on all of them. \nThey, too, have the right to know what this proposed amendment to the \nConstitution will mean to them.\n  Recent surveys show that between 250,000 and 600,000 veterans are \nhomeless each night. Imagine--some 250,000 veterans on any given night \nliving on the streets or in shelters. These figures are absolutely \nstaggering. Outrageous.\n  I want to remind my colleagues that in 1994, 20,200 homeless veterans \nreceived assistance in VA regional offices, shelter sites, and on the \nstreets. How many homeless veterans are living in Maine--in Florida--in \nNew Mexico, or Oregon? My colleagues may not be hearing from homeless \nveterans. There are good explanations for that. Like not even having \nthe pen and paper or the money for a phone call to be in touch.\n  We will know soon enough, if this amendment is attached to the \nConstitution, just how serious the problem of homeless veterans is in \nevery State. The States and communities that don't want unfunded \nmandates will be handed an immense, unfunded shift in responsibility \nfor veterans living on the streets and grates.\n  There is not one hospital, one vet center, one outpatient clinic, one \nveterans' home or domiciliary, that will be safe. If we put the budget \non this speeding train, it may have to trample any one of these.\n  I cannot say which veterans hospitals will be hurt the most by the \ncuts. Because this constitutional amendment does not come with details \nlike that. I can only guess.\n  I can speculate that hospitals in rural States and communities will \nbe especially vulnerable. Then I think about small States like \nDelaware. Would the veterans of Delaware lose their only VA hospital? \nOr other rural States where VA medical centers provide health care to \nthousands of lower income people who have no place else to go? Medical \ncenters like those at \n[[Page S2194]] Hot Springs, SD, or Fort Harrison in Montana?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent at this time that tables from \nthe 1994 Annual Report of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs showing the \nnumber of patients receiving inpatient and outpatient medical care, \nbroken down by State and facilities, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                       TABLE 7.--PROGRAM SUMMARY, INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT MEDICAL

Mr. President, do my colleagues realize that the VA \njust last year added four new Women Veterans Comprehensive Health \nCenters, bringing to eight the number of such VA facilities in the \ncountry? Do we need to let those facilities know they better prepare to \nroll back care for these women who served side by side with their male \ncounterparts, or nursed dying soldiers and sailors?\n  VA medical centers admitted over 870 quadriplegic veterans last year. \nWith a balanced budget amendment, will we need to tell 261 of them to \nseek treatment elsewhere? I do not know the answer, because I can't \nfind the budget that goes along with writing new promises into the \nConstitution.\n  VA is predicting a loss of 63,000 full-time employees under the \nbalanced budget amendment. Understand that these employees are the \ndoctors, the nurses, the technicians who administer health care, as \nwell as the vital support staff that keep our facilities operating. It \nwould require closings.\n  The loss of this staff would mean that literally thousands of \nveterans who are now receiving health care would no longer be able to \nget treatment. VA figures suggest there would be 488,000 fewer \ninpatient visits and 11,403,000 fewer outpatient visits at our medical \ncenters.\n  Staff cuts will create severe problems in an already troubled \nadjudication system within VA. Timely decisions in benefits claims will \nbecome impossible. Over the past 2 years, in my capacity as chairman of \nthe Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I have heard from literally \nhundreds and hundreds of veterans from across the country complaining \nof the time it takes to receive the benefits they are entitled to as a \nresult of the injuries they sustained in the service. Some veterans \nwait years. Who is going to tell them it will get worse?\n  Veterans write us daily about the long delays in processing their \nclaims. I know because I get copies of those letters to my colleagues, \nbecause of my duties with the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  It currently takes VA 25 to 30 weeks to process an original claim. \nAre my colleagues aware of that, Mr. President? Disabled veterans--\ndisabled because of something that happened to them when they were \nserving their country--and they wait 30 weeks to get a claim processed? \nAnd as if that weren't bad enough, they often wait years if they file \nan appeal.\n  A recent study showed that 50 percent of veterans believe that VA \ntook too long. That adds up to approximately 60,000 unhappy veterans in \nthe State of Georgia, 24,000 unhappy veterans in the State of Oregon, \nand 110,000 unhappy veterans in the State of Florida. A 30 percent cut \nin veterans' benefits will not help them get their claims faster, and \nevery Senator will hear from those unhappy veterans.\n  Am I going to have to tell the 32,000 veterans and dependents who \nreceive benefits in my State of West Virginia, that the promises made \nto them will no longer be kept?\n  Mr. President, at this point I ask unanimous consent that the tables \nfrom the 1994 annual report of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs \nshowing estimated expenditures of VA benefits for veterans, broken down \nby State, be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        TABLE 57.--ESTIMATED SELECTED EXPENDITURES BY STATE\\1\\--FISCAL YEAR 1994

Education expenditures  \n  come from the COIN EDU 666. Information for insurance and indemnities for the 50 states and D.C. are statistical estimates. All other dollar estimates are derived from VA accounting reports.\n\nMr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I spoke earlier about a West Virginia \nveteran receiving pension benefits. I would like to take just a moment \nnow to give you an example of a disabled veteran receiving disability \ncompensation and medical care in our VA medical centers. I do not want \nany doubt about who is getting VA benefits and why.\n  Jim Honce lives in Bridgeport, WV, and I am enormously proud of him. \nJim is a World War II disabled veteran. He is a Navy man and served \naboard a minesweeper, the U.S.S. Skill. During the war, a minesweeper \nwould travel 3 or 4 hours ahead of a convoy, sweeping for mines in the \nwater, setting buoys for ships to follow, and cutting channels for them \nto land. It was a vital mission. Thousands upon thousands of American \nlives were saved because of the work done by those on our minesweepers. \nIt was incredibly important and dangerous work.\n  On September 23, 1943, off the coast of Italy, Jim's life was \nchanged. The U.S.S. Skill took a direct hit from an enemy torpedo and \nsank. Only 32 of the heroic 102-man crew survived. They were all \nwounded. Not one of the ship's officers survived.\n  Jim was thrown 70 feet to a lower deck, suffered flash and fuel oil \nburns over his entire upper body, his left arm and ribs were fractured, \nand he had a scalp wound. He remembers being dragged off the burning \nship by an electrician's mate, who was suffering from a broken arm \nhimself. They made it about 100 yards from the ship when it went down.\n  Jim was not able to be placed on a liferaft with 12 other survivors \nbecause of his injuries, so he held onto a rope in the water. The water \nwas shark infested, and Jim tells of a sister ship shooting at the \nsharks when it arrived to rescue the men. Just imagine it. It sounds \nlike an action movie--but it was real life--it happened.\n  Once he arrived back in the States, home for Jim for the next 2 years \nwas the naval hospital in Bethesda, MD. During his stay there he had \nnine operations and had to learn to walk all over again.\n  Jim has gone on with his life, went on to college, married, and \nraised a family. But he still suffers terribly from both his physical \nand emotional wounds--and the memories of those crew mates lost--and \nthe events he experienced in that war--will never go away.\n  Jim was awarded the Purple Heart--he earned his ``Contract With \nAmerica.'' Today, he is one of our 2.1 million veterans receiving a \nservice-connected compensation check for the injuries that still plague \nhim and that changed his life forever.\n  Mr. President, there is no way that I, in good conscience, can vote \nfor an amendment to balance the budget without being absolutely \npositive that Jim Honce, and the many, many disabled veterans like \nhim--and Jesse Overbaugh and his family, and the many, many other \nfamilies like his--will retain what little repayment the Government now \nprovides them. They have earned their contract with their country--and \nwe should not let them down.\n  There is a lot of talk about sacrifices on this floor, Mr. President. \nThe American people need to make sacrifices and shoulder the burden for \nthe sake of the future. Somehow, that wasn't the talk that led 50 \nSenators to vote against a historic plan of real deficit reduction \nbefore us 2 years ago.\n  But the talk is back, and now it is around the idea of using the \nConstitution to make a mad, blind dash to a balanced budget, and maybe \neven $400 billion of tax cuts to take along for the ride.\n  My purpose in taking the floor is to ask the proponents of this speed \nchase to the finishing line to let more than 26 million Americans \ncalled veterans--those who are disabled, those who are widows, those \nwho are poor, those who are sick, know something about what happens to \nthem along the way. Will they be sidestepped or stomped on? Will their \nbenefits and services be untouched or will they get sliced down the \nmiddle?\n  Mr. President, if anyone in America has earned the right to know, it \nis America's veterans and their families. With more than 200,000 \nveterans just in my State, and more than 26 million veterans across the \ncountry, I could not possibly consider this proposed use of the U.S. \nConstitution, before knowing what it will mean to the men and women who \nhave paid the highest honor to this sacred document through their \nmilitary service.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from New York [Mr. \nMoynihan] is recognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Before the Senator from West Virginia leaves the floor, \nI hope he will pause long enough for me to congratulate him on his \nremarks. The Senator from New York joined the U.S. Navy 50 years ago \nlast July 1 and, without having any expectation of it, came to benefit \nenormously from the GI bill, from veterans' insurance. I shall be \nremarking this afternoon that during the first year of the Kennedy \nadministration, in an effort to stimulate the economy back from the \nsharp recession of 1960 that came so quickly on the recession of 1958, \nthe VA issued a double dividend on that $10,000 life insurance we had \nall signed up for. It was not a lot, but it was enough to enable us to \nbuy our little farm in Delaware County, the last hills in Appalachia \nwhich connect us with West Virginia. We live there to this day.\n  I do not think that would be possible under the proposed amendment. I \nam confident that if it were tried it would be litigated, and that \nyears after the effort was made by Walter Heller and James Tobin and \nPresident Kennedy, and such, we might find out we had or did not have \nsuch a benefit, but it would not help those who needed it at the time. \nThe prospect of any litigation and leaving the decisions of the Federal \nGovernment, taking them out of the Senate Chamber across the park to \nthe Court, or down the avenue to the \n[[Page S2200]] Federal Reserve, is baffling and certainly troubling, \nand he has described it with great clarity and force. I thank him.\n  Mr. President, this week I propose to present three papers to the \nSenate arguing in opposition to House Joint Resolution 1, ``Proposing \nan amendment to the Constitution of the United States to require a \nbalanced budget.''\n  The first of these papers will show that the current deficit is a \nrecent event that marks a sharp departure from fiscal problems of \nearlier administrations that were directed primarily to the seemingly \nintractable problem of a persistent full employment surplus, with its \naccompanying downward pressure on consumer demand.\n  The second of these papers will relate the singular events of the \n1980's which led to huge deficits and a correspondingly huge debt. I \nwill show that there is no reason whatever to think we will repeat this \nbehavior, or misbehavior, especially now that the events are better \nunderstood.\n  The third paper will explore the folly and danger of writing into the \nConstitution decrees concerning fiscal policy which would have been \ninappropriate to a small 18th century republic and would be absurd and \npotentially destabilizing to a world power in the 21st century.\n  Representative democracy in the United States is fully capable of \nbalancing the Nation's accounts without an amendment to the \nConstitution. Deficits are not endemic to democracy. As recently as the \nNixon administration, the President's economic planners faced a problem \nof surplus in the national accounts, and thought it wise to create \ndeficits in order to move the economy toward full employment.\n  In those not notably distant years full employment with price \nstability was the central goal of fiscal policy; this had been \nindicated by the Employment Act of 1946 which established the Council \nof Economic Advisers, and became steadily more feasible as economic \nprojections became steadily more reliable. The Nixon administration \ninherited a difficult economic situation. Contrary to advice from the \nCouncil, President Lyndon B. Johnson had been unwilling to raise taxes \nto pay for the increased outlays occasioned by the Vietnam war. The \nresult was inflation. This was stamped out, but then unemployment rose. \nIt became necessary to stimulate the economy once again by deliberately \nincurring a deficit. George P. Shultz, then Director of the newly \nestablished Office of Management and Budget, explained the policy in \nthe budget of the U.S. Government, fiscal 1973:\n\n       Budget policy.--The full-employment budget concept is \n     central to the budget policy of this Administration. Except \n     in emergency conditions, expenditures should not exceed the \n     level at which the budget would be balanced under conditions \n     of full employment. The 1973 budget conforms to this \n     guideline. By doing so, it provides necessary stimulus for \n     expansion, but is not inflationary. [Italic in original]\n\n  George P. Shultz is one of the most admired public men of his \ngeneration. His service as Secretary of State in the Reagan \nadministration won the esteem and gratitude of much of the world, along \nwith that of the American people. It is useful to recall that he is by \nprofession an economist, having once been dean of the School of \nBusiness at the University of Chicago. He had joined the Nixon \nadministration as Secretary of Labor. He was speaking in terms then \nreadily understood by fellow economists, but not always clear to \nlaymen, such as myself. The key phrase in his policy statement is \nitalicized:\n\n       * * * expenditures should not exceed the level at which the \n     budget would be balanced under conditions of full employment.\n\nWhich is to say that in the absence of full employment, as was the case \nin fiscal year 1973, the Federal Government should deliberately \ncontrive to incur a deficit equal to the difference between the \nrevenues that would actually come in at levels of underemployment and \nthose that would come in at full employment.\n  Far from being inevitable and unavoidable, there were points in the \nbusiness cycle where a deficit had to be created. Otherwise surpluses \nwould choke off recovery.\n  The contrary thought, that budget deficits will be continuous and \nuncontrollable is surely the oldest of prejudices against democracy. \nWhich is to say the assertion that a majority will continuously vote \nitself benefits which the economy cannot sustain.\n  In an earlier age this supposed tendency was seen as a threat to \nproperty. Benefits would be obtained by confiscatory taxation--or plain\n confiscation. Hence, John Locke's prescription for a stable society: \nthe security of ``Life, liberty, and estate.'' In the Declaration of \nIndependence, Thomas Jefferson devised a more felicitous formula: \n``Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.'' Yet, there was never \nany doubt that the security of property was essential to such \nhappiness. In the Federalist No. 10, James Madison address this issue \nwith not the least apology. Ours would be a representative Government, \nconcerned to moderate, if not indeed to control appetites.\n\n       From this view of the subject, it may be concluded, that a \n     pure Democracy, by which I mean, a Society, consisting of a \n     small number of citizens who assemble and administer \n     Government in person, can admit of no cure for the mischiefs \n     of faction. A common passion or interest will, in almost \n     every case, be felt by a majority of the whole; a \n     communication and concert results from the form of Government \n     itself; and there is nothing to check the inducements to \n     sacrifice the weaker party, or an obnoxious individual. Hence \n     it is, that such Democracies have ever been spectacles of \n     turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible \n     with personal security, or the rights of property; and have \n     in general been as short in their lives, as they have been \n     violent in their deaths. Theoretic politicians, who have \n     patronized this species of Government, have erroneously \n     supposed, that by reducing mankind to a perfect equality of \n     their political rights, they would, at the same time, be \n     perfectly equalized and assimilated in their possessions, \n     their opinions, and their passions.\n\n  In modern times a more common fear has been that the excesses of \ndemocracy would debauch the currency through the monetization of debt, \nwhich is to say inflation. Indeed, there have been such episodes, \nalbeit relatively rare. Twentieth century democracies have experienced \nfairly steady price increases. Yet nothing ruinous. Far the greater \nfact has been the economic growth of the 20th century. Far from \ninhibiting such growth, democracy is now widely seen as an essential \nprecondition. If democracy caters to wants more than to needs, it has \nproven itself reasonably capable of satisfying both, not least because \nwe have developed a profession of economics which, if not in any sense \nperfected or even especially scientific, even so has a lot to show for \nitself. In the United States, for example, real per capita income has \nincreased fourfold over the course of the 20th century from about \n$4,300 to $20,500 per person.\n  The historian Alan Brinkley has recorded the development of the idea \nof Federal spending as a route to prosperity, dating back to the \n1890's, particularly for public works to counteract the business cycle. \nIn the 1920's, William Trufant and Waddill Catchings argued for public \nspending as an antidote to underconsumption, an idea that would come to \ndominate both theoretic, to use Madison's term, and applied economics. \nThe theoretical approach to underconsumption is much associated with \nthe publication in 1935 of John Maynard Keynes ``the General Theory of \nEmployment Interest and Money.'' That master of the calling, John \nKenneth Galbraith, records that by the autumn of 1936, ``the General \nTheory'' ``reached Harvard with tidal force.'' In a review of \nGalbraith's autobiography, I have commented there has been no other \nevent like it in the history of the social sciences. The Great \nDepression, then two-thirds over, had seemingly falsified the central \ntenet of classical economics, which is that markets clear through the \nprice mechanism--that whatever is offered for sale, including labor, is \npurchased. There were business cycles, to be sure, but, most important, \nthere was said to be an inherent tendency for the system to return to \nan equilibrium in which all resources were fully employed. But for 6 \nyears there has been no such return; none was in sight. In ``the \nGeneral Theory of Employment Interest and Money,'' Keynes demonstrated \nthat there could be unspent savings, and that when this happened prices \nwould not adjust downward to ensure that the same volume of goods would \nbe purchased with the reduced--after saving--purchasing power. \nGalbraith summarizes:\n\n\n[[Page S2201]]\n\n       Instead, output and employment fell until reduced profits, \n     increased losses and the need to spend from past savings \n     ensured that all income from current production or its \n     equivalent was thus established, one with a lot of people out \n     of work--the under-employment equilibrium.\n\nAfter an unprecedented period of depression, mounting crisis, and \nsomething like intellectual desperation, this had indeed the quality of \nrevelation.\n  However, by the time any considerable portion of the economics \nprofession had converted to Keynesianism, the Second World War had \ncommenced. And so to a considerable irony, Keynesian economics was to \nbe given its first trial not in the conditions of depression for which \nit had seemed designed but in the very opposite circumstances of a \nwartime economy, when the central problem was an excess of consumer \ndemand and a shortage of consumer goods production.\n  Yet, in the crucible of war, the new doctrine produced, well, \nastonishing results. In a series of newspaper articles, Keynes set \nforth how to maintain price stability, during wartime, and in the \nUnited States a new Office of Price Administration did just that. \nUntil, that is, the war ended and wartime controls collapsed. Here are \nthe inflation rates for that period.\n\n                                                                Percent\n1941................................................................9.7\n1942................................................................9.3\n1943................................................................3.2\n1944................................................................2.1\n1945................................................................2.3\n\n  With the war ended, Congress enacted the Employment Act of 1946. The \nauthors of the legislation, and perhaps especially committee staff, \nwere convinced that this new economics could now be used as originally \nintended, which is to say to ward off a recurrence of the Great \nDepression of the 1930's. It was widely assumed that the depression \nwould indeed resume at war's end. Hence, for example, the Interstate \nHighway Act of 1944, a public works program in the classic New Deal \nmode. The Employment Act established the annual economic report of the \nPresident which steadily became a more detailed and instrumental \ndocument. By 1947, for example, we established the current survey \nmethods measuring unemployment on an annual basis, a national statistic \npreviously gathered through a patch-work of survey and administrative \ndata. In 1960, with the election of John F. Kennedy, the new economics \nwas well-established. Kennedy assembled a brilliant Council of Economic \nAdvisers, Walter W. Heller, Kermit Gordon, and James Tobin. Although \nbut little noted at the time, the present Senator from New York became \nAssistant Secretary of Labor for Policy Planning and Research. What I \nnow report, I saw. I dare to think that what I saw is of great \nimportance in the matter now before the Senate.\n  The unemployment rate had remained remarkably low throughout the \npost-war period. Then, in 1958 recession struck. The unemployment rate \nrose to 6.8 percent, two-and-one-half times the 2.9 percent rate of \n1953. A recovery followed. But then stalled. By 1961, when the new \nPresident took office, it was back up to 6.7 percent. What had \nhappened? In their first annual report to the President, in January \n1962, the new Council of Economic Advisers offered a striking \nexplanation. The Federal budget was running a surplus. This was termed \n``the full employment surplus.'' Chart 6 in the report, entitled, \n``Effect of Level of Economic Activity on Federal Surplus or Deficit,'' \nshowed how this worked. Higher Government expenditures during the 1957-\n58 recession helped to reduce the unemployment rate from 6.8 percent in \n1958 to 5.5 percent in 1959. But the fiscal 1960 program, the next to \nlast of the Eisenhower administration, and which, according to the \nCouncil, was ``The most restrictive program of recent years * * *'' had \na large full employment surplus amounting to almost 2 percent of \npotential gross national product. This surplus came about as follows. \nAs the recovery from the 1958 recession got underway, economic activity \ngrew and so did the revenues of the Federal Government. But Congress \nwould not, or in any event, did not spend the additional revenue. As a \nresult, the recovery stalled. This untoward event was ascribed to \n``fiscal drag.'' Accordingly, the President's economic advisers devised \na fiscal 1962 program with a built-in deficit, which moved the economy \ncloser to full employment. To say again, the Federal Government had to \nfind ways to prevent a recovery from stalling because of an \naccumulation of a budget surplus.\n  The President's economists then proceeded to explain their actions \nand plans to reduce the full employment surplus.\n\n       The full employment surplus is a measure of the restrictive \n     or expansionary impact of a budget program on over-all \n     demand.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n                         the budget in 1958-60\n       The analysis of the budget program in terms of the full \n     employment surplus points to a probable major cause of the \n     incomplete and short-lived nature of the 1958-60 expansion. \n     The most restrictive fiscal program of recent years was the \n     program of 1960. Its full employment surplus exceeded any \n     from 1956 to date . . . The full employment surplus declined \n     sharply as a result of higher expenditures during the 1957-58 \n     recession until it reached an estimated $3 billion in the \n     second half of 1958. Thereafter, it rose gradually through \n     most of 1959 but then increased sharply to about $12\\1/2\\ \n     billion in 1960. Thus, whereas the Federal budget contributed \n     to stability during the contraction phase of the cycle and \n     during the first year of the expansion, it was altered \n     abruptly in the direction of restraint late in 1959 at a time \n     when high employment had not yet been achieved.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n\n                   federal fiscal activity in 1961-62\n\n       Immediately upon taking office, the new Administration \n     moved vigorously to use the fiscal powers of the Federal \n     Government to help bring about economic recovery. Federal \n     procurement was accelerated by presidential directive early \n     in February, and tax refunds were also expedited . . . \n     Changes in transfer programs added about $2 billion to the \n     combined total of transfer payments for fiscal years 1961 and \n     1962. The Veterans Administration advanced the payment of \n     $150 million of veterans' life insurance dividends into the \n     first quarter of calendar year 1961, and then made an extra \n     dividend payment of $218 million at midyear. The Congress \n     promptly adopted a number of measures requested by the \n     President. A Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation Act \n     was adopted, providing for extension of exhausted benefits \n     and giving the Administration time to develop a comprehensive \n     program for permanent improvement in unemployment \n     compensation.\n\n  In time, the Council came forward with a proposal for a tax cut, \nwhich was enacted in 1964, and Walter Heller hit upon the idea of \nrevenue sharing. If the Congress would not spend the surplus, then \nsurely the Governors would oblige. Those were heady times. I recall \nvisiting the White House mess in the company of that most eminent of \npublic men, Arthur J. Goldberg, then-Secretary of Labor, later an \nAssociate Justice of the Supreme Court and Permanent Representative to \nthe United Nations. Walter Heller was there and recounted in the most \nprecise terms just how much GNP had been lost by congressional delay in \nthe tax cut, just how much would be gained once it was enacted. His \nprojections were perhaps too confident, but his principles were sound, \nas well as the practice that went with them. That double dividend on \nG.I. bill life insurance brought our family savings to just the point \nwhere we were able to buy the farm near Pindars Corners in Delaware \nCounty which has been our home ever since.\n  In the economic report of the President transmitted to Congress in \nJanuary, 1969, the Council of Economic Advisers, now headed by Arthur \nM. Okun, could report.\n\n       The full employment surplus was a particularly enlightening \n     measure of fiscal policy in the early 1960's when the economy \n     was far below its potential. Actual Federal budgets were then \n     in deficit. But after taking account of the large shortfall \n     in tax revenues associated with the gap between potential and \n     actual output, there was a large full employment surplus. It \n     meant that the economy could realize its potential only if \n     private investment far exceeded private saving. By that \n     standard, discretionary fiscal policy was highly restrictive.\n       The vigorous and unbroken expansion of the last 8 years is \n     in dramatic contrast to the 30-month average duration of \n     previous expansions. No longer is the performance of the \n     American economy generally interpreted in terms of stages of \n     the business cycle. No longer do we consider periodic \n     recessions once every 3 or 4 years an inevitable fact of \n     life.\n\n  As remarked earlier, the Johnson administration left office with too \nmuch of a deficit, which had to be reversed. And was. But the 1960's \nhad produced an economics capable of understanding such matters to a \ndegree never previously achieved. An understanding which we are asked \nto reject altogether by an amendment to the Constitution \n[[Page S2202]] which economists of every political persuasion reject as \npotentially ruinous.\n  This consensus was stated February 3, in a statement issued by \nhundreds of such economists. They state:\n\n       When the private economy is in recession, a constitutional \n     requirement that would force cuts in public spending or tax \n     increases could worsen the economic downturn, causing greater \n     loss of jobs, production, and income.\n\n  That insight is the great legacy of the economics that emerged from \nthe great depression of the 1930's. It was hard-won knowledge. It is \nnot to be lost in the turbulence and contention that accompanied and \nnow follow a single congressional election.\n  Mr. President, seeing my distinguished friend from California on the \nfloor--she has been waiting patiently to address the Senate--I am happy \nto yield the floor and I look forward to her remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I say to my friend, the Senator from New \nYork, I thank him for his leadership, protecting the senior citizens of \nthis Nation. I think as we develop the arguments on this balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution, both pro and con, his leadership \nwill be a real bright spot in this U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank my friend from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I do hope all Americans are paying close \nattention to this debate on the balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution and that they are listening very carefully to the \narguments presented on both sides. This is a very important debate. We \ndo not very often even discuss amending the Constitution of the United \nStates of America. So it is important that we hear the arguments, we \ndebate both points of view and the various amendments that will come \nbefore us as those on each side of the aisle try to perfect this \namendment and some will try to defeat it.\n  Some will say the only way to balance our budget is to write the \nrequirement to balance it into the Constitution. Others will say the \nConstitution is not the appropriate place to put economic theory. I \nmyself am not philosophically opposed to the idea of amending the \nConstitution with a balanced budget amendment if it provides \nflexibility to the people's elected representatives to respond to \nnational security threats, disasters, emergency situations, and \nrecessionary conditions. It also must protect our commitment to \nAmerican workers past and present, by exempting the Social Security \ntrust fund from its procedures.\n  By flexibility I mean specifically that such an amendment should not \nenshrine a supermajority vote into the Constitution. The balanced \nbudget amendment pending before the Senate now, which has the strong \nsupport of the Republican leadership, a part of the Contract With \nAmerica, does not meet that criterion of flexibility. It does, in fact, \nrequire a supermajority and I think that is a tremendous mistake and it \ndoes violence to what I consider the rule of democracy. I think \nmajority rule is what our ancestors fought and died for.\n  Amending our Nation's most important document is not something that \nshould be done lightly. I know this is the time of the 30-second sound \nbite, the wisecrack, the easy solution. But some issues are more \ncomplicated than that, and this, amending the Constitution of the \nUnited States of America, is one of those issues. The Californians I \nrepresent--and I might say 31 million strong--and all Americans should \nask the following questions in this critical debate.\n  First, should we build into the Constitution the requirement of a \nsupermajority vote to take the budget out of balance? For example, if \nwe are in a deep recession one year, or a depression--and this country \nhas gone through recessions and depressions--should it take a \nsupermajority to enable us to respond? In the Republican contract it \nwill take a three-fifths vote in each House to enable us to act. In the \nSenate that is 60 votes. I think that is downright dangerous.\n  The second question we should ask is should we build into the \nConstitution the requirement of a supermajority to respond to a natural \ndisaster, an earthquake, for example, or a flood that ravages our \nhomes, our towns, our farms? I know the Presiding Officer sitting in \nthe chair tonight has gone through that as a brand new Senator. He has \nseen what floods can do. The Republican contract would require a three-\nfifths vote to respond to a natural disaster and I think that is very \ndangerous. I am going to talk a lot more about the whole issue of \ndisaster relief later in my remarks.\n  Third, should we build into the Constitution the requirement of a \nsupermajority to respond to a flood of illegal immigrants or a public \nhealth crisis or an internal terrorist attack--a terrorist attack that \nstrikes us unexpectedly?\n  If we have to move and we have to act, should we have to have a rule \nof a supermajority for us to respond to that? The Republican contract \nwould require a three-fifths vote for us to go out of balance to \nrespond to that. I think that is very dangerous.\n  (Mr. ABRAHAM assumed the chair.)\n  Mrs. BOXER. So, what the constitutional amendment before us will do \nis require a supermajority for us to do our jobs as U.S. Senators. And, \nas I said, I think that does violence to democracy itself, which is \nbased on majority rule. I do not believe in the tyranny of the \nminority. And I am in the minority now. I am not happy about it. I see \nmy friend, the Senator from Utah, has a big smile on his face because \nhe should be happy. The Republicans won control of the Senate. But I do \nnot like the idea of giving the minority the right to stop things in \ntheir tracks. I think it is wrong. I thought it was wrong when the \nRepublicans were in the minority. I tried to change the filibuster, for \nexample, even when it was not in my own best interests as now a member \nof the minority party.\n  There are those who say we will never balance this budget if we do \nnot put that amendment into the Constitution and if we do not have a \nsupermajority requirement. History shows us that this is not the case. \nI think it is very important to learn from history. History has shown \nus that it is an aberration to have these kinds of deficits. Our \nballooning deficits, as a share of the size of the overall economy, did \nnot become a problem until around 1980.\n  I want to quote Herbert Stein of the American Enterprise Institute. \nHe was the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under Richard \nNixon. I want to say that again. Herbert Stein worked in the Republican \nadministration of Richard Nixon. Let us hear what he said about this \namendment.\n  I see that we have a very strong leader on the floor right now, the \nSenator from West Virginia, who to many people is still their leader. \nHe is still their chairman. Certainly when it comes to defending the \nConstitution of the United States of America, I say unequivocally that \nI know of no one else who does it with the style and substance of the \nSenator from West Virginia. Last year, the Senator from West Virginia \nheld hearings on this balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, \nand they were extensive. I urge every Senator, Republican and Democrat, \nto read those hearings.\n  Herbert Stein came down to the hearing. This is what he said:\n\n       Our experience under the current regime without the \n     amendment has not been terrible. Between 1950 and 1980 the \n     annual deficit averaged about 1.2 percent of the GDP. After \n     1980 there was a break in history. Deficits became much \n     larger than they have been, averaging 4 percent of GDP.\n\n  I think it is very important for us to know that it was Democratic \nPresident Bill Clinton and a Democratic Congress that began reversing \nthe anomaly of the eighties. It is true there was a budget agreement \nunder George Bush, and it did start down the track. But I believe it \nwas that vote that we cast here in the Senate for the deficit reduction \nplan that brought us to a point where we can be very proud of that $500 \nbillion deficit reduction package which passed this Senate. I want to \npoint out that not one Republican voted for real, substantial, deficit \nreduction. They talked about the amendment then. They talked about how \nterrible it was to have deficits. But not one Republican joined us. We \ndid not just talk about the procedures as gimmicks for getting us to a \nbalanced budget. We actually took the steps needed to reduce our \ndeficit.\n   [[Page S2203]] With the President's leadership, we made some very \ntough choices. We cut spending. We cut taxes also for millions of \nworking families and, yes, we did raise some taxes on the top 1 percent \nof families in America, the top 1 percent of the economic strata. The \nvery wealthy did pay a tax increase. That is not an easy vote, my \nfriends. No one likes to go home and say, ``I hate to tell you, but I \nhad to vote to raise your taxes.'' But we did it. We did it because I \nbelieve it was the right thing to do to get this deficit on the \ndownward track.\n  How can I explain that someone making $400,000 a year was paying the \nsame tax rate as someone making $55,000 a year? I believe the Tax Code \nmust be fair, and every one of us has to do his or her share to reduce \nthat deficit. What is interesting is after that deficit reduction plan, \nfor every American who pays higher taxes, 10 pay lower taxes. So it was \na fair bill, a fair package. And it brought fairness to the Tax Code, \nand it started us on this decline of this deficit without a \nconstitutional amendment. We started to get the deficit on the decline.\n  So here it is in plain view, in this Senator's perspective, the \ndifference between making the tough votes on budget and making this \nvery simple vote on amending the Constitution. Let me say how I feel \nabout that. I respect every one of my colleagues, Democrats and \nRepublicans, who will vote for this, no matter what the shape of it is. \nI do not particularly think it is a courageous vote. I think it takes \nthis country into a position where the minority Members of Congress can \nhold our country hostage to depression, recession, disasters, and \nunknown emergencies.\n  I have heard many of my colleagues say, because I am very concerned \nabout this, ``Oh, in times of recession and depression, in times of \ndisaster, we will all come together and it will be easy to get 60 votes \nin the U.S. Senate. It will not be a problem, Senator Boxer. It will be \neasy. We will pull together as Americans. We will have supermajorities \nto go out of balance and to increase the debt ceiling''-- which by the \nway also takes 60 votes. I have read the Record. That is just not so. \nSupermajorities are hard to get, and I will show that in this debate.\n  I think we are going to find that our hands are tied, ensuring our \ninability to act when we should act. Why else do we come to the Senate? \nWhy else do we want to be here if not to help the people, particularly \nin times of crisis, whether it is an earthquake, whether it is a \nveteran who is, yes, a paraplegic? We heard Senator Rockefeller, who \nlives his life here in the Senate in behalf of veterans. We heard what \nhe said about what would happen to veterans if this passes.\n  Why are we here? Why are we here? I ask my friends. To tie our hands, \nto make it impossible for us to act? I hope not. I hope the American \npeople ask those who support this amendment if they voted for real \ndeficit reduction last year. If they did not, then I say they are \nhiding behind this constitutional amendment. It is a figleaf. They want \nto be able to say they are for a balanced budget. Well, whoopee. That \nis easy. Saying you are for a balanced budget is easy. What is tough is \nmaking the tough votes to make it happen. But when they had the \nopportunity to vote for deficit reduction by casting a very difficult \nvote--and it was difficult--they took a powder on that vote. If they \nhad prevailed, we would not have had the success we have had thus far \nin getting that deficit under control.\n  I think it is very important to continue to talk to the American \npeople about--since the Republicans did not vote for the deficit \nreduction that the President put forward and the Democrats supported--\nwhat kind of deficit reduction do they support?\n  I know what I supported because I supported the President's package. \nSo I can show you what I supported. It was difficult. But I can show \nyou. And I will take the heat for it, and I took the heat for it.\n  But I say they have not shown us their hand. They support an \namendment to the Constitution that supposedly outlaws deficits unless a \nsupermajority decides to go out of balance. And I say they have a moral \nobligation to tell us what their version of deficit reduction looks \nlike.\n  Now, I heard Senator Byrd discussing this the other day, and he said \nsomething very sensible. He said if an average American goes to buy a \nused car, would they not look under the hood and see what is under the \nhood?\n  Well, I say to my Republican friends, if you want to put forward this \nbalanced budget amendment, show us your budget. Open up the hood. We \nneed to see what you mean and what you want to do. It is the right of \nthe American people to know and to know before, not after, we vote for \nthis amendment.\n  Now, in the deficit reduction bill that I voted for, which passed in \n1993, we protected education and children and new technology \ninvestments and health research and Social Security and the fight \nagainst crime. We did cut other things. As I said, over 200 Government \nprograms were terminated or reduced.\n  I say, what are the Republican priorities? Where is their budget? We \nknow that the Republican Contract With America promises $700 billion of \ntax cuts over the next 10 years and, by the way, not targeted to the \nmiddle class but to those also in the high tax brackets. They have \nproposed the same child tax credit for families making $200,000 a year \nas for families making $30,000 a year.\n  Now, think that is not going to drain the Treasury. I can assure you \nthat it will. How will they pay for these tax cuts? How will they pay \nfor these tax cuts? They already said they do not want to cut defense. \nIndeed, they want to spend more on defense. They already said they do \nnot want to touch Social Security even though, by the way, many of them \ndo not support the amendment to exclude Social Security from the \nbalanced budget amendment. They say they do not want to touch Social \nSecurity. I am going to vote to remove Social Security from the \nbalanced budget requirement. Social Security should be separate and \napart from the budget, untouchable because it is a trust fund and it \nmust be there for current and future retirees.\n  The Republicans want to leave it right there. In the House, they \ndefeated the amendment to delete Social Security from the requirements \nof this amendment. But I want to take them at their word tonight. I am \ngoing to take them at their word tonight. Even though they did not want \nto remove Social Security from the requirements of the balanced budget \namendment, let us take them at their word that they will not touch \nSocial Security.\n  Now, if Social Security is off the table, what would we have to cut? \nWe already know they do not want any new taxes. They have already said \nthat. They want tax cuts. They do not want to touch the military. They \nwant to spend more. So what would their balanced budget look like? They \nwill not tell us. It is as simple as that.\n  I say to the American people, you have a right to know. I am trying \nto get you the facts. As soon as I learned about the balanced budget \namendment, on January 12, I sent the following letter to my colleagues, \nwho have brought this amendment before us. I sent it to the \ndistinguished majority leader, to the chairman of the Budget Committee, \nand to every Republican Senator who is part of the leadership of this \nSenate and endorses this balanced budget amendment. This is what I \nwrote. I am going to read you what I wrote the Republican leaders of \nthis Senate.\n\n       Dear Senator: I understand that it is the intention of the \n     Republican majority to bring the constitutional amendment to \n     require a balanced budget to the Senate floor as soon as \n     possible because of the Republican Contract With America. \n     Because you are a supporter of this constitutional amendment, \n     I ask that you send to me your plan to reach this balanced \n     budget target by the year 2002. As I am sure you are aware, \n     the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that to get to \n     a balanced budget by the year 2002 would require deficit \n     reduction in the amount of $1.2 trillion. I would be \n     interested to know what programs you recommend be cut or \n     revenue raised in order to reach a balanced budget.\n       Specifically,\n\n  I wrote to my colleagues:\n\n       I am interested in knowing the cuts you would make in \n     programs for crime prevention, education, health and science \n     research, border enforcement, environmental protection, \n     veterans, or transportation. I would also be interested to \n     know what cuts you intend to make to defense, Social \n     Security, and Medicare. Because--\n\n  [[Page S2204]] I wrote--\n\n     there is no exception for assistance to people who have been \n     struck by a natural disaster, I would also appreciate your \n     candid assessment of how this constitutional amendment could \n     impact funding for disasters such as an earthquake, flooding \n     or fires. Ominously, a supermajority would be necessary or \n     other programs would have to be cut to provide assistance to \n     these disaster victims.\n       I thank you for you attention to these questions.\n\n  I sent 16 letters. So far I have not received a single response. I \nhope that they will in fact write to me and give me the details of \ntheir budget because the American people deserve these details. I am \nwaiting, and I think they are waiting. Now, I must say I am not shocked \nthat I have not received a response.\n  House Majority Leader Armey said that if Members of Congress saw the \ndetails, ``it would make their knees buckle.'' Listen to that one.\n  The House has very fast procedures over there. I was there for 10 \nyears. It is an incredible atmosphere, a very exciting atmosphere. As \nsome watchers of the Congress have been known to say, the House is like \nthe cup where things get really hot and the Senate is like the saucer \nwhere they cool down. We are cooling things down here because, as Dick \nArmey, the majority leader of the House said, if Members of Congress \nsaw the details, ``it would make their knees buckle.''\n  House rules allowed the balanced budget amendment to be rushed \nthrough the House. I am not critical of that. That is the way it is \nover there. But we have the ability over here to fully debate measures, \nand we will not be rushed. We will be able to point out very clearly \nwhat will happen when we have a requirement for a balanced budget in \nthe Constitution that requires a supermajority to respond to the needs \nof the American people.\n  Now, I said when I was elected to the U.S. Senate that I would fight \nfor the people of California and for what I believe in, and after the \nRepublicans took over the Senate, the press started asking, ``Aren't \nyou going to change? Aren't you going to be different?''\n  I said that I was elected to fight for the people of California and \nwhat I believe in. And that is what I intend to do for as long as they \nwant me to do it. The day they do not want me to do it, they will pick \nsomeone else. That is the Contract With California that I have.\n  I said at the opening of this Congress that I would work hand in hand \nwith the Republicans if I felt that what they were doing was good for \nmy State and my country, but I also would stand up and fight against \nthem when I felt what they were doing would hurt my State and my \ncountry.\n  I want you to know I supported the Congressional Accountability Act \nwith my Republican friends. Yes, I felt it could have been made \nstronger, so I also supported amendments for campaign finance reform \nand the gift ban that they voted down. I finally voted for that bill \nbecause on balance it was a good bill which, by the way, Democrats and \nRepublicans had pushed in the last Congress.\n  Let me tell you, this rigid amendment that gives so much power to the \nminority is bad for my State. You need to have three-fifths of the \nCongress to vote to go out of balance or raise the debt limit--60 votes \nof the Senate right here--and that gives power to the minority to \nthwart the will of the majority, and that is not right. That is not \nright. The majority should rule--not the minority. And if I am stuck in \nthe minority, that is my problem. I have to learn to live with it. I \nshould not be able to stop this Senate from responding to the needs of, \nsay, a disaster, a crisis, a health emergency.\n  I know a health scientist who told me that the worst virus you can \nimagine, Mr. President, is one plane ride away from this country. It is \nunbelievable. There is a book called ``The Hot Zone'' which talks about \nthis. The worst virus, the worst bacteria that you can dream of, is one \nplane ride away from America, and we are going to have a situation \nwherein a minority could stop us from reacting to that kind of \nemergency.\n I say that is bad for the people of California and bad for the people \nof this country.\n\n  I have already shown you by reciting history that you do not need an \namendment to balance the budget. We did it around here for many, many \nyears. It was not until the 1980's that things got out of control. \nTrickle-down economics did not do what it was advertised to do, and \nthis budget went out of control. We have to make progress and we are \nmaking progress. I would like to get that deficit down to zero, and I \nbelieve we can. But in some years--some years--because of major \nproblems, because of the state of the economy, which may reduce \nrevenues to this Government--what causes the deficit? Expenditures and \nrevenues have to match and some years in this country, because we are a \nfree market, proud economy, some years we go into recession. We used to \ngo into worse recessions. But we have gone into some pretty bad ones. \nOf course, before I was born was the depression that so impacted the \nlives of my parents, because they lived through that and they never \nstopped telling me the horror stories of that time.\n  Sometimes those revenues go down. Do we want to say, no matter what, \nwe will have a balanced budget, and even if we have a virus that comes \nin from another country, a bacteria, an earthquake, a fire, a \nrecession, a depression, we need to get a supermajority? My friends \nsay: It is easy, you will get it at a time like that. If they feel that \nway, why do we not have some exemptions here for recessions, for \ndisasters, so that we know we can respond in a timeframe that makes \nsense.\n  Let me tell you what would happen to my State if this amendment \npasses in the timeframe laid out and if the Republicans stick to their \npromise--namely, that they will not touch Social Security, and they \nwill enact a megabillion dollar tax cut, and they will increase \nmilitary spending. That is what they said. And they will not show us \ntheir budget. I am trying to figure it out.\n  What is left on the table? Let me tell you who I went to to get the \nanswer. I did not go to my own party or call the White House. In \nFebruary 1994, the Wharton Econometrics Forecasting Group, one of our \nNation's leading economic forecasting firms, said the balanced budget \namendment could cost the State of California more than 700,000 private \nsector jobs as a result of a significant decline in economic activity \nin the State. The drop in personal income would be roughly $148 \nbillion.\n  The Treasury Department reports that the balanced budget amendment \nwould reduce annual Federal grants to the California State government \nby $7.7 billion. So, first of all, we have a 700,000 loss of private \nsector jobs as a result of that decline in economic activity, and we \nhave the drop in personal income of $148 billion in my State and loss \nof Federal grants of $7.7 billion. How can I not take to the Senate \nfloor and protest this amendment? It is going to kill my State. It is \ngoing to hurt the people of my State--the children, the families, the \nelderly, the veterans, people caught in disasters. It is going to hurt \nour ability to stop illegal immigration at the border.\n  I cannot sit back and allow this to happen to the people of my State \nwithout fighting. I cannot sit back and not fight for an exception in \nthis balanced budget amendment for disasters. I have to fight for an \nexception for disasters. The Kobe earthquake in Japan demonstrates in \nways words cannot express the violence that can be released from an \nearthquake at 7.2 on the Richter scale. The 6.7 rated Northridge \nearthquake caused at least $20 billion in damages for both the public \nand private sector. But a 7.0 earthquake could cause more than $57 \nbillion in damages to Los Angeles, according to a University of \nSouthern California study.\n  Let me say to my friends from the Midwest and from other parts of \nthis country, we had a report from James Lee Witt that just hit the \npress yesterday that says they expect an earthquake of that size--Kobe-\nsize--to hit this country, and more than likely it will be in the \nMidwest. So talking about earthquakes simply is not a matter for \nCalifornia. Talking about floods simply is not a matter for California.\n  The tragedy in Japan revealed another underlying problem, and that is \nthe problem the Japanese Government had in responding to the crisis. \nThe Government's slow response is undergoing intense scrutiny by \nJapanese citizens, and rightly so. I bring it up here today because I \nwant us to understand, because we are on the firing line, when \nsomething like that happens, we do not want our Government \n[[Page S2205]] to be indecisive and unresponsive in times of crisis.\n  Let me say this: We have responded beautifully to the recent \ndisasters in California and the Midwest floods and the problems in \nGeorgia and the problems in Texas, under this really newly designed \nFEMA that we have under the Clinton administration. I do not want us to \ngo back to the days when FEMA did nothing.\n  Let me tell you what a Japanese bureaucrat said to hundreds of \nhomeless people gathered at a local city hall. Put on your thinking \ncaps, because it is going to be us for sure if we do not make an \nexception for disasters. This is what this bureaucrat said to these \nhomeless people, hardworking citizens of Japan, suffering from an \nearthquake, homeless:\n\n       I can't do anything about your house at this point. I \n     suggest you go to another city.\n\n  Imagine Americans taking that. Are we going to tell the people of our \ncities, suburbs, our rural areas, to move and leave their memories, \ntheir dreams, their hopes, because we put in the Constitution a \nmechanism that tied our hands and said we cannot act? I hope not. I \nhope the American people will not let that happen. They all love the \nsound of a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. ``They better \nlook under the hood,'' as Senator Byrd said.\n  Our States are not colonies of the Federal Government. When disaster \nstrikes, ``we are,'' as the words say above this beautiful Capitol \ndome, ``from the many one.'' No confederation of States can respond to \na natural disaster as the U.S. Federal Government can respond to a \ndisaster.\n  When I offer my amendment to exempt disasters from this, I am going \nto go into chapter and verse about how we have responded and the time \nthat it took and the billions of dollars of relief we were able to send \nto the various parts of this country.\n  I hope all of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle will join \nwith me. I do not see how we can possibly not learn from the disasters \nin this country and from the Kobe experience that the United States of \nAmerica is the preeminent of, by, and for the people, because we can \nrespond in a crisis. Let us not tie our hands and let 40 people in this \nbody stop us--or 41 to be exact. It takes 60 votes to go out of \nbalance, to respond to a disaster.\n  I am saying to you, let us not put ourselves in a situation while the \ndebate rages day after day after day, and we have 51 votes to help and \nwe have 52 votes to help, but we are a long way from 60 votes and we \ncannot help. I would not want to be the Senator whose constituents are \ngoing through the hellish nightmare of a disaster without a Federal \nGovernment to help. Getting 60 votes will be difficult. History has \nproved that. Let me tell you, my friends, I am not just theorizing \nhere. We had a horrible earthquake in San Francisco where the Cypress \nFreeway was badly damaged.\n Hundreds of thousands of people commute on that every week.\n\n  Now I will tell you, I barely survived a vote to rebuild the Cyprus \nFreeway, 52 to 43, because none other than the distinguished majority \nleader, who was minority leader then, tried to say, ``Let's get \noffsetting cuts.''\n  There are some times when there is a crisis and you do not expect it, \nwhether it is in your family or in the family of government, and we \nmust act to help people.\n  So I hope that my friends on the Republican side and on the \nDemocratic side will join me when I offer the amendment, which, by the \nway, is cosponsored by Senator Leahy of Vermont. It has the support of \nSenator Feinstein and Senator Inouye, and the list is growing. Because \nwe should not have our hands tied in a disaster.\n  Now let me cite another example of where we should not have our hands \ntied. We should not require a supermajority to act in case of a \nrecession. I do not think we want to return to the days of Herbert \nHoover. During the Great Depression of the 1930's, Republican President \nHoover refused to see the economic danger signs and he would not act to \nbolster the plummeting American economy.\n  When the Depression struck and unemployment in this country rose from \nunder 5 percent to over 20 percent in roughly 2 years, Hoover still \nrefused to act. He refused to provide assistance for the one-fifth of \nthe American population that was out of work.\n  Let me tell you what he said. And I want the American people to \nplease listen to the words of Herbert Hoover. He said. ``The principles \nof individual and local responsibility'' would be applied to the \nvictims of the economic suffering.\n  Let me repeat that. In the days of the Depression, when people of \nskill were selling apples on the street and heads of families were \njumping out of windows because they could not provide for their \nfamilies, President Hoover said, ``The principles of individual and \nlocal responsibility'' would be applied to the victims of economic \nsuffering.\n  And I quote him further:\n\n       Each community and each State should assume its relief of \n     the distress with that sturdiness and independence which \n     built a great nation.\n\n  Sound familiar? Let me read it again.\n\n       Each community and each State should assume its relief of \n     the distress with that sturdiness and independence which \n     built a great nation.\n\n  My friends, that statement is true, but in times of deep emergency in \nthis country--from the many, one. That is the purpose of the United \nStates of America. From the many, one. We come together and we have \ngreat strength when we come together.\n  Now I hear a lot of talk about the new federalism. And I hear words \nthat sound just like this. There is nothing new about it. We tried it \nand it failed.\n  Of course, we must be responsible for ourselves and our families, but \nthere are times when things occur in this country that we cannot \ncontrol, such as recession, depression, an outbreak of cholera, or a \nserious bacterial infection that may come in, a plane ride away, or a \ndisaster that only God understands why it has to happen to us. And then \nfrom the many, one, from the many States, one, and not a situation \nwhere in order to act as one we need a supermajority. That is wrong.\n  We understand that there are times when the Federal Government needs \nto act to counterbalance cyclical downturns and serious \neconomic trouble.\n  And, again, Senator Byrd had a press conference with Senator Moynihan \nand Senator Sarbanes and prize-winning economists who said this is a \nhuge mistake to put this requirement into the Constitution with a \nsupermajority vote.\n  A statement signed by over 200 economists and political scientists \nsays that the balanced budget amendment--and let me quote from them--\n``hinders severely the public sector's ability to compensate for \ncyclical fluctuations.'' In other words, recession, depression. ``The \nneed for Federal action to stabilize the economy has been widely \nrecognized since the 1930's.''\n  This is the economists talking.\n\n       A balanced budget eliminates one the few mechanisms \n     preventing mild downturns from developing into severe \n     recessions.\n\n  Sometimes you want to act early in a recession to turn it around so \nit does not turn into a depression. Well, it would be hard to get 60 \nvotes for that, I say to my friends.\n  I have received letters from several economists repeating these \nconcerns.\n  Dr. James Tobin, a professor of economics at Yale University and a \nNobel laureate, says in a letter to me: ``The balanced budget amendment \nwould make the economy more unstable, more vulnerable to business cycle \nrecessions, because it requires the budget to be balanced every fiscal \nyear regardless of economic conditions,'' which is what I talked about \nbefore. In many years, it will be perfectly good economic policy to \nhave a balanced budget, but sometimes it may be very difficult.\n  This is what this Nobel laureate says in his letter to me:\n\n       The tax increases or expenditure cuts necessary to keep the \n     budget balanced would make recessions worse and retard \n     recoveries.\n\n  Let me repeat that: This amendment would ``make recessions worse and \nretard recovery.''\n  He goes on and explains:\n\n       When the economy is depressed, individual and business \n     incomes are smaller; income and payroll tax receipts are \n     smaller, too. Spending is down throughout the economy, so \n     excise and sale taxes yield less revenues than normal. \n     Outlays for unemployment insurance, food stamps, cash \n     welfare \n     [[Page S2206]] and even Social Security benefits are higher * \n     * *.\n\n  Now, why are they higher? Because people are out of work and they are \ndrawing down on these safety net programs which I have not heard anyone \nsay they want to destroy.\n  ``The economy,'' he goes on, ``would be worse if these responses to \nrecession did not occur or were cancelled out. Individuals and \nbusinesses hit by losses of income and employment would be hit even \nharder if their tax liabilities remained as high as before and if they \nreceived no help. They would have to curtail their spending even more, \ndepressing economic activity further.''\n  So we have a vicious circle of misery. And what does it take to go \nout of balance? Under this amendment, unless there is an amendment to \ngo out of balance with 51 votes in a recession, you have to get 60 \nvotes to ease the pain of the American people.\n  Dr. Robert M. Solow, professor of economics at the Massachusetts \nInstitute of Technology, and also a Nobel laureate, says the following:\n\n       The Amendment is not only bad law, it is bad economics. One \n     of the important ways we protect ourselves against deep \n     recessions is through ``automatic'' variations in the Federal \n     budget. When business turns bad and sales turn down, incomes \n     fall too. Wage and salary income is reduced by short time and \n     layoffs; business profits are usually even harder hit. The \n     Treasury's tax revenues fall automatically. A balanced \n     Federal budget will be thrown into deficit, not by act of \n     Congress, but by workings of the economy.\n       If the law required Congress to respond by increasing taxes \n     or reducing income-support payments or other expenditures, \n     the result would be perverse. Families and firms would find \n     themselves even worse off, business sales would fall further, \n     and the recession would worsen.\n\n  Dr. Lawrence R. Klein, a proessor of economics at the University of \nPennsylvania and a Nobel laureate, also opposes the balanced budget \namendment because of its potentially damaging effect on the economy. \nProfessor Klein wrote in his letter to me that:\n\n       * * * the primary economic objection to the proposed \n     amendment is that it locks government fiscal policy into an \n     inflexible position. * * * The experience of 1991 and 1992 \n     provides ample evidence of the failure of monetary policy to \n     bring the economy significantly out of recession when it is \n     acting alone instead of being coordinated with fiscal policy \n     in a balanced way.\n\n  Professor Klein goes on to say:\n\n       There are times when budget deficits are needed for \n     temporary stimulus and when surpluses are needed for \n     restraint. If these short-run fiscal policies are properly \n     coordinated with monetary policies we can enjoy a much better \n     national economic performance.\n  These economists are very impressive.\n  I started off with Herbert Stein, who has been a leading voice for \nthe Republicans, who says this is not a good idea. So it is bipartisan. \nThese are people who really care about this country's economy. This is \nnot a political issue to them. This is an issue of substance. They are \nconcerned about our inability to act quickly to head off a recession, \nstop it from getting worse.\n  Now I want to bring up some of the real, what I call red herrings of \nthis debate. They are thrown up there, but they are really not real.\n  The argument is made that all we are doing to the Federal Government \nis what the States already do. This is untrue. The balanced budget \nrequirements of the States usually apply only to the State's general \nfund, which, according to the General Accounting Office, is only about \n54 percent of a State's spending.\n  The balanced budget requirements of most States only deal with a very \nsmall part, with 54 percent of the State's budget and the rest does not \nhave to be in balance.\n  As State deficits start to rise, State governments do some \ninteresting things; 47 States can issue general obligation debt to \nfinance operations and other State activities.\n  They say they have to have a balanced budget, but they go out when \nthings arise and they issue debt; 42 percent of States have capital \nbudgets for infrastructure and other investments that are not required \nto be balanced. In other words, where the United States of America's \nbudget includes infrastructure, capital improvements, highways, \nbridges, roads, as part of our budget, in 19 States, those things are \noff budget. They are separate. And they can be, in fact, financed by \ndebt.\n  I know that the leader here is getting a little concerned at the \nlength of my speech, but I can assure him this will not be the last \ntime I am on the floor, and I am getting to the end of my statement. \nThis is the longest speech I have ever made on this Senate floor. I am \nvery proud that I am able in this democracy to take to the Senate floor \nand give a complete speech on a subject that is so important.\n  This is the Constitution of the United States of America, and in a \nContract With America that Republicans have written, they want to have \na constitutional amendment to balance the budget. They would like to \nget it done in 100 days. Maybe they will. But I came here to fight for \nthe people of my State and for what I believe in. This is going to hurt \nthe people of my State.\n  For me, it is unprecedented to speak longer than 30 minutes on the \nSenate floor. But I am doing it because in my heart I would be failing \nthe people of my State if I did not.\n  Forty-seven States can issue general obligation debt to finance \noperations and other State activities; 42 States have capital budgets \nfor infrastructure and other investments that are not required to be \nbalanced; and 37 States are allowed to borrow for capital projects. \nMoreover, the General Accounting Office reports when States begin to \nexperience deficits, they often resort to financial gimmicks to achieve \na balanced budget, such as putting things off budget, shifting \naccounts, and reducing contributions to pension plans which, by the \nway, can be very dangerous.\n  Let me tell Members what the debt is in my State of California. It is \n$23.5 billion. The Governor of my State says he has to balance his \nbudget. He does not say he has $23.5 billion of debt.\n  Now, the argument is made, so if we say that the Federal Government \nshould act as the States act, I say to Members, the States have debt. I \nam not saying it is right. I am not saying it is wrong. I am saying it \nis a reality. So then some people will say, why do we not have the \nFederal Government act more like a business? Members have heard that--\nact more like a business. By the way, I think we should sometimes. Does \nbusiness have debt? In fact, debt for businesses was $3.8 trillion in \nthe third quarter of 1994. The Federal debt is about $4 trillion. \nBusiness debt is $3.8 trillion. It is very close.\n  Now, why does business go into debt? They do it because they make \ninvestments with the money they borrow; they expand their capabilities. \nAnd I do not think there is one successful business person who would \ncome before Members and say they could never imagine a time when they \ndid not make a loan to expand unless they had unlimited resources. That \nis why businesses are so dependent on interest rates. When interest \nrates go down, they are happy because they can go to the bank and get \ncheap loans, and they can turn that into productivity and profit. Now, \nthey must be wise about it. So should Government. Sometimes, they go \ninto debt.\n  Now the argument is often made, let the Federal Government look like \na family. Now we will look at family. Private debt held by households \nin the third quarter of 1994 was $4.5 trillion. Private debt by \nhouseholds is larger than the Federal debt. Federal debt is $4 \ntrillion; household debt $4.5 trillion. Amazing. I do not know too many \npeople who do not have home mortgages. Maybe other Members do. I do not \neven know too many people that own their cars outright. The upper \nechelon, sure, no problem. Clip the coupons, get the inheritance, no \nproblem. But the average working American has a mortgage. Indeed, we \nencourage them to buy homes. We make the interest on the mortgage tax \ndeductible.\n  So, yes, families have debt. Now, it should be reasonable. It should \nbe intelligent. It should not be overdone. We know when we get in \ntrouble we have to pull back. But if we say the Federal Government \nshould look like a family, families have some debt. More like a \nbusiness? Business has some debt. More like the States? States have a \nwhole lot of debt. I am not saying it is right. I am not saying it is \nwrong. I am saying it is the way it is in a capitalistic society.\n  If someone in our family suffers a setback, we do not throw up our \nhands and say, ``Sorry, we did not expect that you would get cancer, \nand we have used \n[[Page S2207]] up our rainy day funds and we cannot do anything about \nit.'' We pull together; from the many, one. We reach out to friends and \ncommunity to help, and that is why we have to be able to act as a \nFederal Government and to act quickly and to act in such a fashion that \nit does not take a 60-vote majority.\n  Now, many of those supporting this amendment rail against bureaucracy \nand unelected folks having too much power. I agree with them. \nTherefore, I cannot understand them supporting this rigid amendment \nwhere the power will go, first, to a minority in the House and Senate, \nand second to the courts. For example, how do we define outlays in this \namendment? How do we define revenues? These basic questions will surely \nbe the subject of litigation. But that is just the tip of the iceberg.\n  Constitutional scholars anticipate that the President will be sued by \nparties who think his revenue estimates are too high, and by parties \nwho think his revenue estimate is too low; by parties who think his \ngrowth projections are too high, and by people who think his growth \nprojections are too low; by people who will lose benefits or salary \nincreases if the President impounds appropriated funds, which he can do \nin this amendment in the event of a shortfall, and by Congress if the \nPresident declines to impound. And, of course, the cases will be heard \nby judges who do not necessarily have any background in fiscal policy, \nwho will find in their case books no useful precedent and will discover \nin the amendment itself no description, no remedies.\n  Ironically, the simplest solution for the courts in some cases may \nvery well be to order a tax increase. So the power goes to a minority \nof Congress, to the courts, and maybe even to the Federal Reserve, \nbecause they will be the only institution which will be free to respond \nin an economic crisis through monetary policy.\n  If Congress' hands are tied by the will of a minority, as the pending \namendment would do, the central bankers of the largest nations who \nalready have great power will fill the vacuum. They will be able to \nwield greater authority over financial markets, interest rates, \nindustrial development, and economic behavior all around the globe, and \nwe do not even know who these people are.\n  So, Mr. President, I am coming to the end of my remarks. I am down to \nthe last few brutal minutes. For all these reasons, I hope we will not \nadd this amendment to the Constitution. It is a tough vote to vote \n``no'' because it seems simple. If you favor a balanced budget, vote \nfor the amendment to the Constitution. But that is not what this is \nabout.\n  I have made tough deficit reduction votes and continue to do that. \nBut I will not put Social Security at risk. And that is what this \nconstitutional amendment does. I will not put our citizens at risk in \ncase of natural disaster. And that is what it does. I will not put our \npeople at risk in a recession, and that is what this amendment does. \nAnd I will not put our fighting crime budget at risk, and that is what \nthis amendment does, as well as put so many people--our children, our \nelderly, our families--at risk.\n  I will not stand by while my State of California gets the shaft from \ncolleagues who, frankly, will not even tell Members where the cuts are \ncoming from. They are taking a budget ax, but we do not know where it \nwill land. I cannot stand by quietly and not talk out for my State and \nfor the people I represent.\n  I worry very much about this amendment. It is one of our most \nimportant votes. I think, again, out of many, one. That means we should \nbe able to respond to a crisis. We will not be able to do this. I think \nif we vote for this, before we vote, we should demand that my \nRepublican friends show us their budget.\n  Let us support amendments to protect our people by exempting Social \nSecurity disasters and economic downturns from this rigid amendment. \nLet us remove the requirement of a supermajority which will totally tie \nus in knots, and if we do not do these things, then let us defeat this \namendment.\n  In closing, Mr. President, true leadership requires patience, \ncourage, and convictions. This debate will challenge our patience, our \ncourage, and our conviction. Let us meet the test not just as a \npersonal challenge, but because the stakes are enormous for America for \nnow and for decades and decades to come.\n  I thank my colleagues for their patience. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the Senator from California suggests that \nthe balanced budget amendment is inconsistent with the Framers of the \nconstitution and their Constitution because it requires a supermajority \nto pass an imbalanced budget. She asserts that this is \ncountermajoritarian and that majority rule is the main principle in the \nConstitution. This is simply wrong.\n  Virtually every provision of the Bill of Rights is \ncountermajoritarian--each limits what passing majorities can do. There \nare many instances in the Constitution: separation of powers, checks \nand balances, bicameralism, the qualified veto, advise and consent \nprovisions, and treaty ratifications which do not involve the House and \noften involve supermajorities. The entire amendment process requires \nsupermajorities of Congress and the States. Each of these \ninvolves supermajority requirements or gives decisionmaking power to \nless than the majority.\n  But, Mr. President, the Bill of Rights goes even further: It does not \nallow changes with majorities, or even supermajorities. In fact, even a \nunanimous vote cannot contravene the Bill of Rights without amending \nthe Constitution itself. A majority cannot make laws abridging freedom \nof speech. A majority cannot establish a national church or interfere\n with the free exercise of religion. A majority cannot allow police to \nmake unreasonable searches and seizures. A majority cannot infringe on \nthe right to keep and bear arms--at least not legitimately.\n\n  A majority cannot change the bicameral Congress to a parliamentary \nsystem or divide the unitary Executive into a Roman triumvirate. A \nmajority cannot even lower the age requirement of Senators.\n  Mr. President, the Constitution itself is a countermajoritarian \ndocument. If all we wanted in a government was mere majority rule, we \nwould not need a Constitution at all. The very notion of a set of rules \nthat a majority cannot change is countermajoritarian and empowers a \nminority. But, Mr. President, I believe the Constitution has proven its \nworth by protecting transient majorities from themselves and protecting \nthe minority as well. And it has proven its worth as a basic charter \nfor our Government and our Nation.\n  Changing majorities in Congress have been spending our children's \nmoney and they have trampled on the rights of those generations who do \nnot have a vote yet. It is wholly appropriate to require at least a \nmeasure of consensus among those represented to spend the legacy of the \nyoung and the unborn. It is wholly consistent with Madison's \n``auxiliary precautions'' which serve to control the Government to help \nmaintain the freedom of the governed.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, let me take a few minutes to explain to \nthe American people what this debate over the balanced budget amendment \nis really all about.\n  It is a debate between those in this body who want to maintain the \nstatus quo versus those of us who want to implement the change that the \nAmerican people voted for last November.\n  It is a debate between those who want to preserve the business-as-\nusual practices of official Washington--more taxes, more spending, and \nmore debt--versus those of us who want to shake up Washington and \npromote less government and more individual freedom.\n  Mr. President, in March 1994, 17 Senators on the other side of the \naisle voted for the balanced budget amendment. Although I was not here, \nI am told that many of these Senators gave impassioned speeches about \nthe dire economic consequences of high and rising budget deficits--\nabout the immorality of burdening future generations with massive debt.\n  Today, the projections of future deficits and debt are significantly \nhigher than they were last year. The latest CBO outlook for the budget \ndeficit shows it climbing from $207 billion in fiscal 1996 to $243 \nbillion in fiscal 2000. By fiscal year 2005, the CBO projects \n[[Page S2208]] that the deficit will rise to over $400 billion.\n  Budget deficits are rising. Interest rates are rising. The national \ndebt will increase by over $1 trillion over the next 5 years. But \nsomehow our colleagues on the other side of the aisle who voted for the \nbalanced budget amendment in March 1994 now feel less compelled to \nsupport the amendment today.\n  They now want to attach special conditions; namely, the right-to-know \nand Social Security exemption amendments to the balanced budget \namendment in exchange for their support on final passage.\n  As a new Member of the Senate, I would like to know why our \ncolleagues voted for a balanced budget amendment that did not include a \nright-to-know provision last year? Why were there no requests for \nbudget details back then?\n  The minority leader was quoted the other day in Congress Daily saying \nthat he may not vote for the balanced budget amendment because he does \nnot ``have sufficient information on it.'' Again, I was not here, but \nthe minority leader and others apparently had sufficient information \nwhen they voted for the balanced budget amendment the last March.\n  Why did our colleagues vote last year for a balanced budget amendment \nthat did not include a provision to exempt Social Security? Is Social \nSecurity somehow more at risk this year than it was last year? Judging \nfrom the cards, letters, and phone calls that I get from Michigan's \nsenior citizens, Social Security is politically as strong as ever. I \nhave no doubt that it will compete very well with other programs in the \nFederal budget.\n  Mr. President, in truth, the only difference between today and last \nyear is that a new party controls the Congress--and some people do not \nlike it. These amendments are nothing but veiled attempts to torpedo \nthe balanced budget amendment, thereby thwarting the American public's \nwill as demonstrated in the last election.\n  In my judgment, we need the balanced budget amendment now more than \never. Clearly, the budget deficit is once again spiraling out of \ncontrol. And President Clinton has apparently decided to raise the \nwhite flag on the budget deficit.\n  His proposed budget for fiscal 1996 barely puts a dent in the out-\nyear budget deficits. In fact, his budget calls for an increase in \nFederal spending from $1.5 to $1.9 trillion by the turn of the century. \nIt will produce budget deficits of about $200 billion every single year \nthrough the year 2000.\n  Mr. President, according to an article in Saturday's Washington Post, \none administration official who participated in drafting the \nPresident's budget said that, ``It should be a source of shame.''\n  With this budget submission, the President has basically decided to \nwalk away from his campaign pledge to cut the budget deficit in half \nduring his first term--and walk away from the public's overwhelming \ndesire to balance the Federal budget.\n  In my view, President Clinton's budget should be the poster child for \nthe balanced budget amendment.\n  Without the constitutional force of a balanced budget amendment, the \nPresident is simply not compelled to make some tough choices and submit \na balanced budget.\n  Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier, I think this debate is a \nshowdown between the business-as-usual politics of official Washington \nand the desire for sweeping change that the people voted for last \nNovember. It is that simple.\n  Those Senators who oppose the amendment want to maintain the status \nquo of higher deficits, higher spending, and higher taxes. Those \nSenators who support the amendment want to shake up the system and \nforce Congress to do what every American family must do--live within \nits means.\n        education infrastructure and the right-to-know amendment\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, as a strong supporter of the right-\nto-know amendment, as well as a strong supporter of the balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment, there is a lot I would like to say on behalf \nof the principles that underlie both ideas. However, at this time, I \nwould like to say just a few words about the fiscal year 1996 \nadministration budget proposals and their impact on my top legislative \npriority in the last Congress, the Education Infrastructure Act.\n  I ran for the Senate in no small part because I believe that the \nFederal Government has a real responsibility to make primary and \nsecondary education a higher priority. I think it is absolutely clear \nthat a solid primary and secondary education is the foundation on which \nopportunity is built, and I am convinced that one of the most cost-\neffective ways the Federal Government can open up opportunities for our \nchildren over the long-run is to give primary and secondary education \nthe attention they deserve.\n  That is why I am so disappointed that the administration is proposing \nto rescind the $100 million fiscal year 1995 appropriation for the \nEducation Infrastructure Act, which I authored last year, and it is why \nI am so disappointed that the President is not requesting any money for \nthis very important program in fiscal year 1996.\n  Last year, Congress passed the Goals 2000: Educate America Act, which \nPresident Clinton signed into law on March 31, 1994. I strongly \nsupported this legislation when it was before the Congress. It promises \nto help create a coherent, national framework for education reform, \nfounded on the national education goals.\n  Helping to achieve real progress in education is what the Education \nInfrastructure Act is all about. Last Wednesday, the General Accounting \nOffice released a frightening report on the physical condition of our \nNation's public schools. This study concluded that it will take $112 \nbillion to restore school facilities nationwide to a ``good'' overall \ncondition. The GAO found that public schools need $11 billion just to \nmeet Federal requirements, including $46 billion to make all programs \naccessible to all students and $5 billion to remove or correct \nhazardous substances.\n  The Education Infrastructure Act, which was included in the \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act is \nspecifically designed to help school districts that do not have \nadequate local resources to provide facilities where students can \nlearn. It assists school districts in renovating, altering, and \nrehabilitating old facilities and in constructing needed new \nfacilities.\n  It is inherently unfair to expect our children to meet national \nperformance standards if they do not have a real opportunity to learn. \nThe Education Infrastructure Act will help our children learn by \nhelping to restore an environment conducive to learning. In her \nresearch at Georgetown University, Maureen Edwards found that students \nin poor school facilities are likely to fall over 5 percentage points \nbelow those in schools that are in fair condition and 11 percentage \npoints below those in schools in excellent condition. These figures are \neloquent testimony as to why the Education Infrastructure Act is so \nneeded, and why it is such a cost-effective idea to pursue. And they \nprovide important evidence as to why the decision to zero out the \nEducation Infrastructure Act in the budget was so ill-advised.\n  But building on the work Congress did last year on the Education \nInfrastructure Act was not the only opportunity this budget missed. \nLooking at the budget more broadly, I am very disappointed that it does \nnot continue the work that the administration and Congress began in \n1993 to reduce Federal deficits. The current strength of the U.S. \neconomy and the long-term budget trends the United States is facing \nmake this the time to act. In too many areas, however, this budget \ndefers taking actions that are already long overdue.\n  Most importantly, the budget does not contain proposals to deal with \nthe major entitlement\n problems the Federal Government is facing. Mandatory spending is \nbecoming an ever-greater portion of the Federal budget, and it is the \nengine driving the growth of the budget. Mandatory spending will be \nalmost three-quarters of the entire Federal budget by the year 2003, \nand mandatory spending, together with interest expense, represents 95 \npercent of the growth of year-to-year Federal spending. The only way to \nget a real handle on Federal deficits is to take a hard look at \nmandatory spending. That is what the Bipartisan Commission on \nEntitlement and Tax Reform, on which I served, was all about. And that \nis \n[[Page S2209]] what the Commission found, approving its report on the \ntrends driving the growth of Federal spending by an overwhelming 30 to \n1 vote.\n  However, the truth contained in the Commission's report--that rapidly \nrising health care costs and the ``graying of America'' are what are \ndriving Federal deficits--is not reflected in the budget.\n  Medicare and Medicaid continue to rise at rates above the rate of \neconomic growth or Federal revenues. Health care reform continues to be \nessential in order to make any lasting progress on health care cost \ngrowth. Yet the budget does not face the need for reform in health \ncare.\n  Social Security needs reform to ensure it will be there for future \ngenerations as it has for current and past beneficiaries. This does not \nmean cutting benefits for any current beneficiary by even a nickel, but \nit does mean that we need to face the reform issues honestly, and that \nwe owe it to the American people, and particularly to younger Americans \nwho worry that Social Security will not be there for them, to face them \nnow. Yet, this budget does not do so.\n  Instead, the budget seems to concentrate on the part of the budget--\ndiscretionary domestic spending--that CBO says has not grown as a \npercentage of the economy since 1960, rather than taking on the real \narea of growth--mandatory spending. And it proposes tax cuts, when the \nAmerican people know that deficit reduction is the higher priority.\n  The President does not support the balanced budget constitutional \namendment, but the underlying budget trends do not either know or care \nwho is for the balanced budget amendment or against it. The trends \nsimply go on until we develop the political will to act to change them.\n  We all have an obligation to the American public to tell the truth \nabout the budget, and about the future we face if we do not act. The \nAmerican people know that something is wrong with the budget; the \nbudget document should be a clear guide to what that something is.\n  Mr. President, I am confident that the American people will make the \nright decisions regarding the budget if they have the right \ninformation. This budget does not do enough to see that they do. Not \nfacing our budget problems condemns us to a future where we don't have \nthe money to solve either old problems or new ones. It costs us \neconomic growth, savings, and works to undermine the standard of living \nof most Americans.\n  Dealing with our budget deficits is not an arcane accounting issue, \nit is perhaps the most important issue facing America today, and the \nmost important determinant of the kind of future we will see. Balancing \nthe budget is a people issue--an issue for our children and their \nchildren. It is disappointing that the budget does not do more to \ncommunicate those fundamental truths to the American people. I expected \nmore.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/06/senate-section/article/S2156-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

We \nmoved quickly and vigorously to address these problems. Working with \nCongress in 1993, we enacted the largest deficit reduction package in \nhistory. We cut Federal spending by $255 billion over five years, cut \ntaxes for 40 million low- and moderate-income Americans, and made 90 \npercent of small business eligible for tax relief, while increasing \nincome tax rates only on the wealthiest 1.2 percent of Americans. And \nwhile we placed a tight ``freeze'' on overall discretionary spending at \n1993 levels, \n[[Page S2211]] we shifted spending toward investments in human and \nphysical capital that will help secure our future.\n  As we fought for our budget and economic policies, we moved \naggressively to open world markets for American goods and services. We \nnegotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and \nMexico, concluded negotiations over the Uruguay Round of the General \nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade, and worked with Congress to enact \nimplementing legislation for both.\n  Our economic plan helped bring the deficit down from $290 billion in \n1992, to $203 billion in 1994, to a projected $193 billion this year--\nproviding three straight years of deficit reduction for the first time \nsince Harry Truman was President. Measured as a percentage of our \neconomy--that is, Gross Domestic Product [GDP]--our plan will cut the \ndeficit in half.\n  By reassuring the financial markets that we were serious about \ngetting our fiscal house in order, our plan also lowered interest rates \nwhile holding inflation in check. That helped to stimulate private \ninvestment and exports, and sparked the creation of 5.6 million new \njobs--more than twice the number in the previous four years.\n  Now that we have brought the deficit down, we have no intention of \nturning back. My budget keeps us on the course of fiscal discipline by \nproposing $81 billion in additional deficit reduction through the year \n2000. I am proposing to save $23 billion by reinventing three Cabinet \ndepartments and two other major agencies, to save $2 billion by ending \nmore than 130 programs altogether, and to provide better service to \nAmericans by consolidating more than 270 other programs. Under my plan, \nthe deficit will continue to fall as a percentage of GDP to 2.1 \npercent, reaching its lowest level since 1979.\n  Despite our strong economic record, however, many Americans have not \nshared in the fruits of recovery. Though these Americans are working \nharder and harder, their incomes are either stagnant or falling. The \nproblem is particularly acute among those with less education or fewer \nof the skills needed to compete in an increasingly global economy. To \nbuild a more prosperous America, one with rising living standards for \nall Americans, we must turn our attention to those who have not \nbenefited from the current recovery.\n  My budget proposes to do that.\n\n\n        promoting a rising standard of living for all americans\n\n  I am proposing a Middle Class Bill of Rights, which will provide tax \nrelief to middle-income Americans. The Middle Class Bill of Rights \nincludes a $500 per child tax credit for middle-income families with \nchildren under 13, expands eligibility for Individual Retirement \nAccounts and allows families to make penalty-free withdrawals for a \nrange of educational, housing, and medical needs; and offers a tax \ndeduction for the costs of college, university, or vocational \neducation.\n Also as part of my Middle Class Bill of Rights, I am proposing to \nrevamp our confusing array of job training programs by consolidating \nsome 70 of them. In my G.I. Bill for America's Workers, I propose to \noffer dislocated and low-income workers ``Skill grants'' through which \nthey can make their own choices about the training they need to find \nnew and better jobs.\n\n  The G.I. Bill for America's Workers is the final element of my effort \nto improve the education and skills of Americans, enabling them to \ncompete in the economy of today and tomorrow. In the last two years, we \nenacted Goals 2000 to encourage States and localities to reform their \neducation systems; revamped the student loan program to make post-\nsecondary education affordable to more Americans; and pushed \nsuccessfully for the School-to-Work program that enables young \nAmericans to move more easily from high school to training or more \neducation.\n  And I am proposing to pay for this Middle Class Bill of Rights with \nspecific spending cuts. In fact, I am proposing enough spending cuts to \nprovide more than twice as much in budget savings--$144 billion--as the \ntax cuts will cost--$63 billion--over five years.\n\n\n          creating opportunity and encouraging responsibility\n\n  By itself, the Federal Government cannot rebuild America's \ncommunities. What it can do is give communities some of the tools and \nresources to address their problems in their own way. My national \nservice program provides incentives for Americans of all ages to \nvolunteer their services in local communities across the country, and \nearn money for their own education. The budget proposes to invest more \nin our urban centers as well as in rural areas, and to continue our \nefforts to build stronger government-to-government relations with \nAmerican Indian and Alaska Native Tribes. And I will work with Congress \nto enact comprehensive welfare reform that embodies the principles of \nwork and responsibility for abled-bodied recipients, while protecting \ntheir children.\n  My Administration has worked with State and local law enforcement \nagencies to help retake the streets from the criminals and drug dealers \nwho, in far too many places, now control them. Congress enacted my \ncrime bill last year, finally answering the cries of Americans after \ntoo many years of debate and gridlock. We pushed successfully for the \n``three strikes and you're out'' rule for violent criminals, and we are \nmaking significant progress on my promise to put 100,000 more police on \nthe street. Congress also passed the long-overdue Brady Bill, which \nprovides for background checks that will keep guns out of the hands of \ncriminals. In this budget, I am proposing new funds with which States \nand localities can hire more police, build more space in prisons and \nboot camps, invest in prevention programs for first-time offenders, and \nprovide drug treatment for many more drug users.\n  My Administration inherited deep-seated problems with the immigration \nsystem, and we have gone a long way toward addressing them. This budget \nproposes the strongest efforts yet, including funds for over 1,000 new \nBorder Patrol agents, inspectors, and support staff. While working to \nfulfill the Federal Government's responsibility to secure our borders \nagainst illegal immigration, the budget also proposes funds to assist \nStates that are unduly burdened with the health, education, and prison-\nrelated costs associated with illegal immigrants.\n  We must redouble our efforts to protect the environment. My \nAdministration has sought more innovative, effective approaches to do \nso, and this budget would build upon them. In particular, I am \nproposing to work more with State and local governments, businesses, \nand environmental groups on collaborative efforts, while seeking more \nfunds for high-priority programs.\n  Because investments in science and technology pay off in higher \nproductivity and living standards down the road, I am seeking \nsignificant new funding for the Advanced Technology Program at the \nCommerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology, \nNASA's New Technology Investments, the Defense Department's Technology \nReinvestment Project, biomedical research at the National Institutes of \nHealth, and research and development at the National Science \nFoundation. I am also seeking to strengthen\n our coordinated efforts through the Administration's National Science \nand Technology Council and to improve the payment system for federally-\nsponsored research at colleges and universities.\n\n  I remain committed to comprehensive health care reform. The problems \nthat prompted me to send Congress the Health Security Act in November \n1993 have not gone away. Health care costs have continued to soar for \nindividuals, businesses, and all levels of government. More Americans \nare losing their health coverage each year, and many others are staying \nin jobs only out of fear of losing their own coverage. I am asking \nCongress to work with me on a bipartisan basis, to take the first steps \ntoward guaranteeing health care coverage to every American while \ncontaining costs.\n\n\n            projecting american leadership around the world\n\n  We have begun the post-Cold War era and welcome one of its most \nsignificant fruits--the continuing efforts of Russia and the newly-\nindependent states to move toward democracy and economic freedom. We \npropose to continue our support for this fundamental change that \nclearly serves the Nation's long-term interests.\n  My proposals for international affairs also promote and defend this \nNation's vital interests in Central Europe, the \n[[Page S2212]] Middle East, and Asia. The budget supports the important \nrole we play in fostering our historic peace process in the Middle \nEast.\n  With the global economy offering the prospect of new markets for \nAmerican goods, we are redoubling our efforts to promote an open \ntrading system in Asia, as well as in Latin America and the rest of the \nglobe. I am, for instance, proposing increased funding for our trade \npromotion agencies, such as the Export-Import Bank, which strengthen \nour trade position. I am also asking for continued support for the \nbilateral and multilateral assistance to less-developed nations that \ncan prevent humanitarian crises, as well as support for a strong \nAmerican response to these crises.\n  Our military strength works in synergy with our foreign policy. Our \nforces defend our interests, deterring potential adversaries and \nreassuring our friends. My Defense Funding Initiative, a $25 billion \nincrease in defense spending over the next six years, marks the third \ntime that I have raised defense spending above my initial funding plan \nin order to support and maintain the most capable military force in the \nworld. I am determined to ensure a high level of readiness of U.S. \nmilitary forces, to continue to improve the pay and quality of life for \nthe men and women who serve, and to ensure that our forces are \nmodernized with new systems that will be available near the end of the \ncentury.\n\n\n                         making government work\n\n  None of our efforts can fully succeed unless we make Government work \nfor all Americans. We have made great progress with the National \nPerformance Review (NPR), which I established early in the \nAdministration and which Vice President Gore has so ably run at my \ndirection.\n  Specifically, departments and agencies across the Government have \nmade substantial progress on each of the NPR's four themes: putting \ncustomers first, empowering employees to get results, cutting red tape, \nand cutting back to basics. The departments and agencies have \nestablished customer service standards and streamlined their \noperations. They also are working with my Office of Management and \nBudget to focus more on ``performance''--what Federal programs actually \naccomplish. And they are doing all this while we are cutting the \nFederal workforce by 272,900 positions, bringing it to its smallest \nsize since John Kennedy was President.\n  We also greatly improved the Federal regulatory system, opening it up \nmore to public scrutiny. We plan to build upon our efforts, to make \nsure that we are protecting the public while not unduly burdening any \none industry or group. We also overhauled the Federal procurement \nsystem, cutting mountains of red tape and enabling the Government to \nbuy high-quality goods and services at lower cost.\n  Despite such progress, however, we are only beginning our efforts. I \nrecently announced a major restructuring of the Departments of Housing \nand Urban Development, Energy, and Transportation, the General Services \nAdministration, and the Office of Personnel Management. The budget \ncontains details of these restructurings and our related proposals that \naffect hundreds of other programs.\n  In the coming months, the Vice President will lead Phase II of our \ncrusade to reinvent Government--an effort to identify other agencies \nand programs to restructure or terminate, to sort out responsibilities \namong the Federal, State, and local levels of government, and to choose \nfunctions better performed by the private sector.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  Our agenda is working. By cutting the budget deficit, investing in \nour people, and opening world markets, we have begun to lay the \nfoundation for a strong economy for years to come. And by reinventing \nthe Federal Government, cutting red tape and layers of management, we \nhave begun to make Government more responsive to the American people.\n  This budget seeks to build upon those efforts. It seeks to spread the \nbenefits of our economic recovery to more Americans and give them the \ntools to build a brighter future for themselves. It also seeks to \ncontinue our reinvention efforts--to eliminate or restructure agencies \nand programs, and to better sort out responsibilities among the \nFederal, State, and local levels of government.\n  These proposals will help us to create a stronger economy and more \neffective Government. I will ask for Congress's help in these efforts.\n                                                  William J.

Identical legislation passed both Houses during the 103d \nCongress, but failed to reach the President's desk before adjournment.\n  The advisory Commission was originally authorized for a 10-year \nperiod under the National Parks and Recreation Act of 1978, the bill \nwhich established the Kaloko-Honokohau National Historical Park. \nUnfortunately, since the National Park Service did not acquire a \nsufficient land base for park operations until October 1990, the 10-\nyear period expired without the Commission being established.\n  My bill simply reauthorizes the Friends of Kaloko-Honokohau to \ncomplete its original mandate. The Commission will advise the Director \nof the National Park Service on historical, archaeological, cultural, \nand interpretive programs for the park. Particular emphasis will be \ngiven to the demonstration of traditional native Hawaiian culture.\n  Mr. President, Congress intended Kaloko-Honokohau Historical Park to \nbe dedicated to the preservation and perpetuation of traditional native \nHawaiian culture and activities. The reestablishment of Friends of \nKaloko-Honokohau is a necessary step in achieving this goal.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HEFLIN (for himself and Mr. Lott):\n  S. 358.

Mr. President, today I introduce S. 358, a bill which \nwill clarify the tax treatment of air ambulance flights.\n  The purpose of an air ambulance is to transport critically ill or \ninjured patients quickly and with the appropriate level of care between \nhospitals or from roadside accidents to emergency rooms. Nearly 70 \npercent of all air medical transports originate in rural locations. \nSince air ambulances are reimbursed for providing their services, \nthough, they are considered charter operators, and therefore, must pay \nthe Federal aviation excise tax.\n  The need for this legislation is evident when you consider that \nnearly half of all air medical flights are reimbursed from Government \nprograms such as Medicare, Medicaid, Champus, or State programs. In \neffect, this means that the tax revenue generated is simply one \nGovernment agency paying a tax to another with an air ambulance program \nacting as tax collector. Commercial airlines can pass this tax on to \nits paying customers, but for transportation on an air ambulance, this \ntax is passed on to the payor even if that payor is another Government \nprogram such as Medicare.\n  Furthermore, even though the total portion of tax revenue generated \nby air ambulances is small compared to airlines, approximately 45,000 \ncovered air medical transports compared to 500 million commercial and \ncharter passengers, the financial and administrative burden on air \nambulance administrators is significant.\n  I do not believe that it was the intention of Congress, when this tax \nwas drafted, for critically ill or injured patients, or those paying \ntheir health costs, to support the aviation trust fund. My bill will \ncorrect this obvious oversight by reducing the administrative burden on \nair medical programs. Its impact on Federal revenues is only slight. \nIts impact on access to rural health care however is significant. \nTherefore I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am pleased to join as a cosponsor of \nSenator Heflin's legislation that would clarify the tax treatment of \nair ambulances transporting the critically ill and injured.\n  The role of air medical services continues to grow as the number of \nrural and community hospitals continue to close. Air ambulances provide \nthe vital service of transporting patients needing a higher level of \ntrauma or emergency care to the appropriate medical facility. This is \nparticularly important in rural areas where the availability of \nappropriate medical care is always a concern.\n  Air ambulances transport approximately 45,000 patients annually that \nmust pay the Federal aviation excise tax. Nearly half of these patients \nare covered by Federal or State health care plans, such as Medicare. \nTherefore, approximately 50 percent of the time, this tax results in \none Government program paying a tax to another.\n  Not only do I support the role of air medical services in my State, \nbut I also question the logic of the Federal Government paying a tax to \nitself. Preliminary estimates indicate that the cost to the aviation \ntrust fund would be approximately $10 million, with nearly half that \namount coming from other government health care programs.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation. It makes \nno sense to charge an excise tax on those that are critically ill or \ninjured.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BYRD (for himself and Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 359. A bill to provide for the extension of certain hydroelectric \nprojects located in the State of West Virginia; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                new martinsville ferc license extension\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I introduce, on behalf of Senator \nRockefeller and myself, a bill to grant the city of New Martinsville, \nWV, a 4-year extension to its Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \n[FERC] licenses to begin construction of two hydroelectric power \nprojects at New Cumberland and Willow Island on the Ohio River. These \nprojects are to be financed by the city of New Martinsville through the \nsale of municipal bonds. This extension is necessary because the city \nhas already invested over $4 million in these projects. The \nhydroelectric projects take advantage of existing Army Corps navigation \ndams on the Ohio River in order to generate power, and also will \ninclude the \n[[Page S2214]] development of recreational facilities. Without any \ncontribution from the Federal Government, the city of New Martinsville \nwill finance projects that will include fishing piers, underwater \nreefs, walkways, picnic facilities, and parking areas.\n  The city anticipates that the two projects would employ 500 workers \nduring the peak of construction, with a $1.5 million monthly payroll. \nThe total construction payroll for both projects is expected to be $25 \nmillion. The New Martinsville hydropower projects will also pay \nsubstantial taxes and other payments to various governmental entities \nduring construction and operation. The Federal Government will benefit \nfrom these projects, since it will receive annual payments of $800,000 \nfrom the hydroelectric projects, even though the projects will be \nfinanced by the city of New Martinsville. The license extensions made \npossible by this bill will bring significant economic development to \nthe northern Panhandle region of West Virginia.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/06/senate-section/article/S2213-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2214]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                  S. 7\n\n  At the request of Mr. Daschle, the name of the Senator from \nMassachusetts [Mr. Kerry] was added as a cosponsor of S. 7, a bill to \nprovide for health care reform through health insurance market reform \nand assistance for small business and families, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                  S. 8\n\n  At the request of Mr. Daschle, the name of the Senator from Hawaii \n[Mr. Akaka] was added as a cosponsor of S. 8, a bill to amend title IV \nof the Social Security Act to reduce teenage pregnancy, to encourage \nparental responsibility, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 12\n\n  At the request of Mr. Roth, the names of the Senator from Wyoming \n[Mr. Thomas], the Senator from Alabama [Mr. Shelby], the Senator from \nNevada [Mr. Bryan], and the Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner] were \nadded as cosponsors of S. 12, a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code \nof 1986 to encourage savings and investment through individual \nretirement accounts, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 227\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatch, the name of the Senator from Ohio [Mr. \nDeWine] was added as a cosponsor of S. 227, a bill to amend title 17, \nUnited States Code, to provide an exclusive right to perform sound \nrecordings publicly by means of digital transmissions, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                       Senate Joint Resolution 16\n\n  At the request of Mr. Brown, the name of the Senator from Wyoming \n[Mr. Simpson] was added as a cosponsor of Senate Joint Resolution 16, a \njoint resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the \nUnited States to grant the President line-item veto authority.\n\n\n                       Senate Joint Resolution 19\n\n  At the request of Mr. Brown, the name of the Senator from \nPennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] was added as a cosponsor of Senate Joint \nResolution 19, a joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States relative to limiting congressional \nterms.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/06/senate-section/article/S2214-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2214]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          NOTICES OF HEARINGS\n\n\n               committee on energy and natural resources\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.
