Mr. President, it is widely rumored that the Federal \nReserve will raise interest rates today for the seventh time in the \npast year. Hard-working Americans all across this country can only hope \nthat the Fed will give a second thought to an unnecessary and \ndestructive action. The Federal Reserve is an independent and powerful \nfourth branch of Government--a branch of Government, I might add, that \nis unelected and essentially unchecked by reasonable examination.\n  While I disagree with Alan Greenspan's policies, I must give him \ncredit for a superb ability to manipulate the press and many others, \nincluding many Members of Congress. Somehow, Mr. Greenspan has created \nan aura of naturalism, a feeling that his actions are somehow preset by \nimmutable economic realities, some form of the invisible hand operating \nthere that causes \n[[Page S1864]]  us to do things that we cannot change. In fact, his \nposition is based on a conservative ideology that favors the long-term \ninterest of bondholders and bankers but shows little sympathy for \nhardworking, middle-income families.\n  In fact, his policies are specifically intended to force a \nsignificant number of breadwinners out of work and into the \nunemployment lines. In fact, I read in the paper the other day that Mr. \nGreenspan, in testimony, was saying that unemployment rates were coming \ndown and they were approaching a 5.4- percent rate of unemployment, and \nhe thought that was getting too low, that unemployment ought to be \nhigher than that. That is his feeling. That is where he is coming from.\n  Thus, the Federal Reserve's policies are designed to keep millions of \nAmericans out of work, in spite of the fact that the law which governs \nthem specifically provides that the Federal Reserve is to balance the \ngoal of maximizing production and employment with the goal of keeping \nprices stable and moderating long-term interest rates.\n  Mr. President, as I said earlier, the Federal Reserve has already \nraised interest rates six times over the past year. As a result, the \nprime rate increased from 6 to 8.5 percent, a 41-percent jump in \ninterest rates in just 1 year. These actions by the Fed amount to a \nbill to the American taxpayers for $107 billion over 5 years--$713 per \ntaxpayer.\n Why this bill? It is a bill to pay the resulting higher interest costs \nto service the Federal debt.\n\n  The Federal Reserve's repeated interest rate hikes have also had an \nimportant negative effect on Americans. They have cost nearly every \nbusiness in the country large sums in higher interest rates.\n  In addition, the average buyer of a new house will pay an extra $158 \nper month on a fixed rate mortgage--that is nearly $1,900 a year, more \nthan enough to prevent many Americans from attaining a key component of \nthe American dream, owning your own home. Millions of other American \nfamilies are being forced to pay more on their adjustable rate home \nmortgages, more on their bank loans, and more for interest rates on \ntheir cars and on their credit card balances.\n  Even more significantly, the six, and now probably seven, increases \nin interest rates will and are, in fact, designed to, eliminate jobs. \nFederal Reserve officials do not use those terms, although Mr. \nGreenspan came close to it in testimony the other day. But that is \nclearly their intent. Their intent is to keep unemployment high. They \nwant to artificially slow the economy down and reduce the number of \navailable jobs. In many cases, that will mean that people will be \nfired.\n  In other cases, that will mean that a job will not be there for \nsomeone looking for work. It will mean that families with breadwinners \nactively looking for work will not have their basic needs met. The \nfinancial strain on those families will cost both economic and \npsychological damage.\n  It also means an increase in the welfare roles. Some of us have been \nworking hard to fix our broken welfare system. It is failing both the \ntaxpayers and those who rely on it. But a key to welfare reform that \nworks is the availability of good jobs. I think all of us agree that we \nwant to move people from welfare to work and to self-sufficiency; that \nis, all but perhaps those on the Federal Reserve Board. Their recent \npenchant for raising interest rates in order to keep the unemployment \nrate up will make ending welfare as we know it impossible.\n  Why would the Federal Reserve want to do that? Well, there is an \neconomic concept called nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment. \nThis concept says that when unemployment falls below a certain level, \nit becomes harder to find employees, then it is easier to demand higher \nwages and wages will rise. Some economists think that the natural rate \nof unemployment in the United States--the point where lower \nunemployment will cause inflation--is about 6 percent. This, obviously, \nis what Mr. Greenspan believes.\n  The Fed's principal justification for its six increases in interest \nrates has been their fear of rising inflation. Well, let us take a look \nat that.\n  Last year, the Consumer Price Index, the CPI, went up a meager 2.7 \npercent, exactly the same rate of inflation as in 1993. If you take out \nthe more volatile food and fuel costs, the rate increased by just 2.6 \npercent, the lowest rate of inflation since 1965. And, on top of that, \nMr. Greenspan believes that the CPI was actually overstating inflation, \nas he says, by anywhere from 0.5 to 1.5 percent.\n  Mr. Greenspan has been talking a lot about this lately. He said it in \ntestimony before a congressional committee.\n  Well, if he were right about the CPI being overstated by that much--\nand I have my doubts about that--then Mr. Greenspan has pushed a huge \nburden on our economy when even he believes that inflation has been \nunder 2 percent a year over the last 3 years.\n  So Mr. Greenspan cannot have it both ways. He cannot say, on the one \nhand, we have to raise interest rates because inflation is threatening \nand, on the other hand, come before a committee of Congress and say \nthat inflation has been overstated and it is really not as high as it \nhas been; it really has been lower than that. He cannot have it both \nways.\n  And yet, we now have interest rates going up for the seventh time in \n1 year. Again, an ideology that says we have to reward the long-term \nbondholders but forget about our Main Street businesses; forget about \nour farmers; forget about our homeowners and young people wanting to \nbuy a house; forget about people buying a car on time; people paying \noff college students loans. All of this goes up, not to mention, again, \nthe fact that these rate increases have stuck the American taxpayer \nwith an additional $107 billion tab to pay increased interest costs on \nthe national debt.\n  For Alan Greenspan to push these further destructive increases in \ninterest rates on the American people, while saying that inflation has \nbeen running at less than 2 percent, to me is the height of hypocrisy. \nMr. Greenspan, as I said, cannot have it both ways.\n  I also note that the Fed Chairman recently indicated in testimony \nbefore the Finance Committee last week that he thinks there is likely \nto be a slowdown in the economy in the coming months. But he said that, \n``I see it as crucial that we extend the recent trend of low and \nhopefully declining inflation in the years ahead.''\n  Well, Mr. President, we need balance between the need to fight \ninflation and the need to keep our economy moving. The law, as I read \nit, requires a balance. But, right now, there is no balance. There is \nan imbalance.\n  All of the Fed's weight is now toward the single goal of cutting any \npossibility of rising inflation in the future. That is wrong, and I \nbelieve it is very likely going to send our economy into a recession.\n  Robert Eisner, a respected professor at Northwestern University, made \nan excellent analogy, comparing the economy with a patient with clogged \narteries. ``The patient would have a longer and better life by \nexercising and expanding the capacity of his heart and circulation \nsystem,'' Eisner said. ``But what Dr. Greenspan has done, I think \nunwisely, is simply to put the patient to bed.''\n  Well, Mr. Greenspan talks about the dangers of large deficits on the \neconomy. And I agree with him on that point. We do need to keep our \ndeficits coming down. But his push to higher interest rates is adding \nto the deficit--hugely. Higher Federal interest payments will add $107 \nbillion to the Federal deficit over the next 5 years. This totally \nwipes out more than 20 percent of the deficit reduction achieved by our \neconomic recovery package of 1993.\n  It is almost as if Mr. Greenspan does not want to see the efforts \nthat we took here to reduce the deficit succeed. He is wiping out all \nof those gains that we have made to reduce the deficit.\n  There is considerable reason to believe the idea that inflation will \nautomatically rise because the unemployment rate has fallen below 6 \npercent is wrong. Things have changed. Wages are more closely tied to \nproductivity increases. And, there is a greater ability to move \nmanufacturing overseas if the price of producing many items in the \nUnited States rises.\n  There have also been large changes in the retail sector. The large \nincrease in discount stores is putting greater downward price pressures \non the entire system. There is a growing willingness of consumers to \nuse non-brand-name \n[[Page S1865]]  products, also creating a real difficulty of \nmanufacturers and retailers to raise prices.\n  Some people also see a new culture developing in many manufacturing \nareas which places considerable pressure on suppliers to avoid cost \nincreases and to develop new, lower cost methods of producing goods. To \nsome extent, gains in computer designs are providing methods to \naccomplish that goal. Productivity seems to be covering a significant \nshare of the wage increases that are occurring.\n  I would also note, Mr. President, that wage and salary costs have \nonly increased by about 3 percent in 1994. A significant part of that \nis covered, as I said, by increases in productivity.\n So, wage costs were--considering productivity--less than the inflation \nrate in 1994. I want to repeat that because it is very important to \nnote this. Wage costs were, when we consider the increase in \nproductivity, less than the inflation rate in 1994.\n\n  So, Mr. President, economic theories that may have proven true in the \n1950's or 1960's or 1970's may not be useful today. I believe that Mr. \nGreenspan is living in the past. Companies that have recently hired \nlarge numbers of employees do not seem to need to pay higher wages. \nLands' End hired 2,200 people for the Christmas season, Sears hired \n40,000 Christmas workers, but they saw no increase in wage levels. MCI, \nwhich hires 10,000 to 15,000 people a year, also has not been pushed to \nraise wages.\n  So where, I ask, is this inflation that the Fed has been expecting \nand warning about? Mr. Greenspan says if we do not act now, it will \ncome. The Fed says it takes a long time for the pain of their interest \nrate increases to work their way through the economy to cause the \neconomy to slow down; that is, to interpret that, to cause enough \npeople to be laid off and fired for enough unemployed people to stay \nthat way. I may agree with that. It may take from 6 to 18 months for \nthat to happen.\n  Is it logical, I ask, to rush forward with a seventh increase in \ninterest rates when we have not even seen the impact of the earlier \nincreases? Since the Fed Chairman believes inflation has been running \nat less than 2 percent, I believe we could take a very small risk of a \nslight increase in inflation in order to limit the likelihood that the \neconomy will take a serious plunge into recession and far higher \nunemployment. I would think it would be far more prudent to wait to \nincrease interest rates any more.\n  In fact, Mr. President, I believe that from the actions taken by the \nFed with this recent increase in interest rates, we may be seeing in \nthe next year a severe downturn in the economy in 1996. We might think \nof the height of interest rates as a mountain, and as the speed of the \nrate increases, remains high, and the height grows, the cliff on the \nother side, the deep valley into which the economy may fall, will \nbecome more painful.\n  I think it is past time for the Federal Reserve to pull back its \nbulldozer. Let the economy work through the interest rates already put \nin place. Then, after that has happened, we can consider further \naction. That is the way to get a soft landing for the economy that we \nall want, rather than having it tossed off a cliff. I believe that is \nexactly what may happen next year.\n  There have already been a few signs of a slowdown in the economy. \nTotal construction fell by 7.7 percent in December, the largest decline \nof the year. Construction is very sensitive to interest rates. Housing \nfell by 8 percent; again, very sensitive to interest rates. Personnel \nincome rose nicely in December, by 0.7 percent, but consumer spending \nwent up by only 0.2 percent.\n  This morning, the leading economic indicators showed a slim 0.1 \npercent gain. These are signs that economic growth is near its peak. \nThis is not the time to further burden the economy with higher interest \nrates. The Federal Reserve and the Open Market Committee should be \nbalanced in its views and actions. It should not be led by ideological \nzeal on one single factor, inflation, and, I might say, the veiled \nthreat of inflation. There should also be a concern for the well-being \nof manufacturers and farmers and main street businesses and American \nfamilies and homeowners and car buyers.\n  So, Mr. President, I strongly urge the Federal Reserve to hold the \nline on interest rates, limit the damage they have already done to our \neconomy, and give us some good news today and say they are not raising \ninterest rates a seventh time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about the \nsubject that is before the Senate this week, and I suppose next week \nand possibly the week after, the balanced budget amendment. I think we \nwill have extended debate, probably longer than we need, some of which \nwill be to talk about options, some of which will be to talk in real \ndebate about differences in view, but much of it will simply be \ndesigned, I think, to delay action on what I think to be a very \nimportant issue. So, it will be difficult to focus on new information.\n  It seems to me there is a very basic question that has to be asked \nfirst, before all the detail is entered into and that is, is it morally \nand fiscally responsible to spend more than we take in? I think that is \nthe question that most Americans ask of their Government: Can we \ncontinue to spend more than we take in? Is it morally wrong to spend \nmore than we take in, to transfer that debt to someone in the future? I \nthink Americans ask, is it fiscally responsible to continue to spend \nmore than we take in? The answer, obviously, ``is no,'' it is not \nmorally responsible, it is not fiscally responsible. So, that is the \nbasic question. And most everyone would answer that the same.\n  Then we get into a great debate about how we do it. I support a \nbalanced budget amendment. I believe very strongly that it needs to be \ndone. I believe very strongly that it has worked in the States. What \nare the arguments against it? We hear them time and time again. One of \nthem is it is not needed. The evidence is it is needed. This Congress \nhas not balanced the budget. It has not balanced the budget in 26 years \nand only balanced it five times in 50 years.\n  So the evidence is that, sure, we can balance the budget. The fact is \nthat Congress does not. The fact is, it is a little easier to say we \nlike the programs; if we can put it on the credit card, we will do it. \nIf we have to pay for it, it is a different matter. Then it is a matter \nof setting up priorities. Then it is a matter of a cost-benefit ratio, \nand we hear, ``Here is what it costs. Here is the value.'' The decision \nmay be different than saying ``Here is the value. We do not have to pay \nfor it now.''\n  Some say it is not needed. I suggest that the evidence would indicate \nthat it is. Some say we already have the tools; we can do it this year. \nCertainly, that is true. Again, the evidence shows that that has not \nhappened. It is very difficult. I am persuaded that there needs to be a \nconstitutional discipline to balance the budget on a continuing basis.\n  Some say it is too strict, it is too confining. It does not need to \nbe. There are arrangements that in case of emergencies--some say in \ncase of war--it can be changed, of course. It can be changed by a vote \nor supermajority vote or written into the amendment that it is changed \nunder certain circumstances.\n  Again, I say to Members that almost all of the States in this country \nhave balanced budget amendments. In my State of Wyoming it is in the \nconstitution, and it is not troublesome for that reason. We heard an \nextended argument earlier this week on how courts and judges would be \ndeciding. The evidence does not show that in the area where we have had \na balanced budget amendment in the States. The courts do not do the \nbudgeting. That is, I think, not a good reason for not moving forward.\n  [[Page S1866]] Mr. President, the balanced budget amendment is one of \nthe several procedural changes that seem to me to be imperative. \nSeveral of the changes were clearly in the mind of voters in November, \nchanges that will have a long-term impact, not just on this year's \ndecisions in the Congress, but an impact on the way Congress behaves \nover time. That is the more important question.\n  We keep expecting different results and continue to use the same \nprocess. There is really little reason to expect that results will be \ndifferent if we continue to do the same thing. We need a forced \ndiscipline. We need an external constraint. I think that is true of \nmost political bodies, frankly. Politicians love to be able to provide \nprograms. Politicians love to be able to solve problems. Politicians \nsort of get to where they like to have problems to resolve for their \nconstituents. A man with a hammer thinks every problem is a nail.\n  We need some constraint, some constitutional discipline. The Federal \ndebt is nearly $5 trillion, over $18,000 for every person in this \ncountry. We spend $800-plus million per day in the gross interest \npayments.\n  So we have a moral imperative to balance the budget for people in \nWyoming and people in every other State. Families have to balance, \nbusinesses have to balance, States, by and large, have to balance, and \nthe Federal Government should have to balance as well and not pass off \nthe debt on its children and grandchildren.\n  Opponents say, ``We already have the tools.'' The evidence shows that \nwe do not. The Federal Government has spent more than it has taken in \nfor 55 of the last 63 years. Not a good record--not a good record--and \nnot a good basis for saying we do not need to do anything.\n  So, Mr. President, I am sure we will hear about draconian cuts. The \nfact is that what we have to do is slow the growth. We have been \nincreasing spending at 5 percent. Say we increase it only at 2 percent.\n  So I hope as we go forward, we can continue to make some points about \nthe balanced budget, but the bottom line is, should we do it and, if \nso, what has to take place to require that the balanced budget be used \nin the Congress and be used for Federal spending.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. President, oftentimes it is not appropriate to be \ncritical of a proposal unless you have a better solution. But I rise \ntoday to speak on the action of the administration which was announced \nyesterday regarding Mexico. In the opinion of the Senator from Alaska, \nthe administration simply did an end-run around Congress and the \nAmerican people when it unveiled its latest financing package for \nbailing out foreign investors in Mexico.\n  There is no question the President has the legal authority under the \nexchange stabilization fund to provide the $20 billion in loans and \nloan guarantees to the Mexican Government. However, I am concerned that \nthis establishes a dangerous precedent and represents a use of power by \nthe administration that was, in my opinion, unwarranted. It should be \nnoted that the potential of unilaterally using the emergency \nstabilization fund was not conveyed to many of the Members who were \ninvolved in working with the administration on the potential \nalternatives associated with this financial crisis.\n  In any event, it has been less than 6 weeks since the Mexican \nGovernment reversed its longstanding policy of maintaining a pegged \nvalue for the Mexican peso and devalued the peso by nearly 13 percent. \nThis devaluation plunged the Mexican stock and currency markets into a \npanic and a crisis that resulted in the peso dropping by more than 30 \npercent in a matter of just a few days.\n  It was at that point that the Clinton administration came forward and \noffered, first, a $6 billion credit line to Mexico in an effort to \nstabilize the currency. By January 3, Treasury saw fit to extend this \nline of credit to $9 billion and there were some other governments that \ncame in, and commercial banks, for another $9 billion. So there was \napproximately $18 billion available for stablizing the peso at that \ntime. I include the $6 billion I previously mentioned.\n  When I made an inquiry to the administration about this taxpayer-\nfinanced $9 billion credit line, I was assured that the American \ntaxpayer would not be at risk because the credit line was fully \ncollateralized by Mexico.\n  Since January 3 we have seen the peso crisis not abate. It only got \nworse. The peso dropped 45 percent in barely 1 month. This led the \nadministration to raise the specter of as much as a $40 billion credit \nline to stabilize the peso. And by yesterday, the size of the bailout \nhad grown another 25 percent to nearly $50 billion, with at least $20 \nbillion coming from U.S. participation.\n  The specifics of that participation, as indicated in a newspaper \narticle, suggests that commercial banks will be in for $3 billion; \nCanada, $1 billion; Latin American countries, $1 billion; the Bank for \nInternational Settlements, $10 billion; the International Monetary \nFund, $17.8 billion; and, as I have indicated, the United States \nTreasury, some $20 billion.\n  Why are we putting so much taxpayer money at risk? Who are we \ndefending and who are we bailing out with this taxpayer-financed line \nof credit? And how did Mexico fall into the crisis?\n  Mr. President I would note that most of this debt is represented by \nbearer bonds. That means whoever holds them basically owns them. It is \nlike owning a $100 bill. You can walk in and turn it into two 50's or \nfive 20's. The significance of that is it is very difficult to identify \nwho specifically holds those debt instruments.\n  What we have learned in the last month, however, is that this crisis \nhas not just happened overnight. It has been building for a year or \nmore. It was clearly foreseen by the United States and Mexican \nGovernments. In fact, the New York Times recently reported that United \nStates Treasury officials warned the Mexican Government as early as \nlast summer the country's foreign debt had become dangerously high and \nthat the peso was being maintained at an artificially high level.\n  But, for strictly internal political reasons, the Mexican Government \nchose to compound the crisis by continuing to print billions of pesos. \nAs far as I know they were printing them yesterday. They may still be \nprinting them today. Compounding the Mexican Government's mismanagement \nof its finances and its insatiable desire to maintain a strong peso and \nexcessive foreign imports, the Government allowed its foreign currency \nreserves to drop from $29 billion in February to less than $7 billion \nin December.\n  Now Mexico faces the daunting prospect of having to deal with foreign \ndebt redemptions that are listed at approximately $80 billion this \nyear, $39 billion of which is in the public sector. The significance of \nthat is that is debt that is falling due this year, not all at once \nthis year, but it will have to be met or refinanced this year. It is \nvery likely, when the guarantees are in force, the holders of these \nnotes, these bearer notes, are going to immediately want to convert \ntheir pesos into dollars and increase rather than decrease the capital \nflight out of Mexico.\n  If you and I held bearer notes in this crisis, what would be the \ninducement to hang on if the guarantees were there and we knew we could \nbe paid? A fiduciary responsibility would suggest the holder of those \nnotes would run in, cash them in, and take his or her principal and \nleave the country. The only consideration that might keep them \n[[Page S1867]]  there is the attractiveness of the high interest rates. \nThat rate may be in excess of 20 percent, which would certainly be an \ninducement.\n  But then the question is, Who are we bailing out? And the \nadministration has yet to address specifically who holds that debt. \nThey say the mutual funds hold the debt. The mutual funds are \nsophisticated investors. If they make an investment mistake, should the \ntaxpayer have the responsibility of bailing them out anymore than any \nother individual who makes a financial investment and looks for a \nreturn on that investment, and tries to measure the risk against the \ninducement which is the interest that he is generating on that \ninvestment?\n  If the risk is too great or the investment goes sour, obviously the \nalternative is you lose your principal. But that is not what is \nhappening here and that is why I am critical of this proposal.\n  I think there is a growing danger that the Mexican Government will \nhave to return to Washington before this year is out seeking another \n$10, $15, or perhaps $20 billion in taxpayer funds for a second \nbailout. We were told by the assistant to the President of Mexico that \nthe total debt of Mexico was about $180 billion, that the current debt \nwas something in the area of close to $80 billion, and now we are \ntalking about approximately a $50 billion guaranteed fund.\n  It is interesting to note that yesterday, Mr. Bill Seidman, former \nhead of the FDIC and the RTC, in testimony before the Senate Banking \nCommittee, indicated that the best way to resolve the Mexican financial \ncrisis was to have the Mexican Government sit down with its creditors \nand renegotiate the terms of the loans that are coming due this year. \nHe adamantly opposed a taxpayer bailout of speculators in Mexican debt. \nI believe Bill Seidman is absolutely right. Much of that Mexican debt \ncarries rates of interest of 25 to 40 percent.\n  Where can you get that today in the United States? You are not going \nto get it in your savings account or your mutual fund. There is \nassociated risk with the attractiveness of the investment and the \npotential return. Why should the American taxpayer dollars be used to \npay off this debt of 100 cents on the dollar plus interest when we do \nnot know who those holders are, other than the gray area of people who \nbought bearer notes or mutual funds, who made these risky investments \nsimply to attain a higher interest rate? If they can get the Federal \nGovernment to guarantee what we have done, they will be very, very \nhappy with such high interest rates.\n  Investors knew precisely what types of investments they were making. \nThey were speculating. They were almost junk bond type of investments. \nAnd for American taxpayer funds to be used to guarantee this investment \nis unconscionable in my opinion.\n  Mr. Seidman's suggestion is that the debtors and the creditors sit \ndown, the creditors being the holders, the debtors obviously being the \nMexican Government, to work something out. How does that work? It is \ndone all the time. I was a commercial banker for 25 years. If there is \nno blood in the turnip, if your borrower cannot pay, you sit down, you \ntry to work something out, and you reschedule the debt, and take 40, \n50, 60, or 70 cents on the dollar. You work something out. You just do \nnot let everything collapse. We have not given this process a chance to \nwork. I think we should.\n  Mr. President, yesterday the administration stated that the United \nStates will impose strict conditions on the assistance it provides with \na goal of ensuring that this package imposes no costs on the U.S. \ntaxpayer. As of today, I am not aware that any of my colleagues know \nprecisely what those conditions are. I have been involved in the \nmeetings. I would expect the administration will make those conditions \nknown, and I would encourage that they make them known before a single \nAmerican dollar is used to provide guarantees to the Government of \nMexico.\n  A factsheet released yesterday by the Treasury Department implies \nthat these loans will be collateralized with the proceeds from Mexican \noil exports. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, I asked the Treasury to \nspecifically identify how much of Pemex's revenue the Mexican \nGovernment has pledged, and how that revenue will be handled by United \nStates financial authorities; how much of it is pledged, because \nobviously you can only attach what is not pledged but still assignable. \nI believe that it is imperative that for every dollar in loans and loan \nguarantees, the Mexican Government has to come up with some way to make \na deposit of an equal amount of foreign hard currency in a Federal \nReserve bank account in the United States from their oil export \nrevenues.\n  I think the American taxpayer must be assured that so long as there \nare outstanding United States Government guarantees of Mexican debt, \nthat an amount equal to the debt is maintained under the control of our \nGovernment. Otherwise, we risk the real possibility that the current \nMexican Government or succeeding Governments could renounce the \ncollateral agreement with the United States and leave the American \ntaxpayer holding the bag. What are we going to do after these notes are \ncalled, so to speak, if the guarantees have to be delivered? We do not \nhave another monetary stabilization fund to go to.\n  The response I received when I made an inquiry from the Treasury \nDepartment regarding collateralization of this debt was completely \nunsatisfactory to me. It does not appear to me that the new agreement \nwill be any different, although I hope it will be. Under the previous \ndraft agreement, the Mexican Government is required to turn over the \nproceeds from its oil exports only--get this, Mr. President--turn over \nthe proceeds from its oil exports only in the event that the Mexican \nGovernment defaults on these bonds and only after such a default \noccurs. In other words, the Mexican Government would not establish an \nescrow account in the United States that can be immediately attached by \nthe United States Government in the event of default. Another way of \nsaying it is that there will be no collateral provided by the Mexican \nGovernment to offset the risk of default.\n  Mr. President, if we look at the structure of this, where we can only \ncall, if you will, on this process after the Government is in default, \nI assure you that the practicality of that is basically unworkable. It \nis simply naive to believe that if Mexico, after receiving some $50 \nbillion in loan guarantees from the United States Government and the \nIMF, faces a default on these bonds in the future, that it will have \nthe political will and capacity to turn its oil revenues over to the \nUnited States Government. At that time, if the Government defaults, it \nis everyone for himself. The demands internally in Mexico will dictate \nthat there will never be realistically a fund set up for the oil \nrevenues, if indeed default occurs.\n  It does not take much imagination to know that, if in the future, \nMexico faces default on United States Government-backed bonds, the \nentire Mexican economy will surely be in political, social, and \neconomic chaos that will only be exacerbated by being forced to turn \nover its oil receipts to its neighbor in the north.\n  Let us be realistic. What caused this problem is too much debt. We \nhave other nations that are friendly to us that have too much debt. \nCanada from the north would be the first to admit that.\n  What I fear is that, if such an economic crisis were to occur in the \nfuture in Mexico, the United States, having already put its $20 billion \nat risk, basically, would simply have to extend further credit lines to \nMexico in order to stave off the political crisis that will be evident \nin that country. In other words, if we start down the line of extending \n$20 billion to Mexico, we are laying the foundation for future bailouts \nthat I think will put even more American taxpayer money at risk.\n  Mr. President, before we extend $20 billion of credit to Mexico, we \nmust have ironclad guarantees of internal economic reforms in Mexico, \nand I would like to see 100 percent collateralization of the loan.\n  Finally, Mr. President, it struck me during the entire negotiations \nthat the best way to have handled this would have been to propose a \nguarantee on a percentage, if you will, of the current term debt that \nMexico is exposed to. \n[[Page S1868]]  Let us assume that we were to guarantee $40 billion of \nthe $50 billion and require that the holders of the debt stay in on the \nbalance, that other $10 billion. In other words, we would have been \nfirst out with a guarantee; the holders would have been last out. The \nexplanation given as to why that was unworkable is we did not know who \nthe holders of the debt were. I do not totally accept that. I think, \nhad we waited, we could have forced the holders of that debt to come \nforward and make a proposal that they would stay in for a portion of \ntheir participation in return for the U.S. Government guarantee.\n  So that was my suggestion, which was recognized but rejected under \nthe explanation that it was impossible to know who the holders of the \ndebt were and, therefore, they could not proceed with that kind of an \narrangement.\n  So time will tell, Mr. President, just what the risk to the U.S. \ntaxpayer is. But this Senator is very concerned about the agreement \nthat was made, and I felt an obligation to present my views to my \ncolleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] is recognized to speak for up to \n10 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/01/senate-section/article/S1866-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1868]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNITION OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there is almost nothing in Government \nworse than to have people do significant work and get almost no credit \nfor it. So today, as the Federal Reserve Board once again closets \nitself in its concrete temple, locks its door, goes in the secret room, \nand makes decisions about interest rates that every single American \nwill pay, I figured maybe we ought to give credit to those who are \ngoing to do the work and cast the votes. I do not know what is going to \nbe announced in the next couple of hours, but I am told by almost \neverybody who thinks they know that the Federal Reserve Board will \nincrease interest rates for the seventh time in less than a year; for \nthe seventh time in less than a year they will increase people's \nmortgage rates.\n  I met a fellow the other day who said, ``I am paying $115 more now \nfor my home mortgage now because of the Fed.'' In the past year, the \nFederal Reserve has increased people's interest rates on credit cards \nand has increased the Federal Government's deficit by $125 billion over \n5 years just to pay the interest on the debt.\n  So they take action that has a significant impact on this country. I \nwant to tell the American people who they are. Lord, it seems to me if \nyou are doing work this important, you at least need to get credit for \nit. Let me tell the American people who is going to do this today. This \nis the Federal Reserve Board on this chart, the top line of pictures. \nThese people are all appointed by the President and confirmed by the \nSenate. So they go through the Senate for confirmation. But they are \njoined in that room--which the public is kept out of, by the way--by \npresidents of the Federal Reserve banks in the country, the regional \nFederal banks.\n  These people are not appointed by the President. They are not \nconfirmed by the Senate. But they are going to go into the room on a \nrotating basis. There will be five of them in that room today who will \nactually cast votes on monetary policy and interest rates. They are not \nappointed by anybody, not confirmed by anybody. They owe their jobs to \nthe regional Federal Reserve bank boards of directors, the majority of \nwhom are their local bankers. These folks will go into the room \nrepresenting the local bankers' interests. They will take action to \nincrease interest rates for this country.\n  The four, today, who will vote--it is a rotating vote--are Mr. \nMcDonough from New York, Kathy Minehan from Boston, Michael Moskow from \nChicago, Tom Melzer from St. Louis, and Tom Hoenig from Kansas City. \nThey will, with the Board of Governors, cast votes.\n  Let me, without being disrespectful, say this--and I emphasize that I \nam not being disrespectful. I do not have any idea what is in their \nheads down at the Federal Reserve Board. I would like to have those \nheads examined to find out what facts are rattling around in those \nheads that persuade these people that there is a new wave of inflation \nsomewhere on the horizon. What persuades them to put the brakes on the \nAmerican economy? Who has appointed them to become human brake pads to \ndecide to slow down the American economy? And whose divine notion is it \nthat unemployment in America should never fall below 5 percent, and \neconomic growth should apparently never go above 2\\1/2\\, 3 percent. \nWhere on Earth did these notions come from?\n  If this country faced credible inflation problems, I would not be \nhere at all criticizing the Federal Reserve Board. We have had four \nsuccessive years of decreasing inflation. There is no--I emphasize no--\ncredible evidence that we have a new wave of inflation on the horizon. \nYet, today, and again, if the pundits are correct, the Federal Reserve \nBoard will take one more step that most surely will put the brakes on \nthe economic progress we have seen and probably move this country \ntoward a recession.\n  This is not a newfound concern of mine. The Federal Reserve Board \noperates by itself, in secret, and no, I am not saying let us put \npolitics in monetary policy. I am not saying give to it the Senator \nfrom Utah to handle or the Senator from North Dakota or my colleagues \nin the Senate or the House. But here is a copy of the Constitution. The \ncopy of the Constitution begins with these three words: ``We the \npeople''--not we the bankers, the central bankers or we the Federal \nReserve, but ``We the people.'' A question this important, that affects \neconomic growth in this country and the pocketbook of every single \nAmerican, and especially coming at a time when all of the credible \nevidence would seem to me to imply that the Fed's policies are wrong, \nleads me again to ask the question: Why does this continue? By whose \nauthority does this continue?\n  I hope one day soon that we will discover a Federal Reserve Board \nthat understands that you have two twin economic goals in America. Yes, \ntwo: price stability, absolutely, which has been a goal in this country \nfor decades. Price stability and full employment. Price stability and \neconomic growth are the twin economic goals in this country, only one \nof which this board cares much about. And even at that, when it cares \nabout price stability, it fights the wrong fight at the wrong time.\n  I have young children who look for dragons under their bed at night \nbecause they hear noises and they wonder where does it come from, where \ndoes it lurk? Then they read books like Tony the Dragon. When you look \nat all of the credible evidence, where are the dragons this board looks \nfor? What fights does the Fed wage, that it wins because it has no \nopponent?\n  I hope one of these days the American people will get better news \nfrom that Federal agency, that dinosaur that still operates in secret \nwhen the watchword of American democracy is ``openness.'' Maybe one day \nthere will be enough of us here who care and enough of us here who \nthink alike to believe that reform--yes, reform--ought to touch this \ninstitution as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/01/senate-section/article/S1868-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1868-S1869]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           A CALL FOR REFORM\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me turn to one other quick item. I am \ngoing to speak about this at greater length later. But I want to touch \non it today, because I have watched with amazement in recent days \nreformers, people who say let us tip everything upside down and shake \nit, let us change it, let us reform it.\n  Among that call for reform, joined by many Governors in our country, \nis a plea by those folks that what we ought to do is decide the Federal \nGovernment cannot do anything right, and State governments do \neverything right, and we ought to have a massive transfer of money, a \nsubstantial transfer of resources between the States and the Federal \nGovernment, moving, of course, from the Federal Government to the \nStates.\n  I am willing to concede that the Federal Government has too much \nwaste; it is too bureaucratic, too big. The Clinton administration has \ntaken action to downsize it. One hundred thousand people who used to \nwork for the Federal Government are not working for the Federal \nGovernment anymore. At the end of 2 more years, it will be 250,000 \npeople; 250,000 jobs will have \n[[Page S1869]]  been eliminated. That is downsizing in a real way.\n  I reject the notion somehow that is being thrown around by the \nreformers, especially by Governors, who come out with press conferences \nand television lights and put on a big brassy show and say, ``Here are \n250 programs you ought to abolish. Throw all the funding for these \nprograms into a block grant and send us a check.'' These are the very \nsame Governors who are back home busting their buttons, boasting about \nall the tax cuts back home. They have the gall and brass to come to \nWashington and say all the things you have done and all that money--\nsend us the money and with no directions. Put it in something called a \nblock grant, and we will take care of it.\n  Is there no priority for child nutrition in this country? Is that not \nimportant? They are asking us to put funding for things like WIC, and \nother programs dealing with children, in a block grant and send it back \nto the Governors. We're supposed to let the Governors work with local \nbusiness interests on economic development grants. If the Governor \nwants to use the money to help a company from another State build a \nmanufacturing plant in his State, that is, we are told, just fine. Let \nus let them make those decisions there, because we do not have a \nnational priority on the subject or the issue of child nutrition.\n  Well, the fact is we do have a priority. We have established a \npriority over a long period of time. And I am one who does not believe \nthat we ought to decide that get rid of those priorities that have been \npriorities for a long, long time. We should not just load them up into \none big block to send to Governors and say, ``We will make you a deal. \nWe will raise the taxes and then we will send money to you and you \nfigure out how you might want to spend it, while all the while you are \nboasting back home you are cutting State taxes.''\n  You want the real conservative answer, Governors, the real answer, \nthen raise the money yourself and spend it yourself.\n  There is no better way to create fiscal irresponsibility than for one \nlevel of Government to raise the money and another level of Government \nto spend the money.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. We need to talk through this at some length, Mr. \nPresident. Because I wonder whether I am the only one that thinks that \nit is a little strange to have people rush into town to say, on the one \nhand, that the Federal Government cannot do anything right, and on the \nother that they would like to continue to have our money. People are \ntelling us to just send the money to the States and let them spend it.\n  The whole principle of the unfunded mandates bill, which we just \npassed here on the Senate floor, was that those who raise the money \nshould decide how to spend the money. Governors and mayors were \ncomplaining mightily that we in Washington violate this principle.\n  Even as we dealt with the unfunded mandates bill, it was interesting \nto me that in many jurisdictions they were busy hooking their hose to \nthe Federal tank, siphoning money out of here with bogus plans, such as \nthe provider tax under Medicaid and others.\n  Well, reform works both ways. Responsibility works both ways. And I \nhope one of these days we can have a thoughtful discussion about who \ndoes what better, which things are important, which must be saved, \nwhich must take priority. I think there is room for all of us to have a \nthoughtful discussion about this, and I intend to say more about it in \nthe days ahead.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BRADLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, anyone attuned to the news over the past \n6 weeks has been subjected to a daily barrage of articles and \nstatements on Mexico's economic crisis. We read of devaluations, \nfloats, and market slides. We hear of lines of credit, loan guarantees, \nIMF programs, and conditionality. We follow the daily barometers of \nPresident Clinton, Secretary Rubin, Majority Leader Dole, and \nCongressman Leach.\n  What we have not been getting, however, is an adequate sense of the \nsocial and political context for Mexico's troubles. But Mexico is not \njust an economist's case history. Mexico is a country, with people and \nhistory. Unless we understand how the current financial crunch grew out \nof and, in turn, affects Mexico's political and social dynamics, we \nwill not be capable of developing a response that works for Mexico or \nin the Congress for us.\n  The financial dimensions of the Mexico problem are well understood. \nLike many developing countries--such as the United States in the 19th \nand early 20th centuries--Mexico imports foreign capital to finance \ngrowth. However, because of its relatively low domestic savings rate, \nMexico's appetite for foreign capital is exceptionally high. In a \nsense, Mexico is similar to the United States in the 1980's, financing \ninvestment from the savings of foreigners. In 1994, for example, Mexico \nimported a net $28 billion in foreign capital, 8 percent of its GDP.\n  Less than half of that $28 billion was invested in productive assets, \nsuch as plant and machinery. The rest was volatile portfolio \ninvestment, known with justification as hot money. What made this money \neven hotter was the fact that much was invested in short-term debt that \nmatures in bunches. As a result, the Mexican Government must find the \nresources to redeem or rollover around $52 billion in debt in 1995.\n  Mexico, like any other country, can attract capital from abroad only \nas long as investors remain confident that the return compensates for \nthe perceived risk. This requires investor confidence in Mexico's \neconomic, political, and social stability. It also requires relatively \nhigh interest rates, declining inflation, and a stable currency--in \nother words, relatively high return for relatively low risk.\n  The Salinas government in the late 80's cut their internal budget \ndeficit by the equivalent of three Gramm-Rudmans. Inflation plummeted, \nprivatization exploded. Protectionist barriers and government subsidies \ncame tumbling down. Mexico pursued a strong peso policy both as an end \nin itself and as a symbol of the new Mexico. This led the Salinas \ngovernment to resist the economic forces that threatened to push the \npeso down and, in the short run, it was successful.\n  Just over a year ago, the North American Free-Trade Agreement came \ninto force and gave a huge boost to investor confidence in Mexico. \nHowever, on the very day NAFTA took effect--January 1, 1994--the \nZapatista revolt began in Mexico's Chiapas State. That revolt was an \nattack on democratic forces from the left. Thus began a year in which \nsocial and political, as well as economic, events undermined investor \nconfidence in Mexico. As the year unfolded, we witnessed the \nassassination of the ruling party Presidential candidate, and the \nassassination of the ruling party secretary-general amid allegations of \ninvolvement by party dinosaurs. These were attacks on democratic forces \nin Mexico from the right.\n  At the same time, the peso came under increasing economic pressure as \nthe PRI-dominated Government turned on the fiscal and monetary taps for \nthe elections to win the first really contested election in Mexico's \nhistory.\n  There was another joker in the pack, one the Mexican Government could \nnot control. That was the Federal Reserve's decision to raise United \nStates interest rates. The higher yields made American securities more \nattractive relative to Mexican securities. Because a high percentage of \nthe capital flowing into Mexico came not from banks, as in the 1970's \nand 1980's, but from mutual funds and pension funds, the impact of \nhigher American rates was magnified.\n  According to a study by Guillermo Calvo, professor of economics at \nthe University of Maryland, much of the mutual fund money that flowed \ninto Mexico came more as a response to lower interest rates in the \nUnited \n[[Page S1870]]  States than as a result of a profound understanding of \nMexican economic fundamentals. When interest rates rose in the United \nStates during 1994, this money was ready to bolt out of Mexico.\n  So, when the Zapatistas moved again last December, jittery foreign \ninvestors began converting their money into dollars and taking it out \nof the country. Mexico's foreign reserves melted away. The Government \nbotched the resulting peso devaluation. The markets smelled fear, and \nthe rout was on.\n  Governments and international financial institutions, viewing the \nproblem as a liquidity crunch, have prescribed standard fiscal and \nmonetary responses, which are designed to reduce domestic consumption \nand make exports more competitive by lowering real wages. In other \nwords, the economists are prescribing recession to reduce the demand \nfor foreign capital.\n  That is why the economists oppose political conditionality so \nstrongly. For inserting a requirement that Mexico's wages rise in line \nwith productivity or that Mexico try to repeg the peso at 3.5 to the \ndollar destroys the economic underpinning for eventual recovery.\n  However, the economic cure ignores Mexico's political and social \ncontext. It ignores both the pacto which lay at the heart of the \nMexican model, and the new social pact upon which President Zedillo \nbased his legitimacy.\n  Ernesto Zedillo was elected head of state of a country exhausted by a \ndecade of economic reform--three Gramm-Rudmans in a matter of 4 or 5 \nyears--and hungry for justice. He took over a population unwilling to \ncontinue to sacrifice for the benefit of others.\n  Zedillo promised the Mexican masses a share in the prosperity bought \nwith their sacrifice. He promised more open politics and an overhauled \njustice system. He promised a secondary education to the 45 million \nMexicans under age 19. In short, unlike Boris Yeltsin in Russia, he \npromised his people a vision.\n  However, Zedillo's vision threatened old-line entrenched interests in \nMexico. It threatened an end to the old PRI-government gravy train. \nSince Zedillo does not head an old-style Leninist party, he lacks the \nbrute party power of his predecessors to override opposition and \nimplement his vision. In fact, he is presiding at the time when a \nregime is in greatest danger, the time when it tries to reform.\n  The only way to square the circle is economic growth, not just the 5 \npercent necessary to create a million jobs a year, but enough to spread \nthe benefits to the masses and at the same time buy off the party \ndinosaurs, who would like nothing more than to regain their subsidies \nand deny the people a real voice. This growth was the instrument \npromised by NAFTA. It is the instrument which the crisis has taken out \nof Zedillo's hands. Having lost the instrument, Zedillo will be hard \npressed to restore the vision.\n  We see the erosion already. Chiapas is active. The opposition PRD \nparty has taken new life. As have the PRI dinosaurs. For example, when \nPresident Zedillo concluded a pact with three opposition parties that \nwould have removed the PRI Governors of Chiapas and Tabasco States, who \nwon disputed elections, the Governor of Tabasco brought his supporters \ninto the streets. When President Zedillo was scheduled to announce the \nnew social compact, the industrialists and labor leaders balked, \nforcing him to cancel a nationwide TV address and reveal the extent of \nhis obligation.\n  This, then, is the context for the loan guarantee debate. How can the \nMexican Government negotiate the fine line between financial meltdown \nand social-political meltdown? Let me suggest a few guidelines.\n  First, the United States needed to act quickly to shore up Mexico's \nfinancial system. The President has acted because the Congress delayed. \nIf Mexico's financial system collapses, there is no hope of generating \nthe needed growth, now or in the future. The President's support \npackage is not to bail out Wall Street, or even individual American \ninvestors, but to give Mexico the chance to grow into social and \npolitical stability and become an even better market for American \nexports that create American jobs.\n  If Mexico's financial system collapsed because the Americans reneged \non a promise--if having announced the $40 billion loan guarantees, the \nadministration was unable to deliver anything--we would have put at \nrisk a decade of changing Mexican attitudes toward the United States. \nWe would have confirmed Mexico's traditional anti-Americanism that is \nnow latent, but still lurks just beneath the surface.\n  Now we have a support package, we have a support package. But that \npackage only buys time. It is up to the Mexican Government to put that \ntime to work to generate popular support for the continued sacrifices \nnecessary to overcome this financial setback.\n  So the second step must be for the Mexican Government to return \ndecisionmaking on Mexico's economy to Mexico City. The Mexican \nGovernment must develop, announce, and implement itself a plan to pull \nMexico through the crisis and prevent this problem from happening \nagain.\n  That plan must not simply prescribe recession as the cure for \nMexico's current account ills. It must hold out a way to grow and \nreduce the risk of hot money at the same time. Otherwise, Mexico is \nconsigned to a continuing cycle of recession and currency crisis--\nsocial crisis and economic crisis.\n  To grow without generating a crisis, Mexico must finance more of its \ngrowth itself. That means the Mexican Government plan must increase \nMexico's savings rate. The Asian dragons, for example, enjoy sources of \ndomestically generated capital resulting from savings rates twice as \nhigh as Mexico's.\n  The Government plan must also encourage foreign direct investment \nover portfolio investment. Investment in productive assets both implies \nan understanding of the underlying fundamentals that reduces volatility \nand is more difficult to pull out with a panicked phone call.\n  There are many ways to do this, as countries as diverse as Chile, \nIndonesia, and Thailand have shown. Capital controls, however, are not \nan option. The means to shift the balance in favor of foreign direct \ninvestment must increase the integration of the Mexican economy, not \nits isolation.\n  It should be clear that this plan cannot be dictated by Washington. \nNo Mexican Government can allow Washington to load up support with a \nwish-list of conditions and still generate the popular support required \nto carry it out. If we need a support package to make the economic plan \nwork, we need a clean package to let the economic plan work.\n  Third, and finally, the Mexican Government must broaden its \nlegitimacy among the Mexican people. Only democracy or dictatorship \nwill see Mexico through the sacrifices President Zedillo will be asking \nof his people. Mexicans who are asked to sacrifice for the good of the \nsystem will also want a say in that system. Zedillo made an important \nstatement with his four-party pact to open up the political system, but \nmay be backing away in the face of resistance from the dinosaurs. That \nsimply cannot happen.\n  There are those who say that we can contain the fallout if Mexico \ngoes belly up, that, despite dire predictions of systemic risk, this is \na problem, not an emerging market problem. Mexico's crisis results from \nthe market's misjudging of the balance between risk and reward in \nMexico's financial markets, this argument goes. An investment that was \nprofitable in, for example, the Philippines 2 months ago should still \nbe profitable.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Unfortunately, our vulnerability is deeper than this. \nMany emerging markets have gotten out of control and are due for a \nreadjustment. Investors have been blinded by high returns in many \ndeveloping countries.\n  Thus far, outside of Mexico, investors are merely chastened, not \npanicked. We can expect to see a sounder evaluation of the risk-reward \ntrade off that will play out over time. But, if Mexico melts down, we \ncould well see the bubble burst in a global withdrawal from emerging \nmarkets. We and our OECD partners are not equipped to handle a \nworldwide panic that would produce a collapse in the fastest growing \nexport market we now have and, prospectively, the biggest source of \ncontinued worldwide growth.\n  [[Page S1871]] So it is not only investors and developing countries \nwho should view Mexico as a wake up call. We in the OECD and the \ninternational financial institutions must begin now to put in place the \ninstitutional arrangements to handle the next Mexico. The United States \nsimply cannot be the permanent ad hoc lender of last resort.\n  The current Mexico faces a long road as it pursues democratization \nand economic reform. During the NAFTA debate, we heard why Mexico's \nsuccess is important to us in the United States. We need a stable, \ndemocratic and prosperous neighbor to our south for reasons of our own \nstability, democracy, and prosperity.\n  Nothing that has happened since December 20 has changed that \ncalculation. We cannot turn our backs on Mexico, and Mexico cannot lose \nfaith with itself.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Grams].\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/01/senate-section/article/S1869-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution.\n  Last November, the American people sent a message loud and clear to \nWashington. I know first-hand, having heard this message in cafes and \ntown hall meetings all across the State of Minnesota.\n  It is a simple message, with all the wisdom and common sense of the \npeople who sent it. And yet, it is a message that Congress has failed \nto heed until this year.\n  It is time to change the way Congress taxes and spends the people's \nmoney.\n  This message is the same, whether I hear from parents worried about \nthe economic future of their children, workers who fear the impact of \nthe deficit on their jobs, or families who manage each year to balance \ntheir own books.\n  Cut spending, balance the Federal budget, and start getting this \ncountry out of debt. Mr. President, the balanced budget amendment is \nthe first step on the long journey toward restoring fiscal sanity to \nWashington.\n  Mr. President, the statistics are clear: Our Nation currently faces a \n$4\\1/2\\ trillion debt. That means every child born in America is \nimmediately saddled with nearly $20,000 in debt. And at the rate we are \ngoing, these numbers increase every year, taking with them the future \nof our children.\n  If America were a business, it would have been forced into bankruptcy \nyears ago, with each Member of Congress liable for breach of duty. In \nprevious centuries, there was a place for those who made a habit of \nspending more than they brought in: it was called debtor's prison. \nToday, it is called Congress.\n  Now, some in this body would argue that there is no need for a \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution. And they might have a \ncase if we were talking about anyone else but Congress. After all, \nthere are laws all over the books to prevent the accumulation of \nunmanageable debt.\n  But what happens when those who break the laws are those who make the \nlaws? Simple. They ignore them.\n  Only the Constitution and the moral authority it represents will \nforce Congress to do what it is supposed to do, what we were elected to \ndo.\n  And only by passing a balanced budget amendment can we hope to show \nthe American people that we will do our job and carry out the mandate \nthey delivered last November.\n  Minnesotans have joined me in calling for a balanced budget \namendment. It is not a new concept in our State. In fact, the first \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution was sponsored in the \n1930's by--not surprisingly--a Minnesotan, Congressman Harold Knutson. \nBut like so many balanced budget amendments after it, it was left to \ndie in committee.\n  Well today, more than 50 years later, we have the opportunity to \ncomplete Representative Knutson's work. And his idea that was good in \nthe 1930's is still good today, and it ought to become part of the \nConstitution.\n  In following the balanced budget amendment, however, we must be \ncareful that our efforts to balance the budget come through cuts in \nspending and not tax increases. Taxpayers did not cause the budget \ndeficit, Congress did, and it would be unfair, unjust and unwise to \ncover up the irresponsible behavior of Congress by punishing taxpayers, \nthrough new taxes or higher taxes.\n  For that reason, I introduced my own version of the balanced budget \namendment which requires that any legislation to increase taxes be \napproved by a three-fifths supermajority vote. It is based on the \nidea--unheard of in Washington--that it should be more difficult to tax \naway the people's hard-earned dollars then to spend them.\n  By requiring a supermajority vote, my legislation would protect \ntaxpayers and put the burden on Congress to come up with the cuts.\n  While I prefer this version of the balanced budget amendment, I do \nnot believe the perfect should be the enemy of the good. We can have a \nconstitutional limitation on tax increases, and I plan to work with the \nchairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee to pass one.\n  But that can come at a later date. The House has scheduled a vote on \nsuch an amendment for April 15 of next year. I will urge the Senate to \nfollow suit.\n  Believe me, we will pass a taxpayer protection clause to the \nConstitution. But let us pass the balanced budget amendment first.\n  And to those who might try to derail the balanced budget amendment, \nthrough killer amendments or parliamentary tactics, I ask you to think \ntwice. I ask you to think about the impact that continued deficit \nspending will have on our economy, on the people's faith in their \nGovernment, and most importantly, on our children. Because it's their \nfuture we're mortgaging away with every new governmental program, with \nevery additional dollar of debt we rack up.\n  When I decided to run for Congress, I did so because I was frustrated \nwith the way our Government was being run.\n  Growing up on a dairy farm in Minnesota--where we did not have a lot \nof money, where we worked hard and cleaned our plates--taught me a lot \nof lessons about life. Most importantly, it taught me the fundamental \nprinciple that you should not spend what you do not have.\n  What kind of lessons are we teaching our children when Congress \nspends this country $4\\1/2\\ trillion in debt and what will their future \nbe like when they are forced to pay off our bills?\n  I do not want my kids or grandkids to grow up wondering why we left \nthem holding the bag.\n  We have to do something now. And the balanced budget amendment is the \nfirst step.\n  For those reasons, I urge my colleagues to pass the balanced budget \namendment without delay. Because every second we push this vote off is \nanother dollar we take away from our kids. And our kids deserve better, \nour country deserves better.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/01/senate-section/article/S1871-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1871-S1872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, many of us in the Senate on both sides of \nthe aisle support an increase in the minimum wage, and it is clear that \nthe vast majority of the American people support an increase, too.\n  Last month, the Los Angeles Times conducted a poll of citizens across \nthe country. As the results demonstrate, raising the minimum wage has \nextraordinarily high support across the entire spectrum of income \ngroups, political party, and every other category, with the possible \nexception of the House Republican leadership.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the Los Angeles Times poll will be of \ninterest to all of us in Congress, and I ask unanimous consent that it \nmay be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the poll was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n       As you may know, the federal minimum wage is currently \n     $4.25 an hour. Do you favor increasing the minimum wage, or \n     decreasing it, or keeping it the same?

DAVID ELTON TRUEBLOOD\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, this past Saturday, January 28, in \nRichmond, IN, 150 persons from around the world gathered at Earlham \nCollege's Stout Meetinghouse for a memorial service in honor of one of \nthe 20th century America's most prominent religious leaders, Dr. David \nElton Trueblood. Dr. Trueblood, professor-at-large emeritus at Earlham, \ndied on December 20, 1994 at Lansdale, PA. He was 94 years of age.\n  Dr. Trueblood was no stranger to the Senate. He first served as the \nguest chaplain of the Senate in August 1972. I was pleased to serve as \nthe cosponsor, along with his former Earlham student, our late \ncolleague Senator John East of North Carolina, for Dr. Trueblood's \nsecond visit with us as guest chaplain on the National Day of Prayer, \nMay 3, 1984. In addition, Mr. President, Dr. Trueblood was a close and \nvalued personal friend of long standing to our colleague, Senator Mark \nHatfield. The two men first met as Stanford University in 1946, when \nDr. Trueblood was serving as the chaplain of that great institution and \nSenator Hatfield was a young graduate student there.\n  Although he was born on a small farm near Indianola, IA, in 1900, \nElton Trueblood had deep Indiana roots. His Quaker ancestors left North \nCarolina, where they had settled in 1682, and moved to Washington \nCounty, IN, in 1815. The Truebloods were part of the great migration of \nantislavery Quakers from the slaveholding States of the South to the \nincreasingly abolitionist States of the North in the decades before the \nCivil War.\n  By the time that Dr. Trueblood joined Earlham's faculty as professor \nof philosophy in 1946, he had already established a distinguished \nacademic career and a growing national reputation as a religious writer \nand speaker. After graduating from Iowa's William Penn College, he had \nearned the graduate degree of bachelor of systematic theology from \nHarvard University in 1926. He was awarded his doctor of philosophy \ndegree from the Johns Hopkins University in 1934.\n  It was during Dr. Trueblood's studies at Johns Hopkins University \nthat his career in the academic and religious worlds began to intersect \nwith the Nation's political life. While completing his doctorate at \nJohns Hopkins, Dr. Trueblood served as the clerk of the Baltimore \nyearly meeting of the Religious Society of Friends. Already in demand \nas a preacher, Dr. Trueblood was invited to deliver the sermon at a \nQuaker meeting in Washington, DC. In the congregation that day was the \nfirst Quaker to become President of the United States, Herbert Hoover. \nThat first encounter led to a long friendship between the two men which \nculminated in Dr. Trueblood's delivery of the eulogy at President \nHoover's funeral some 35 years later.\n  After completing his doctoral studies at Johns Hopkins, Dr. Trueblood \naccepted teaching assignments at Guilford College, in North Carolina, \nand then at Haverford College, in Pennsylvania. After a temporary \nassignment as the acting chaplain of Harvard, Dr. Trueblood became the \nchaplain of Stanford University in 1936. He held a dual faculty \nappointment at Stanford as professor of philosophy.\n  The friendship between Herbert Hoover and Elton Trueblood blossomed \nwhen Dr. Trueblood arrived at the Stanford campus, to which President \nHoover had moved after he left the White House in 1933. When President \nHoover died in 1964, the Hoover family called Dr. Trueblood back from a \nround-the-world cruise to conduct the memorial services for the former \nPresident in West Branch, IA. After flying back to the United States \nfrom Saigon, Dr. Trueblood delivered a stirring eulogy to the 31st \nPresident before the 75,000 persons gathered for the funeral services \non a hillside overlooking the Hoover Library.\n  When, in 1946, Dr. Trueblood received his offer to come to Earlham in \nIndiana, he faced a difficult decision. He enjoyed the prestige of a \ntenured full professorship at one of the Nation's leading universities. \nHe was, as I noted, also Stanford's chaplain and the close friend and \nneighbor of former President Hoover. Yet Dr. Trueblood yearned for a \nsmaller educational institution, for a return to his Quaker roots, and \nfor greater freedom to pursue his writing and public speaking. And so, \nMr. President, Dr. Trueblood accepted Earlham's offer, a decision about \nwhich he wrote in an article entitle ``Why I Chose a Small College'' \nfor Reader's Digest.\n  After his arrival at Earlham in 1946, Dr. Trueblood's career as a \nreligious writer and speaker earned him growing national following. \nSeveral years later, he was invited to speak in Washington, DC, before \na church congregation that included President Dwight Eisenhower. \nPresident Eisenhower later invited Dr. Trueblood to the Oval Office at \nthe White House. Ultimately, President Eisenhower asked Dr. Trueblood \nto join his administration as the Director of Religious Information for \nthe U.S. Information Agency.\n  During the Eisenhower administration, Elton Trueblood developed a \nfriendship with the young man who would be the second Quaker to become \nPresident of the United States. The young man was Vice President \nRichard Nixon. Dr. Trueblood and Vice President Nixon stayed in regular \ncontact after Dr. Trueblood returned to Earlham and throughout Mr. \nNixon's post-Vice-Presidential years in California and New York.\n  After Mr. Nixon took office as President in 1969, he honored Dr. \nTrueblood by inviting him to speak at the Sunday \n[[Page S1873]]  religious services held regularly in the White House. \nWhen the 1972 Republican National Convention nominated him for a second \nterm as\n President, Mr. Nixon turned to Elton Trueblood to give the invocation.\n\n  As a man of character and faith, Dr. Trueblood believed deeply in \nloyalty to his friends. Throughout the ordeal of the Watergate scandal, \nDr. Trueblood offered his friend, President Nixon, religious solace and \nadvice in private. When, in August 1974, Mr. Nixon reached his decision \nto resign, the President called Dr. Trueblood at Earlham to tell him \nabout the action that he finally had concluded that he must take.\n  The author of three dozen books, Dr. Trueblood was a world renowned \nwriter. Perhaps the book for which he is best known was published the \nsame year in which President Nixon resigned. Bringing his deep \nappreciation for the nexus between the spiritual life and the world of \npolitics to its most creative fruition, Dr. Trueblood published \n``Abraham Lincoln: Theologian of American Anguish.''\n  Critically acclaimed, Dr. Trueblood's study of President Lincoln's \nreligious life became a great inspiration to numerous political \nleaders. President Gerald Ford kept a copy in his Oval Office. First \nLady Nancy Reagan spoke of being deeply moved by Dr. Trueblood's \nLincoln book when she found it in the White House Library. I am proud \nto say, Mr. President, that Elton Trueblood's ``Abraham Lincoln'' \ngraces my own bookshelf as well.\n  After an extraordinary career, Dr. Trueblood ended 42 years of \nservice to Earlham College and the Nation when he retired to \nPennsylvania in 1988. Today, Mr. President, Elton Trueblood is back \nhome again in Indiana. Following Saturday's memorial service at \nEarlham, his ashes were interred in the outer wall of his beloved \nTeague Library on the Earlham campus.\n  Mr. President, another of Dr. Trueblood's former Earlham College \nstudents, Steven R. Valentine, served as a Deputy Assistant Attorney \nGeneral in the Reagan and Bush administrations and is now the general \ncounsel to our colleague, Senator Robert Smith of New Hampshire. Mr. \nValentine traveled to Richmond, IN for the memorial services on January \n28. He remembers Dr. Trueblood ``as not only a man of extraordinary \nintellect, but as a person with a great heart. Elton Trueblood has a \nbeautiful eternal soul,'' Mr. Valentine says, ``and as I think of him \nnow, I recall his words of Shakespeare:''\n\n     [A]nd, when he shall die,\n     Take him and cut him out in little stars,\n     And he will make the face of heaven so fine\n     That all the world will be in love with night,\n     And pay no worship to the garish sun.\n\n   Mr. President, before he died, Elton Trueblood chose, as the \nconvenor of his Quaker memorial service, another distinguished Indiana \neducator. Dr. Landrum Bolling, whom Dr. Trueblood brought to Earlham to \nteach political science, became the president of Earlham College in \n1958. He left Earlham in 1973 to become the president of Lilly \nEndowment in Indianapolis, IN, and later served as the chairman of the \nCouncil on Foundations.\n  In connection with his service as the convenor of Dr. Trueblood's \nmemorial service, Dr. Bolling wrote a short biographical sketch of \nElton Trueblood, which was printed and distributed to all in \nattendance. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print that \nbiographical summary in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       David Elton Trueblood--December 12, 1900-December 20, 1994\n\n                        (By Landrum R. Bolling)\n\n       Dr. David Elton Trueblood, author, educator, philosopher, \n     and theologian, endowed with special gifts and holder of many \n     honors, bestowed unnumbered blessings upon a numerious family \n     and countless friends. He leaves to all of us who knew him \n     and to multitudes who never met him a rich legacy of \n     spiritual insights, intellectual and ethical challenges, and \n     a vision of what communities of committed men and women, \n     faithful to God's guidance, may yet do to build a better \n     world.\n       A lifelong member of the Society of Friends, Elton \n     Trueblood's teaching, speaking and writing influenced \n     directly the lives of many people in many faith communities \n     around the world. At Haverford, Guilford, Harvard, Stanford, \n     Mount Holyoke, and Earlham he inspired thousands of students \n     over half a century of spirited classroom teaching. His \n     thirty-three books, clearly and simply written, captivated \n     mass audiences rarely reached by words from academic pens.\n       Elton's English Quaker ancestors settled on the coast of \n     North Carolina in 1682 at the site of the present town of \n     Elizabeth City. In 1815 a large group of Carolina Quakers, \n     including the Truebloods, emigrated to Washington County, \n     Indiana. In 1869 his grandfather and other members of the \n     family moved on to Warren County, Iowa. There, on a small \n     farm near Indianola, Elton was born on December 12, 1900, the \n     son of Samuel and Effie Trueblood.\n       Molded by the close-knit Quaker community, hard work on the \n     family farm, encouragement from proud and supportive parents \n     and excellent teachers, Elton Trueblood developed bookish \n     interests and a strong student record. At William Penn \n     College, Oskaloosa, Iowa, he won high standing as scholar, \n     debater, and football player. After preliminary studies at \n     Brown University and Hartford Theological Seminary, he earned \n     the graduate degree of Bachelor of Systematic Theology at \n     Harvard in 1926. He received his Ph.D. degree in philosophy \n     from The John Hopkins University in 1934.\n       His first teaching assignments were at two Friends \n     institutions: Guilford in North Carolina and Haverford in \n     Pennsylvania. In 1936, largely as the result of his handling \n     of a summer appointment as acting Chaplain of Harvard, he was \n     invited to become Chaplain of Stanford. Thus, he was given a \n     public platform and a visibility that drew him increasingly \n     into a national ministry. Former President Herbert Hoover and \n     his wife Lou Henry Hoover were close neighbors and friends \n     and often attended the Quaker Meeting for Worship held \n     monthly in the Trueblood home. (That friendship led to \n     Elton's conducting the funeral services for both of the \n     Hoovers, presiding over Mr. Hoover's public burial before a \n     crowd of 75,000 on a hillside overlooking the Hoover \n     presidential library and museum or West Branch, Iowa.)\n       In 1945 Elton Trueblood felt a strong calling to extend his \n     public ministry through writing and speaking--and at the same \n     time to serve a small Quaker liberal arts institution. Thus, \n     he was prompted to leave his tenured full professorship at \n     Stanford to join the faculty of Earlham College in Richmond, \n     Indiana, as professor of philosophy. There he quickly became \n     a major asset in the rebuilding of the College after the \n     impoverishing years of World War II: helping in the \n     recruiting of both faculty and students, the shaping of new \n     educational policies, the raising of funds, and the promoting \n     of broader public appreciation of Earlham--and of hundreds of \n     other church-related and independent colleges. In a much-\n     reprinted Reader's Digest article, ``Why I Chose a Small \n     College,'' he extolled these institutions as superior places \n     for undergraduate education, where teaching was emphasized \n     and where close faculty-student relations could be naturally \n     fostered.\n       Although the teaching of undergraduates, in courses in both \n     philosophy and religion, remained at the center of his\n      academic life at Earlham, his interest and influence were \n     crucial in the implementation of the risky and \n     controversial decision by the Earlham Board to establish \n     the graduate programs of an Earlham School of Religion. \n     Questions about the possibility of a Quaker seminary had \n     been debated for almost a century, but the idea had always \n     been discouraged as ``not feasible'' and rejected by some \n     Friends as ``thoroughly un-Quakerly.'' Meanwhile, Quaker \n     churches of the pastoral tradition seemed increasingly to \n     draw their ministers from the ranks of the clergy trained \n     in other denominations, or with little formal education in \n     religion, while the less numerous unprogrammed (or \n     ``silent'') Quaker Meetings and their related outreach \n     agencies tended to draw their leadership from among \n     Friends and non-Friends with no theological training. \n     Elton Trueblood was one of the few ``leading Quakers'' who \n     believed that this enterprise could and should be \n     undertaken. Happily, he lived to see the Earlham School of \n     Religion thriving and serving all branches of the Society \n     of Friends.\n       Although he served on many committees of the Society of \n     Friends and was widely recognized as one of the most eminent \n     Quakers of the Twentieth Century, Elton Trueblood was very \n     much at home in a variety of other religious communities, was \n     a strong advocate of ecumenical activities, and was \n     considered by many Quakers and non-Quakers as not quite \n     fitting the popular stereotype of the ``liberal activist'' \n     Quaker. His generally strong pro-Republican political views, \n     his friendship with such prominent Republicans as Hoover, \n     Nixon, and Eisenhower, and his strong anti-communism caused \n     discomfort to some of the more strongly social-activist \n     segments of Friends. He did not like the popular stereotyping \n     of people as ``conservative'' and ``liberal,'' as he \n     considered these terms simplistic and divisive. He believed \n     the Society of Friends, though a small denomination, was big \n     enough for widely divergent points of view.\n       He liked to say that the most important word in the \n     language is ``and.'' On many matters of controversy, he would \n     insist, ``we have to say both-and, not either-or.'' By word \n     and action he demonstrated what some saw as contradictory \n     beliefs and habits: liberal and conservative, traditional and \n     innovative, compassionate and tough-minded, generous and \n     demanding. He was the affirmation of these combinations as \n     being human, realistic, and honest.\n       [[Page S1874]] From his abolitionist Quaker heritage and \n     his own sense of moral and religious imperatives, he drew \n     strength for vigorous opposition to racial discrimination. He \n     was an early friend and supporter of Dr. Martin Luther King, \n     Jr. At crucial points in the civil rights struggle he \n     appealed directly to Presidents Eisenhower and Nixon to hold \n     to strong stands for public policies to eliminate all forms \n     of racial discrimination and to advance equality in human \n     rights.\n       On another central Quaker testimony, pacifism, he was \n     forthright about the importance and complexity of the issue \n     as faced by those holding political power. He struggled \n     openly over the personal dilemma of how an individual or a \n     state can effectively confront challenges of violence and \n     tyranny. He wrote and spoke eloquently against war, for \n     international reconciliation, and in support of the rights of \n     conscience for objectors to military service, and for those \n     who chose military service. If a government does not \n     successfully practice peaceful relations with its neighbors, \n     then it will face a choice of evils in times of crisis. Thus, \n     reluctantly, he concluded during World War II that military \n     resistance to Hitler aggression was necessary.\n       Avoiding simplistic admonitions for a ``back to the \n     church'' or ``back to the bible'' movement, he called for the \n     reinvigorating of religious faith as the essential force \n     necessary to sustain the ethical, moral, and social \n     principles on which a humane and livable society must be \n     built. He warned against what he called ``churchianity'' and \n     ``vague religiosity,'' but he also cautioned against the \n     overly optimistic expectations of secular social-reformism or \n     of a too-easy social gospel.\n       His emphasis in his books and lectures on the importance of \n     family life was not theoretical but a reflection of his role \n     as husband and father. He and Pauline Goodenow, who met while \n     they were students at William Penn College, were married in \n     1924. They had three sons and one daughter: Martin, born in \n     1925; Arnold, born in 1930; Samuel in 1936; and Elizabeth in \n     1941. They knew him, throughout his life, as a loving and \n     devoted father who found ways to be available to them in \n     spite of his heavy work responsibilities and frequent \n     speaking trips. He consciously determined that his children \n     should not pay a heavy price for his public career.\n       Tragedy struck the family in the fall of 1954 when it was \n     discovered that Pauline was suffering from an inoperable \n     brain tumor. The family was in the process of moving to \n     Washington, D.C. where Elton was beginning an assignment with \n     the U.S. Information Agency. Pauline had been a strong \n     support an inspiration, providing needed critisicm of his \n     writings and encouraging him to fulfill his opportunities for \n     national ministry--and managing a busy household in spite of \n     years of chronic illness. Pauline died in early 1955.\n       Virginia Hodgin, a widow with two children, became Elton's \n     secretary at Earlham in 1950 and moved to Washington to \n     continue her work with him at the USIA. In September, 1956 \n     Elton and Virginia were married at the Washington National \n     Cathedral, with both families in attendance. Virginia proved \n     to be a valuable partner as well as devoted wife. With her \n     help, he wrote and published 17 books in the next 18 years, \n     ending with his autobiography, While It Is Day, in 1974. \n     Virginia died in 1984.\n       As a writer, Elton Trueblood developed a style that \n     emphasized clarity, conciseness, and simplicity. Among his \n     literary mentors, of whom he spoke with the greatest sense of \n     admiration and debt, he always listed Blaise Pascal, Dr. \n     Samuel Johnson, Abraham Lincoln, and C.S. Lewis. He was \n     grateful for their skill in treating serious subjects with \n     ample use of aphorisms, anecdotes, and humor. He also liked \n     to paraphrase Mark Twain on how to get started with your \n     writing by saying you simply had ``to glue your trousers to \n     your chair and pick up your pen without waiting for \n     inspiration.''\n       To many who knew him, Elton was an almost awesome figure \n     because of his self-discipline. To his editors at Harper and \n     Row, he was a delight to work with, always turning in clean \n     copy that required little editing, was delivered on or before \n     his promised deadline, and was sure to appeal to a diverse \n     and numerous audience. During his most productive years, he \n     rigorously divided his day into periods of meditation, \n     exercise, writing, and family life. Most of his books he \n     wrote in a small cabin at the family summer home in the \n     Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania during the summer break in \n     the academic year. He would contract to deliver his \n     manuscript in early September, and begin writing on the \n     Monday after the Fourth of July. He wrote between eight in \n     the morning and noon, Monday through Friday, in longhand on a \n     yellow pad. He never got personally involved with typewriters \n     or computers!\n       Although his earlier books were of the longer academic \n     type, he came to feel that any book with a serious public \n     message, with any hope of impact on its readers, should be \n     limited to 130 pages. He generally followed his own \n     prescription.\n       Likewise, in his public speaking, he believed in being \n     brief and to the point. His sermons and popular lectures were \n     rarely more than twenty minutes, thirty at the outside. In \n     classroom lectures he filled the required fifty minutes, \n     often without a note, and ended exactly at the bell. His \n     popularity as a public speaker was such that he could easily \n     have devoted all his working time to the well-paying lecture \n     circuit. Instead, he limited his speaking engagements to \n     those audiences he wanted to reach or help, saving most of \n     his time and energies for teaching and his family. He spoke \n     without fee for those who could not afford to pay, but \n     charged a standard amount for those who could.\n       Although he led a very busy and highly productive life, \n     countless individuals from all walks of the life remember \n     Elton Trueblood with deep gratitude for time he spent in \n     private conversation with them, hearing their problems, their \n     hopes and their dreams--and giving advice. He had \n     extraordinary gifts in encouraging others to believe in their \n     potential and to develop the discipline to use their gifts \n     fully. He was a living example of the good advice he gave to \n     others.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/01/senate-section/article/S1872-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE? THE VOTERS HAVE SAID YES\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the incredibly enormous Federal debt is \nlike New Year's Resolutions--everybody talks about making them but \nrarely do very much about them.\n  The New Year arrived a little over a month ago, but the Senate is \nbogged down about passing a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution. The Senate had better get cracking--the clock is ticking \nand the debt is mushrooming. As of the close of business yesterday, \nTuesday, January 31, the Federal debt stood--down to the penny--at \nexactly $4,815,826,745,802.15 or $18,280 per person calculated on a per \ncapita basis. This debt, don't forget, was run up by the Congress of \nthe United States.\n  Mr. President, most citizens cannot conceive of a billion of \nanything, let alone a trillion. Yesterday, President Clinton authorized \na $20 billion in loan guarantees to Mexico. This figure was so \ndisturbing to the American taxpayers--80 percent of them--that I felt \ncompelled to discuss them during Foreign Relations Committee hearings. \nNow, multiply that $20 billion by 240--this equals the total debt of \nour Federal Government.\n  Which sort of puts it in perspective, does it not, that Congress has \nrun up this incredible Federal debt totaling 4,803 of those billions--\nof dollars. In other words, the Federal debt, as I said earlier, stood \nthis morning at 4 trillion, 803 billion, 795 million, 968 thousand, 326 \ndollars and 50 cents. It'll be even greater at closing time today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/01/senate-section/article/S1874-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1874-S1877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 PRESIDENT ARISTIDE'S PROGRESS IN HAITI\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, on October 15, 1994, I was privileged to \njoin Secretary of State Warren Christopher and other United States \nofficials and congressional leaders in accompanying President Aristide \non his return to Haiti after more than 3 years in forced exile. Before \ndeparting for Port-au-Prince, President Aristide pledged that upon his \nreturn, his government would work for peace and reconciliation among \nall sectors of Haitian society.\n  I believe that President Clinton has done a remarkable job in \nfashioning a policy that has led to the restoration of the duly elected \nPresident of Haiti. Special commendation must go to the men and women \nin the United States Armed Forces who have been deployed in Haiti to \nensure a stable and peaceful climate within which the newly restored \ncivilian government may begin the difficult task of rebuilding Haiti. \nWithout the presence of these committed men and women, the dreams and \naspirations of the Haitian people to live in a democracy would stand no \nhope of fulfillment.\n  More than 100 days have now passed since that historic day last \nOctober. President Aristide has kept his commitment to work for peace \nand reconciliation among all Haitians. I believe that he has made \nsignificant progress in the areas of governance, security, economic \nreconstruction, and meeting the basic needs of the Haitian people. \nObviously much remains to be done.\n  The Embassy of Haiti has prepared a detailed report on the measures \ntaken by the Haitian Government during the first 100 days of the \nrestoration of democracy. I ask unanimous consent that report be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the report was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n Haiti Since the Restoration of Democracy: One Hundred Days of Progress\n\n       ``The Government and people of Haiti take pride in the \n     achievements of the last one \n     [[Page S1875]]  hundred days. However, our struggle is far \n     from over and so we continue to strive within every \n     geographic area, and within every ministry, to make secure \n     the foundations of a lasting, stable democracy.\n       ``We are grateful for the U.S.-led multinational effort in \n     support of Haitian democracy, and not only welcome the \n     opportunities for cooperation and partnership with the \n     world's democracies that the past four months have made \n     possible, but are committed to expand and build upon \n     them.''--President Jean Bertrand Aristide\n\n\n                              introduction\n\n       President Jean Bertrand Aristide's return to Haiti on \n     October 15, 1994 was the culmination of an historic \n     international effort to end a brutal military dictatorship \n     that had:\n       (i) ousted Haiti's first democratically elected President \n     three years earlier;\n       (ii) executed summarily 5,000 civilians;\n       (iii) dislocated 350,000 Haitians, forcing them into hiding \n     within their own country;\n       (iv) caused some 48,000 Haitians to take to the high seas \n     in an attempt to escape the imprisonment, torture, rapes, and \n     murder that Haiti's coup regime was meting out to members of \n     Haiti's pro-democracy community;\n       (v) created a massive Haitian refugee crisis for the United \n     States and other countries of the region;\n       (vi) accelerated the economic and environmental degradation \n     of Haiti, reversing the progress achieved during Haiti's \n     first democratic administration in 1991;\n       (vii) increased drug-related criminal activity within the \n     United States by permitting Haiti to be used as a drug \n     transshipment point for illegal narcotics destined to the \n     United States from South America; and\n       (viii) threatened to undermine, by way of example, the \n     viability of other fledgling democracies throughout the \n     hemisphere;\n       In the first 100 days since President Aristide has been \n     reinstated as his country's democratically elected President, \n     the Government and people of Haiti have moved with single-\n     minded determination to assure Haiti a firm foothold in the \n     world community of democratic, free-market nations.\n       Perhaps most impressive, as noted by U.S. officials, \n     leading members of Haiti's business community, and the \n     international press, has been President Aristide's ability to \n     bridge Haiti's profound social tensions by reaching out to \n     all Haitians, in a spirit of reconciliation and non-violence, \n     to create a new Haiti.\n       President Aristide has demonstrated himself to be a \n     skilled, committed democrat, working with respect for \n     constitutional limits and mandates of Haiti's Presidency and \n     other governmental institutions, and has built a coalition \n     government that promotes and encourages open dialogue with \n     all sectors of Haitian society.\n       Listed below are some of the achievements of the 100-day \n     old ``second'' Aristide administration. To place the efforts \n     and successes of Haiti's constitutional government in proper \n     context, however, it is important to note that upon their \n     return, President Aristide and other members of Haiti's \n     democratically elected government were not only faced with a \n     country whose social and economic development had been \n     thoroughly undermined by the coup regime, but with government \n     ministries and a National Palace that had been pillaged and \n     gutted of equipment, furniture, wiring and supplies (down to \n     paper and pencils) by the departing de facto ``government'', \n     in order to thrust the returning government into a totally \n     inhospitable, unmanageable administrative environment.\n\n\n                 impact of the restoration of democracy\n\n                                Refugees\n\n       Haitian refugees have stopped fleeing Haiti due to the \n     constitutional government's respect for human rights;\n       As a result, ``the Haitian refugee crisis'' no longer \n     preoccupies the American public, the American media, and U.S. \n     policy-makers;\n       Some 16,000 Haitian refugees being held at the U.S. Naval \n     Base at Guantanamo, Cuba, who:\n       (i) had refused to return to Haiti while it was under \n     military dictatorship, and\n       (ii) were seeking refugee status within the United States \n     or other regional countries,\n       have returned to Haiti voluntarily;\n       As was the case after Haiti's first democratic elections in \n     1990, Haitian teachers, health/legal/other professionals who \n     had long been legal residents in Canada, the United States, \n     France and elsewhere, have begun returning to Haiti to make \n     their contributions to the rebuilding of their country;\n\n                    Democratic reform and governance\n\n       The UN/OAS Human Rights Observer Mission, expelled by the \n     military dictatorship in 1994, has returned to Haiti;\n       The Government of Haiti is working with the United Nations, \n     the Organization of American States, and bilateral donors to \n     develop mechanisms and systems to facilitate broad-based \n     awareness of the importance\n      of adhering to internationally accepted human rights \n     standards in the building of a new Haiti;\n       Repeated, impassioned, and sustained calls for \n     reconciliation by President Aristide have been accepted by \n     his followers. Haitians, upon identifying those who \n     brutalized them during military dictatorship, turn these \n     individuals over to members of the Multinational Force--and \n     in some cases, even to the foreign press--rather than taking \n     ``justice'' into their own hands;\n       The strength and lasting power of his message was most \n     recently demonstrated on January 12, when Haitian civilians \n     in Gonaives chased, apprehended, and then turned over to the \n     multinational force a former Haitian military officer \n     attempting to escape after an attack on U.S. servicemen that \n     left one U.S. soldier dead and another wounded;\n       The Haitian Government's emphasis on consultation, \n     inclusion and reconciliation has been demonstrated \n     repeatedly, as in:\n       (a) President Aristide's exhaustive and cordial \n     consultations with at least 16 political parties--almost \n     immediately upon his return--to establish dialogue on issues \n     of concern and to stress the importance to the nation of \n     parliamentary elections taking place at the earliest possible \n     opportunity, and\n       (b) the extensive discussions he entered into across \n     Haiti's leadership spectrum prior to selecting Smarck Michel, \n     a prominent 51-year old Haitian businessman, as Prime \n     Minister;\n       Prime Minister Smarck Michel's unanimous confirmation by \n     Haiti's multiparty parliament, and the subsequent \n     installation of Mr. Michel's ministerial cabinet on November \n     6, 1994 formalized the establishment of the official, legal \n     framework within which democratic, constitutional governance \n     in Haiti can go forward. (See Attachment A for a complete \n     list of all Government Ministers);\n       Immediately upon his return, President Aristide began \n     stressing to the Haitian people and Parliament the importance \n     of the upcoming parliamentary elections. In order to expedite \n     this, a Provisional Electoral Council (representing the three \n     branches of government) has been established, an electoral \n     law has been submitted to Parliament, and a mid-April \n     election date targeted.\n       Within a month of his return, President Aristide invited \n     400 Haitian business leaders to the National Palace, among \n     them individuals who had opposed his return and supported the \n     coup. He included several of these in his official delegation \n     to the Summit of the Americas and named them to the \n     Presidential Commission on Business Modernization and \n     Economic Growth.\n       At the end of 1994, Time assessed President Aristide's \n     reconciliation efforts thus: ``(Aristide) is a man whom \n     experience has imbued with wisdom, a new found respect for \n     dialogue and a deft skill for the politics of pragmatism.''\n\n                        Economic revitalization\n\n       In keeping with his commitment to modernize the Haitian \n     business sector, promote economic development, and reinforce \n     the government's interest in expanding economic and business \n     links with the rest of the region, in general, and the United \n     States, in particular, President Aristide, in December 1994, \n     established a high-level Commission on Economic Growth and \n     Modernization, headed by prominent Haitian businessman and \n     President of the Haitian Industrial Association, Jean Edouard \n     Baker.\n       The Commission, comprised of 25 Haitians representing a \n     broad cross-section of Haiti's business leadership as well as \n     those Cabinet ministers responsible for economic \n     reconstruction, was represented by a 6-person delegation to \n     Washington in mid-January for talks with the Administration \n     and the Congress. These talks focussed on the policies and \n     programs implemented by the Government of Haiti to stabilize \n     the economy and facilitate the workings of a free-market \n     system.\n       This delegation also stressed to U.S. policy-makers that \n     there is now a historic opportunity for Haiti to be \n     permanently transformed--provided the international community \n     maintains its security and human rights observer presence, \n     and keeps its commitment to provide technical and financial \n     support;\n       In response to the free-market policies of the government, \n     some 35 plants in the assembly export sector which ceased \n     production during the political and economic crisis of the \n     past three years have reopened;\n       The macro-economic plan presented by the Aristide \n     government to the international community prior to the 1991 \n     coup won multilateral economic pledges in excess of $500 \n     million. However, the three year military dictatorship caused \n     multilateral donors to withhold this much-needed injection of \n     capital from the Haitian economy. The re-submission of its \n     macroeconomic plan by the ``second'' Aristide administration \n     has again won the support of multilateral community, and \n     Haiti expects pledges in excess of $1 billion over the next 5 \n     years;\n       The resumption of multilateral economic support to Haiti \n     was contingent upon the country's arrears, (resulting from \n     the coup regime's refusal to make payments on Haiti's \n     international debt), being cleared. Thanks to the joint \n     efforts of the international community and the Government of \n     Haiti, these arrears were cleared in December 1994, thereby \n     removing one of the impediments to the timely flow of the \n     support pledged by the international community;\n       There are well-established channels of communication and a \n     strong spirit of cooperation between the Government of Haiti \n     and the Haitian business community, born of the realization \n     on both sides that (i) business, (ii) labor, and (iii) \n     democratic, stable government are all crucial, indispensable, \n     and interdependent components of any modern state;\n       [[Page S1876]] President Aristide has announced a package \n     of special incentives to attract foreign investment to Haiti. \n     These include a reduction in telephone, electricity and \n     customs fees; a dramatic reduction in tariffs on most \n     imported items, except sensitive agricultural commodities; \n     and tax incentives for businesses that return to Haiti by \n     July 1, 1995;\n       At the end of January, Haiti will formally announce to the \n     international financial community its plan for economic \n     development and its projected assistance needs. The plan \n     embraces solid fiscal discipline, open investment and trade \n     policies including a reduction in tariffs, elimination of \n     non-tariff barriers, the modernization of commercial and \n     investment codes, and the streamlining of import/export \n     procedures;\n       The Aristide government is also implementing economic \n     policies geared at sustaining economic growth, reducing the \n     public sector deficit, streamlining and professionalizing the \n     civil service, and eliminating currency exchange and interest \n     rate controls;\n       In order to maximize competition and facilitate the \n     efficient functioning of the Haitian economy, the Government \n     of Haiti has retained the services of the International \n     Financial Corporation to review the condition of state-owned \n     enterprises, and is in the final stages of establishing a \n     tripartite commission on labor-management\n      relations. This commission will facilitate greater \n     communication and cooperation between labor, management \n     and government to the overall benefit of the Haitian \n     economy and the Haitian people;\n       In December 1994, the Governments of the United States and \n     Haiti signed an agreement aimed at revitalizing the Haitian \n     economy via improvements in telecommunications, energy and \n     transportation;\n       The Haitian Ministry of Finance and the U.S. Department of \n     Commerce agree to establish a joint Business Development \n     Council;\n       Haiti's ports have re-opened.\n\n                 Military, police, and judicial reform\n\n       A law was submitted by the Aristide administration to \n     Haiti's parliament to create a civilian-controlled police \n     force separate from the military, as mandated by Haiti's \n     constitution. Haiti's police and military had long been \n     indistinguishable from each other and the source of much \n     repression in Haiti. The law was debated and ratified by the \n     Parliament, and the creation of the new police force under \n     the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice is now underway;\n       One thousand former refuges at the U.S. Naval Base at \n     Guantanamo have been recruited as members of the interim \n     police force, as have 3,000 former members of the Haitian \n     military who were screened for human rights abuses;\n       The Haitian army, originally estimated at 7,000, has been \n     demobilized and will be reconstituted at a level of 1,500, \n     with the salaries of the demobilized soldiers going to the \n     Ministries of Health, Public Works and Agriculture. In \n     addition, these soldiers are being encouraged by the \n     government to apply for positions within these ministries, in \n     order to begin new, constructive careers. A commission, \n     headed by Minister of Defense Wilthan Lherisson, has been \n     charged with establishing--in conjunction with U.S. \n     advisers--a plan for the army's reorganization. (The \n     downsizing of the Haitian army to 1,500 was an important \n     component of the Haitian government's marcro-economic plan \n     which won the support of multilateral donors in Paris last \n     August).\n       The new Police Academy is scheduled to open within the next \n     few weeks and trainees, recruited from Haiti's nine \n     (regional) departments, will be selected from a pool of \n     25,000 applicants. A commission under the authority of the \n     Ministry of Justice has been created to develop the \n     organizational structure and regulations for the new National \n     Police Force.\n       Haiti's notorious ``section chiefs'', long identified by \n     human rights observers and the people of Haiti as key \n     instruments of rural repression in Haiti, were aggressively \n     supported by the military dictatorship. They have now been \n     outlawed and the constitutional government is, instead, \n     establishing in the rural areas local, legitimate justices of \n     the peace.\n\n                   Demilitarization of Port-au-Prince\n\n       Haiti's Army Headquarters, traditionally situated next to \n     the Presidential palace, is now the site of Haiti's Ministry \n     of Women's Affairs.\n       The Port-au-Prince police station is now controlled by the \n     interim police force, under the jurisdiction of the ministry \n     of justice.\n\n    Accounting for human rights abuses during military dictatorship\n\n       An independent Truth Commission has been established\n        by Presidential decree in an attempt to acknowledge, \n     investigate, and provide a full accounting of the \n     brutality that characterized Haiti's 1991-1994 military \n     dictatorship. This is part of an effort to put an end to \n     Haiti's history of impunity and allow for the \n     establishment of the rule of law in the pursuit of \n     political, economic, and social stability;\n       The Government of Haiti has retained the services of \n     Haitian lawyers to pursue claims arising from the most \n     notorious cases of human rights abuses during the coup \n     period.\n\n                              Public works\n\n       The Government of Haiti, in conjunction with international \n     donors, has created 5 thousand road repair jobs, thereby \n     upgrading areas of Haiti's physical infrastructure that were \n     seriously neglected during the three-year military \n     dictatorship;\n       Haiti's main airport in Port-au-Prince is being renovated \n     to accommodate the increased traffic that (i) has resulted \n     from the restoration of democracy, and (ii) is expected from \n     Haiti's pursuit of expanded economic and other links with the \n     region in general and the United States in particular;\n\n                         Social infrastructure\n\n       Education, neglected by the coup regime, is once again \n     being stressed by the constitutional government as a crucial \n     component of Haiti's political, economic, and social \n     stability. With the restoration of democracy came the re-\n     opening of schools, the establishment of a State Secretariat \n     for Literacy, and the distribution of $3 million in school \n     supplies;\n       The government, with the assistance of international \n     agencies, initiated in November 1994 a massive vaccination \n     campaign. To date some 520,000 children have been vaccinated \n     and the government plans to have 3 million children similarly \n     protected by summer 1995;\n       President Aristide has pledged to open at least one new \n     school and one new clinic in each of Haiti's 500 districts by \n     the end of his term in February 1996;\n       A Ministry for the Environment has been created to address \n     the serious ecological challenges facing the people of Haiti.\n\n\n                          remaining challenges\n\n       The return of constitutional government to Haiti on October \n     15, 1994 celebrated a commonality of purpose among the \n     world's democracies. It also raised serious questions \n     regarding the climate of impunity which aspiring despots in \n     the region had begun to assume they could take for granted. \n     For this the people of Haiti are most grateful. However, in \n     the midst of its efforts to secure the achievements \n     summarized in this paper, Haiti's newly reinstated \n     constitutional government has had to face a number of \n     challenges.\n       No sooner had constitutional government been restored to \n     Haiti than Hurricane Gordon hit, causing over 1,000 deaths \n     and extensive damage to infrastructure. Indeed, the United \n     Nations Development Program reports that 1.5 million Haitians \n     were hurt and/or lost property. Thanks to the presence of the \n     Multinational Force in general and U.S. troops in particular, \n     however, the Government and people had a ready source of \n     logistical and material support which helped alleviate the \n     impact of the crisis.\n       Less benign in its origins but just as deadly in its \n     impact, however, was the placement--one month after the \n     return of constitutional government--of an explosive device \n     at a power generator upon which most of Port-au-Prince \n     depends for\n      electricity. This development has sorely taxed the Haitian \n     government as it attempts to stabilize the country, \n     encourage domestic investment, and attract foreign \n     investment. However, the determination of the government \n     and the people of Haiti to build a stable and secure \n     nation, acts such as this notwithstanding, remains \n     unshakable.\n       Regarding the partnership between the government of Haiti \n     and the international community, it is clear that the \n     presence of the Multinational Force has been a dramatic \n     demonstration of the commitment of the world community to \n     democracy in Haiti, and this has enabled the Government of \n     Haiti to move forward with many of the policies and programs \n     outlined in this report. It is the hope of the Government of \n     Haiti, however, that the international community will soon be \n     able to make available the economic support so generously \n     pledged prior to the return of constitutional government in \n     October 1994, since it has long been stressed by both the \n     donor community and the constitutional Government of Haiti \n     that this support is an indispensable counterpart to the \n     essential and fully appreciated multilateral military \n     presence now in Haiti.\n       To the extent that the bottlenecks and administrative \n     delays that have slowed the actual provision of economic \n     support (as opposed to pledges) can be corrected, then \n     Haiti's entry into the world community of stable democratic \n     nations would be greatly expedited and the positive impact of \n     the multilateral military presence would be permanently \n     secured.\n       Haitians from all classes will attest to the unifying \n     influence of President Aristide, who has encouraged patience \n     and perseverance in the face of the significant difference \n     between the economic support that was long ago promised, (as \n     a complement to the multinational troop presence), and what \n     has, to date, been forthcoming.\n       Nonetheless, the Government continues to pursue as top \n     priorities:\n       The holding of free and fair parliamentary elections at the \n     earliest possible date;\n       The strengthening of the institutions of democracy and the \n     promotion of respect for the rule of law;\n       Expanding links between U.S. and Haitian businesses, \n     building upon:\n       (i) Haiti's geographic proximity to the United States,\n       (ii) The long history of U.S./Haiti business relations,\n       (iii) The heightened degree of cooperation and \n     collaboration between the peoples of both nations afforded by \n     the U.S.-led effort to restore democracy,\n       (iv) The energy that has long characterized Haiti's private \n     sector leadership and the dependability of Haiti's labor \n     force, and\n       [[Page S1877]] In keeping with President Aristide's \n     emphasis on the importance of national reconciliation to \n     Haiti's future, the Government of Haiti remains committed to \n     disarmament.\n       Jean Edouard Baker, President of the Industrial Association \n     of Haiti, during a recent visit to Washington stressed to \n     U.S. policy makers that there is now a historic opportunity \n     for Haiti to be permanently transformed--``provided the \n     international community maintains its security and human \n     rights observer presence as originally negotiated, and keeps \n     its commitment to provide financial and technical support \n     during this crucial transition period.''\n       The Government of Haiti shares this assessment and will \n     continue to work with its friends in the international \n     community to ensure that this historic moment yields its full \n     potential.\n                              Attachment A\n\n\n                cabinet of Prime Minister Smarck Michel\n\n       Foreign Affairs & Culture: Mrs. Claudette Werleigh.\n       Defense: Gen.

Mr. President, earlier today, Secretary of Education \nDick Riley delivered his State of Education Address. Speaking at Thomas \nJefferson Middle School in Arlington, VA, he outlined the new and \npromising direction that education reform is now taking, a process that \nis already well under way under the leadership of the Clinton \nadministration.\n  Secretary Riley pointed out that today, just 8 months after the \n``Goals 2000 Educate America Act'' was signed into law, 44 States are \ndesigning, from the bottom up, a better education system for the next \ncentury.\n  To succeed as a Nation, we must create a society in which all \nchildren have a chance to succeed. Education provides that chance. Few \nother investments of taxpayer dollars yield such immense benefits for \nthe Nation and its people.\n  There is no quick or easy answer to deal with the many challenges \ninvolved in improving our schools and colleges. Steady progress will \ntake time and hard work and the involvement of millions of citizens \nthroughout the country. Federal leadership is essential if we are to \nkeep moving forward, and President Clinton and Secretary Riley are \nproviding it. It is preposterous to suggest that we can do more by \nabolishing or downgrading the Department of Education and cutting the \nbudget for education. As Secretary Riley states, the American people do \nnot want Congress to cut Federal aid to education that helps Americans \nbecome more self-reliant.\n  I commend Secretary Riley and President Clinton for their vision and \nleadership on education, and for giving it the high priority it \ndeserves. We are making wise investments toward meeting our national \neducation goals, and we must stay the course, not make a U-turn.\n  Mr. President, I believe that Secretary Riley's address will be of \ninterest to all of us in the Senate, and I ask unanimous consent that \nit may be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the address was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n  Turning the Corner: From a Nation at Risk to a Nation With a Future\n\n                         (By Richard W. Riley)\n\n\n                              INTRODUCTION\n\n       To the students who just sang to us from their hearts--to \n     Sidney and David and Anh and Zelmie--how very proud we are of \n     all of you and your classmates. You are the future of our \n     country; you give us hope and strength.\n       I am grateful to Terrel Bell for his very kind \n     introduction. American education owes a debt of gratitude to \n     Terrel Bell for his foresight and leadership. We are on a new \n     course toward excellence and high standards in American \n     education in large part because of Terrel Bell's good deeds a \n     dozen years ago.\n       Today, I am honored to make my second annual State of \n     American Education Address here at Thomas Jefferson Middle \n     School in Arlington, Virginia * * * to tell you that we are \n     no longer a nation at risk, but a nation on the move * * * a \n     nation turning the corner, raising its standards and reaching \n     for excellence for the 21st century.\n       It is so appropriate that we should come together at a \n     school named in honor of Thomas Jefferson--the president who \n     wrote to John Adams that he could ``not live without books,'' \n     and the founder of a great American institution of higher \n     learning, the University of Virginia.\n       Were he alive today, I have no doubt that Jefferson, ever \n     the scientist and inventor, would be, at this very moment, in \n     the computer lab uplinking to the Internet's World Wide Web.\n       But Jefferson would have to be quick because the classrooms \n     and computers here at Thomas Jefferson are always in use. \n     This school is a community bursting with energy and learning, \n     day and night. Thomas Jefferson is a school that reflects \n     many of the new dynamics shaping the future of American \n     education.\n       We are, for example, in the midst of another baby boom. In \n     the next ten years, an additional 7.1 million children are \n     going to get up in the morning and go to school. Another 7.1 \n     million children.\n       And at the same time that we are helping these brand new \n     students become part of America's strength, we must raise \n     standards and tech Americans of all ages some very new and \n     demanding skills.\n       Now, every child still must learn the basics. I am a great \n     believer in the fundamentals. You simply can't get ahead if \n     you cannot read, write and figure out how much change the \n     checkout clerk should give you. But in this day and age, \n     using computers and recognizing the discipline of the arts \n     and the power of science all have to be seen as new \n     fundamentals for all our children.\n       This is a critical time for American education * * * a \n     turning point.\n\n\n                TURNING THE CORNER; A NATION ON THE MOVE\n\n       So what, then, is the state of American education today \n     given these and other new dynamics? I believe that we are, at \n     long last, turning the corner * * * moving from being a \n     nation at risk to a nation with a hopeful future. We are \n     starting to win the battle for excellence and good \n     citizenship in American education.\n       Why am I becoming optimistic? Student performance in \n     reading, science and math is on the rise, and we have made up \n     much of the ground we lost in the 1970s. The number of high \n     school students taking the core academic courses is \n     increasing, up 27 percentage points since 1983, and still \n     rising. Many more students, particularly minority students, \n     are participating in the advanced placement process.\n       The dropout rate has declined in the last decade, and young \n     people are getting the message that graduation from high \n     school is only the stepping-stone to more learning. There is \n     a new seriousness and appreciation for the value of \n     education. The percentage of students attending college is \n     higher than any other developed country. Community colleges \n     are filling up as never before. And our great institutions of \n     higher learning still produce world-class graduates.\n       Now, we still have many problems. Overall achievement is \n     still too low. The dropout rate for our Hispanic youth is too \n     high; the gap in performance of African-American, Hispanic, \n     and poor children is still too large; violence in some \n     schools remains a destructive force; too many college \n     freshmen are still in remedial classes; and I am increasingly \n     concerned about a growing trend to de-emphasize the value of \n     our nation's wonderful system of higher education.\n       But all across America there is great energy and commitment \n     to the progress of education. In Colorado, Governor Roy Romer \n     has taken the lead in calling for high standards and\n      comprehensive reform. In Massachusetts, Governor Weld is \n     using Goals 2000 money to support the creation of charter \n     schools.\n       In Minnesota, thousands of parents are signing compacts to \n     improve their children's learning. And the Parents-as-\n     Teachers (PAT) program in Missouri continues to add value to \n     education by having parents help other parents.\n       In Columbus, Ohio, Project Discovery is leading a statewide \n     effort to improve math and science instruction. In Illinois, \n     a new technology initiative now links public schools to \n     scientists at Northwestern University.\n       Good work is being done in many states to design tougher \n     standards for our young people and establish real \n     accountability. And, two weeks ago, 81 middle school teachers \n     received the first national certificates for meeting the most \n     rigorous of standards.\n       Kentucky, a state that has done so much in school reform, \n     is now reporting dramatic improvement in mathematics, \n     reading, science, and social studies based on their new, \n     challenging academic standards.\n       We are starting to see a difference. Above all, we are \n     starting to overcome the greatest \n     [[Page S1878]]  barrier to the future of American education: \n     the tyranny of low expectations.\n       And the intensity of activity at the state and local levels \n     is being matched by the strong bipartisan commitment of \n     Congress and President Clinton to put excellence back into \n     American education.\n       Passage of the Goals 2000: Educate America Act; the \n     creation of a new School-to-Work Opportunity Act; our new \n     direct lending program; our new substantial investment in \n     technology; the refocusing of our research arm; the Safe \n     Schools Act, the creation of AmeriCorps; and the expansion of \n     Headstart are all part of the national effort to move \n     American education forward.\n\n\n                      the uniqueness of goals 2000\n\n       So I am pleased to report to you today that just eight \n     months after the President signed Goals 2000 into law, 44 \n     states are now moving forward in designing--from the bottom \n     up--an education system for the 21st century.\n       Goals 2000 is the driving force behind the ongoing effort \n     across this country to raise standards, to get technology \n     into the classroom, and to make sure that we set high \n     expectations for every young person, every teacher and every \n     parent.\n       I want to emphasize that Goals 2000 is the very model of \n     how we can help the states and local schools without \n     smothering them with regulations. Our Department of Education \n     has decided to have no regulations governing this $400 \n     million program--no regulations--and the state applications \n     form is just four pages long. But accountability is there--by \n     testing to high state standards. About 98 percent of all the \n     funding in Goals 2000 goes directly to the states and in its \n     second year, 90 percent of all funding will flow directly to \n     local school districts.\n       I want to take a moment to speak directly to the critics of \n     this most important piece of legislation. I am not an \n     advocate of a ``national exam;'' nor am I an advocate of \n     federal intrusion into state and local decision making. I did \n     not come to Washington to save the job of a bureaucrat or to \n     defend old ways of doing business.\n       I am a strong supporter of applying ample doses of American \n     ingenuity and creativity to our educational system. We need \n     to encourage ideas such as charter schools and public school \n     choice; be flexible and recognize that students learn in many \n     different ways; and carefully think through how we use time \n     in the school day.\n       But we must always have accountability in public \n     education--for the sake of both the children and the American \n     taxpayer. Accountability is so important. That is one \n     important reason why I do not support the ``silver bullet'' \n     solution of using public tax dollars for private school \n     vouchers.\n       Above all, we need to avoid the trap that has so often \n     befallen American education: the inability to maintain a \n     sustained drive for excellence. Too often we get distracted \n     by the fad of the moment. What we need now, more than ever, \n     is some old-fashioned American tenacity to stay on course.\n       And, I will tell you this--if we roll back the Goals 2000: \n     Educate America Act * * * if we get off course now * * * just \n     when we are turning the corner and giving states and \n     communities the help they request in the form they need it, \n     well then, where will we be? One place we will be is out of \n     step with the American people.\n       The American people believe in education, and they believe \n     it should be made a national priority. They know that \n     education is an act of building--the building of people, the \n     building of our nation, and the building of our future.\n       Every poll that I have read drives home this essential \n     point: the American people want to invest in education that \n     works. The results of the November election do not tell me \n     that the American people want to go backwards. There is \n     nothing that tells me that they want cuts in student aid for \n     college, nor that they want Congress to cut education that \n     helps the American people become more self-reliant.\n       I pledge my full cooperation to the new Congress. We will \n     make an honest review of what federal education programs are \n     working and which ones have seen their time come and now must \n     go.\n       But the need to reduce the federal budget deficit must be \n     balanced against our need to invest in America's future. The \n     reduction of the deficit and investing in education are two \n     of the most important and essential ways we can secure this \n     nation's prosperity. In this new Information Age, education \n     must be seen as a national priority.\n\n\n               the new excellence: six winning americans\n\n       Nothing so exemplifies the progress this nation has made in \n     the last decade than the six special guests who are here \n     today. In 1994, these six students--all from public schools--\n     represented this country as the American team at the 35th \n     International Mathematical Olympiad.\n       These young Americans did something quite extraordinary. \n     They defeated the very good teams of 69 other nations--and \n     they won with perfect scores. Their victory is surely a \n     personal achievement--and a victory for their teachers, \n     parents, coaches and for all Americans.\n       But it is also a reflection of the serious work that has \n     been done in the last decade to achieve a new standard of \n     excellence in American education. The first professional \n     group to produce new academic standards were America's math \n     teachers. My Department and other federal agencies have kept \n     a sharp focus on advancing math and science education, and it \n     is beginning to pay off.\n       So it is my great pleasure to present to you the six \n     winning members of the American math team and their coach, \n     Doctor Walter Mientka of the University of Nebraska.\n\n\n          increasing and protecting access to higher education\n\n       These young Americans clearly represent our very best. Most \n     of them are already in college, and I have no doubt that each \n     of them will achieve and succeed in life. But they are not \n     alone in wanting to advance themselves. Millions of young \n     Americans know the score already: to get ahead in America, \n     you need to have a first-class education.\n       This is why we really do need to reinvent the American high \n     school--to create new, concrete links to the world of work \n     and careers--and why access to higher education has got to \n     remain a national priority.\n       We intend to maintain and increase our commitment to the \n     Pell Grant program because it is an essential statement of \n     our commitment to higher education.\n       And, we are very proud of our Department's efforts to crate \n     and maintain a new direct lending program for college \n     students. This is a program for the 90s. Recently, an \n     American University student told me that she had received her \n     direct loan in 24 hours and at a lower cost * * * and that \n     last year under the old system, it had taken three weeks.\n       College presidents are placing a high value on this program \n     because they know that it is working. This program will save \n     the taxpayers $4.3 billion and save students $2 billion by \n     1998.\n       I encourage the Congress not to ``cap'' a program that is \n     making college more affordable and accessible--and saving \n     taxpayers money. Every college should have the choice to \n     provide the benefits of this program to their students.\n\n\n                      middle class bill of rights\n\n       But we need to do more. For the first time in generations, \n     parents are truly worried that they will not be able to pass \n     on the American Dream to their children. And they are not \n     alone. High school and college students know that they have \n     but two choices: they can work longer hours for less pay, or \n     they can get a meaningful education.\n       Our economy has added almost 6 million new jobs in the last \n     two years, and many of these require new thinking skills. The \n     economy of the future will be--and already is for millions of \n     Americans--an economy based on what you know and on the \n     skills you have. And we need everybody to build America's \n     future.\n       This is why education is the very centerpiece of the \n     President's proposed Middle Class Bill of Rights. The \n     President's proposals to allow a tax deduction for college \n     tuition, to expand IRA withdrawals for education, to create a \n     $2,600 skills grant that empowers working Americans and a \n     $500 child tax credit--are all part of the same effort to \n     make sure every American has a chance to be part of the \n     American Dream.\n       I urge all the parents who are thinking ahead about your \n     children's future, to sit down at the kitchen table, talk \n     this proposal through and understand its details. And when \n     you do, you'll understand that President Clinton's proposal \n     is a good one.\n\n\n               maintaining excellence in higher education\n\n       Now, a word of caution. I am concerned that in the rush to \n     cut budgets, we can do unintentional but very real damage to \n     the jewel of the American educational system--our system of \n     higher education.\n       Increasingly, state leaders seem to see higher education as \n     a budget item to be cut rather than as a long-term investment \n     in the future. The federal government, which for much of the \n     1980s increased its funding for basic research, will be hard \n     pressed to maintain this capacity. And, all of us in \n     Washigton--in both the executive and legislative branches--\n     have come close to over-regulating over the years.\n       Nothing defines these new pressures more than the current \n     budget-cutting proposal in the Congress to eliminate the \n     ``in-school interest subsidy.'' Now, that's a complicated way \n     of saying that if you lose your subsidized student loan--and \n     there are 4.4 million of you who would--you are going to have \n     to pay about 20 percent more on hour student loan--as much as \n     $5,000 more over the life of the loan if you borrow the \n     maximum that is allowable. That's a lot of money.\n       This is the wrong way to go. We're not going to build up \n     the middle class by charging students who are trying to get \n     into or stay in the middle class $2 billion extra a year in \n     interest. If this proposal goes through, it will be the \n     largest reduction of financial aid to working American \n     families in the history of this country.\n\n\n           violence, drugs and the disconnection of our youth\n\n       As we seek to turn the corner, we need to recognize that \n     many young people remain disconnected--growing up on their \n     own--often alone--and in some cases--truly alienated. Last \n     year at this time, I spoke about my very real concern that \n     this disconnection is becoming so pervasive that we were \n     losing touch with one another.\n       Nothing defines this disconnection better than the \n     increasing violence by our children, and the increasing \n     violence toward our children. I try hard to understand the \n     causes, \n     [[Page S1879]]  but this I know for sure: the American people \n     have had enough.\n       Now, the great majority of America's schools are safe and \n     drug-free. But we cannot ignore the reality of our times. \n     Guns are being brought to schools as tests of manhood. Drugs \n     are being used with greater frequency and at earlier ages. \n     And a $7 movie ticket is all to often a ticket to see a \n     killer use a gun.\n       Strong families and schools with high expectations remain \n     our first lines of defense against the spiritual numbness of \n     violence. When 82 percent of all the people in this nation's \n     prisons and jails are high school dropouts, surely, that fact \n     alone should tell us something about the importance of high-\n     quality and safe schools in every neighborhood.\n       It is not hopeless. The Robert E. Lee High School in \n     Houston, Texas, and the Joseph Timilty School in Roxbury, \n     Massachusetts, are two schools that have turned themselves \n     around. These schools have set high academic standards; they \n     have attacked the culture of violence head-on; and they have \n     involved parents and the community to get results.\n       So we must keep our focus on ending the violence. We passed \n     the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Act last year. And if you \n     bring a gun to school, don't expect much sympathy--because \n     you are not playing by the rules.\n       But we need to do more. This is why Attorney General Janet \n     Reno and Doctor Lee Brown, our nation's Drug Czar, will join \n     me in the coming months in visiting different communities to \n     encourage and work with people to end the violence.\n       And our message to Hollywood is clear and simple: help us \n     raise our children right by ending this fixation that \n     entertainment must always contain violence. By the time young \n     people reach age 18, they have watched 25,000 murders on \n     television alone. Stop glamorizing assassins and killers. I \n     urge you to see this issue through the eyes of parents \n     instead of scriptwriters . . . through the eyes of teachers \n     instead of advertisers.\n       Sit down with community leaders, principals, PTA \n     presidents, and the doctors in the trauma units who are \n     struggling so hard to protect the children and mend their \n     communities, and use your power to reach children in a \n     helpful and supportive way.\n       Our young people are searching for clearly marked pathways \n     to adult hood that are appropriate for the '90s. In some \n     troubled neighborhoods, gangs have almost replaced the family \n     in laying out a new path to adulthood. And what a terrible \n     path it is--an act of violence, a first arrest, expulsion \n     from school, a place in juvenile hall, time spent in prison \n     and sometimes death, and all before they are 20 years of age.\n\n\n                 a social compact for public education\n\n       This is why I continue to place great importance on \n     supporting the American family. Last year on this occasion, I \n     announced a new effort to encourage parent involvement in the \n     education of our children. As I said at that time, ``thirty \n     years of research tells us that parent expectations and \n     parental involvement'' is the starting point for improving \n     American education. Parents matter.\n       Today, I can report to you that more than 100 \n     organizations, including the national PTA, the U.S. Catholic \n     Education Association, the National Alliance for Business, \n     and the Boys' and Girls' Club of America, are actively \n     participating in our Family Involvement Partnership for \n     Learning. There is great energy in this effort.\n       I am pleased by the support we are receiving from the \n     American business community. And I am deeply encouraged by \n     the religious leaders of many faiths who came together last \n     December to release a ``Statement of Common Purpose'' \n     articulating their common desire to find new ways to support \n     family involvement in their children education.\n       I believe there is an enormous desire on the part of the \n     American people to have new rules of public engagement when \n     it comes to relating to each other. A young student might \n     willfully disobey a teacher or cheat on an exam and think \n     nothing of it; an ambitious politician can\n      distort the truth or defame the character of another and be \n     rewarded with more media exposure.\n       Listen, in contrast, to these words from a pledge that \n     young people take every day at school in Independence, \n     Missouri:\n       ``I am the one and only person who has the power to decide \n     what I will be and do. I will accept the consequences for my \n     decisions. I am in charge of my learning and behavior. I will \n     respect the rights of others and will be a credit to myself, \n     my family, my school, and my community.''\n       I believe this is what the American people want for their \n     children. And I agree with them.\n       So what does this mean for those of us who are part of the \n     public dialogue about the future of American education? We \n     need to get beyond the idea that everything in America is \n     part of a political game. We are not educating our children \n     as Republicans, Democrats or Independents, but as Americans, \n     and as the future of our great country.\n       We need to lower our voices, to listen to one another and \n     surely to listen to our parents and teachers. there is a \n     difference between constructive criticism and the \n     articulation of deeply held convictions--and the tendency by \n     some to define just about everything in public education as \n     useless and at the extreme, even ``corrupt.''\n\n\n             turning the corner: looking toward the future\n\n       As we look to the future, let us also recognize that we \n     live in a time of great learning and technological \n     achievement. New discoveries by the Hubble telescope are \n     leading astronomers to rethink the very age of the Universe, \n     even as we marvel at the recent unearthing of 20,000-year-old \n     prehistoric paintings in caves in Southern France.\n       Scholars are deciphering the Dead Sea Scrolls and the \n     technology of virtual reality is helping to teach disabled \n     children how to drive wheelchairs. Machines the size of \n     molecules are being created by dedicated scientists to heal \n     the sick, and scientists are announcing that they have \n     isolated the DNA of dinosaurs. It is all rather \n     extraordinary.\n       Dr. Pat Graham, the former Education Dean at Harvard, wrote \n     in her book, ``In this nation, we have never had a `golden \n     age of learning.' We have had a golden age for some,'' she \n     said, ``but not one for the nation.''\n       If ever there was a time for this great nation of ours to \n     have a ``golden age of learning'' for all of our people, now \n     is the time to have it--to create a new ethic of learning--a \n     new standard of excellence.\n       Now all this is going to take some decisionmaking, and \n     here, I want to end by telling you a story about a funeral I \n     attended when I was governor of South Carolina.\n       The deceased was an elderly lady named Katie Beasley. Katie \n     Beasely was a sharecropper, the mother of six or seven \n     children, who spent her entire life just getting by. At her \n     funeral, an old friend stood up and said that he had spent a \n     good long while trying to think through what made Katie \n     Beasley so special--how it was that she had so little and yet \n     all of her children got an education, got good jobs and were \n     community leaders themselves.\n       And he had decided, after a great deal of thought, that \n     what made her special was that she was a decisionmaker. This \n     is what he said: ``Katie decided that an education for her \n     children was important, and she was determined to see that \n     they were all educated. She never looked back,''\n       We are at a time for decisionmaking in this country. If we \n     believe, as Katie Beasley believed, that education is a \n     serious matter, and that all of our children must be \n     educated, we too can be successful. It is a matter of having \n     the human spirit to believe in ourselves as a people--and to \n     make the decision to move forward. Everything is in place to \n     educate America--and I think we will with your help.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/01/senate-section/article/S1877-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1879]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO AUGUSTA WOLFE\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Augusta \nWolfe who will celebrate her 100th birthday on March 2. Augusta has \nbeen a resident of California for 62 years and when she and her friends \nand family gather to celebrate, I want her to know she has been honored \nby the U.S. Senate.\n  Raised in New York City until age 17, Augusta had three sisters and \nfive brothers. Her mother died when Augusta was only 13 and she assumed \nmuch of the responsibility and care of her younger siblings. Her father \nremarried and she acquired one half-sister.\n  Her older brothers moved to Winnipeg, Canada. At age 17, Augusta \njoined them, then sent for the three younger brothers and one sister. \nWhile in Winnipeg, Augusta worked in her brother's store.\n  At age 19, she met and married her brother's friend, Nathan Wolfe, \nand had two children. Two years later the family moved to Salt Lake \nCity, UT, where they lived for 14 years. During this time, Augusta \nhelped Nat found and operate a very successful retail business, Wolfe's \nDept. Store. Mr. Chairman, In 1933, because Nat's health was failing, \nthey moved to Beverly Hills and later to Palm Springs.\n  After Nat's death in 1952, Augusta returned to New York City for a \nbrief period and then to Santa Barbara. She devoted much of her energy \nto creative art, primarily the making of mosaics. Later, she moved to \nLaguna Hills, CA, where she continued her interest in art and began \nwriting poetry, which she continues to do until this date. Her work has \nbeen recognized by the National Library of Poetry and some of it has \nbeen published in their publication ``Tears of Fire.''\n  Today she is active and in relatively good health. Her keen intellect \nand memory are unimpaired. She lost her daughter in 1979. In addition \nto her son, Bernard, a California lawyer, she has many devoted friends \nand relatives who will attend her 100th birthday celebration on March \n4, 1995.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/01/senate-section/article/S1879-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1880]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S1880]]\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of House Joint Resolution 1, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (H.J. Res. 1) proposing a balanced \n     budget amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the joint resolution.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we are now on our third day on the balanced \nbudget constitutional amendment. I think the debate has been \ninteresting. There have been a lot of points made on both sides of the \nfloor, and I can see there are people anguishing over which way to go \non this amendment.\n  I suggest that the American people are about fed up with the \nprofligacy of Congress. They see us just spending this country right \ninto bankruptcy. They see no real curtailment. They have seen a series \nof legislative approaches that were supposed to solve this problem, all \nof which bite the dust the minute 51 percent of the Senate and the \nHouse vote otherwise.\n  It is clear that for all the good intentions that we have had through \nthe Harry Byrd amendment, the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings legislation, and \nthe current approach toward budgeting, nothing has worked because there \nis no mechanism in the Constitution that requires us to make priority \nchoices among competing programs.\n  It is really difficult because I see all over Capitol Hill today \npeople from all over the country, from every State, arguing for their \nown special interest. That is the way the system should work, because \nthe people ought to have a right to come see their elected \nrepresentatives and argue for their own special interests.\n  But some mechanism must be supplied to enable us to say to some of \nthem: ``Your interest is worthy, but we don't have the money.'' And it \nis not as worthy as a whole raft of other interests that we have to \ntake care of, among which would be Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, \nveterans pensions, and the whole variety of entitlement programs that \nwe think are so worthy that they automatically escalate every year, \nregardless of what we in Congress do.\n  I think anybody sitting here ought to stop and think why this \nbalanced budget amendment is a wise and good thing. And the number one \nreason I would say that it is is because it would force us to have to \nlook at all programs, it would force us to be able to choose and make \npriority choices among programs on order of merit. It would not force \nus to go to a balanced budget, but it certainly gears us toward going \nto a balanced budget and provides different incentives that will lead \nus to a balanced budget.\n  I have had a number of senior citizens come to me in my home State of \nUtah and as I have traveled all over the country, and they say: \n``Senator Hatch, we hope you'll protect Social Security.'' And they \nalways start that way and they know that I will. And I assure them that \nvirtually every Member of Congress will. But invariably, these seniors \nwill say:\n  ``But we know that in order for us to have protection of our ability \nto live, we have to consider our youth of today, we have to consider \nour budget problems, we have to consider what is right for America, we \nhave to consider how we live within our means in our country or what we \nget will not be worth very much, and we will not be able to live on \nSocial Security no matter how much it is.\n  ``So, Senator, please as you try to protect Social Security, also \ngive us protection against the Federal Government spending us into \nbankruptcy, spending beyond our means to pay for things we cannot \nafford.''\n  Senior citizens are not dumb. They know what is going on. Most of \nthem have lived through this life, most of them have had to pay their \nbills all their lives. Most of them understand what it is like, and \nmost of them are worried that sooner or later there is going to come a \nreckoning unless we get our fiscal house in order.\n  On the other side of that coin, I have had a lot of young people come \nto me, young college students, young people who are starting to think \nabout what their futures are.\n  Invariably, they say, ``Will our future be as good as yours was when \nyou were in college, Senator Hatch?'' And for the first time in the \nhistory of this country a lot of parents are starting to become \ndepressed because they realize we can no longer say that their children \nwill have as much opportunity to progress and have better lives than \nthey had, like our parents were able to say to us.\n  These young people are not stupid. They know, taking Social Security, \nwhen it came into existence back in the forties, that there were about \n46 workers for every person on Social Security. They are not stupid. \nThey know that is now down to just a little more than three workers for \nevery person on Social Security, and that our senior citizens are \nliving longer and growing in number. They know that we are going to \nthat ratio reduced to probably two persons working for everybody on \nSocial Security.\n  Yet, what kind of a nation would we be if we did not take care of \nthose who have worked so hard to build the Nation and who now cannot \nwork, who are senior and who need to be cared for and helped, and who \ndeserve to be helped because of their paying into the system all their \nlives?\n  It does not escape these young people that their future is going to \nbe very limited because the cost of Social Security, of course, with \nCOLA's, keeps going up, and the work base keeps going down. They also \nknow that complicating it all is a profligate Federal Government, a \nprofligate Congress. Year after year, Congress after Congress, has no \nreal incentives to get spending under control.\n  I know Members of this body who are liberal, with whom I have served \nfor the whole 19 years I have been here, who in that whole 19 years \nhave never asked the question: Where are the revenues going to come \nfrom to pay for these programs? They never once, never once have \nconsidered that an important question. They continue to ignore that \nunless we have a balanced budget amendment, which would help us to put \nour fiscal house in order, help to solidify the value of the dollar, \nand help the future of our children and our young men and women, we are \ngoing to have to face our fiscal irresponsibility.\n  I know some here who have never once said, ``Where are we going to \nget the funds?'' Would it not be better to support this amendment, \nrather than their favorite program, which is not as important, rather \nthan to go into bankruptcy or to go toward a system where we ultimately \nmonetize the debt, where the dollar becomes worthless, where inflation \ngallops, and where our senior citizens really are left high and dry, as \nwell as our youth and their future?\n  This last election was about these issues. I may not have articulated \nthem very well, but I have tried to show that our senior citizens are \nnot stupid. They understand that we have to, sooner or later, live \nwithin our means or their Social Security and their retirements will \nnot be worth very much.\n  Our young people are not dumb either. They know there is a \ndiminishing work force and the whole burden of taking care of our \nsenior citizens is going to be on their shoulders, and they want to do \nit. But will they want to in the year 2014 and 2020 if we do not get \nspending under control, and we keep loading them up with all kinds of \nother loads like we do?\n  Why, the committee I used to chair, the Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee, has over 2,000 Federal programs, some of them very \nduplicative. There are 154 job training programs that this wonderful \nseries of Congresses has enacted over the years to show that they are \nreally empathetic and considerate of those who need job training. Many \nof those programs are duplicative, many of them overlap. We ought to \nhave one major program for job training, and it ought to work.\n   [[Page S1881]] What about welfare? It has been estimated by some \nthat by the time the billions and billions of dollars in welfare are \nlaundered through the Federal bureaucracy, those on welfare only get \nabout 28 cents out of every dollar. We eat it all up right here in \nWashington, DC.\n  Is it not time to face this? This is what this last election was all \nabout. It was 85 percent of the American people saying: We have had it \nup to here with Congress. We think it is time for Congress to start \nliving within its means, and we are for a balanced budget amendment \nthat will help Congress to live within its means.\n  We are not asking for drastic measures here. We are saying that the \nbudget must be balanced over a period of 7 years, to the year 2002, \nwhich everybody here knows could be done if we had the will to do it.\n  It is nothing inordinate or difficult to do if we have some \nincentives to do it. But until we do, I guarantee you that those who \nnever ask where the moneys are going to come from to pay for these \nexcessive pieces of legislation, and they are in both parties, are \ngoing to continue to spend just the way they have always spent. I think \nthey are more in one party than in the other, but nevertheless there \nare some in both parties.\n  Mr. President, the greatest economic threat this country faces is \nout-of-control Federal spending. The single most useful thing this \nCongress can do is to enact a constitutional requirement that Federal \nspending not exceed Federal revenues each year, starting in the year \n2002. The only exceptions would be when a declaration of war is in \neffect--we all understand that--when the United States is engaged in \nmilitary conflict causing an imminent threat to national security, or \nin those instances where three-fifths of the whole number of each House \nof Congress votes for a specific deficit but will have to vote, which \nis going to be a very important aspect of this amendment.\n  Interest on the national debt is currently about $300 billion a year, \namounting to approximately 20 percent of the total Federal budget. \nThese deficits directly affect every American.\n  For example, every dollar we must spend on interest payments on the \nnational debt is one less dollar available to tax relief for \nhardworking citizens in Utah, Illinois, New York, California, and all \nacross this country.\n  As another example, continuous large Federal deficits force the \nFederal Government to borrow huge sums of money, keeping interest rates \nhigh and driving them even higher. Hard-working Americans looking to \nfinance their first home or to buy a more suitable home face higher \nmortgage rates. As a result, fewer homes are sold. Home builders and \ntheir suppliers lose business and have to reduce their work forces. \nBusinesses associated with the housing industry, from realtors to title \nresearchers, are all similarly affected. These are not abstract matters \nwe are talking about.\n  Opponents of the amendment ask about the consequences of its passage. \nWe are addressing those questions. I do not see how anybody could not \nunderstand that you cannot just continue to spend more than you take \nin. But these same opponents wish to ignore the consequences of failing \nto pass the amendment. The American people spoke in this last election, \nbut the people here in the Senate, some of them, have not heard them \nyet. I think they need to speak more in each of these States.\n  What are some of the other ways huge Federal deficits affect our \nconstituents? The cost of consumer credit goes up. That includes the \ncost of everything from automobiles, washing machines, televisions, to \neven much smaller goods paid for with credit. Hard-working Americans \nwork more but can afford less. And the slowdown in consumer spending \nwill result in work force reductions in those consumer industries. We \njust cannot go on like this.\n  The unwritten rule in this country until just a few decades ago was \nfor the Federal budget to be balanced except in wartime. That was the \nunwritten rule. We abided by it for a century and a half. For much of \nour history, the legislative process reflected the norm of a balanced \nbudget. But as the role and size of the Federal Government expanded, \nCongress became unable to control spending. New spending programs have \nbeen added over the years, many of them starting small but always \ngrowing larger, and even larger.\n  Today, the problem is this: Every single spending program, no matter \nhow small, has a divine set of beneficiaries. The beneficiaries of each \nspending program are able to make their voices heard whenever they \nsense a chance that their program may be cut or eliminated.\n Even Federal programs of a few hundred million dollars can generate \nintense lobbying by the program beneficiary. This occurs for dozens \nupon dozens, even hundreds of Federal programs.\n\n  Taxpayers are rarely heard about in the spending on any given single \nprogram. They do not realize this is all going on. The cost to an \nindividual taxpayer of even large Federal programs is diffused among \nthe large number of all taxpayers. As a result, the interest of the \ntaxpayer in cutting or eliminating a particular program is rarely heard \nas loudly or as often as that of the program's beneficiaries. The \ntaxpayers are at an enormous disadvantage, the way things are presently \nset up, without this mechanism in the Constitution.\n  This spending bias is the reason we need a structural change in how \nCongress does business, a change we must make to our fundamental \ncharter in order for it to be effective. Only a constitutional balanced \nbudget provision will impose fiscal discipline on Congress. Only a \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution will force spending \nprograms to compete against each other and hold down overall Federal \nspending.\n  The other body for the first time in history has acted in a \nbipartisan manner. Our efforts here in the Senate, those who support \nthis amendment, are bipartisan.\n  I particularly appreciate the great leadership of our distinguished \ncolleague from Illinois and his willingness to stand up on this issue, \nhis articulation of why it is so important. I look forward to listening \nto him this morning as soon as I have completed these few remarks I \nhave. We are working in a bipartisan way, and there are others. Senator \nHeflin, Senator DeConcini has worked very hard, Senator Bryan, a whole \nraft of Democrats have worked very hard on this amendment. We have many \nover here, from Senator Thurmond to Senator Craig, right on down the \nline to every one of our new Senators on this side.\n  I think the Senate dare not act on the basis of politics as usual. We \njust cannot do that this time. I do not think we dare just favor the \nstatus quo, just continue spending with no mechanism to stop it, no \nmechanism to deter it, no mechanism to encourage us to do what is \nright. I urge my colleagues to vote for this change, the kind of sea \nchange America voted for in this last election.\n  I hope all our American citizens out there are listening to this \ndebate because they need to get with their Senators. They need to get \nwith their Senators and make sure they are going to support this \nbalanced budget amendment. Nothing short of a public outcry, a public \neffort--phone calls, letters, meeting them in their offices, getting \nthem at home, letting them know how you feel--is going to make the \ndifference here. We think that is what has made the difference thus \nfar. That is why we are here. That is why the House of Representatives \nhas voted, for the first time in history, 300 to 132 for this \namendment. That is why we brought up the House resolution which is \nidentical, except for one comma, to our resolution that Senator Simon \nand I have brought to this body.\n  I hope we will all vote for the kind of change the American people \nare calling for. I hope we will give our young people a future like we \nhad. I hope we will give our senior citizens the protections they have \nearned and that they need. Let us quit demagoging this issue of Social \nSecurity and realize if we exempt Social Security we will open up such \na loophole that they will change the definition of Social Security, and \nthe Social Security trust funds will be raided day in and day out by \nthese big spenders in Congress because it will be the only way they can \ncontinue business as usual, the status quo, the spending practices that \nhave just about wrecked this country.\n   [[Page S1882]] Mr. President, I really look forward to hearing my \ndear colleague from Illinois, who has been a great leader in this \nbattle. So I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, while I have been engaged in some dialog on \nthe floor on the balanced budget amendment, I have not spoken. I want \nto take this opportunity just to spell out clearly why we need this \nchange in the Constitution.\n  I thank Senator Hatch for his leadership, and also others on the \nother side, Senator Craig, who has been a real Rock of Gibraltar on \nthis. Also Senator Thurmond through the years has been providing \nleadership.\n  On our side I want to pay tribute to a former Senator, Dennis \nDeConcini, who was very helpful, Senator Heflin, Senator Bryan, Senator \nGraham, Senator Robb, Senator Kohl--I could mention others. I am \ngrateful to them all.\n  Leading the opposition is our colleague, Senator Robert Byrd. I want \nto make clear that, while he and I differ strongly on this issue, there \nis no lack of respect on my part for Senator Byrd. He is one of the \nmost valuable Members of this Senate today, one of the most valuable \nMembers in the history of the Senate. I agree with him on this, that \nthis is an issue beyond politics. What we have to look to is the future \nof our country. Forget the polls, forget party affiliation, forget \neverything else. How can we best serve the country? I believe strongly \nwe can best serve the country by passing this constitutional amendment.\n  What is our problem? We have both an economic problem and a political \nproblem. The economic problem, first of all, is very clear as you look \nat the history of nations. If we do not get a hold of this--and if \neveryone forgets everything else I say just remember this--the history \nof nations is you pile up debt and if there is no restraint then you do \nwhat the economists call monetize the debt. You start the printing \npresses rolling and you go from there. And that is where we are headed. \nAs you look into the next century and you see the percentage of deficit \nversus GDP, that is unquestionably where we are headed. We can take a \ngamble that we can be the first nation in history not to follow that \npath, but it is a huge gamble on the future of our country.\n  Listen to Adam Smith in his ``Wealth of Nations,'' published in 1776, \nthe year of our Declaration of Independence. He writes:\n\n       When national debts have once been accumulated to a certain \n     degree, there is scarce, I believe, a single instance of \n     their having been fairly and completely paid. The liberation \n     of the public revenue * * * has always been brought about by \n     a bankruptcy * * *. The raising of the denomination of the \n     coin has been the most usual expedient by which a real public \n     bankruptcy has been disguised * * *. The creditors of the \n     public are really defrauded. Almost all States * * * ancient \n     as well as modern, when reduced to this necessity have * * * \n     played this very juggling trick * * *. The Romans at the end \n     of the First Punic War reduced [the value of] the coin by \n     which they computed the value of all other coins * * *. The \n     [Roman] Republic was in this manner enabled to pay the great \n     debts which it had contracted with the sixth part of what it \n     really owed.\n\n  In other words, your dollar, if I may use a current analogy, $1 \nbecame worth one-sixth of what it was worth. What does that do to the \nSocial Security trust fund? It just devastates it. What does it do to \nfamily savings? Devastates them. What does it do to the economy of the \ncountry? Devastates it. What does it do politically? It causes chaos. \nWe do not know where we are headed on this.\n  For those who say that just is not going to happen, do not take my \nword for it. Take a look at what the OMB put forward last year as part \nof the budget. This table is taken directly from there: ``Lifetime Net \nTax Rates Under Alternative Policies.''\n  I was born in 1928, so you go down here to this line--to 1930--and \nyou see that before we passed the August 1993 budget reconciliation \nbill, I would have spent in my lifetime 30.5 percent on taxes. It is \nnot changed much by the reconciliation bill, 30.6 percent; with health \ncare reform I would spend 30.9 percent, or a lifetime of roughly 30.9 \npercent with or without health care reform.\n  But then look down here, to the line for ``future generations.'' The \ngrandchildren of Robert Bennett and John Ashcroft and Paul Simon and \nthe people who work here: future generations.\n  What does it say about the budget reconciliation--spending 93.7 \npercent of lifetime earnings in taxes? After budget reconciliation, 82 \npercent of lifetime earnings, with health care reform, would have gone \nto 66 percent, or without health care reform, because it did not pass, \n75 percent. That is just not going to happen. No one is going to spend \n75 percent of their lifetime earnings in taxation. What you do is you \nstart the printing presses rolling.\n  One of the great fights early in our history was taxation without \nrepresentation. Talk about future generations and taxation without \nrepresentation--what we are doing is living on a huge credit card \nsaying send the bill to our children and grandchildren, send the bill \nto the pages who are here, and send the bill to my three grandchildren, \nthe oldest of whom turned 5 just the other day.\n  Thomas Jefferson was the first person to advocate a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution. He was not here in the United States \nwhen the Constitution was written. He came back. And, when he came \nback, he said, ``If I could add one amendment to the Constitution it \nwould be to prohibit the Federal Government from borrowing money.'' He \nhad an absolute prohibition. We have some flexibility.\n  We say with 60 percent growth you can have a deficit. But the history \nof nations is clear. There is a book written by a man named Michael \nVeseth, published by Oxford University Press, entitled ``Mountains of \nDebt.'' It goes into the history of modern city states, and starting in \nthe early 15th century. He comments on Florence and other city nations \nat that point. He says:\n\n       The fiscal imperatives caused by huge debt drain away the \n     capital that might have helped Florence adjust to the new \n     world economy and growth in the future. By 1494, the future \n     pattern of the Florentine economy was set, and Florence's \n     years of economic power and influence were over.\n\n  Again, we can take a chance that we are not going to follow the path \nof Florence, of all the other nations since but we are taking a huge \nchance.\n  This is what is happening in terms of our expenditures in inflation-\nadjusted percentages. What has happened between fiscal year 1980 to \nfiscal year 1994 is that education--we all make speeches how important \neducation is to our future, and the Presiding Officer and I were \ntalking about that in committee the other day--education is down 13 \npercent; transportation is down 2 percent; get over here to defense, a \nlot of people think that is the biggest growth item, 18 percent growth; \nentitlements have grown 50 percent largely because of growth in numbers \nand because of health care reform; get over here to gross interest, it \nhas grown 120 percent.\n  I do not care whether you are a conservative, liberal, Democrat, or \nRepublican. The expanding increase in percentage of our tax dollar on \ninterest just is not rational. We simply have to do better. What is \nhappening to our country in terms of economic independence? If the \nSimon family gets too deeply into debt, you start losing your \nindependence. The same is true for a nation. Right now we know, because \nwe require public disclosure, that 17 percent of our debt, or a little \nbetter than $800 billion, is held by other countries, and people in \nother countries.\n  In addition, many countries do not permit their citizens to hold \nforeign bonds. So there are some countries where the citizens use some \nother person as a front, and, in fact, hold U.S. bonds. So it is in \nexcess of $800 billion. There was a time when people said about the \ndeficit, ``We owe it to ourselves.'' That is no longer true.\n  I can remember when I was in the House and I opposed an arms sale to \nSaudi Arabia. I can remember a Treasury Department official coming into \nmy office saying, ``Please do not vote against this arms sale to Saudi \nArabia because among other things Saudi Arabia holds a lot of our \nbonds.'' That is what is happening.\n  Let me give you a bit of history that a lot of people have not paid \nattention to. In 1956--my colleague from Utah is old enough to remember \n1956 along with me--President Nasser of Egypt grabbed the Suez Canal, \nand just before the 1956 election when President Eisenhower was running \nfor reelection, the British, the French, and Israelis ran through and \nseized the Suez Canal. \n[[Page S1883]]  They believed I think because they were our good \nfriends and allies, and because it was just before the election, that \nthe United States would not do anything. We did not send a soldier \nanywhere. Because the British were deeply in debt, we threatened to \ndump the pound sterling. And, without firing a shot, they withdrew. You \nlose your independence when you get too deeply into debt.\n  Let me use a more practical illustration. Let us say Senator John \nAshcroft was not a Member of the U.S. Senate but the president of the \nFirst National Bank in Carbondale, IL, and I went to him, and I said \n``Mr. President, I would like to borrow more money than I take in this \nyear. Will you lend me some money?'' And he would do it for 1 year, and \nmaybe 2 years, and maybe 3 years. But at some point a prudent banker is \ngoing to say I had better put my money somewhere else.\n  We have gone to the international bankers for 26 years in a row \nsaying we want to borrow some money because we want to spend more than \nwe take in. And at some point prudent international bankers are going \nto start saying no. We do not know when that point is going to be \nreached.\n  Lester Thurow, one of the Nation's great economists, says at some \npoint international bankers are going to say no to us. He said the \nquestion is not if they are going to say no. The question is when they \nare going to say no.\n  Alan Greenspan testifying the other day said:\n\n       In today's more open and integrated international capital \n     markets, it is easier to finance investment abroad. But this \n     does not mean that we should view the pattern of U.S. \n     external deficits as sustainable in the long run. Looking \n     back at the history of the past century or more, the record \n     would suggest that nations ultimately must rely on their \n     domestic savings to support domestic investment.\n\n  The New York Federal Reserve Bank did a study from 1978 to 1988 of \nwhat the deficit has, of what our lack of savings primarily caused by \nthe deficit has cost us. They came to the conclusion that in that 10-\nyear period we lost 5 percent growth in GDP, in our gross domestic \nproduct; 1 percent, according to the Congressional Budget Office, is \n600,000 jobs.\n  That means a loss of 3 million jobs. The General Accounting Office, \nin June 1992, issued a very significant report, in which it said if we \ndo not get ahold of things, we are going to have a gradual decline in \nour quality of life and our standard of living. If, by the year 2001--\nthat was the year at which they put it, and this year we are talking \nabout 2002 for balancing but it basically holds--if by the year 2001 we \nbalance the budget, then by 2020 the average American will have a real \ngrowth in quality of life and income of 36 percent. Those are huge \nnumbers.\n  If we do not adopt this balanced budget amendment, we are headed \ntoward continual decline. We did, to the credit of President Clinton \nand, I think, to the majority in this body and the other body, pass a \nbudget reconciliation bill in August 1993 that has helped. Our \ncolleague Senator Robert Kerrey described it as a modest improvement.\n  I am going to switch charts here. It shows clearly that we have \nreduced the deficit here, but it is also clear we are headed way, way \nup, far beyond anything we have known in terms of deficits. Let me \nquote just a few sentences from the GAO, and these sentences are taken \nfrom different parts of the report. But, I am not, I believe, taking \nanything out of context and distorting what they say.\n\n       Early action to reduce the deficit pays huge dividends in \n     lower interest costs. Must come from program cuts or revenue \n     increases. The more rapidly interest costs can be brought \n     down, the less sacrifice is required.\n\n  They also say,\n\n       To prevent stagnation in the living standards for future \n     workers, if deficits are not reduced, the Government will \n     have no fiscal flexibility to increase its investment in \n     better infrastructure, technology and skills. Large and \n     continued deficits are likely to seriously inhibit the growth \n     of the economy under current and present foreseeable economic \n     conditions. Inaction is not a sustainable policy.\n\n  They predict ``a deteriorating American economy, if we do not get \nahold of it. Action that is stronger and taken sooner yields greater \nlong-range benefits.''\n  They include a study of Japan, Australia, Germany, and the United \nKingdom. They all had deficits, along with the United States, in 1981. \nAll but Australia's was significantly greater than the United States \ndeficit. By 1989, Japan, Australia, and Germany had surpluses. Great \nBritain had a deficit about 2 percent of ours, while ours had grown \nsubstantially.\n  Eliminating the budget deficit and, if possible, achieving a budget \nsurplus should be among the Nation's highest priorities. Because of the \naccumulating burden of interest and the mounting public debt, it is \nimportant to move rapidly.\n  Take the report we got a few days ago from Data Resources, Inc., one \nof the two most prestigious econometric forecasters in the Nation. I \nwill quote a little bit:\n\n       A balanced budget would be a major boost to the long-term \n     growth of the U.S. economy.\n       Over a 5-year period--\n\n  We are talking really about a 7-year period now.\n\n     this can be done with few problems. Today, when the Fed is \n     trying to slow the economy anyway, would be a good time to \n     start. Balancing the cuts would require real interest rates \n     to drop to their lowest levels since the 1970's.\n\n  They predict a drop of 2.5 percent in the interest rates if we move \non this. The Wharton School, the other prestigious group, predicts a \ndrop of 4 percent. I do not know who is right, but even if it is half \nthose figures, that is tremendous.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Will the Senator yield for a comment?\n  Mr. SIMON. I am pleased to yield to my colleague from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have taken to writing out a simple \nequation for my colleagues on this side, and I would be delighted to \nhave the Senator adopt this on the other side. I take a piece of paper \nand I write simply ``1 percent equals $48 billion.'' People say, ``What \ndoes that mean?'' I say, ``When you have a national debt of $4.8 \ntrillion, 1 percent of $4.8 trillion is $48 billion. If we lower the \ncost of funding that $4.8 trillion debt by 1 percentage point in \ninterest rates, we save $48 billion every year.''\n  The Senator has just told us, Mr. President, that the balanced budget \namendment could lower the interest rates by anywhere from 2 to 4 \npercent. We are talking, if the Senator's information is correct, \nanywhere from $100 to $200 billion a year in savings on the interest \nrate alone. I think it should be stressed that the Senator has touched \na point here that often gets overlooked. We talk about spending cuts, \nwe talk about tax increases. Do you know how painful it will be in this \nbody if we say we have to increase taxes $200 billion a year to balance \nthe budget? Or that we have to cut spending $200 billion a year to \nbalance the budget? If we can get somewhere between $100 to $200 \nbillion a year in savings simply on the interest rate alone, we will \nhave done more than a good day's work.\n  I thank the Senator for raising that issue of the impact of interest \nrates on the Federal economy.\n  Mr. SIMON. I thank my colleague. Just to buttress what he has said, \nData Resources, Inc., said this, and I will read the full paragraph:\n\n       The positive elements of balancing the budget become clear \n     in the longer run. The elimination of the deficit would \n     relieve strain on financial markets, allowing lower interest \n     rates and bond yields. The lower interest rates and reduced \n     borrowing would cut interest costs for the federal \n     government; in fact, by 2002 half the savings [that we are \n     talking about we need] in our budget simulations come from \n     lower interest costs.\n\n  And in addition, you would have, according to their projections, 2\\1/\n2\\ million more people working. You are going to have more housing \nstarts, more industrial investment, and everything else.\n  Alan Greenspan, again, testifying the other day, said:\n\n       But the influence of a fiscal imbalance of the federal \n     government on capital formation is broader than inflation. \n     The federal deficit drains off a large share of a regrettably \n     small pool of domestic private saving, thus contributing \n     further to the elevation of real rates of interest in this \n     economy.\n\n  It is very clear. I have to acknowledge that Dr. Reischauer has \ntestified against the balanced budget amendment. But in his testimony \nof June 17 of last year, I will quote a few things:\n\n       [[Page S1884]] * * * we and other economists can see \n     clearly that national saving is too low, no matter how it is \n     measured, and that federal deficits contribute significantly \n     to low saving. It is equally clear to us that reducing \n     federal deficits offers the most reliable way to remove the \n     threat that low national saving poses to the growth of living \n     standards.\n       * * * history has shown repeatedly that sustained growth in \n     living standards is achieved most reliably through national \n     saving.\n\n  And then they have a chart on what is happening in national savings, \nour savings rate. From 1960 to 1969 we average an 8-percent savings \nrate; from 1970 to 1979, 7.1 percent; from 1980 to 1989, 3.8 percent, \nand going down. No other industrial country has anything like that in \nthe way of savings rates that bad.\n\n       The main cause of the decline in the national savings rate \n     is rampant Federal deficits after the 1970's * * * federal \n     deficits could be responsible for between one-half and two-\n     thirds of the decline in the national savings rate, depending \n     on how they are measured, with a reduction of private saving \n     accounting for the rest of the decline.\n\n  And so it goes on. Here is one other quote in here I wanted to give \nyou:\n\n       * * * deficits will soon rise again and keep national \n     saving too low to prevent further slowdown in the growth of \n     living standards.\n\n  I will show you one other chart. This is what happened in the deficit \nover the years. We are down here, and you will see 2 years in a row \nwhere it is being reduced, and it comes back up here a little bit, and \nthen it goes down off the chart. It is going to go beyond the floor. We \nare not going to put that one on the chart. That is what is happening \nin our country.\n  Some of us had the chance to work with Roger Porter when he worked in \nthe White House. He is now is a professor of government at Harvard.\n  He says:\n\n       The second reason for passing the balanced-budget amendment \n     is moral. Persistent public borrowing, largely for the \n     purpose of current consumption, is analogous to one \n     generation throwing a party and saddling the next generation \n     with the bill. We view such behavior on the part of \n     individuals with disdain and contempt. One is hard-pressed to \n     find moral justification for such behavior, whether \n     individual or collective.\n\n  Roger Porter is correct.\n  I heard about the Louisiana Purchase, that we cannot pass this \nbecause we could not have had the Louisiana Purchase. First of all, it \nis interesting that in Jefferson's first term, he cut the Federal debt \nin half.\n  But the Louisiana Purchase was signed May 13, 1803, in Paris--and, \nfrankly, they did not have any authorization to do anything like that--\nand 2 months later, in July, we learned about it here in Washington, \nDC. It was for $15 million at 5 percent.\n  Do you know what the main complaint of Secretary of the Treasury \nAlbert Gallatin was at that point? He complained because the bonds were \nsuch that they could not start paying them back for 15 years. That was \nthe big complaint.\n  We say, you can have a deficit if you have a 60-percent vote. What \nwas the vote in the Senate and in the House on the Louisiana Purchase? \nThere were two votes in the Senate, 24 to 7 and 26 to 6, far more than \nthe 60 percent. In the House, it was 90 to 25, far more than the 60 \npercent.\n  There is simply no justification for saying we could not have done \nsomething like the Louisiana Purchase.\n  And then, my friends--and I feel strongly about this--we are having a \nsqueeze on social programs. This fiscal year, we will spend $339 \nbillion on interest; next year, $372 billion.\n  I might add--and I give credit to my colleague, Senator Fritz \nHollings, for teaching me this--in only one area do we subtract the \nearnings of the Government. Administrations like to come up with net \ninterest. It does not look so bad. The real figure is gross interest.\n  It is like the Department of Justice subtracting all the money \ncollected from their total bill, or the IRS doing that. That is just \nnot the way we do it.\n  But what does $339 billion mean? It means that this year we are \nspending 11 times as much on interest as education. Oh, we make great \nspeeches about education, but we are not funding it like we should. In \nfiscal year 1949, we spent 9 percent of the Federal budget on \neducation. This year, we will spend 2 percent of the Federal budget on \neducation. Interest is squeezing out our response.\n  I heard Senator Bennett Johnston yesterday say that in an exit poll, \nwhen people were asked what the Federal Government spends money on, 27 \npercent thought the big item was foreign economic assistance. We will \nspend this year 22 times as much on interest as on foreign economic \nassistance. We will spend almost twice as much on interest as on all \nthe poverty programs combined.\n  Listen to what my House colleague, Congressman Joe Kennedy, who is \none of the cosponsors of this legislation, said in the House. This is \non January 25.\n\n       Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the \n     balanced budget amendment. I have been for the balanced \n     budget amendment for the last several years, because I do not \n     believe that we can find the will to make the necessary cuts \n     to save the future generations of this country without the \n     support of the American people through a balanced budget.\n\n  And then, he says, people come up to him and say:\n\n       Listen, Joe, you are a liberal Democrat, how can you \n     possibly be for a balanced budget amendment? It is going to \n     cut the very programs that much of your family and others \n     have stood for generations.\n\n  And here is Congressman Kennedy's response:\n\n       I say to them that those very programs that stand up for \n     the working people and the poor and the senior citizens of \n     this country have suffered the worst cuts over the course of \n     the last 15 or 20 years in this country as a result of budget \n     deficits.\n       Look at the housing budget. Cut by 77 percent over the \n     course of the last 15 years. Look at those who have press \n     conferences that say they want to protect fuel assistance for \n     the poor. Look at what has happened to the fuel assistance \n     program. Cut by 30 percent.\n\n  And then he goes to some other things. This is his final line, and I \nhope we remember it:\n\n       Do we see the bellies of our poorest children filled as a \n     result of interest payments on the national debt?\n\n  Let me repeat that:\n\n       Do we see the bellies of our poorest children filled as a \n     result of interest payments on the national debt?\n\n  Well, the answer is obvious. Oh, we are talking about welfare reform, \nand I am not optimistic we are going to get genuine welfare reform. I \nhope I am wrong. But it is interesting, welfare payments from 1970 to \n1993, when you take in the inflation factor, have been reduced about 40 \npercent. That is because of the squeeze of interest.\n  Or take a look at New York City. New York City went bankrupt, or for \nall practical purposes bankrupt. They had to cut programs for poor \npeople by as much as 47 percent. But New York City had the advantage of \nhaving an umbrella called the United States of America and we rescued \nNew York City.\n  There is no umbrella big enough to rescue the United States of \nAmerica. If we go down the tube, the programs for poor people and the \nprograms that we need in education and other things are just going to \nbe devastated.\n  It is also interesting that in New York City, they still have a mayor \nand city council, but for any significant expenditure they make, do you \nknow who has to approve it? They have a little group of bankers and \nbond holders that has to approve anything like that. New York City has, \nto a great extent, lost its independence.\n  We may be able to put something together if and when the time arrives \nthat we have difficulties, but it is going to be at the cost of losing \na great deal of our independence.\n  Back maybe 2 years or so ago, I had an illustration of why it is \nimportant not only for the poor in our country but for the poor in \nother countries.\n  The IMF had asked for a $12 billion guarantee from the United States. \nI received an invitation to have breakfast with the Director of the \nInternational Monetary Fund. I thought, well, he is reaching down \npretty far on the Foreign Relations Committee to talk to someone, \nbecause I am about halfway down there.\n  I went over and he did not want to talk about the guarantee. He \nwanted to talk about what we are doing fiscally. He said--and I do not \nknow if he was speaking in a slight exaggeration or not, but Alan \nGreenspan tells me he was not--``If you had a choice of getting hold of \nyour deficit or cutting out the entire foreign aid program''--and I \ncertainly do not favor that--``If you \n[[Page S1885]]  had a choice, if you want to help the poor people in \nthe world, get rid of your deficit. What you are doing is borrowing and \nsending up the costs of borrowing for the poor nations of the world.''\n  In terms of social programs, it is very clear what we are doing. When \nwe talk about spending $339 billion this year, we are talking about a \nmassive redistribution of wealth. Who pays the $339 billion? By and \nlarge, Americans of limited means. Who collects the $339 billion? By \nand large, those who are more fortunate, who hold the T-bills, and \nincreasingly those beyond our borders.\n  We hear a lot about the trade deficit. This is very interesting. I \nasked the Congressional Research Service, what does a budget deficit \nhave to do with the trade deficit? They came in, 37 to 55 percent of \nthe trade deficit is caused by our budget deficit. What it does is \nescalates the value of the dollar. It makes it more profitable for \nindustries to put their investment in other countries, and makes it \nmore costly for them to put their investments here.\n  It is very interesting that as our deficit has gone up and our \ninterest payments have gone up, we have been losing relative to other \ncountries. As late as 1986, the average American working in a \nmanufacturing location was being paid more money than in any other \ncountry. Now there are 13 nations on the face of the Earth where the \naverage manufacturing wage is greater than ours. That is, in large \npart, because of the budget deficit.\n  We have a political problem, too. I hear the speeches on the floor, \n``We can do it without a balanced budget amendment. All it takes is \npolitical will.'' We heard those same speeches in 1986 when this failed \nby one vote to pass the U.S. Senate. In 1986, the deficit was $2 \ntrillion. Now, 9 years later, that deficit is $4.7 trillion. And we \nhear the same speeches. If we should show the poor judgment not to pass \nthis, then 5 years from now, 10 years from now, we will hear the same \nspeeches.\n  What would have happened to our country if, in 1986, that had passed? \nWe would have millions more people working; we would have lower \ninterest rates; we would have more housing in our country; we would \nhave more revenue for the Federal Government; we would have a higher \nstandard of living for our people; and we would have a lower trade \ndeficit. If we pass this, we will move in that direction.\n  Then the argument is made, and I have heard it several times already, \nbut what if there is a recession? Listening to what the National Bureau \nof Economic Research in Cambridge had to say, in a report made by two \nprofessors in the department of economics at the University of \nCalifornia:\n\n       Discretionary fiscal policy does not appear to have had an \n     important role in generating recoveries. Fiscal responses to \n     economic downturns have generally not occurred until real \n     activity was approximately at its trough.\n\n  Or listen to an article written by Bruce Bartlett in the Public \nInterest, and I ask unanimous consent that this full article be placed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Public Interest, summer 1993]\n\n                    How Not To Stimulate the Economy\n\n                          (By Bruce Bartlett)\n\n       Shortly after taking office, President Clinton began \n     pushing for a stimulus program to end the country's \n     recession. But according to the National Bureau of Economic \n     Research, the recession was already over. It began in July \n     1990 and ended in March 1991. Since that time the U.S. \n     economy has expanded continuously. By the end of 1992, in \n     fact, the economy was growing at an annual rate of 4.7 \n     percent--almost twice the postwar average.\n       Fortunately, Congress was less persuaded of the need for \n     stimulus than Clinton. His proposal was withdrawn. But months \n     later the administration was still pushing for a scaled-down \n     stimulus bill, even as the unemployment rate continued to \n     decline.\n       Probably the best defense of Clinton's action is that he \n     was simply doing what our last ten presidents all did. All \n     these presidents, regardless of party or ideology, ultimately \n     endorsed public works programs to combat recessions that were \n     already over.\n       This article will review the results of this curious \n     phenomenon. Without exception, stimulus programs have failed \n     to moderate the recessions at which they were aimed, and have \n     often sowed the seeds of the next recession. These programs \n     have not been simply worthless, but harmful. It would have \n     been better to do nothing.\n\n\n                          keynesian economics\n\n       The idea of using public works to jump-start the economy is \n     not a new one. Since at least the late nineteenth century, \n     governments have attempted to use public works in a \n     countercyclical manner. But until John Maynard Keynes, \n     governments felt constrained by the need to keep their \n     budgets in balance. Since recessions invariably shrink tax \n     revenues, few governments could afford to increase spending \n     on public works as a countercyclical measure. Keynes, by \n     preaching the efficacy of deficit spending, relieved \n     governments of this constraint.\n       Keynes also freed governments of the need to fund public \n     works projects that were useful. In The General Theory, he \n     wrote that pyramid-building, earthquakes, and even wars ``may \n     serve to increase wealth.'' He suggested that people be paid \n     to dig holes in the ground, and even proposed burying bank \n     notes in mine shafts to encourage the digging.\n       Although it is widely believed that the public works \n     projects of the New Deal played a major role in ending--or at \n     least mitigating--the Great Depression, such programs \n     actually played a very limited role. It was World War II and \n     monetary policy, not the New Deal, that ended the Depression. \n     Unfortunately, policymakers have convinced themselves \n     otherwise. And so, whenever another slowdown has occurred, \n     they have turned to the same programs they believe ended the \n     Great Depression.\n       This over-reliance on fiscal policy has given the U.S. \n     massive deficits and debt, which requires even greater \n     payments for interest. Large deficits also crowd out private \n     borrowers, raising interest rates, and reducing investment, \n     growth, and productivity. Finally, deficits put pressure on \n     the Federal Reserve to increase the money supply, which leads \n     to inflation.\n       For an illustration of these points, let us take a brief \n     look at the postwar economic experience.\n               the truman and eisenhower administrations\n\n       The first recession of the postwar era began in November \n     1948. Initially the Truman administration was oblivious, as \n     were most private economists. In mid-December, for example, \n     Treasury Secretary John Snyder said the economy ``is at \n     present in a basically sound condition, and shows encouraging \n     signs of stability in the vicinity of the present high \n     levels.'' A survey of private economists found similar \n     optimism: 59 percent expected business to expand; only 41 \n     percent expected a decline. And this was after the recession \n     had already begun!\n       It was not until eight months later that President Truman \n     asked Congress to pass an antirecession program. Congress did \n     eventually pass the Advance Planning for Public Works Act, \n     and it took effect in October 1949--the very month the \n     recession ended.\n       The first of three recessions under President Eisenhower \n     began in July 1953, shortly after he took office. There is no \n     evidence Eisenhower was even aware a recession had begun. \n     Later, when signs of a slowdown became unmistakable, \n     Eisenhower supported a small increase in highway spending. \n     But no significant action was taken to counteract the \n     recession, which ended three months later.\n       Eisenhower confronted a second recession in August 1957. \n     Again, there is no evidence he saw it coming. In July, \n     Treasury Secretary George Humphrey told the Senate Finance \n     Committee, ``I don't see any significant recession or \n     depression in the offing.''\n       Although the Eisenhower administration did not put forward \n     any antirecession legislation, it did acquiesce in \n     congressional efforts. Congress passed and Eisenhower signed \n     bills to increase grants to states for highway construction, \n     and to increase federal spending on rivers and harbors. The \n     highway bill became law in April 1958, and the rivers and \n     harbors bill was signed in July. The recession had ended in \n     April.\n\n\n                       the kennedy administration\n\n       The third recession under Eisenhower began in April 1960, \n     and it contributed to the election of John F. Kennedy. Upon\n      taking office in January 1961, Kennedy moved quickly to \n     enact antirecession legislation. A key element of his \n     program was the Area Redevelopment Act (ARA), which sent \n     federal aid to areas with high unemployment. It was signed \n     into law on May 1, although the recession had ended in \n     February.\n       An early assessment of the ARA by Sar Levitan, a professor \n     of economics at George Washington University, found that 40 \n     percent of its funds went simply to reimburse other \n     government agencies. Moreover, almost any project undertaken \n     in a depressed area was eligible for ARA funding, even if it \n     would have been undertaken anyway. Thus while 7,100 miles of \n     ARA-funded roads were built in depressed areas. Levitan \n     notes, the Federal Highway Administration ``could not point \n     to a single mile of road which was constructed as a result of \n     priorities accorded to depressed areas.''\n       In 1962, Congress passed more antirecession legislation--\n     the Accelerated Public Works (APW) program, Subsequent \n     analysis shows that the peak employment created by this \n     program did not come until June 1964--thirty-nine months \n     after the end of the recession. Spending was so drawn-out \n     that expenditures were still being made nine years later.\n        [[Page S1886]] A follow-up report by the General \n     Accounting Office (GAO) found that the number of jobs created \n     by the ARA and the APW had been overstated by 128 percent. \n     Another GAO study found the overstatement to be 94 percent. \n     The GAO also found that only 55 percent of the jobs created \n     by the APW went to workers living in the areas where the \n     projects were located, and that most of the jobs went to \n     contractors' regular employees rather than unemployed local \n     persons. Partially as a result of such criticism, Congress \n     abolished the Area Redevelopment Administration (which \n     administered the ARA and APW) in 1965.\n\n\n                   the nixon and ford administrations\n\n       The country's next recession began in December 1969 and \n     ended in November 1970. Antirecession legislation, however, \n     was not enacted until August 1971. That legislation--the \n     Public Works Acceleration Act--funded public works in \n     designated areas of high unemployment. It was predicted by \n     the Economic Development Administration that the program \n     would create 62,000 man-months of employment in the first two \n     years, with 75 percent of\n      the jobs going to the previously unemployed. A Commerce \n     Department study, however, found that only 39,000 man-\n     months of employment were created, and that only 22 \n     percent of the jobs went to the unemployed. The average \n     job lasted just four weeks.\n       The next recession was the worst of the postwar era. It \n     began in November 1973, following the OPEC oil embargo. Yet \n     antirecession legislation, in the form of a tax rebate, was \n     not enacted until March 1975, the month the recession ended. \n     THe $22.8 billion legislation gave taxpayers a 10 percent \n     rebate on their 1974 tax payments (with a maximum rebate of \n     $200). The bill also extended unemployment benefits, \n     increased the investment tax credit from 7 to 10 percent, and \n     made various other tax changes. All this was intended to pump \n     up demand by putting dollars into people's pockets. \n     Subsequent analysis, however, shows that most of the money \n     was initially saved, not spent. The bill had no significant \n     stimulative effect.\n       During the following year, Congress determined that the \n     lingering effects of the recession justified further \n     antirecessionary action. Over the veto of President Ford, \n     Congress established the Antirecession Fiscal Assistance \n     Program (ARFA), and the Local Public Works Program (LPW). The \n     LPW increased funding for public works by $2 billion. The \n     ARFA program increased revenue-sharing by $1.25 billion.\n       As late as 1977, in fact, Congress was still enacting \n     legislation to deal with the aftermath of the 1973-75 \n     recession. The Local Public Works Capital Development and \n     Investment Act of 1976 added another $4 billion to the LPW \n     program. The ARFA program was also extended for another year \n     and its funding increased by another $1.75 billion.\n       Subsequent analysis shows that these program were failures. \n     A Treasury Department study of the ARFA program found that \n     because the funds were not disbursed until well after the end \n     of the recession, they failed to provide assistance when it \n     was most needed and probably contributed to inflationary \n     pressures during the economic expansion. The study also found \n     that, rather than spend federal money immediately, state and \n     local governments tended to save it. Thus state and local \n     government budget surpluses increased, mitigating the \n     stimulative effect of the federal programs. Another study, by \n     the GAO, found that ARFA grants\n      often went to areas unaffected by the recession, and \n     concluded that the program was not particularly effective \n     as a countercyclical tool.\n       The LPW program was also ineffective. Although the \n     recession ended in March 1975, 20 percent of the program's \n     funds were spent in 1977, 61 percent in 1978, 18 percent in \n     1979, and 1 percent in 1980. In a study commissioned by the \n     Commerce Department, Chase Econometrics estimated that the \n     cost per direct job created was $95,000.\n       Chase and the Commerce Department found other problems. \n     Between 25 and 30 percent of LPW funds paid for projects that \n     would have been funded by state and local governments anyway, \n     and another 9 percent of LPW funds crowded out private \n     expenditures that would otherwise have occurred. In addition, \n     only 12 percent of workers on LPW projects were previously \n     unemployed, and half of those had been unemployed less than \n     five weeks. The average job lasted just 2.6 months. Finally, \n     due to the Davis-Bacon Act, workers on LPW projects were paid \n     more than before--for the same work.\n       The LPW program has also been severely criticized by \n     University of Michigan economist Edward Gramlich. He argues \n     that because the program had no allocation formula, required \n     no matching funds, and funded only projects that could be \n     started within 90 days, it virtually guaranteed that the only \n     projects funded would be those that would have been built \n     anyway. He has also noted that since the Commerce Department \n     received some $22 billion worth of project applications for \n     just $2 billion in federal funds, the LPW program apparently \n     postponed $22 billion worth of construction spending, thus \n     reducing GNP by $30 billion. Instead of stimulating the \n     economy, the LPW program was actually contractionary.\n\n\n                  the carter and reagan administration\n\n       Despite the many problems of the LPW program, one of the \n     Jimmy Carter's first acts upon taking office was to push for \n     its expansion. The Congressional Budget Office argued that an \n     expansion would have no impact on the economy for at least a \n     year, but Carter proceeded anyway. He signed the expansion \n     legislation on May 13, twenty-six months after the end of the\n      recession.\n       Another recession developed in 1980, as a result of \n     Carter's ill-considered imposition of credit controls. \n     Although the recession was over by mid-year--after the \n     lifting of controls--Carter continued to press for money for \n     antirecessionary public works. It was then revealed that some \n     $100 billion was already available from previous programs--\n     fifty times more than Carter was asking for. According to \n     analyst Pat Choate, these funds were held up by a combination \n     of incompetence at the state and local level, and federal \n     regulations that made it difficult to get money released.\n       Even the Reagan administration, despite its general \n     aversion to such policies, adopted two antirecessionary \n     programs. They were designed to attack a recession that began \n     in July 1981 and ended in November 1982. The first of the \n     programs was the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of \n     1982, which raised the gasoline tax by five cents a gallon, \n     and increased spending for highways and mass transit by $33.5 \n     billion over five years.\n       With some exceptions, the provisions of the act that \n     created jobs did not go into effect until after the tax \n     increases to pay for them. Thus, in the short run, the \n     legislation was contractionary rather than stimulative.\n\n        TABLE 1.--SURFACE TRANSPORTATION ACT RECEIPTS AND OUTLAYS       \n                        [In billions of dollars]                        \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                    Fiscal year                      Receipts   Outlays \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1983..............................................        1.7        0.6\n1984..............................................        3.8        2.9\n1985..............................................        3.9        5.6\n1986..............................................        3.9        7.3\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       There is also evidence that the act led state and local \n     governments to pull back on their own public works spending \n     in anticipation of new federal funds. Furthermore, many state \n     and local governments ``piggy-backed'' gasoline tax increases \n     on the federal increase. Between 1982 and 1984, twenty-nine \n     states increased their gasoline taxes. The result was a large \n     increase in state and\n      local government budget surpluses, which offset much of the \n     stimulative impact of the federal spending.\n       President Reagan predicted the transportation bill would \n     create 320,000 jobs, but subsequent analysis shows otherwise. \n     In the year following passage of the legislation, employment \n     in highway construction actually grew at a lower rate than \n     did total employment (although wages for highway construction \n     workers did rise sharply.)\n       Interestingly, at the very time that President Reagan was \n     pressing hard for passage of the transportation bill as a \n     jobs program, his Office of Management and Budget produced a \n     study which showed that increases in federal aid for public \n     works actually reduce overall public works spending, because \n     state and local governments respond by cutting back their own \n     spending. Of course, this and other studies had little \n     effect. Both Congress and the administration were under \n     irresistible political pressure to appear to be doing \n     something about the recession, even though it had ended four \n     months earlier.\n       The ink was barely dry on the transportation bill, in fact, \n     when Congress pressed ahead with another antirecession bill, \n     the Emergency Jobs Act of 1983. This act was little more than \n     a grab-bag of pork-barrel projects, most of which just \n     happened to be in the congressional districts of \n     Appropriations Committee members.\n       A GAO study of the act in 1986 noted that it was not passed \n     until twenty-one months after the beginning of the recession. \n     A year and a half after passage, only one-third of the bill's \n     funds had been spent; two and a half years after passage, \n     half of the funds still had not been spent.\n       Job creation peaked in June 1984, but the number of jobs \n     created at that point totalled just 1 percent of the private \n     jobs created since passage of the bill.\n\n\n                  the bush and clinton administrations\n\n       Like its predecessors, the Bush administration adopted an \n     antirecession program after a recession. The $151 billion \n     Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act was signed \n     by the president in November 1991--eight months after \n     recession's end. Congressional supporters of the bill \n     estimated it would create 2 million jobs. The Bush \n     administration, ``eager to embrace\n      the bill as a job creator on the eve of an election year,'' \n     according to Congressional Quarterly, doubled the estimate \n     to 4 million. More than a year later, however, \n     transportation planners told the New York Times that ``the \n     law has neither stimulated the economy nor created many \n     jobs.'' One of the major reasons was the slow pace of \n     construction, which has been attributed to an increase in \n     federal standards for air quality, access for the \n     disabled, and public participation. In the end, the bill \n     did nothing to alleviate the recession or to aid Bush's \n     reelection hopes.\n       As noted earlier, the Clinton administration quickly came \n     forward with a $16 billion stimulus program, despite data \n     showing the \n     [[Page S1887]]  economy to be strengthening. Although the \n     program was promoted as an insurance policy to keep the \n     economy going, the evidence indicates that few, if any, jobs \n     would have been created in the short run. Instead, the main \n     effect of the legislation would have been simply to fund \n     traditional Democratic programs. As Newsweek observed:\n       ``Administration officials concede privately that much of \n     the money will go into highway and transportation projects \n     that won't actually get underway until 1994 or 1995. A good \n     chunk of the rest will raise spending on programs Clinton \n     proposes to expand permanently, like Head Start and infant \n     nutrition. By boosting outlays right away instead of waiting \n     until the next fiscal year starts in October, Clinton can \n     label those initiatives `stimulative.'''\n       A Republican analysis of the cost per job of the Clinton \n     stimulus program found that the average cost was over \n     $89,000, with the cost of some jobs reaching into the \n     millions.\n\n\n                               doing harm\n\n       In 1980, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, now secretary of the Treasury, \n     held a hearing before the Joint Economic Committee on the \n     effectiveness of countercyclical public works programs. At \n     that hearing, President Carter's Office of Management and \n     Budget presented a study that reviewed the postwar experience \n     with such programs. Its conclusions:\n       Public works programs cannot be triggered and targeted in a \n     sufficiently timely manner to compensate for cyclical \n     fluctuations in unemployment and economic activity.\n       Even if it were possible to properly time a countercyclical \n     program, the time it takes to construct public works would \n     lead to a significant overlap of job generation and economic \n     stimulus with periods of economic recovery.\n       Public works programs have had minimal impact on the \n     unemployed. This is partly because the programs are not \n     labor-intensive, and partly because many of the jobs created \n     require skills the unemployed do not have.\n       The duration of employment for individual workers is too \n     short to provide meaningful economic relief, to maintain \n     skills and work habits, or to provide on-the-job training.\n       Public works are extremely costly. The cost of generating a \n     construction job for one year ranges from $70,000 to \n     $198,000.\n       Later Bentsen issued a unanimous report from the Joint \n     Economic Committee which concluded that by the time a \n     recession is recognized, it is too late to be treated. \n     Efforts to do so are destabilizing. The committee recommended \n     avoiding short-term countercyclical actions, and instead \n     focusing on factors that contribute to long-run growth. This \n     was good advice then, and good advice now.\n       Even Lord Keynes, the father of countercyclical policy, \n     eventually recognized its limitations. Toward the end of his \n     life he wrote:\n       ``Organized public works . . . may be the right cure for a \n     chronic tendency to a deficiency of effective demand. But \n     they are not capable of sufficiently rapid organization (and \n     above all cannot be reversed or undone at a later date), to \n     be the most serviceable instrument for the prevention of the \n     trade cycle.''\n       The U.S. economic experience provides ample confirmation.\n\n      TABLE 2.--DATES OF RECESSIONS AND ANTI-RECESSION LEGISLATION      \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                       Antirecession    \n       Beginning                   End                  legislation     \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNovember 1948..........

But \n     they are not capable of sufficiently rapid organization (and \n     above all cannot be reversed or undone at a later date), to \n     be the most serviceable instrument for the prevention of the \n     trade cycle.''\n\n  ``The U.S. economic experience provides ample confirmation,'' the \nauthor of the article says.\n  Fred Bergsten, who serves as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury and \none of our Nation's really fine economists, recommends that we build in \na small surplus. He is suggesting a 2-percent surplus, and then \nauthorizing the President to move quickly with programs when we have \nunemployment above a certain level in any area, whether it is Missouri \nor Illinois or Michigan or Ohio, or wherever it might be.\n  Alan Greenspan has said much the same thing. Interest reduction is a \nfar greater stimulus than any kind of stimulus that we might provide. \nBut we have extended unemployment compensation and people say, well, we \ncould not even do that.\n  We will take a look at the record. The only time I can find where we \nhave not had 60 votes for that was in 1982. But let me start with 1991. \nPassed extension of unemployment compensation; passed the Senate 91-2, \nfar more than the 60 percent required. Later that year, by voice vote, \nanother voice vote. In 1992, 94-2; 1992, another voice vote; later in \n1992, 93-3. In 1993, 66-33; also, in 1993, 76-20.\n  Clearly, we can get the 60 votes to do that.\n  I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, Mr. \nPresident, an article from Investors Business Daily.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Investors Business Daily, Jan. 25, 1995]\n\n A Balanced Budget Myth Bared: Economy Cycles Unlikely to Worsen Under \n                                  Plan\n\n                           (By John Merline)\n\n       A balanced budget amendment will either restore fiscal \n     sanity to a town drunk on deficit spending or lead the \n     country toward economic ruin.\n       Those, at least, are the stark terms typically used by \n     supporters and opponents of a constitutional amendment \n     outlawing deficit spending.\n       And, while passage of a balanced budget amendment is almost \n     a sure thing this year, debates over its merits remain \n     fierce--with critics from all sides of the political spectrum \n     lobbing grenades at it.\n       Democrats don't like the rigidity it imposes while \n     conservatives fear it may bias Congress towards tax \n     increases.\n       One of the principal criticisms of the amendment is that it \n     would short-circuit the federal government's ability to fight \n     recessions, either with ``automatic stabilizers'' or with \n     stimulus spending like temporary tax cuts or spending hikes. \n     Yet there is little evidence to support this view.\n       ``When purchasing power falls in the private sector, the \n     budget restores some of that loss, thereby cushioning the \n     slide,'' said White House budget director Alice Rivlin in \n     testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this \n     month.\n       ``Unemployment compensation, foodstamps and other programs \n     fill the gap in family budgets--and in overall economy \n     activity--until conditions improve,'' she said, defending the \n     budgetary ``automatic stabilizers.''\n       In addition, because of the progressive income tax code, \n     tax liability falls faster than incomes drop in a recession, \n     slowing the decline in after-tax incomes.\n       The result, however, is typically an increase in the \n     deficit.\n       Mandatory balanced budgets would, she argued, force \n     lawmakers either to raise taxes or cut spending in a \n     recession to counteract increased deficits.\n       ``Fiscal policy would exaggerate rather than mitigate \n     swings in the economy,'' she said. ``Recessions would tend to \n     be deeper and longer.''\n       Other economists agree with Rivlin.\n       Edward Regan, a fellow at the Jerome Levy Economics \n     Institute in New York, argued that the amendment would \n     ``restrict government efforts to encourage private sector \n     activity during economic slowdowns.''\n       [[Page S1888]] The assumption, of course, is that these \n     automatic stabilizers actually work as advertised, an \n     assumption not all economists share.\n       ``If anything, I think the government has made economic \n     cycles worse,'' said James Bennett, an economist at George \n     Mason University.\n       Bennett, along with 253 other economists, signed a letter \n     supporting a balanced budget amendment introduced last year \n     by Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill.\n       Ohio University economist Richard Vedder agrees. ``If you \n     look at the unemployment record, to use that one statistic, \n     it was more favorable in the years before we began automatic \n     stabilizers than in the years since,'' he said.\n       Much of the countercyclical programs were implemented in \n     the wake of the Great Depression.\n       Unemployment data show that in the first three decades of \n     this century the average jobless rate was roughly 4.5%.\n\n\n                           prolonging slumps\n\n       In the four decades since World War II, the rate averaged \n     5.7%. And, from 1970 to 1990, it averaged 6.7%.\n       In addition, some of the stabilizers may actually keep \n     people out of the work force for longer periods of time, \n     possibly prolonging economic slumps.\n       A 1990 Congressional Budget Office study found that two-\n     thirds of workers found jobs within three months after their \n     unemployment benefits ran out--suggesting that many could \n     have found work sooner had they not been paid for staying \n     home.\n       Other data suggest that, at most, federal fiscal policy has \n     had only a small stabilizing effect on the economy, despite \n     the sharp increase in the economic role played by government.\n       A study by economist Christina Romer of the University of \n     California at Berkeley found that economic cycles between \n     1869 and 1918 were only modestly more severe than those \n     following World War II.\n       Romer corrected what she said were serious flaws in data \n     used to suggest that the pre-war economy saw far larger \n     swings in economic cycles.\n       The finding runs contrary to conventional wisdom--which \n     posits that government fiscal programs enacted after the \n     Great Depression have greatly reduced the magnitude of boom \n     and bust cycles.\n       ``I think there are plenty of arguments against the \n     balanced budget amendment,'' said Christina Romer in an \n     interview. ``I would not put much emphasis on taking away the \n     government's ability of having countercyclical * * *.\n       Finally, some economists note that the stabilizers Rivlin \n     points to don't have to be a function of government.\n       Private unemployment, farm or other insurance could provide \n     needed cash during economic downturns, they say, replacing \n     the government programs as the provider of these funds.\n       While the effectiveness of automatic stabilizers is doubted \n     by some, straightout antirecessionary stimulus spending has \n     few outright backers--for one simple reason.\n       Every major stimulus package since 1949 was passed after \n     the recession was already over.\n       These packages typically consisted of temporary tax cuts or \n     spending hikes designed to boost economic demand and \n     artificially stimulate growth.\n       The problem has been that, by the time Congress recognizes \n     the economy is in a slump and approves a package, it's too \n     late.\n\n\n                         too little, too late?\n\n       Clinton's failed stimulus package, for example, was \n     proposed nearly two years after the 1990-91 recession ended, \n     and half of the money wouldn't have been spent until 1994 and \n     1995.\n       A study of the 50-year history of stimulus packages by \n     Bruce Bartlett, a senior fellow at the Arlington, Va.-based \n     Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, concluded that ``without \n     exception, stimulus programs have failed to moder- * * * \n     would have little bearing on the government's ability to \n     pursue these policies during recessions.\n       First, the amendment allows Congress to pass an unbalanced \n     budget, as long as it can muster 60% of the votes.\n       And, lawmakers could avoid that by simply running a budget \n     surplus during growth years.\n       ``The best technique is to aim for a modest budget surplus, \n     of about 2% of GDP, over the course of the business cycle,'' \n     Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International \n     Economics, told the Judiciary Committee.\n       ``This would permit the traditional `automatic \n     stabilizers,' and perhaps even some temporary tax cuts and \n     spending increases, to provide a significant stimulus to the \n     economy,'' he said. Interestingly, Rivlin herself made \n     similar arguments in her book, ``Revving the American \n     Dream,'' which was published shortly before she joined the \n     Clinton administration.\n       In that book Rivlin said that the federal government should \n     run annual budget surpluses--increasing national savings and, \n     in turn, economic growth.\n       At the same time, Rivlin said the federal government could \n     strengthen federal ``social insurance'' programs designed to \n     mitigate economic swings.\n       To accomplish this, she proposed shifting whole blocks of \n     federal programs down to the states, including education, \n     welfare, job training, and so * * *.\n  Mr. SIMON. This is the lead story. The headline says: ``A Balanced \nBudget Myth Bared,'' in which the article talks about the fact that, in \nfact, we just do not act promptly enough to move in a recession, so to \nstop the balanced budget on that basis just does not make any sense. \nThe article quotes James Bennett, an economist at George Mason \nUniversity:\n\n       If anything, I think the government has made economic \n     cycles worse.\n\n  I hear this: What about floods, earthquakes? We have an emergency in \nMichigan or Missouri, or someplace, and we have had them in Missouri \nand Illinois recently in our floods.\n  First of all, I will say that I favor creating a special emergency \nfund. We should not create a deficit every time. We ought to create an \nemergency fund of $5 or $10 billion every year, where we can tap into \nthat for emergencies that will occur almost every year.\n  Take a look at the votes on these things. They say, well, we will be \nprevented from helping in natural calamities. Starting in 1991, I have \nnot been able to find a single time when, in an emergency, we declined \nhelping people. Now, there have been times when, years later or \nsometime later, we come back and they want help and they have been \ndeclined. In March 1991, 92 to 8; March 1991, 98 to 1. May 1991, voice \nvote. November 1999, 75 to 17. September 1992, 84 to 10. April 1992, 84 \nto 16. May 1992, 61 to 36. August 1992, voice vote. June 1993, voice \nvote. August 1993, 86 to 14. February 1994, 85 to 10. These are all \nmore than 60 percent.\n  Then the argument is made, well, we will have the courts in this \nmassively. What is the reality? Well, section 6 of this article says.\n\n       The Congress shall enforce and implement this article by \n     appropriate legislation which may rely on estimates of outlay \n     and receipts.\n\n  The only example you have of a Federal court acting is in the case of \nthe State of Missouri, the Jenkins case, and there it was the Federal \ncourt acting, in terms of a State situation, under the 14th amendment, \nbut we had no legislation and so you have a very, very different \nsituation.\n  Second, we can say who has standing. I think we ought to say it takes \n10 Senators or 30 House Members or 3 Governors to go before the courts. \nSo we limit who can go before the courts.\n  And then, finally, the reality is we have a very good enforcement \nmechanism: You cannot increase the debt ceiling without a 60-percent \nvote. I think the likelihood that we are going to go before the courts \nis very, very slim, and the experience of the States is--and 48 of the \n50 States have some kind of provision--the experience of the States is \nthat it is rare for any kind of litigation. I remember when this came \nup--and Senator Abraham will recall this--Senator Hank Brown said in \nthe history of the State of Colorado, which has such a provision in its \nconstitution, there has been no litigation. This idea that we are going \nto be massively in the courts is just not true.\n  Then some say, ``Well, you are going to give the President \nimpoundment authority and the President is going to increase taxes.'' \nIf I thought there was any possibility of that happening, I would favor \nan amendment. I had my staff research this very carefully. And I want \nto pay tribute to Aaron Rapport of my staff who has really done a \nsuperb job, but my staff has researched this and it is very clear, \nthere is no impoundment authority. Anyone who looks at the legislative \nrecord will know that, and we will make it clear through implementing \nlegislation.\n  Then I hear people say, ``It is going to hurt my program, it is going \nto hurt my State, we are getting these letters from the Department of \nDefense and all the other departments.'' If you total up what everyone \nsays is going to hurt and what is going to be taken out, we will have a \nhuge surplus in this Nation.\n  Obviously, these figures are largely phony, and if the President of \nthe United States had made a different decision, we would be getting \nall these letters from people saying what a great thing this is and \nthis is going to be the salvation of our program.\n  I think you have to ask all these agencies and the States what is \ngoing to happen if we do not alter the present path. And the answer is, \ninterest is \n[[Page S1889]]  going to continue to squeeze out our ability to respond \nto States, interest rates are going to continue to go up, and \neventually we will monetize the debt.\n  Then I hear about Social Security, and we are going to have an \namendment on that on the floor. I suggest we listen to Bob Myers, chief \nactuary for Social Security for 21 years, in which he says the only \nprotection that we need that is desperately needed is a balanced budget \namendment so we do not monetize the debt. That is the only way to \nprotect senior citizens.\n  Groups like the AARP, and others who are saying that we should not \npass this are looking short term. They are not looking long term. We \nhave to protect Social Security, and it is true it is running a surplus \nnow, and I would love to balance the budget without that surplus, but \nstarting in the year 2012 or 2013, it starts going in the red. We have \nan obligation to face this problem.\n  President Gerald Ford said:\n\n       Unless we, as a Nation, face up to the facts of fiscal \n     reality and responsibility and the sacrifices required to \n     restore it, the economic time bomb we are sitting on will do \n     us in as surely as any sudden enemy assault. We cannot go on \n     living beyond our means by borrowing from future generations \n     or being bailed out by foreign investors.\n\n  He is absolutely right. We have, and some will argue we have shown in \n1993 we can do something. We did and to the praise of President Clinton \nwe did do something. But you had an unusual confluence of things. You \nhad a brand-new President in his honeymoon period, you had a Congress \nof both Houses that was in his party, and you had a President who had \nthe courage to do something. What happened? Interest rates came down, \neven with the small gesture that we made at that point.\n  Listen to the lead witness against the balanced budget amendment 2 \nyears ago before the House Budget Committee, Professor Laurence Tribe, \nof Harvard. I want to make clear he still opposes a balanced budget \namendment: Listen to what he said:.\n\n       Despite the misgivings I expressed on this score a decade \n     ago, I no longer think that a balanced budget amendment is at \n     a conceptual level an ill-suited kind of provision to include \n     in the Constitution. The Jeffersonian notion that today's \n     populace should not be able to burden future generations with \n     excessive debt does seem to be the kind of fundamental value \n     that is worthy of enshrinement in the Constitution. In a \n     sense, it represents structural protection for the rights of \n     our children and grandchildren.\n\n  People say, ``Well, let's just do it with statutory action.'' I voted \nfor Gramm-Rudman, but as soon as it started to squeeze too much, we \nchanged the law. It is just too easy. For people who say, ``Well, we're \nnot going to pay attention to the Constitution''--John Ashcroft when \nyou took that oath of office right over there, you took only one oath, \nto uphold and defend the Constitution. I cannot imagine any Senator, no \nmatter how extreme, standing up and saying, ``Let's ignore the \nConstitution.'' That just is not going to happen. We are going to pay \nattention to it.\n  The language that we have devised, that we have cleared with a great \nmany people, is constitutional in nature, and those who say we are \nviolating the spirit of the Constitution by requiring more than a \nmajority vote ignore the fact that eight times in the Constitution it \nrequires more than a majority vote to prevent governmental abuse. Have \nwe had governmental abuse in this area? I do not think anyone can say \nanything to the contrary.\n  I also hear, ``Oh, this is just a gimmick.'' I was in a press \nconference with Olympia Snowe, our new colleague in the Senate, when \nshe was in the House, and a reporter said, ``Isn't this just a \ngimmick?'' And she responded, unfortunately with too much accuracy, \n``If it was just a gimmick, Congress would have passed it a long time \nago.'' And I am afraid there is some truth to that.\n  If it were just a gimmick, my friend--and he is my friend--Senator \nRobert Byrd, would not be working so hard against this. The reality is, \nthis has teeth. That debt increase means something.\n  People say, ``Well, we have to show how we are going to do it. If \nthey are talking in broad principles, I am all for, once this passes, \nspelling it out.\n  Let me give you one option, and that is we follow the present limits \nwe set forth in our agreement through 1998 and then a combination of \nthe Bush program for reducing the deficit and the Clinton program, \nsomething somewhat similar, neither of which did any great harm to \nanyone, that will do it by the year 2002.\n  I say to my colleagues who oppose this, who make these great \nspeeches, ``We can do it without a balanced budget amendment,'' they \ninsist we spell out what we are going to do, and I am for spelling it \nout in broad terms. But I think there is a responsibility on the part \nof those who say we can do it without a balanced budget amendment to \nspell it out.\n  We save at least, by the most conservative estimate, about $140 \nbillion in interest and some people say as much as $600 or $700 billion \nin interest. But there is that substantial savings. There is not that \nsavings on the other side.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me just give you one illustration why we \nneed this. Two or 3 years ago, I introduced a bill for long-term care, \na problem that is going to escalate in this country. I had with it a \nhalf-percent increase in Social Security to pay for it. Two of my \ncolleagues in the Senate, one of whom is still in the Senate, came to \nme and said, ``We really like your bill for long-term care. If you will \njust drop the taxes to pay for it, we would like to cosponsor the \nbill.''\n  My friends, that is our problem. Nothing is there to restrain us from \ndoing that. Now, my colleague from Michigan and my colleague from \nMissouri may differ with me on whether or not we ought to have the \nprogram. That ought to be a legitimate area of debate. There should not \nbe a debate that if we have the program, we have to be willing to pay \nfor it, and if we are unwilling to pay for it, we cannot have the \nprogram. That is what it is all about. We need pay-as-you-go \nGovernment.\n  I hope this body will take a look not just at all the pressure groups \nthat are coming at us right now, but take a look at future generations, \ntake a look at those pages, take a look at your children and your \ngrandchildren and ask: How do we best protect them?\n  Deficit reduction is a tax cut for future generations.\n  Do I make a little sacrifice myself so that my three grandchildren \ncan live better? That is the real question. I do not have a hard time \nanswering that. Are we going to have to make some unpopular decisions \nif we pass this? You bet. If it was easy, we would have done this a \nlong time ago. That is why we need a constitutional amendment.\n  So I hope my colleagues will do the right thing--not politically but \nfor future generations. The right thing clearly I think is adopting \nthis balanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the Chair.\n  I rise today in strong support of the balanced budget amendment to \nthe Constitution, and I would like to preface my remarks by extending a \ncompliment to the Senator from Illinois for his extensive work over \nmany years on this issue. Thanks to his leadership, we are already \nmoving in the House and here in the Senate toward adoption of this \nafter many years of debate.\n  In my judgment, the amendment would change the way Congress makes \nbudgetary decisions by severely limiting the option to borrow money. \nCurrently, when faced with demands for more spending, the Congress \nmakes the easy choice to borrow money. Under the balanced budget \namendment, Congress would be forced to make the tough choices, to \neither raise taxes or reduce spending elsewhere, unless it mustered the \nnecessary supermajorities required to deficit spend.\n  With last week's historic vote in the House of Representatives to \napprove the balanced budget amendment by a bipartisan margin of 300 to \n132, the American people sent a clear and powerful message to the \nSenate: It is time to restore fiscal control of the Federal budget and \nprevent politicians from increasing Government spending.\n  In my view, the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution \nembodies the spirit of the electorate that voted for a Republican \nCongress for the first time in 40 years last November, \n[[Page S1890]]  and I believe that we in the Senate must not let them \ndown.\n  When I was out on the campaign trail in Michigan in this most recent \ncampaign, I encountered people all over the State. It did not matter \nwhere they lived. From Detroit to the Upper Peninsula, from Grand \nRapids to Saginaw, north to south, and east to west, they all said the \nsame types of things about the way Congress does business. They were \ntotally perplexed and incapable of understanding why the Congress of \nthe United States could not operate the way they did in their families \nor the way businesses did in trying to meet a bottom line of staying in \nthe black.\n  I was constantly asked, ``Why is that the case? Can you make a \ndifference?'' The one thing that was a clear note of consistent opinion \nacross the spectrum was that the best and surest way to get the Federal \nGovernment under control was by adoption of a balanced budget \namendment. The attitude in my State was not one of asking us to come up \nwith a fancier bookkeeping way of handling Federal spending. They did \nnot want me to come down here and say, ``Well, we will have a balanced \nbudget amendment, but we will leave exceptions for this or that \nprogram; we will put something off budget and make you feel better \nabout the bottom line.''\n  They said, ``Why can't you go down and do what we have to do every \nday in our lives here in Michigan?'' And that is what I came here to \ndo.\n  Now, I have heard some people say in the course of the debate in the \nJudiciary Committee and already in the Chamber that this is not the way \npeople behave. The families of the people of Michigan do not operate \nreally in the black. They buy a house, and when they buy a house they \nhave a debt. And if you put that debt into consideration, at the end of \nthe year they still have that debt. They just make payments on the \ndebt. And to them balancing the family budget really means that the \namount of income they have is equal to the payments they make for the \ngoods and services and the debts they encounter.\n  My response to those people, as I responded in the campaign was, \n``But wait a minute. There is a very simple distinction here. Those \npeople are spending their own money and we are spending the taxpayers' \nmoney.''\n  If people choose in their own lives to buy a house, I do not think \nthat is the Federal Government's business. But if the Federal \nGovernment and those of us entrusted with the responsibility of \nspending over $1.5 trillion a year do not keep the public's interests \nin mind, I think we have made a huge mistake. And so in this campaign I \ngot a clear message. It was a message that I should come here, that I \nshould fight as hard as possible to put this country on a course to \nbring about a balanced budget as fast as possible and that the surest \nway to do it was with a balanced budget amendment. And so today I wish \nto speak about why that is so critical.\n  I believe that requiring a balanced Federal budget should no longer \nbe a question for serious debate. For the past 25 years, the Congress \nhas demonstrated its inability to manage effectively the Nation's purse \nstrings. The national debt now stands in excess of $4.7 trillion. The \nFederal Government currently owes more than $13,000 for every man, \nwoman, and child in America.\n  One of the major reasons for this explosion in Government spending \nand debt is that we have abandoned the implicit balanced budget \nrequirements established by the Nation's Founding Fathers. Indeed, the \nFounding Fathers recognized that persistent Government deficits and the \nunfettered growth of Government had consequences for the long-term \nstability of our democracy and threatened our individual freedoms. The \nreason the Founding Fathers did not include a balanced budget \nrequirement in the Constitution is because they felt it would be \nsuperfluous. Balancing the budget and reducing the outstanding debt \nwere considered the highest priorities of Government. I think Thomas \nJefferson summarized it best when he said that:\n\n       The public debt is the greatest of dangers to be feared by \n     a republican Government.\n\n  Because of this implicit balanced budget requirement, Government \nspending remained low, rarely exceeding 10 percent of our national \nincome, for the first 150 years of this Republic. But starting in the \nmid 1930's, the rise of Keynesian economics gave politicians an \neconomic rationale to increase Government spending. As a result, fiscal \ndiscipline was abandoned. Today, Federal spending as a share of our \nnational income stands at 22 percent. Deficit spending has now become \nthe fiscal norm. The purpose of the balanced budget amendment is to \nrestore fiscal discipline upon the Congress by placing the balanced \nbudget obligation in the supreme law of the land. Absent such an \namendment, the Congress has proven itself incapable of making difficult \nspending decisions, given its free and easy access to deficit spending.\n  The amendment would contribute to a balanced budget by transforming \nthe critical questions asked by Members of Congress who confront \nspending interests. Instead of asking merely, ``Is this a desirable \nspending measure or program?'' they will instead have to ask, ``Is this \nspending measure so desirable that we should either reduce spending for \nsome other spending measure or raise taxes on the people to pay for \nit?''\n  The psychology of the budget process will also be transformed. No \nlonger will spending interests be competing against the taxpayer for a \nportion of an unlimited budget. Rather, they will be competing against \neach other for a portion of a limited budget. No one doubts that \nGovernors of States with balanced budget requirements will propose \nbalanced budgets because they are obligated to do so. When the Congress \nis also obligated to do the same, I believe they, too, will propose \nbalanced budgets. The details will inevitably be fought out in the \nbudget process, where they should be. Without a balanced budget \namendment, this Nation could be looking at Federal deficits in the \ntrillions of dollars within 15 years.\n  All the opponents of the amendment want to talk about is the cost of \nreducing spending programs for special interests. But what about the \neconomic costs of running high deficits and high levels of Government \nspending and taxation on the general public? The weight of economic \nevidence from around the world strongly suggests that as the size of \ngovernment increases as a share of national income, the rate of \neconomic growth and job creation declines. I was sent here by people \nwho think it is time to put the welfare of the general public ahead of \nthe special interests.\n  The proposed amendment does not read into the Constitution a mandate \nfor any particular economic policy outcomes. It only restores the \nhistorical relationship between levels of public spending and available \npublic resources. National solvency is not, nor should it be, a \npartisan political principle. It should be a fundamental principle of \nour Government.\n  Mr. President, I would like to spend a few moments on the question of \njudicial enforcement of the balanced budget amendment.\n There are many provisions of the Constitution that are effective in \nachieving their purposes, yet which do not require judicial \nenforcement. For example, the Senate does not introduce revenue bills \ndespite the Court's refusal to involve itself in such political \nquestions. The moral power of the Constitution itself serves as an \nenforcement mechanism.\n\n  The balanced budget amendment is largely self-enforcing and self-\nmonitoring. Congress and the President are to establish procedures for \ncompliance. Congress and the President are to monitor the actions of \neach other, and actions by the Congress and the President will be \nsubject to even more effective monitoring by the public.\n  I would argue that the balanced budget amendment is already working, \ndespite the fact that the Congress has not yet passed it. Indeed, the \nmere prospect of the congressional approval of the amendment has \nalready forced congressional leaders to seriously consider a 7-year \nplan to reduce the growth rate of Government spending and balance the \nbudget. Does anyone truly believe that this debate would be occurring \nin the absence of the debate over the balanced budget amendment?\n  Once the amendment is actually approved by both Houses of Congress, \nwe will be under enormous political pressure to produce a balanced \nbudget plan which achieves balance by the year 2002.\n  As the debate over the balanced budget amendment proceeds in the \n[[Page S1891]]  Senate, I will address in more detail why we should not \nexempt any special areas of the budget from the balanced budget \nrequirements. In essence these efforts are, in my judgment, nothing \nmore than escape valves designed to alleviate the pressure on lawmakers \nto spend in different areas of priority than would otherwise take \nplace. These exemptions violate the whole point of having a balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  The Nation believes we already have enough tax revenue to balance the \nbudget. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office projects that tax \nrevenue collected by the Government will naturally increase from the \n$1.36 trillion in 1995 to $1.88 trillion in the year 2002. I know the \npeople in Michigan, and I think most people across this country would \nagree, that $1.88 trillion is more than enough to run the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Finally, I am a strong supporter of the proposed supermajority \nrequirements to limit tax increases. I think the inclusion of the tax \nlimitation language would help avert the bias in our current system \ntoward higher taxes. Although I am concerned about a balanced budget \namendment that does not simultaneously place an explicit limit on \ntaxes, I believe this can be accomplished through other means, not the \nleast among them the wrath of an overtaxed electorate. Further, I \nbelieve that to truly limit the tax burden on the American people we \nmust explicitly limit the total size of Government. It is for this \nreason I strongly support either legislation or a constitutional \namendment to limit to a fixed percentage of our national income, except \nin times of emergency, the spending level of Government. Limiting total \nspending limits total taxes.\n  In my State of Michigan we have a similar government spending \nlimitation in our State constitution called the Headlee amendment. \nUnder that amendment, the size of State government is limited by \nholding State tax revenue to the same fraction of personal income that \nit was when the amendment passed in 1978. A blue ribbon commission \nappointed by Gov. John Engler to study the Headlee amendment recently \nconcluded that it had been effective in limiting the growth of our \nState government.\n  This spending limitation proposal offered by Senator Jon Kyl does \nessentially the same thing as the Headlee amendment. It requires that \nthe Federal Government only grow in size relative to the size of the \nnational income. I think such a spending limitation concept ought to be \na key ingredient as we proceed to the subsequent implementing \nlegislation to balance the budget.\n  In conclusion, before we begin the necessary task of limiting the \ngrowth rate of Government spending, we ought to be able to assure the \nAmerican people that any consequent pain will not be for naught, that \ncuts in spending will finally translate into reduction in the Federal \ndeficit. A balanced budget amendment to the Constitution would restore \na necessary, basic, and broad governing principle for our country; \nnamely, that Government should spend no more than it takes in.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the proposed \nbalanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution. I also rise as a \nperson who I hope can be described as one of the strongest advocates of \nactually balancing the Federal budget. I believe the American people \nreally want a balanced budget more than they want a balanced budget \namendment. Although this may seem strange to a lot of people--and it is \ngoing to be very important to make this point both here and across \nAmerica as we have this debate--I think passing the balanced budget \namendment will make it less likely rather than more likely we will \nactually achieve a balanced budget in the next few years.\n  A number of respected authorities have raised a variety of \nsignificant points of concern with regard to the amendment itself. Some \nsay the problems related to the role of the courts and the power it \nmight confer on unelected judges to set our national budget policy is a \nreason not to vote for this.\n  Some talk of the damage the proposal could do to Social Security \nunless some changes are made to the current draft. I think that is a \nvery, very important issue.\n  Others say there will be unintended changes to the Presidential \nimpoundment authority. That is something we have to look at.\n  And still others say that unnecessary and possibly dislocating \nrestrictions on our ability to establish capital or investment budgets \nwill be a problem, producing the very surprising result that the \nFederal Government could end up being the only government anywhere that \nwe know of that does not have a distinction between a capital and \noperating budget.\n  These are all very serious concerns and there are other ones as well \nthat are being discussed and will be discussed in the coming weeks as \nwe consider the balanced budget amendment.\n  My principal objection to the proposed balanced budget amendment is \nthat it will most likely damage our efforts to reduce and eliminate the \nFederal deficit. I believe strongly in eliminating the Federal deficit. \nAlong with health care reform, that was the issue on which I focused my \ncampaign for the U.S. Senate, and it is the issue on which I focused \nthe greatest amount of my time during the 2 years I have been here. But \nthere is evidence that suggests strongly that this proposed \nconstitutional amendment will only undercut the work I have had a \nchance to do, the work that others have done to bring down the deficit \nand clean up the mess that was created throughout the 1980's.\n  First, consider the basic argument of those who support the proposed \namendment. The essence of the arguments made by supporters of the \namendment is the assertion that a constitutional amendment is \nabsolutely necessary in order to spur lawmakers into making the tough \ndecisions they are otherwise unwilling to make. The amendment's \nsupporters maintain that once the constitutional requirement is in \nplace, lawmakers will suddenly make the tough decisions because they \nwill be able to say this to their angry constituents: I am sorry I cut \nyour program, but the Constitution made me do it.\n  I find it hard to believe that kind of conversation is going to \nreally occur, but that is in effect what is being suggested, that \nMembers of Congress will suddenly do what they must do and should have \ndone a long time ago because they will be able to say, ``My hands are \ntied. I am going to have to hurt you by cutting this program.''\n  The notion that lawmakers require the Constitution of the United \nStates to provide political cover is the defining rationale for the \nsupporters of this proposed amendment. After all, if a constitutional \nrefuge were not required, then the need for this amendment would \nvanish.\n  This assessment of our political process, I believe, ignores a basic \npolitical reality, that those who require political cover in order to \nmake tough decisions under our current rules may end up being the very \nsame people who will find a way not to make the tough decisions even if \nthe balanced budget amendment is passed by this Senate and even if it \ndoes become a part of our Constitution.\n  As the distinguished economist Herbert Stein noted in his testimony \nbefore the Judiciary Committee:\n\n       Objection to a balanced budget amendment is not an \n     objection to balancing the budget. It is, instead, objection \n     to using an appeal to a traditional symbol as a smokescreen \n     behind which to hide unwillingness to face our real problems.\n\n  The only way we can balance the Federal budget is by enacting \nspecific legislation that spells out a series of individual spending \ncuts that add up to sufficient cuts to eliminate that deficit. But the \nproposed constitutional amendment does not contain one single spending \ncut. The sponsors of it do not have to put their name on the line for \nany cut in order to go about their States and say: I fought to balance \nthe budget.\n  I am not sure the people of the country realize this. I think what \nthey are saying is: Balance the budget. I think many folks think the \nbalanced budget amendment will also include the identification and, in \nfact, requirement of a series of cuts to achieve that. But there is \nnowhere in the balanced budget amendment where any of the courage that \nis required to identify specific \n[[Page S1892]]  cuts is demonstrated. It is just the reverse.\n It is just the reverse. In fact, in many ways, it is the easiest vote \nin the world.\n\n  Mr. President, this raises a second point. Many of the supporters of \nthe proposed constitutional amendment are unwilling to outline those \nspending cuts they would pursue in order to balance the budget. The \nmajority leader of the other House, Richard Armey, a strong proponent \nof the constitutional amendment, has been quoted as saying that if \nMembers of Congress knew what it took to comply with the proposal \n``their knees would buckle.''\n  That is a candid statement, but a very disturbing one. Majority \nLeader Armey is also reported as saying that:\n\n       Putting together a detailed list beforehand would make \n     passing the balanced budget amendment virtually impossible.\n\n  Mr. President, this second point is a natural outflow of the \nunderlying political view held by the amendment's supporters. That view \nI think is based on cynical assumptions about the American public and \nour democratic process. It implies that, if the people realized what it \nwould take to balance the budget, they would just refuse to support \nsuch action.\n  Let us consider for a minute what this reasoning suggests. I think it \nassumes a very low opinion of the American people, the electorate. \nSupporters suggest that, rather than deal honestly with the people, we \nshould evade, delay and dissemble. Mr. President, in my view that \nperception of the American people is a good example of the politics as \nusual that got us into this mess in the first place, and which I \nbelieve voters have been rejecting, not just on November 8 of last year \nbut for the past several years where we have had two monumental \nelections.\n  Mr. President, I mentioned that I ran on the issue of deficit \nreduction in 1992, and, as a matter of fact, so did all of my three \nopponents in that race. I strongly believe that one of the reasons for \nmy victory was that I spoke specifically with the voters about the \ndeficit issue. While others supported the balanced budget amendment, \nthey generally refused to specify how they would reduce the deficit. I \nopposed the balanced budget amendment but presented a specific 82-point \nplan--that has grown since--that pointed to exactly all the different \nways we could cut the Federal budget which would add up to the \nelimination of the Federal deficit over 5 years.\n  Mr. President, despite the statements that nothing has been done here \nin the last couple of years, and that this institution is incapable of \ncutting spending without a balanced budget amendment, I can tell you \nthat during the past couple of years many of those specific cuts that I \nhad identified--and that many others had identified--were included in \nthe President's deficit reduction package in 1993, passed, and became \nlaw. Why did the balanced budget amendment advocates refuse to even \ntake seriously the progress that has been made in reducing the deficit \nduring the past 2 years? Well, maybe it is not good politics. But it is \nunfair to the American people to continue to tell them that nothing has \nbeen done, that no effort has been made, that no progress has been \nmade, and that no tough votes have been taken, because they have.\n  I regret that no Member of what is now the majority party chose to \nparticipate in either the other House or this House in trying to help \nus make those specific cuts. But that does not take away from the fact \nthat those cuts were made. Why are we not out here telling the folks \nacross America that, for example, we significantly cut hundreds of \nmillions of dollars out of overseas broadcasting, Radio Free Europe and \nRadio Liberty? Why are not we telling the American people that we \nfinally had the guts to get rid of the superconducting super collider, \nand the wool and mohair subsidy? My constituents say, ``These \nagriculture programs are eating us alive.'' The truth is we eliminated \na program like that. It was not always fun for me with several thousand \nwool farmers in Wisconsin. But that was done here in this body in the \nlast 2 years, and we are not telling the American people something that \nthey need to hear.\n  This week I was informed that one of the cuts that we achieved, one \nof the changes we made, is actually working out better than the CBO \nestimated. I believe the estimates were that the FCC spectrum auction \nwould achieve $7 billion. I hear now it may end up being $10 billion \nthat we are now able, through a more sensible proposal, to use and to \nhelp reduce the Federal deficit. That story is not being told out here \nbecause, if that story were being told out here, the advocates of the \nbalanced budget amendment would have an awful hard time saying what \nthey always say; that is, there is no way to reduce the deficit and \nbalance the budget without a balanced budget amendment.\n  I find it amazing that this is glossed over. And I believe that it is \nour obligation, as we go through this debate of the balanced budget \namendment, to say that during the past 2 years--although certainly I \nwould not describe it as the Camelot of deficit reduction--it was a \nvery good start, and it helped our economy. And it reduced the deficit \nsignificantly. Now it just a question of finishing the job, and we have \nthe power to do that today. And that is what we should be focusing on, \nnot a balanced budget amendment that simply gives political cover.\n  So, Mr. President, I think it is interesting to realize that the \nratification of the proposed constitutional amendment itself may be \nthreatened by the failure of its supporters to be specific and direct \nto the American people about how it is going to be achieved. More \nimportantly, even if the proposed amendment is ratified, the cause of \nfiscal prudence and deficit reduction could be severely jeopardized if \nwe do not have the broad-based support of the Nation and of the people \nof this country. In the end without that support, without the support \nof the American people, an unpopular plan would be overturned, and we \nwould be left with the balanced budget amendment that only serves to \ndegrade and undermine the authority of our laws, and even worse the \nauthority of our Constitution.\n  Mr. President, it should be reiterated that a majority of those \nsupporters of the proposed amendment who were here in 1993 opposed the \nPresident's deficit reduction package. That package included many \ndifficult provisions, including significant cuts to very popular \nprograms. But this is precisely the kind of specific reduction package \nthat will have to pass in this body, if we are ever going to really \nhave a balanced budget, not a balanced budget amendment.\n  (Mr. COATS assumed the chair.)\n  Of course, if we are going to have what the American people really \nwant, which is a balanced budget, I think one certainly can favor \nreducing the deficit but oppose a specific plan. But, Mr. President, \nmany of the supporters of the proposed balanced budget amendment oppose \nany specific plan. In their best of all worlds, you do not propose a \nplan and identify the cuts, but you say that you supported the balanced \nbudget amendment and you have done your job. You can go home and start \nfocusing on other issues.\n  On another matter, some supporters of the proposed constitutional \namendment promised to offer a specific plan of action but they promised \nto do it only after the joint resolution is adopted by both Houses of \nCongress after it is sent out to the States but before it is ratified \nby the States. But, if we apply those folks' own test, this would doom \nthe proposed constitutional change because what it means is, even \nthough it may have passed the House and the Senate and it is sent out \nto the States, the plan would be revealed before ratification. The \nspecifics would come out, those same specifics that would make our \nknees buckle and that would make it impossible to pass the proposed \namendment in Congress presumably would be so terrible and so upsetting \nto the States that they would not pass the balanced budget amendment.\n  Perhaps the supporters of the constitutional change would just keep \nthe specifics secret throughout the whole ratification process. Taking \nthis argument to its logical conclusion--the argument that we should \nnot lay out the plan as we passed this amendment--the reasoning of the \nsupporters of the proposed constitutional amendment dictate that a \nspecific plan apparently could not be offered until after the States \nhad ratified the amendment.\n  In fact, under this argument, no plan could be offered until the \nfirst year the article was to take effect which, of \n[[Page S1893]]  course, is fiscal year 2002 at the very earliest, for \nnot until the constitutional mandate is in force would the needed \npolitical cover be in place to protect those lawmakers that amendment \nsupporters maintain are too hesitant to act without that protection.\n  Is this what the balanced budget amendment supporters want? Is that \nwhat they are saying? We are going to keep a tight lip in 1995, 1996, \n1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001, and then suddenly in the year 2002 we \nare going to magically present this plan that will eliminate the \nFederal deficit, at which point, I assure you if we do this, will dwarf \nthe deficit that we have now? Political cover will have made sure that \nthis institution did not have to act during that time period, and it \nwill not act. It will simply stand back and wait for the States to \ndecide whether to pass this amendment.\n  This reasoning produces the absurd result that Congress would be \nparalyzed to act to reduce the deficit until the first balanced budget \nis required, which again is fiscal year 2002 at the earliest.\n  Mr. President, we know any delay in acting to eliminate the deficit \nonly makes future action that much more difficult and politically \ndistasteful. Waiting clearly makes it harder. In the world depicted by \nthe amendments supporters, delay could be fatal for efforts to balance \nthe budget as legislators would be confronted with an increasingly more \ndifficult task and increasingly more difficult choices.\n  Thus, Mr. President, even using the reasoning of the balanced budget \namendment supporters, adoption of the amendment would make it more \ndifficult to actually balance the budget. I think that kind of delay is \na tremendous disservice to our economy, and especially to our children \nand our grandchildren. As a result of this action by the Congress, the \nStates will end up with a bigger debt and a bigger deficit. The \nspecific plan to reduce the deficit must be passed before a \nconstitutional amendment is sent to the States for ratification.\n  A budget plan is not only a safeguard against later inaction, it \nensures that Congress deals with the American people honestly. I know I \nhave not been the only Member of the Senate to propose a specific plan. \nI believe my colleague on the other side, the Senator from Colorado \n[Mr. Brown], has put together a similar kind of specific plan to \neliminate the Federal deficit. I was delighted to work with him during \nthe past 2 years on a bipartisan basis, and with Senator Kerrey of \nNebraska, to craft that kind of a proposal. We signed onto it and we \nsigned onto the specifics. No, we did not succeed in the vote on the \nfloor, but we worked together to identify the cuts. That kind of \napproach is the only way we are going to reduce the deficits, not by \nletting Members of the Senate off the hook by providing them with the \npolitical cover of adopting a constitutional amendment that does not \nsay one single thing about what should be cut and when and who should \nget hurt.\n  Professor Stein, in his testimony before the Judiciary Committee, \ncommented on this very point. He testified:\n\n       I believe it is basically improper and unfair to propose a \n     balanced-budget amendment without revealing how the balance \n     would, or might, be achieved--by what combination of \n     expenditure cuts and tax increases. I do not think the \n     American people should be asked to commit themselves to a \n     constitutional limit on their future decisions without \n     knowing what would be involved.\n\n  Mr. President, a specific plan of deficit reduction is the only way \nthe budget will be balanced.\n  Passing a specific plan before the proposed amendment is sent to the \nStates helps preclude delay and evasion. Without it, Congress could \nadopt the proposed amendment, declare victory, and do absolutely \nnothing. It is a great formula for politicians who have to run for \nreelection. They can sit back and say: Let the States do it; it is not \nmy problem. I voted for the balanced budget amendment. It is up to the \nStates now to worry about the Federal deficit.\n  That is what might be called a free pass. In fact, I think it is the \nequivalent of a politician winning the lottery. To not even have to \ntalk about what cuts, to be able to say for the next 7 years it is up \nto the States to ratify the constitutional amendment, is like the \npolitical jackpot, because you do not have to say where the cuts should \ncome from. That is what is going on here. It is punting to the States. \nIt is leaving it up to the elected State legislatures instead of the \npeople sent here, who took an oath to solve the Nation's problems \nthemselves. That is what this balanced budget amendment is about.\n  Mr. President, equally as important, before the voters and local \ngovernments and State legislatures are asked to ratify the amendment, I \nthink they are entitled to know what the supporters of the balanced \nbudget amendment mean to do, before they modify the Constitution of the \nUnited States to endorse that action. I believe the Constitution is our \ngreat national contract. Before the people are asked to support a \nchange in that contract, they are entitled to read the fine print.\n  Mr. President, there is at least one other issue that should raise \nserious doubts in the minds of Members. That is this clamor for a \nmiddle-class tax cut or an across-the-board tax cut by many of the same \npeople who are saying they are dedicated to a balanced budget amendment \nand to the balanced budget. I think it is obvious to almost any \nAmerican that this makes no fiscal sense. To give a big tax cut now, \neither to the middle class or across the board, and to maintain you can \nhave a balanced budget amendment in the coming years is flim-flam, \nvoodoo mathematics. The American people do not believe that we can have \na tax cut and balance the budget.\n  I will have more to say on this subject later in the debate.\n  For now, I only want Members to note this obvious inconsistency and \nto consider that the two apparently contradictory positions really \nshare one thing in common: They both flow from the politics of the free \nlunch.\n  In closing, let me add a brief personal note about one of the \nprincipal sponsors of the amendment, the senior Senator from Illinois \n[Mr. Simon]. Unlike many who support the proposed amendment, he has \nconsistently fought for deficit reduction and has taken tough stands in \nthat effort, including voting for the President's deficit reduction \nbill. That vote, obviously, was essential, as was the vote of every \nSenator who voted for it, including, of course, the Vice President of \nthe United States.\n  Senator Simon has joined with a number of us who are questioning the \nwisdom of the tax cut bidding war that has started. So I want to say, \nout of great respect for the Senator from Illinois, that the supporters \nof the proposed amendment could have no greater champion than Senator \nSimon. Though he and I differ on this issue, I regret very much his \ndecision not to seek reelection.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n           The Taxpayers Deserve a Balanced Budget Amendment\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, when our ancestors were on the verge of \na revolt against the British Government, Edmund Burke rose in the House \nof Commons to urge his fellow Members of the House of Parliament to \nrefrain from using force to impose taxes on those in the United States, \nwhich were then Britain's American Colonies. Burke had the courage and \nthe wisdom to speak for conciliation. He foresaw what no one else did--\nthat if England persisted in taxing this country, it would lose its \nempire and would fight a long war for a bad cause. Burke told the \nMembers of Parliament that in attacking America through taxation, they \nwere really attacking their own British liberties.\n  As we discuss the balanced budget amendment, we usually talk about \nthe impact of runaway spending on our economy and on our future. Those \nare our fundamental considerations. But we also must not lose sight of \nconsiderations that are far more fundamental and profound. Protracted \ndeficit spending empowers the central Government with the means to \nundermine our basic liberties.\n  We hear it said in this Chamber, and by the media, that the American \npeople are selfish because they want the benefits of Government without \nthe cost of taxes. We forget that the power to impose taxes is a \nstanding threat to freedom.\n  Mr. President, the acknowledgment that we can only control Government \nby controlling its capacity to take our money is as old as the idea of \ndemocracy. Money was--and is--the source of \n[[Page S1894]] the Government's basic power. The tale of history bears \ntestament to this truth. The Magna Carta prescribed that the King could \nnot impose taxes except through the consent of the Great Council. \nCharles I was executed because he tried to govern without seeking the \nconsent of Parliament in spending public money. Let us not forget that \nthe American Revolution itself was rooted in the relationship between \ntaxation and representation.\n  Congress today does not have to vote to raise more revenue in order \nto spend more money. Instead, our legislature takes the debtor's path: \nSpend and beg; spend and plead; spend and borrow. Our current system \nlets the Government spend on credit and sign the taxpayers' name on the \ndotted line. When the credit card bill comes due, it is the American \npeople who are confronted with the dilemma. They can either send more \nmoney to Washington to pay the bill or default on the debt incurred in \ntheir name.\n  When the American people express the belief that Government is out of \ncontrol--as they did in this past November's election--they, indeed, \nare correct. For too long, this body has assembled to satisfy the \nappetites of narrow interests at the public's expense. The American \npeople are fed up with a Congress that spends the yet unearned wages of \nthe next generation.\n  Mr. President, deficit spending is not only a threat to our \nprosperity and our children's future, it is the method by which \nWashington's imperial elite has circumvented the public, the law, and \nthe Constitution. Deficit spending allows beltway barons to run this \ncountry without regard for the people. Whether it is pork projects or \npolitical payoffs, the Washington elite know how to play the game.\n  That must end. A balanced budget amendment will compel the Members of \nthis body to raise taxes if they want to spend more money. What better \nway to restrain spending than that?\n A balanced budget amendment will make it clear to all that the special \ninterest is rewarded when the citizen is penalized and that we should \nrefrain from penalizing citizens to reward special interests.\n\n  What will a balanced budget amendment mean? It will mean \naccountability to the Constitution and restraint on our spending--in \nshort, it will mean integrity in Government. It will rightly return the \npower of the purse to the people.\n  Two centuries ago, in a nation across the sea, Edmund Burke reminded \nhis fellow Members of Parliament of a fundamental principle. Burke \nsaid:\n\n       * * * the people must in effect themselves * * * possess \n     the power of granting their own money, or no shadow of \n     liberty [can] subsist.\n\n  Mr. President, if we truly wish to preserve the liberties first \ninscribed into the Magna Carta and then brought to these shores--and \npreserved through the blood of revolutions on two continents--it is \nimperative that we return to the people the power of the purse.\n  We must take the American Express card away from the Congress and \neliminate the expense account of the beltway barons. We must make the \nMembers of this body accountable to the taxpayers--not to the \nlobbyists. We can do this if we have the will.\n  The balanced budget amendment is not a quick fix. But it is real \nreform and it will be felt. I know--from my service as Governor of one \nof the States--that 49 States, in effect, require a balanced budget. It \nis not a gimmick. We balance the budget.\n  I balanced budgets 8 years in a row while I was Governor. As a matter \nof fact, we put into place a cash operating reserve fund of several \nhundred millions of dollars. We established a rainy day fund--such as \nthe emergency fund that the senior Senator from Illinois has suggested \nwe have for the Federal Government--because we knew there would be \nepisodes of fiscal crisis and financial difficulty in the future that \nwe would need to meet. And we knew, since we were required by our \nconstitution to have a balanced budget, that we would need to prepare \nfor it in advance.\n  So, Mr. President, let me say it again for emphasis. A balanced \nbudget requirement is not a gimmick. It is not a quick fix either, but \nit is real reform. It will reestablish the responsibilities observed in \nthis country for decades--prior to the last two or three--that we would \nhave balanced budgets except in time of war.\n  A balanced budget is a political reform that will be felt first and \nforemost by the imperial elite who have long run this town. It will be \nfelt by a brood of beltway barons--both elected and unelected--who are \nrobbing the next generation of their inheritance. And, most \nimportantly, it will be felt by the American people who will have \nsucceeded in restoring their right to self-governance.\n  There are those in this body, Mr. President, who suggest to us that \nwe somehow have to forecast the next 7 years of priorities in spending \nfor the United States of America in order to give allegiance to a \nbalanced budget amendment. Nothing could be further from the truth as \nfar as I am concerned.\n  I know of no State which tries to lock itself into a 7-year budget \nwhich would deny subsequent legislatures the opportunity to adjust to \npriorities, to respond to circumstances, and to create budgets which \nmeet the real needs of the individuals in the jurisdiction at the time.\n  When President Kennedy came before the United States of America--and \nbefore the House and Senate--and suggested that we as a nation, adopt \nand embrace an aspiration to put a person on the Moon as an expression \nof our ability to expand our technological and scientific awareness, he \ndid not have every answer for every way in which everything would \nhappen, but he expressed it as an aspiration--an aspiration toward \ngreatness.\n  The desire to climb a mountain does not always contain in it all the \nplans and processes and procedures, but you commit yourself to the \nobjective and you launch your endeavor and you work your way toward the \nobjective. And it is essential that we do that at this time.\n  The suggestion that our aspirations regarding Federal spending can be \naccomplished without a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution \ncalls history a liar. For decades and decades, the United States of \nAmerica has conceded the necessity--but never developed the \ndiscipline--to get this job done. It is time now that we make this \ncommitment to a noble objective, to protect the birthright of a \ngeneration of Americans yet to come, to protect the opportunity for \nproductivity and competitiveness for the next generation. It is time \nthat we made this commitment for ourselves --and for those who follow \nus.\n  Mr. President, I am grateful to have had this opportunity to address \nthis body on these issues. I note that Senator Heflin desires to speak, \nso I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HEFLIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise again to express my support for a \nconstitutional amendment requiring the Federal Government to achieve \nand maintain a balanced budget. The time has finally come to pass this \nlegislation and send it to the States for ratification. This amendment \nis not a gimmick, nor is it chicanery; it is good common sense.\n  We have seen in the House, on January 26, overwhelming, bipartisan \nsupport and passage of a balanced budget amendment. The vote in the \nHouse 300 to 132, 12 more than the two-thirds majority required for \npassage of a constitutional amendment, proves that the time for action \nis now. This momentum, shown by the House, is one which I believe will \nonly grow as the Senate and eventually the State legislatures debate \nand vote to pass this vital amendment to our Constitution.\n  I commend the Members of both parties in the House, who formed an \nalliance to produce the vote, which was a culmination of over 10 years \nof House deliberation and debate. I applaud all for their determination \nto see this legislation succeed, as well as the many House Democrats \nwho have worked unceasingly toward this victory.\n  And, as the waves of this tide roll into the Senate we should be \naware of where the original swell began, the American people.\n  Since I first came to the Senate in 1979, every Congress I have \nintroduced legislation proposing a constitutional amendment to balance \nthe Federal budget, and I have dedicated myself to many years of work \nwith my colleagues to adopt a resolution which \n     [[Page S1895]] would authorize the submission to the States \n     for ratification of a constitutional amendment to require a \n     balanced budget.\n  For much of our Nation's history, a balanced Federal budget was the \nstatus quo and part of our unwritten constitution. For our first 100 \nyears, this country carried a surplus budget, but in recent years this \nNation's spending has gone out of control. Indeed, the fiscal \nirresponsibility demonstrated over the years has convinced me that \nconstitutional discipline is the only way we can achieve the goal of \nreducing deficits.\n  As you know, in 1982, the Senate did pass, by more than the required \ntwo-thirds vote, a constitutional amendment calling for a balanced \nbudget. There were 69 votes in favor of it and that time. It was sent \nto the House of Representatives, where, in the House Judiciary \nCommittee it was bottled up. The chairman would not allow it to come up \nfor a committee vote, in order that it might be reported to the floor \nof the House of Representatives.\n  In order to bring the measure up for a vote in the House of \nRepresentatives, it was necessary to file a discharge petition. This is \na petition that has to be signed by more than a majority of the whole \nnumber of the House of Representatives, and then it is brought up and \nvoted on without amendment. The Senate-passed amendment failed to \nobtain the necessary two-thirds vote that was required in the House of \nRepresentatives at that time.\n  In the 99th Congress, after extensive debate, passage of a balanced \nbudget amendment by the Senate failed by one vote--but got 66 votes. \nDuring the 101st Congress, I supported a measure which passed the \nJudiciary Committee, but it was never considered by the full Senate. In \nthe 102d Congress, the Judiciary Committee favorably reported a \nbalanced budget bill, but since an amendment failed to pass the House \nof Representatives by the necessary two-thirds vote, this killed the \npossibility of favorable action by the Senate.\n  In the 103d Congress, the Senate narrowly defeated an amendment, \nwhich I cosponsored, by a vote of 63 to 47--4 votes short of the 67 \nvotes needed for passage.\n  All the while, there has been considerable debate, various articles \nhave been written in numerous publications, and editorials have \nappeared\n in countless newspapers. Many speeches have been made on the floor of \nthe Senate, and I have made numerous speeches advocating the adoption \nof a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget.\n\n  Mr. President, I hope the time has come to finally adopt this long-\noverdue amendment and begin to move toward our goal of a balanced \nFederal budget.\n  Section 1 of the amendment requires a three-fifths vote of each House \nof Congress before the Federal Government can engage in deficit \nspending. A 60-percent vote in the Senate is a very difficult one to \nobtain. This requirement should establish the norm that spending will \nnot exceed receipts in any fiscal year. If the Government is going to \nspend money, it should have the money on hand to pay its bills.\n  Section 2 of the amendment requires a three-fifths vote by both \nHouses of Congress to raise the national debt. In addition to the \nthree-fifths vote, Congress must provide by law for an increase in \npublic debt. As I understand it, this means presentment to the \nPresident, where the President has the right to veto or sign. If the \nPresident chose to veto the bill, it would be returned to Congress for \naction to possibly override the veto. It is also important to note that \nsection 1, regarding the specific excess of outlays over receipts, \ncontains this same requirement that Congress act by law.\n  Section 2 is important because it functions as an enforcement \nmechanism for the balanced budget amendment. While section 1 states \noutright that ``Total outlays * * * shall not exceed total receipts'' \nwithout the three-fifths authorization by Congress. Therefore, section \n2 will require a three-fifths vote to increase the national debt. This \nprovision will increase the pressure to comply with the directive of \nthis proposed constitutional amendment.\n  In my judgment, section 2 puts teeth into the constitutional \namendment. We have had many statutory enactments that say we are going \nto have a balanced budget. We have a procedure under this \nconstitutional amendment that makes it more difficult to engage in \ndeficit spending. This is a procedure by which, if there is an excess \nof outlays over receipts--and that means deficit spending during a \nfiscal year--we must approve that specific amount by a three-fifths \nvote of the whole membership of both Houses. That in and of itself is \nfine, but it is largely directory. It does not have an enforcement \nprocedure. An enforcement procedure is provided by section 2 of the \namendment, which is the public debt provision.\n  The public debt provision makes it more difficult for Congress to \nvote a deficit. It means that if we vote a deficit and fail to increase \nthe public debt, then Government will come to a halt. If we do not \nincrease the public debt, eventually, we run on a balanced budget.\n  Therefore, section 2 has the intention of making it more difficult. \nSo I say it is not for the purpose of making it harder to pay our \ndebts, it is to make it harder to go into deficit spending and to give \nan enforcement procedure--a process, a mechanism that is so important \nbecause it is not just words that we could pass by and ignore.\n  Other than just being directory, the amendment, by way of section 2, \nhas some teeth and that is what is so important if we are going to do \naway with deficit spending and operate so that we do not spend any more \nmoney than the amount coming into the Government. That is what we are \ntrying to achieve here.\n  Section 3 provides for the submission by the President of a balanced \nbudget to Congress. This section reflects the belief that sound fiscal \nplanning should be a shared governmental responsibility by the \nPresident as well as the Congress.\n  Section 4 of the amendment requires a majority vote of the whole \nnumber of each House of Congress any time Congress votes to increase\n revenues. This holds public officials responsible, and puts elected \nofficials on record for any tax increase which may be necessary to \nsupport Federal spending.\n\n  Section 5 of the amendment permits a waiver of the provision for any \nfiscal year in which a declaration of war is in effect. This section \nalso contains a provision long-supported by myself--that of allowing a \nwaiver in cases of less than an outright declaration of war--where the \nUnited States is engaged in military conflict which causes an imminent \nand serious threat to national security, and is so declared by a joint \nresolution, which becomes law. Under this scenario, a majority of the \nwhole number of each House of Congress may waive the requirements of a \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  I firmly believe that Congress should have the option to waive the \nrequirement for a balanced budget in cases of less than an outright \ndeclaration of war. Looking back over the history of our Nation, we \nfind that we have had only five declared wars: The War of 1812, the \nMexican War, the Spanish-American War, the First World War, and the \nSecond World War.\n  The most recent encounters of the United States in armed conflict \nwith enemies have been, of course, undeclared wars. We fought the gulf \nwar without a declaration of war. In addition, we fought both the \nVietnam and Korean actions without declarations of war.\n  This country can be faced with military emergencies which threaten \nour national security, without a formal declaration of war being in \neffect. Circumstances may arise in which Congress may need to spend \nsignificant amounts on national defense without a declaration of war. \nCongress and the President must be given the necessary flexibility to \nrespond rapidly when a military emergency arises.\n  In the future, there could be a war like the Vietnam war--which went \non for 11 years. Without a waiver for situations regarding less than an \noutright declaration of war, each year you would have to waive the \nconstitutional amendment pertaining to a balanced budget by a three-\nfifths vote. We might look back and we would see that the vote to \nwithdraw the troops from Vietnam carried by only eight votes. The \ndifference between a majority and a three-fifths vote is a difference \nbetween 51 and 60, which is 9 votes.\n  [[Page S1896]] As I previously stated, the United States has engaged \nin only five declared wars, yet the United States has engaged in \nhostilities abroad which required no less commitment of human lives or \nAmerican resources than declared wars. In fact, our Nation has been \ninvolved in approximately 200 instances in which the United States has \nused military forces abroad in situations of conflict. Not all of these \nwould move Congress to seek a waiver of the requirement of a balanced \nbudget, but Congress should have the constitutional flexibility to \nprovide for our Nation's security.\n  Twice since the end of the Second World War, first in Korea and then \nin Indochina, this Nation has been heavily engaged in armed conflicts \nabroad. In other instances, American troops have been sent to foreign \ncountries in times of crisis--Lebanon in 1958, and the Dominican \nRepublic in 1965. Other critical situations, including the \nconfrontation in the Formosa Straits in 1955, and the Cuban Missile \nCrisis in 1962, have been met by use of American military forces.\n  I think it is wise to look at some of the other instances in which we \nhave had undeclared war and to see how serious they were. During 1914 \nto 1917, a time of revolution in Mexico, there were at least two major \narmed actions by United States forces in Mexico. The hostilities \nincluded the capture of Vera Cruz and Pershing's subsequent expedition \ninto northern Mexico.\n  In 1918, Marines landed at Vladivostok in June and July to protect \nthe American consulate. The United States landed 7,000 troops which \nremained until January 29, as part of an allied occupation force. In \nSeptember 1918, American troops joined the allied intervention force at \nArchangel and suffered some 500 casualties.\n  In 1927, fighting at Shanghai caused American naval forces and Marine \nforces to be increased. In\n March 1927, a naval guard was stationed at the American consulate at \nNanking after national forces captured the city. A United States and \nBritish warship fired on Chinese soldiers to protect the escape of \nAmericans and other foreigners. By the end of 1927, the United States \nhad 44 naval vessels in Chinese waters, and 5,670 men ashore.\n\n  When a pro-Nasser coup took place in Iraq in January 1958, the \nPresident of Lebanon sent an urgent plea for assistance to President \nEisenhower, saying Lebanon was threatened by both internal rebellion \nand indirect aggression. President Eisenhower responded by sending \n5,000 marines to Beirut to protect American lives and help the Lebanese \nmaintain their independence. This force was gradually increased to \n14,000 soldiers and marines who occupied strategic positions throughout \nthe country.\n  The most recent military involvement of the United States in an \nundeclared war is, of course, the Persian Gulf war. Although the actual \ngulf war lasted just over a month, this country had a peak strength of \n541,000 troops. In addition, the Department of Defense estimates the \ncost of operation Desert Storm at $47 billion.\n  We should recall the circumstances which occurred on January 12, \n1991, when the Senate, agreeing with the House, voted by a slim margin \nof 52-47 to approve the use of force to stop Iraqi aggression against \nthe State of Kuwait. This slim margin illustrates how difficult it \nwould be without such a provision, to achieve the needed 60 votes to \ntake a budget into deficit posture in order to finance the gulf war. \nThus, circumstances may arise in which Congress may need to spend \nsignificant amounts on national defense without a declaration of war. \nCongress and the President must be given the necessary flexibility to \nrespond rapidly when a military emergency arises.\n  Section 6 of the amendment permits Congress to rely on estimates of \noutlays and receipts in the implementation and enforcement of the \namendment by appropriate legislation.\n  Section 7 of the amendment provides that total receipts shall include \nall receipts of the United States except those derived from borrowing. \nIn addition, total outlays shall include all outlays of the United \nStates except those for repayment of debt principal. This section is \nintended to better define the relevant amounts that must be balanced.\n  Mr. President, the future of our Nation's economy is not a partisan \nissue, which was proven with the recent vote of the House. Furthermore, \nthe problem of deficit spending cannot be blamed on one branch of \nGovernment or one political party. Similarly, just as everyone must \nshare part of the blame for our economic ills, everyone must be united \nin acting to attack the growing problem of deficit spending. I \nrecognize that a balanced budget amendment will not cure our economic \nproblems overnight, but it will act to change the course of our future \nand lead to responsible fiscal management by our national Government.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Chair. I will not be long.\n  I come here this afternoon to speak in favor of the balanced budget \namendment. This is not a surprise to my colleagues. I have been in \nsupport of a balanced budget amendment now for quite some time. I wish \nto add my voice to the voices in support of those who have up to this \npoint indicated their support for the balanced budget amendment.\n  I would like to give one or two arguments that I believe are very \nimportant as we consider this very important amendment to our \nConstitution.\n  There is no question that we should not amend our Constitution very \noften and unless the reason is very, very important. We have only had \n27 amendments to our Constitution over our history, so when we consider \nan amendment to our Constitution we clearly have to consider whether or \nnot that amendment is of great importance. If it is not, we should not \namend the Constitution.\n  In this case, we have to ask ourselves whether or not financial \nresponsibility, however it is defined, is a very important measurement \nand indicator of how our country is functioning at the Federal level \nand whether those who are entrusted with the responsibility of \npresiding over the Federal Government have a responsibility to be \nfinancially responsible.\n  I think the answer is clearly yes. I do not think any of us, whether \nwe favor or oppose the balanced budget amendment, would argue that we \nhave a responsibility to exercise control and good judgment over our \nNation's finances.\n  In my opinion, one need not look very far back in our history to \nconclude that enough time has gone by during which time we have not \nexercised financial responsibility to argue very strongly of the need \nfor the balanced budget amendment.\n  Let us not forget that from 1789 to 1978, we had accumulated a total \nof less than $1 trillion of debt. In all the years, almost 200 years of \nhistory, our country had accumulated less than $1 trillion of debt.\n  In the 16 or 17 years since then, we have gone from less than $1 \ntrillion to almost $5 trillion. I do not think anybody in the Senate \nwould argue that the past 16 or 17 years is an indicator of financial \nresponsibility; that there is no need to pass a balanced budget \namendment because the Congress and the administrative branch of \nGovernment have been acting in a responsible way.\n  I do not think that argument can be made. In fact, any economist who \nwould look at our present level of debt, which is about two-thirds to \n70 percent of our gross national product, would argue that this is a \nvery unhealthy and dangerous level of debt for our country to be in. So \nin terms of our history over the past 15 years, 17 years, there is no \nindication that we are prepared to exercise financial responsibility \nabsent something more than what we have on the books now, which is \nbasically nothing, by way of constraint.\n  I do not think any of us would argue that we are not in the process \nnow of leaving to our children an enormous debt which will cloud their \nlives, make their lives less happy, make them less able to take care of \ntheir needs and their generation. We are head over heels in the process \nof adding to the debt and providing to our children that kind of a yoke \naround their neck. We should not do it. We are not able to stop \nourselves. And so I think that argues for the need for a balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  Oh, yes, there are those who say, ``Well, look at what we have done \nover \n[[Page S1897]] the past several years.'' I voted for the budget that is \nnow in the process of reducing our debt. But we all know it is a quick \nfix or a short fix. We all know that what we voted for is not going to \nbring down our deficit to a proper level, not even going to bring us \nwithin hailing distance of a balanced budget in the foreseeable future \nand that, indeed, after these 3 years of reducing the Federal deficit, \nour deficit is going to start to increase in the outyears.\n  There is nobody suggesting we are prepared to make the hard decisions \nthat will be required to bring what will be an increasing deficit into \nbalance without something more than what we have on the books now, \nwhich is basically nothing, by way of restraint.\n  So I think it is clear that we have demonstrated we need more on the \nbooks, more restraint, more legal mechanisms, and, if you will, a \nconstitutional amendment for a balanced budget.\n  Now, there are those who say, ``But this amendment is draconian. This \namendment is something that will tie our hands. This amendment that we \nare considering right now, although it does lay on the books in the \nConstitution a requirement to balance the budget''--and that is a good \nidea in concept--``we do not like.''\n  That is fine. Let us come down here now and try to change that \namendment. Let us come down here now and try to improve that amendment.\n  There are those who say we have to get Social Security out of that \nconstitutional amendment consideration. I agree. And I support that. So \nlet us see if we can argue it through and get to an elimination of \nSocial Security as part of this constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget.\n  There are those who say we need some provision for capital outlays \nevery year, that States that have balanced budget requirements in their \nconstitutions have a provision for capital outlays. So, fine, let us \nwork to get that in this constitutional amendment.\n  There are those who say that we should not be required to balance our \nbudget every year, that that would not be a smart economic move. Fine. \nLet us see if we cannot get, instead of the 60-vote requirement, which \ndoes exist in this constitutional amendment, which would allow us to \nunbalance the budget in any year for any reason if we can muster a 60-\npercent vote in either House of the Congress--to those who say that is \ndraconian, let us try to amend that to 55 percent, 51 percent of the \nvote.\n  If you do not believe in that, if you do not believe in coming down \nhere to try to amend this amendment to the Constitution so that it more \nnearly conforms to what your ideas of what the balanced budget should \nlook like, if you do not want to even argue that, then I would conclude \nthat you do not want a balanced budget; that you do not believe in \nbalanced budgets; that you do not believe we have a responsibility in \nnormal years to balance our books.\n  If you do not believe that, then you ought to come down and say, \nwell, that is the way I would argue it and this is the way, and maybe \nyou can convince us and the American public that you are right.\n  I do not think it is fair to say, ``I believe in balancing our books \nbut I do not believe in a balanced budget amendment, regardless of what \nit looks like.''\n  That to me is a specious argument, and I think it deserves to be \npointed out. I think those people who believe that we should not have \nan amendment to balance this country's books should come down and \nreally say why. If the fact is they do not like this amendment, I would \nlike to see how they would tailor an amendment they could accept to the \nconcept that we have a responsibility to balance the books of this \ncountry, if not every 1 year, every 3 years.\n  Bring that to the floor of the Senate and let us argue that. But do \nnot say, ``I believe in a balanced budget, but I do not believe in a \nbalanced budget amendment.'' To me that is a very difficult argument to \nmake.\n  So I come down here to lend my support to those who believe we need \nto have an amendment to see that we exercise financial responsibility \nin the Congress. I look forward to this debate. I know it will be \nvigorous. It is very important. Undoubtedly, it will take more than \njust a few days, and it should take more than just a few days. I am \nlooking forward to having that discussion with my colleagues.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the legislation \nbefore us: a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution of the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. President, this year marks an important anniversary in our \nnational history: the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. But \nas we celebrate the victory of one struggle, this year we also mark the \nanniversary of a loss in another battle--one whose fiscal implications \nare almost as prophetic as the battles of 50 years ago.\n  But this anniversary is one that Congress has in fact marked each \nyear since 1969--26 years of continually running budget deficits.\n  This is one of the longest losing streaks in Congressional history. \nIt is a fiscal losing streak that every American citizen has had to pay \nfor over the past generation.\n  But let us be sure of one thing--this debate is not about yesterday. \nIt is not really even about today--1995. But it is most assuredly about \nAmerica's future; it is about our children's future. As one American \nsaid when he was asked about his concern for our tomorrow, ``Of course \nI am concerned about the future. It is where we will spend the rest of \nour lives.''\n  Yet, tragically, we are squandering our future in spiralling debt--\nmortgaging our children's future down a vacuum of debt as we selfishly \navoid the challenge of balancing our Federal budget.\n  Now we have another remarkable opportunity--an historic opportunity--\nto pass this amendment to the Constitution. I would like to commend our \nleader, Senator Bob Dole, for bringing this legislation to the floor at \nsuch an early date.\n  I would also like to especially thank the sponsors of this bill--the \nSenator from Utah [Mr. Hatch], for providing exceptional leadership on \nthis issue, and the Senator from Illinois [Mr. Simon] for providing \nbipartisan support for this measure--as well as the Senator from Idaho \n[Mr. Craig] for his ongoing efforts on this critical amendment.\n  An early debate in this session of Congress is gratifying for many of \nus who have been working for more than a dozen years for a balanced \nbudget amendment. We have already seen our efforts produce positive \nresults--just recently, a requisite two-thirds majority in the other \nChamber passed a resolution calling for a balanced budget amendment to \nthe Constitution. The decision our colleagues made on that vote to pass \nthis legislation for the first time, Mr. President, presents us with a \nrenewed opportunity to act--and pass--this amendment in this Chamber, \ngetting the requisite two-thirds majority.\n  We in Congress are at a precipice--a crossroads--in our relationship \nwith the American people. We can either rise to the occasion and meet \ntheir expectations, or, we can merely do nothing and uphold the \neconomic status quo.\n  Congress' focus on this measure comes after the American people cast \nresounding votes for change in November. By pulling the lever for \naction and progress, they also issued a call for an end to the \neconomics-as-usual, an end to recurring deficits. An end to trillion-\ndollar debts and an end to fiscal irresponsibility and reckless \nspending.\n  In this debate, we have another opportunity to show the American \npeople that, yes, we did listen to them, and we do get it.\n  And, perhaps most importantly, they voted to make Congress \naccountable for its actions. Thus far in this session we have taken \ngreat strides toward that responsibility. We passed legislation on \ncongressional accountability, mandating Congress to abide by the same \nlaws that we have passed onto the American people. And we passed \nlegislation that will curb unfunded Federal mandates on State and local \ngovernments, which is presently being debated in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  [[Page S1898]] Now, we have the historic opportunity to send another \nmessage of accountability to the people by passing the balanced budget \namendment. We will demonstrate our commitment to the American people. \nWe will balance our budget, and put our Nation's fiscal house in \norder--permanently.\n  I am confident that this is the right thing to do: Every American \nfamily must balance their budget; they are not at liberty--as the \nFederal Government has been--to simply run annual household deficits. \nThey play by the rules. They live by the rules. And Congress should not \nbe living by any other standards.\n  For too long, we have spent without regard to our income, and in the \nprocess, we have squandered our children's future. How can we support \nthe fiscal status-quo of increasing national debts and bequeath misery \non the next generation of Americans?\n  We can begin a new regimen this year by facing up to our \nresponsibilities. This is what accountability is all about.\n We must set our priorities within our income. We must stop borrowing \nagainst our children's future.\n\n  Without question, these will be difficult decisions, but we are not \nalone in facing these decisions. Nearly every State, every small \nbusiness, every family, and every citizen faces similar choices each \nyear in keeping spending under control.\n  I have seen firsthand the tough choices that must be made. For the \npast 8 years, my husband served as Governor of Maine. Like the \nGovernors of 48 other States, he was required to balance our State's \nbudget, irregardless of economic conditions or the State's financial \nstatus.\n  This means that Congress will have to make tough choices. But, with \ndiscipline these decisions are as possible as they are necessary. And \nlest anyone think that the States do not consider a balanced budget \nworthy of being a part of the U.S. Constitution, 49 States already \nrequire a balanced budget.\n  If accountability and discipline work at the State level, we can and \nshould make it work at the Federal level. Congress should be able to \nconfront the economic realities and challenges that 49 States--and \nevery American--face as well. They have made the difficult choices even \nwith declining revenues and a declining economy.\n  When we speak of interest payments, deficits, and the debt--we throw \naround numbers in the millions, billions and trillions. We paint a big \npicture that sometimes obscures the direct impact this issue has on \neach and every American family. We must now focus on exactly what these \nnumbers mean in terms of people's daily lives.\n  There is little doubt that deficits and debt place a crippling burden \non hard-working families in my home State of Maine and across our great \nland. An analysis compiled by the Concord Coalition, for example, \nsuggests that the deficit takes an alarming toll in national \nproductivity. In real terms for American families, increased \nproductivity would mean an average American family income of $50,000 \nannually, instead of the current $35,000 a year. Lost income of $15,000 \nand untold costs, Mr. President: our constituents do not deserve this \ninjustice.\n  How many children, I wonder, go without a proper education because of \nthat missing $15,000?\n  How many couples or single parents forego proper, safe child care \nbecause of these numbers? How many Americans make difficult choices on \nhealth care coverage because they do not have these funds to provide \ncoverage to their spouses or children?\n  Is this what has become of the American Dream when, by ignoring the \ndeficit, we deny American families the opportunity to prosper \nfinancially, or survive economically?\n  But even more devastating for our workers looking for stable jobs \nwith a good wage, the Federal deficit has had an alarming impact on our \nNation's economic growth and job creation. The New York Federal Reserve \nBank attributes a reduction in savings to the deficit, and says that in \nthe 10 years from 1979 to 1989, this reduced growth in the gross \nnational product and in personal income by 5 percent. This has a \ndevastating effect on jobs in our Nation: 3.75 million jobs in 10 \nyears--650,000 for every percentage point in the GNP--lost because of \nthe deficit, according to a study by the Congressional Budget Office.\n  That is an astounding cost for our inaction that rests on the \nshoulders of every American worker.\n  Unfortunately, the statistics and examples of the burden our debt and \ndeficit inflicts on each American continues to be staggering: Since \n1980, our national debt has grown from $1 trillion to $4.7 trillion. \nThis is expected to grow to $6.3 trillion by 1999--a 453-percent rate \nof growth since 1980. During the same timeframe, the annual interest we \npay on our growing national debt has ballooned out of control, rising \nfrom $117 billion in 1982 to almost $300 billion in 1994 to $373 \nbillion in 1999, or a 219-percent growth rate between 1982 and 1999. \nThese numbers mean that in the next 5 years, the burden of this debt \nfor every man, woman, and child in the United States will rise from \n$17,938 to $22,909--growing by about $5,000 in just 5 years. Just in \n1\\1/2\\ years that per capita debt had increased by $1,300.\n  As the distinguished Senator from New Mexico [Mr. domenici] has \nemphasized, our national debt represents the most unfair tax ever \nimposed. The Office of Management and Budget has already estimated that \nif we continue our current spending spree, future generations will be \nforced to suffer a tax rate of 82 percent in order to pay our bills. \nThose same generations have no say, no voice, and no vote.\n  But the prices of our inaction do not just come on an annual basis. \nEvery day, we add $819 million of daily interest to the national debt.\n  One would think that, in the face of this track record\n   that Congress would have mustered the courage long ago to meet the \nchallenge of a balanced Federal budget, stopping short of an amendment. \nThat is a major debate here as to whether or not we should have a \nconstitutional amendment or a statutory approach.\n\n  It is interesting to note in the last 15 years in the Congress we \nhave had seven opportunities to consider a constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget. Time and time again we heard from critics of such \nconstitutional approach that we can do it, we do not need a \nconstitutional amendment. All we need is to have the will and the \ncourage and the discipline to make those choices. We have learned \notherwise from that approach.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Ms. SNOWE. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from Maine for yielding, but I could \nnot help thinking, when she was talking about what was going to happen \nto future generations, about people who keep coming up with this idea, \nsaying, ``Where are you going to cut?'' And they try to single out all \nthe programs to show that the individual who is trying to do this \nsomehow lacks compassion. Yet, as the Senator pointed out, future \ngenerations, if we do not do something today and stay on the track \nwhere we are today, are going to have to pay for everything we are \ndoing today.\n  If it gets down to a discussion of compassion, then why would we not \nbe in a position to say that, if you really want to be compassionate, \nlet us bite the bullet today? Let us do it.\n  I think the CBO and others have come up with the figures projecting \nout where we would be in the next 10 to 20 years if we do not make a \nchange. If we do not pass something like this immediately, it gets down \nto a very personal basis. I have two grandchildren, ages 20 months and \n21 months. It works out, if we do not do something and we continue on \nthis trend that we have right now, that during their lifetimes they are \ngoing to have to pay 75 percent of their lifetime income just to \nservice the debt.\n  So I guess I would ask the Senator from Maine if this is not really \nthe most compassionate route to take, to go ahead, bite the bullet now \nand be responsible now?\n  Ms. SNOWE. Absolutely. I think the Senator makes an excellent point \nabout that because clearly what we are doing is just deferring to \nfuture generations for payment of the bills. There is no doubt about \nit. I think the Senator from Oklahoma recognizes, having served in the \nHouse of Representatives over the years, as well, that it is \ninstitutionally incapable of making those decisions.\n  Ironically, the only time we had a lower deficit was back when we had \nthe \n[[Page S1899]] Gramm-Rudman-Hollings legislation. That was because that \nwas a tool to force the Congress to meet certain targets. But I know \nthat many times in which I have been engaged in deficit reduction \nefforts as a member of the House Budget Committee in the last Congress, \nand previously back in the mid-1980's, I offered specific budget cuts \non the floor in conjunction with some of my colleagues so that we could \nreach a balanced budget statutorily. And on each and every occasion, we \nhad people objecting to every cut. There was a reason. For one, we \ncould not cut any program.\n  So there are always those who have to make some tough choices. But I \nthink the American people can do it fairly and prudently, and to \nprioritize and decide. What can we afford or can the American people \nafford? I think the American people have lost confidence in this \ninstitution, in the fact that their hard-earned taxpayer dollars are \nbeing spent wisely, because we have never been forced to make any \nchoices here other than to spend and spend and tax and tax.\n  As the Senator from Oklahoma will recall, in the last Congress, we \nprovided specific line-item reductions in numerous programs that we \noffered as Republicans in the House Budget Committee, and with the \nsupport of the Senator and all other Republicans on the floor. Those \nspecific line-item cuts were ignored. We ultimately got the largest tax \nincrease in the history of this country. Ironically, the CBO just \nindicated that we will get lower-than-anticipated revenues from those \ntax increases.\n  Mr. INHOFE. If the Senator will yield further, she has hit upon \nsomething that is very significant; that is, we cannot do it any other \nway. We served together for 8 years in the House of Representatives, \nand she was there before that. And I am sure what was going on before. \nBut we tried again and again to do it from a statutory perspective, and \nit did not work.\n  I am a little embarrassed to say that it was one of the Members of \nthe House from the State of Oklahoma that challenged in the courts the \nGramm-Rudman approach to balancing the budget, which was an excellent \napproach. It was ingenious. However, apparently it did cause the \nadministration to infringe upon legislative powers and there was some \nconstitutional problem with it.\n  But those same people who took that to court and were able to strike \nit down so that we did not have to comply with the targets are the ones \nwho say we do not want a balanced budget amendment in the Constitution \nbecause that is our job to do it. I say yes. I agree in this case with \nthose who object to it. It is our job to do it. But we have clearly \ndemonstrated for 40 years that we are incapable of resisting the \ninsatiable appetite to spend the money that we generate from future \ngenerations.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I say to the Senator that 25 years ago was \nthe last time we had a balanced budget. The Senator from Oklahoma will \nprobably agree that we are hearing today, ``We will produce a 7-year \nbudget to achieve the balanced budget amendment.'' We know it is a \ngive-and-take process. But more than that, I say the burden of proof is \non those opponents of the balanced budget amendment because the \nstatutory approach has failed. They have had an opportunity, let us \nsay, over the last 15 years, when they objected to a balanced budget \namendment, to come up with a statutory approach. We have had statutory \nremedies, all of which have failed.\n  So now we are at the point of deciding the future of this country. Do \nwe enact a constitutional amendment? There are those who will probably \nfundamentally disagree with having a balanced budget whatsoever. They \ndisagree in principle. I happen not to. I think it is most important \nthat we do it for the country, as the Senator does. But I think it is \nignoring the choices that we are required to make. I think that this is \nthe only way in which we are going to make those tough decisions on \nwhat exactly is affordable and acceptable to the American people.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield further, I think \nit is a significant point to make that if it is not going to be done \ntheir way, it is not going to be done at all. I do not know of one \nperson who goes out and campaigns for office and says: Elect me, \nbecause I want to increase your deficit. I honestly do not think they \nreally want to increase the deficits. But there is the temptation to \nget these programs today, saying, ``Well, there is nothing wrong with \nit. We are borrowing from ourselves.'' They do not stop to think and \nrealize sometimes what they are doing to the future generations.\n  I would also ask the Senator if she might stop and think about how \nlong we have been looking at this. There was a very outstanding Senator \nfrom Nebraska by the name of Carl Curtis, many years ago. In 1970, I \nwas in the State senate in the State of Oklahoma. At that time, just to \nremind you how far we have come, I can remember that the National \nTaxpayers Union had an advertisement that they showed on television. \nThey said: Do you really want to know how bad the debt in this country \nis? Mr. President, they said: If you want to know how bad the debt is, \nif you took $100 bills and stacked the $100 bills on top of each other, \nby the time it reached the height of the Empire State Building--that \nwas a tall building in those days--it would be the amount of our debt, \nwhich is $400 billion. Now, look where it is today.\n  Back in 1972, this Senator from Nebraska, Carl Curtis, had a \nbrilliant idea. He was the author of the Senate budget balancing \namendment at that time. So he called me up one day. I was a State \nsenator. He said, ``Inhofe, if you would just try something new here. \nLet us break down the resistance in the U.S. Senate and in Congress, \nbecause these people up here live in their ivory towers, and they don't \nhave a sense of what is going on at home.'' He said, ``Why don't you \npresent a budget balancing amendment out in the State of Oklahoma?'' I \nsaid, ``Well, that is an ingenious idea.'' His thought was that if he \ncould get 38 States to do that, it would indicate there was grassroots \nsupport for a balanced budget amendment.\n  Keep in mind this is 1972. So in 1972, I introduced and got passed in \nthe State of Oklahoma a ratifying resolution. And I remember that there \nwas a guy named Anthony Kerrigan, a syndicated columnist, who wrote an \narticle entitled ``A Voice in the Wilderness.'' Way out in Oklahoma, \nthere is a State senator that is going to figure out a way to balance \nthe budget. Here it is now, a couple of decades later, and we still \nhave not done it. But we found in that short period of time that there \nis such a ground swell for support, when you get closer to the people, \nthat we are willing to do it. And we had commitments from 38 States in \n1972 to ratify such a resolution.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, look where we are \ntoday in terms of the level of debt since that period of time. The \nSenator mentioned that he was a State senator. I, too, was a State \nsenator in the State of Maine. We had to balance our budgets. We have \nhad to balance our budgets in some very difficult economic times \nregardless of the downturn in the economy, which certainly has been the \ncase in New England and in the State of Maine, where we have had the \nmost difficult downturn since the Depression. They have had to balance \nthe budget. They made tough choices.\n  I know in the debate on the floor in the House of Representatives, \nthe Senator will recall in the last Congress and back in 1992, Members \nof the House said, ``How can we possibly and accurately estimate \nrevenue projections? How can we estimate inflation rates or interest \nrates or unemployment rates?''\n  That is going to be a very difficult and taxing responsibility. That \nis what every State has to do in the country, and every local \ngovernment, every business, and each family does, in the final \nanalysis. They have to make those projections and they have to correct \nthose projections. So they have made those choices. They do not live in \nfiscal fantasyland like we have here in Congress.\n I think the American people have recognized that, and that is why they \nare demanding this most important and fundamental change.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. If the Senator will yield further, going back to our \nyears as State senators--and probably the same thing was true in Maine \nas in Oklahoma--people yell and scream about it. They do not like it. \nThere are members in the house and senate in \n[[Page S1900]] Oklahoma who, every year, try to figure out ways to \neither inflate projections of income and revenues or minimize \nexpenditures to circumvent this thing; yet, in the final analysis, they \nknow that we have a type of sequestration that sets in. If they do not \ndo it, they are going to have to bite the political bullet of all those \npeople who have their programs cut by 1 or 2 percent, whatever it \ntakes. And it works.\n  People in this body quite often talk about the States that have a \nbalanced budget amendment. Look at the cities. I was mayor of the city \nof Tulsa--a major city--for three terms. In our charter, we had the \nsame thing. There are always people on the city commission who want to \ncircumvent that and somehow want to spend more money than comes in, but \nthey have not been able to do it. For all those individuals who say \nthis is different, the Federal Government should not be like States or \nshould not be like the cities and the other subdivisions, they have yet \nto come up with any logical justification for that statement. If it \nworks at the State level in almost all of the States and it works in \nalmost every city charter, it would work in the Federal Government.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I think the Senator makes outstanding points, and I think \nwe agree. What is more fundamental than providing fiscal order, \nespecially for the future of this country, in making those kinds of \nchoices, albeit difficult, but ones that are compelling and ones that \nneed to be made? I thank the Senator for the points he has made.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, might I just say, in terms of what we \ncan expect for future deficits, it is disturbing to note the trend. The \nCongressional Budget Office, in fact, testified before the Senate \nBudget Committee recently and indicated that according to their \nrecalculations, the deficit will increase by $25 billion over the next \n5 years. So we can expect more debt over the next 5 years than we \noriginally anticipated because of interest rates and, in fact, lower \nthan anticipated revenue from the income tax increases and other tax \nincreases of 1993. Between now and 2002 we will add a cumulative total \nof nearly $2 trillion to the existing debt if we make no changes in \nfiscal policy.\n  One further point. The CBO, in their testimony, indicated that, \nobviously, one of the positive benefits of a balanced budget would be \nto increase productivity because of less debt, but also, most \nimportantly, increase the amount of personal savings in this country. \nAnd if you look at the testimony that was provided by Mr. Greenspan, \nthat is clearly essential for the future, because the personal saving \nrate, in his words, has been running at its lowest level in nearly half \na century. He said,\n\n       If we were a high-saving nation, we might be in a position \n     to better tolerate the Federal fiscal imbalance. But, as you \n     can see in the chart, the Federal deficit has generally been \n     absorbing half or more of the available domestic saving since \n     the early 1980's.\n       Looking back at the history of the past century or more, \n     the record would suggest that nations ultimately must rely on \n     their domestic savings to support domestic investment.\n\n  He went on to say,\n\n       The challenge for the United States over the coming decade \n     is clear. We must sustain higher levels of investment if we \n     are to achieve a healthy increase in productivity and be \n     strong and successful competitors in the international \n     marketplace. To support that investment, we shall need to \n     raise the level of domestic saving. Absent a rise in private \n     saving, it will be necessary to eliminate the structural \n     deficit in the Federal budget.\n\n  So that is what it is all about--making choices, increasing the \nstandard of living, not only for the present but for future \ngenerations, by improving productivity, job creation, and finally, I \nshould say, improving the way in which we approach our budgetary \nprocess.\n  There was some testimony presented to the Budget Committee by Mr. \nFosler, President of the National Academy of Administrators, saying we \nshould have performance-based budgeting. This is an idea whose time has \ncome, is long overdue, and in fact was proposed at the beginning of \nthis century. I hope we will take these creative and innovative \napproaches as we begin the historic debate on a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget.\n  Let me close with words of hope for a brighter future for our entire \nNation. As Winston Churchill said in the days of World War II: ``This \nis not the end. This is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, \nperhaps, the end of the beginning.''\n  I hope that will be the case, because if you say ``no'' to a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget, you are saying ``yes'' \nto the economic status quo, ``yes'' to the continued levels of deficits \nof $200 to $300 billion. I assure you, that is not an answer the \nAmerican people want to hear, and it is one they do not deserve to \nhear.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein] \nis recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I voted for the balanced budget \namendment last year. I also voted for the Reid amendment to exempt \nSocial Security, take it off budget, last year. I want to state for the \nRecord--and it is my intention--that I want to vote for a balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  There are two reasons I want to vote for a balanced budget amendment. \nThe first is my own life experience. The year I was born, 61 years ago, \nthe entire Federal debt amounted to just $25 billion. When my daughter \nwas born, the entire Federal debt amounted to about $225 billion. And 2 \nyears ago, when my granddaughter, Eileen, was born, the entire Federal \ndebt was 150 times greater than when I was born; it was nearly $4 \ntrillion. My life experience shows me that, with business as usual, the \nCongress is not going to be able to balance a budget that, in 61 years, \nhas gone from $25 billion to $4 trillion in debt.\n  So, in a nutshell, I want to support a strong balanced budget \namendment. But I want to support the right balanced budget amendment.\n  In my first 2 years as U.S. Senator, I have had the opportunity to \nobserve the standard operating procedure of the Senate--the budget, \nauthorization, and appropriations processes--and I have become \nconvinced that a balanced budget amendment is in order. The American \npeople are sitting on a debt time bomb. It jeopardizes the economic \nsecurity of my daughter, my granddaughter, and even generations to \ncome, because if it continues to be business as usual, the Nation's \npath is one toward bankruptcy and that, quite frankly, is not \nacceptable.\n  I have listened to a lot of arguments about why we should not require \na balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. In theory, certain of \nthese have a great deal of merit. But historical and present day \npractices often demonstrate the wide variation between theory and \npractice when it comes to dealing with the Federal budget.\n  In theory, the Government might run deficits in times of recession to \nstimulate the economy, or in war simply to pay its bills, and surpluses \nin times of prosperity because revenue increases and unemployment \ndecreases. In fact, though, that has not happened. In the last 35 \nyears, the Federal Government has balanced its budget exactly twice--\nonce in 1960, a surplus of $300 million, and again in 1969, a surplus \nof $3.2 billion.\n  In the last quarter of a century, the Federal Government has run up \nthis $4 trillion in debt without once balancing the budget. And during \nthis time, the Nation has experienced war and peace and economic booms \nand recessions. Yet, never was this Government able to balance the \nFederal budget, let alone run a surplus.\n  As mayor of San Francisco, I balanced nine budgets, and I know it is \ntough to do so. I support this amendment, and I support a line-item \nveto, because I know that failing to balance the budget is a choice \nthat this Nation can no longer afford, for the reasons so stated.\n  Let us talk for a moment about two charts which, when I came here, \nconvinced me--and I regret that these are so small; we thought we had \nthem enlarged, but we do not. These two charts, I think, are very \ninstructive. If you can see them, Mr. President, in 1969--these are \nFederal outlay charts--military spending consumed 45 percent of our \nFederal outlays. In 1994, about 19 percent of our Federal outlays were \nmilitary. So military spending has gone from almost one-half to just \nslightly under a quarter.\n   [[Page S1901]] In 1969, entitlements--Medicare, Medicaid, Social \nSecurity, and AFDC--consumed about 27 percent of Federal outlays.\n  In 1994, they consumed almost 50 percent of Federal outlays. There is \nthe rub. In 1969, interest on our debt consumed slightly less than 7 \npercent. In 1994, interest on the debt had doubled to nearly 14 percent \nof total outlays.\n  What is left? Discretionary spending--education, health, environment, \nCommerce, Interior, all those departments--in 1969 consumed 21 percent \nof Federal outlays. In 1994, 18 percent; actually down. Discretionary \nspending has gone down, military spending has gone down dramatically.\n  What has gone up? Interest on the debt and entitlements. And there is \nthe rub. There is the answer I believe to the right to know. That is \nthe road that lies before us. If we really want to make the budget \nbalanced, those are the hard choices: What to do about interest on the \ndebt--which today net interest consumes 40 percent of every person's \ntax dollar--and how do we control entitlements, Medicare, Medicaid, \nSocial Security, and so on?\n  The Federal Government now spends $226 billion just on interest on \nits nearly $5 trillion debt. Our interest payments alone are $59 \nbillion greater than the projected deficit of $176 billion for the year \n1995. This means that if we did not have to service the debt, there \nwould be no deficit this year. If we did not have to service our debt, \nthere would be no deficit. As a matter of fact, there would be a small \nbudget surplus. That is the irony of the problem that we have.\n  So if current policy continues, the CBO estimates that net interest \npayments will reach $387 billion by the year 2004, or roughly 58 \npercent of the amount that is expected to be spent on all discretionary \nprograms, $669 billion will go by the year 2004 just to pay for \ninterest on the debt. That is not for Commerce. That is not for \nInterior. That is not for an education program. That is not for a \nhealth program. That will not purchase a tank or an aircraft carrier or \na battleship. It will be just paper to service the debt.\n  Today, every dollar in personal income taxes collected west of the \nMississippi is used to pay for nothing more than interest. And that is \nthe sad story, because the interest is growing and we need to stop it.\n  So what has 35 years of accumulated deficits meant on our committee? \nAccording to a study by the New York Federal Reserve Board, the low \nnational savings rate, now under 3 percent--and it is the lowest of any \nmajor industrialized power--is mostly attributable to large Federal \ndeficits. And it has resulted in a net loss of 5 percent of national \nincome during the 1980's. That impacts interest rates, it impacts jobs, \nit impacts the ability to buy a home, a car, to afford an education. It \nimpacts the job base. It impacts everything we do every day in our \nlife.\n  And as it gets worse, I think what the Senator from Maine was saying \nis it impacts our children's destinies and our grandchildren's \ndestinies as well.\n  So for all of these reasons--and I want my chairman on the Judiciary \nCommittee to understand this--I want to vote for a balanced budget \namendment because I do not believe we can make the hard choices without \nit. And as I have said, they are all in that 50 percent--Medicare, \nMedicaid, Social Security, AFDC--and then that 15 percent which is \ninterest on the debt for the most part.\n  Now, I do not think Congress should push through just any amendment, \nno matter what. It has to be an amendment which balances the budget \nwisely and honestly.\n  And that is the rub for me. This is where we come to Social Security. \nLet me be frank. I do not want to speak in detail because we will go \ninto this later.\n  But because of a statement I made yesterday indicating my position--\nand I am particularly delighted that my chairman is on the floor so \nthat he can hear this. I consider the greatest flaw in the amendment \nthat we have before us is the fact that it places moneys placed in \nreserve through the FICA tax to pay for retirements in the future. It \nplaces those revenues on budget. And I believe that that is not an \nhonest way to balance the budget.\n  I believe that this puts Social Security essentially on budget. It \nreverses congressional action and it undermines the integrity of the \nSocial Security system.\n  Now between its creation in 1935 and 1969, Social Security was always \noff budget. Then in an attempt to cover the cost of the Vietnam war and \nto mask the growing deficit, Social Security was put on budget by this \nCongress. This was a misuse of the Social Security trust fund.\n  In 1990, 2 years before I came to this place, the Congress saw that \nand they put an end to it. They declared as follows:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the receipts \n     and disbursements of the Federal Old Age and Survivors \n     Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance \n     Trust Fund shall not be counted as new budget authority, \n     outlays, receipts, or deficit or surplus for purpose of:\n       (1) the budget of the United States Government as submitted \n     by the President,\n       (2) the congressional budget, or\n       (3) the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act \n     of 1985.\n\n  In this body, that vote was 98 to 2. So clearly, Members said we must \nnot use Social Security revenues held in trust for retirement to \nbalance the budget. And, boom, the right thing was done and it was \ntaken off budget.\n  What this amendment does is put it back on budget again.\n  This would clearly include Social Security. It would overturn both \nthe historical treatment of Social Security and Congress' recent \ndecision to affirm the off-budget status of Social Security. Worse, it \nwould allow the misuse of Social Security funds to continue.\n  The important point is, Congress has already debated this. They have \ntaken it off budget. It is not a loophole. This amendment is not meant \nto be an escape hatch.\n  I know that there is an amendment at the desk called S. 290. I \nreviewed that amendment. That amendment is flawed because that \namendment deals with benefits. It does not deal with the moneys that \nare taken from the FICA tax paid by employees and employers and held in \ntrust for retirees.\n  Now, even without this balanced budget amendment, just for one short \nmoment let us look at what happens with Social Security now off budget.\n  Here we are today in 1995. Social Security is generating surpluses.\n  As a matter of fact, Social Security will generate these surpluses, \nup to the year 2002. In 1995, $69 billion; 1996, $142 billion. It \nclimbs and it climbs. In 1999, it is $394 billion. It goes up to $705 \nbillion of surpluses from the FICA tax held in trust to pay retirements \nfor the baby boomer generation that is now, alas, beginning to retire.\n  What happens? What happens is this: There is $3 trillion by the year \n2015 in revenue surpluses. Then they plunge. They go down to the year \n2030, $700 billion negative. Negative. Now, here is the rub with this \namendment. It takes all of these revenues and it puts them on budget. \nSo these revenues are used to balance the budget. The way to avoid $705 \nbillion in 2002 when this becomes relevant is to create a surplus of \n$705 billion. Nobody here believes we will be able to create a surplus \nof $705 billion to protect Social Security.\n  So what is the answer? The answer is, in an honest amendment, take it \noff budget. Do not allow those revenues to be used.\n  Now, I would like to have printed in the Record a letter I received \ntoday from Martha McSteen, the president of the National Committee to \nPreserve Social Security and Medicare. She says:\n\n       I am writing with regard to S. 290, introduced recently by \n     Senators Kempthorne, Dole, Thompson and Inhofe. The fact that \n     the sponsors of S. 290 believe that it is necessary to take \n     action to protect Social Security under a balanced budget \n     amendment is, in my view, proof that it is imperative that \n     the Senate adopt your amendment to exclude Social Security \n     from the balanced budget amendment.\n\n  The pending balanced budget amendment reverses the 1990 law removing \nSocial Security from a consolidated budget and put Social Security back \non budget as part of the Constitution. This represents a serious \nproblem for Social Security which cannot be addressed by S. 290 or any \nstatutory measure. Sponsors of S. 290 cannot bind future Congresses to \ntheir legislation or, for that matter, ensure that this Congress will \nnot modify or overturn this legislation while Social Security \n[[Page S1902]] would remain on budget as part of the Constitution.\n  I also note that while S. 290 attempts to prohibit Congress from \nincreasing Social Security revenues or reducing benefits to balance the \nbudget, it will allow Congress to continue using the surplus in the \nSocial Security trust fund to conceal the deficit. This only confirms \nour understanding that the proponents of the balanced budget amendment \nintend to continue this budgetary charade, thereby avoiding balancing \nthe budget well into the next century.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter in its entirety be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                    National Committee to Preserve\n\n\n                                 Social Security and Medicare,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 1, 1995.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing with regard to S. 290, \n     introduced recently by Senators Kempthorne, Dole, Thompson \n     and Inhofe. The fact that the sponsors of S. 290 believe that \n     it is necessary to take action to protect Social Security \n     under a balanced budget amendment is, in my view, proof that \n     it is imperative that the Senate adopt your amendment to \n     exclude Social Security from the balanced budget amendment.\n       The pending balanced budget amendment reverses the 1990 law \n     removing Social Security from a consolidated budget and puts \n     Social Security back on budget as part of the Constitution. \n     This presents serious problems for Social Security which \n     cannot be addressed by S. 290 or any statutory measure. The \n     sponsors of S. 290 cannot bind future Congresses to their \n     legislation, or for that matter ensure that this Congress \n     will not modify or overturn this legislation while Social \n     Security would remain on budget as part of the Constitution. \n     I also note that while S. 290 attempts to prohibit Congress \n     from increasing Social Security revenues or reducing benefits \n     to balance the budget, it will allow Congress to continue \n     using the surplus in the Social Security trust funds to \n     conceal the deficit. This only confirms our understanding \n     that the proponents of the balanced budget amendment intend \n     to continue this budgetary charade thereby avoiding balancing \n     the budget until well into the next century.\n       The nearly six million members and supporters of the \n     National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare \n     strongly oppose this practice of using the surplus generated \n     by the Social Security payroll tax to fund deficit reduction \n     or mask the true size of the general fund deficit.\n       Let's not forget that the continued borrowing from the \n     Social Security trust funds will only create huge debts for \n     the next generation which will be forced to redeem the bonds \n     through massive tax increases.\n       The only way for proponents of the balanced budget \n     amendment to live up to the many promises not to harm or \n     undermine Social Security is to explicitly exclude it from \n     the text of S.J. Res. 1.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Martha A. McSteen,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I earnestly implore my committee \nchairman, the key is simply to exclude the revenues from balancing the \nbudget in an amendment to this amendment, and that would be presented \nnext week. I believe it is the only way to have an honest amendment. I \nalso believe that it makes sense.\n  There are 40 million people today on Social Security. By the time \nthis amendment is ratified and the first balanced budget is prepared, \nthere will be 80 million Americans on Social Security. Young people \nworking today can expect that the money will not be there to pay for \ntheir retirement, and yet they are paying FICA taxes. That is not \nright. They should not have to pay if the money is not going to be \nthere. If the money is used to balance the budget, it just brings the \ncrunch to Social Security that much sooner. I do not think that that \nshould be a by-product of a balanced budget amendment. More \nfundamentally, I believe it is a flaw that will cause its \nnonratification by enough States to make it the law of the land.\n  What I want to say, the bottom line is if we can adopt the \namendment--and I just read the amendments to the Constitution again \nthis morning--I think if we are going to have monetary policy in the \nConstitution, it is fitting, just as there are technicalities in other \namendments on double jeopardy and that kind of thing, that there be an \namendment which simply exempts the revenues from the trust funds that \nhold the FICA taxes.\n  As I said yesterday, absent those, absent that amendment, I cannot \nvote for a balanced budget amendment. With that amendment, I can vote \nfor a balanced budget amendment. So I say these things today, for \nwhatever help it might be to my chairman in considering where this \nmatter rests.\n  Mr. President, in the year that I was born, the Federal debt amounted \nto less than $25 billion. In the year my daughter was born, the Federal \ndebt was about $225 billion--10 times greater. My granddaughter Eileen \nwas born 2 years ago. At the time of her birth, the Federal debt was \nmore than 150 times greater than it was when I was born--nearly $4 \ntrillion.\n  That, in a nutshell, is why I am a strong supporter of a \nconstitutional balanced budget amendment. The path we are on is \nunsustainable. We do not have another generation to allow this problem \nto fester. The time for action is now.\n  In my first 2 years as a U.S. Senator, I have had the opportunity to \nobserve the standard operating procedure of the Senate--the budget, \nauthorization, and appropriations processes. I am convinced that \nwithout a constitutional amendment, this body will simply be unable to \nbalance the budget.\n  Let me share what I see the problem to be.\n  The American people are sitting on a debt time-bomb jeopardizing the \neconomic security of generations of Americans to come and I believe \nthat without the imposition of an amendment such as this, it will \ncontinue to be business as usual. In my opinion, business as usual just \nisn't acceptable.\n  Although amending the Constitution is strong medicine, I am convinced \nthat without this strong medicine, America's fiscal health will not \nimprove.\n  I have listened to the various arguments about why we should not \nrequire a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. In theory, \ncertain of these arguments have merit. But, I am afraid that historical \nand present day practices often demonstrate the wide variation between \ntheory and practice with regard to the Federal budget.\n  In theory, the Federal Government might run deficits in times of \nrecession to stimulate the economy or in war simply to pay its bills, \nand surpluses in times of prosperity because revenue increases and \nunemployment decreases. In fact, that has not happened.\n  In the last 35 years, the Federal Government has balanced its budget \nexactly twice. Once in 1960, a surplus of $300 million and again in \n1969, a surplus of $3.2 billion.\n  In the last quarter of a century, the Federal Government has run up \nmore than $4 trillion in debt without once balancing the budget. During \nthis time, this Nation has experienced war and peace and economic booms \nand recessions. Yet, never did this Government balance the Federal \nbudget, let alone run a surplus.\n  As mayor of San Francisco, I balanced nine budgets in a row. I know \nhow difficult it is to do. But that is why we are elected--to make \nthose tough choices. I support this amendment and the line-item veto \nbecause I know that failing to balance the budget is a choice that this \nNation cannot afford.\n\n\n                          interest on the debt\n\n  The Federal Government now spends over $226 billion annually just to \npay the interest on its nearly $5 trillion debt. Our interest payments \nalone are $59 billion greater than the projected deficit of $176 \nbillion for fiscal year 1995. This means that if the United States did \nnot have to service this enormous debt, there would be no deficit this \nyear. In fact, we would have a small budget surplus.\n  If current policies continue, the Congressional Budget\n   Office estimates that net interest payments will reach $387 billion \nby the year 2004 or roughly 58 percent of the amount that is expected \nto be spent on all discretionary programs--$669 billion will go just to \npay for interest on the debt.\n\n  Today every dollar in personal income taxes collected west of the \nMississippi is used to pay for nothing more than interest on America's \nstaggering Federal debt, or put another way, that's 40 percent of each \ntaxpayers' tax dollar. This money is not used to build new highways, \nplanes, or ships, provide medical care to a child or grandparent, or \neducation to our Nation's students. Americans receive no services, no \npublic infrastructure, no investment for these interest payments. They \nget \n[[Page S1903]] nothing for 40 percent of their taxes. Left alone, that \nwill become 50 percent, then 60 percent, and on and on till bankruptcy.\n  What has 35 years of accumulated deficits meant to our economy? \nAccording to a study by the New York Federal Reserve Board, the low \nnational savings rate, now under 3 percent--the lowest of any major \nindustrialized country--mostly attributable to large Federal deficits, \nand it has resulted in a loss of 5 percent growth in our national \nincome during the 1980's. Now that's a big deal. Let me tell you what \nit means.\n\n\n                           issues of concern\n\n  For all those reasons, I believe the time has come to pass a \nconstitutional balance budget amendment. I recognize, however, that \namending the Constitution of the United States is very serious \nbusiness. It has been amended just 17 times since 1791.\n  Congress should not push through just any amendment that says just \nbalance the budget no matter what. We must pass an amendment which will \nlet us balance the budget honestly and wisely.\n\n\n                       social security amendment\n\n  I must be frank. I don't believe that legislation before us is the \nbest constitutional amendment. Its greatest flaw is that it continues \nthe process of misusing Social Security funds. Let me explain how:\n  First, this amendment would put Social Security on-budget, thereby \nreversing congressional action and undermining the integrity of the \nsystem.\n  Between its creation in 1935 and 1969, Social Security has always \nbeen off-budget. In an attempt to cover the costs of the Vietnam war \nand later to mask growing deficits, Social Security was put on-budget.\n  This was a misuse of the Social Security trust fund. In the 1990 \nBudget Enforcement Act, Congress put an end to this by declaring Social \nSecurity funds off-budget. The act states:\n\n       * * * the receipts and disbursements of the Federal Old-Age \n     and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability \n     Insurance Trust Fund--which together make up the Social \n     Security Program--shall not be counted as new budget \n     authority, outlays, receipts, or deficit or surplus for \n     purposes of--\n       (1) the budget of the United States Government as submitted \n     by the President;\n       (2) the congressional budget, or\n       (3) the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act \n     of 1985.\n\n  An amendment in the Senate to exclude Social Security from budget \ncalculations was passed in the 101st Congress by a vote of 98 to 2. \nEvery Member there that served in the 101st Congress voted for that \namendment.\n  The joint resolution before us now requires total outlays not to \nexceed total receipts for any fiscal year. This would clearly include \nSocial Security and thereby overturn both the historical treatment of \nSocial Security and Congress' recent decision to affirm the off-budget \nstatus of Social Security. Worse, it would allow the misuse of Social \nSecurity funds to continue.\n  The important point is, Congress has already debated this matter and \ndecided to take Social Security off-budget. This is not a loophole. It \nwas an informed decision to budget honestly. Now this constitutional \namendment will reverse that. This amendment would enshrine this abuse \nof Social Security in the U.S. Constitution.\n  This debate is not about who wants to protect Social Security and who \ndoes not. It is about who wants to be honest with the American people \nin our budgeting and fiscal policy and who does not. To be honest, \nSocial Security must remain off-budget. Including Social Security in \nthe budget calculations would be the enormous loophole. It is not the \nFederal Government's money and should not be used as if it is.\n  Second, Social Security is not like other Government programs and \nshould not be treated like other Government programs.\n  Social Security is a publicly administered, compulsory, contributory \nretirement program. Through the Federal Insurance Contributions Act \n[FICA], workers are required to contribute 6.2 percent of their \nsalaries to Social Security. Employers are required to match that \namount. This 12.4 percent contribution funds the Social Security \nsystem. By law, these funds are required to be held by the Federal \nGovernment in trust. They are not the Federal Government's funds, but \ncontributions that workers pay in and expect to get back.\n  Third, Social Security does not contribute to the Federal deficit.\n  In fact, the Social Security trust fund surpluses are masking the \ntrue size of the deficit. In 1995 Social Security will take in $69 \nbillion more than it will pay out in benefits. By 2001, Social Security \nwill be running surpluses of more than $100 billion a year. By \nincluding Social Security in the constitutional balanced budget \namendment, Congress would obfuscate the true deficit problem.\n  Fourth, the failure to save Social Security's surpluses could \nundermine the system's viability.\n  In the late 1970's and early 1980's, Congress changed the way the \nSocial Security system was financed. Recognizing the large demand on \nthe system that would be created by the retirement of the baby boomer \ngeneration early next century, the Social Security system was changed \nfrom as pay-as-you-go system to a system that would accumulate large \nsurpluses now to prepare for the vast increase in the number of \nretirees later.\n  Rather than saving these large surpluses, however, Congress has used \nthem to finance the deficit. That means beginning in 2019, when Social \nSecurity is supposed to begin drawing down its accumulated surpluses to \npay for the benefits of the vast numbers of retiring baby boomers, \nthere will be no money saved to draw on.\n  Congress will be forced to either raise taxes, cut benefits, or cut \nother spending programs to meet the obligations workers are paying for \nnow. In short, the American workers will have to pay twice for the \nretirement of the baby boomers because we are not saving\n what they contribute now.\n\n  As the chart next to me illustrates, the Social Security surpluses \nwill decline and then plunge dramatically into deficit. The deficit \nwill reach $700 billion a year by 2029.\n  Between 1995 and 2002, Congress will essentially steal $705 billion \nfrom the Social Security trust fund. That is the amount of surplus that \nis supposed to be saved over that period, but instead will be used to \nbalance the budget. If we are to save that money, the budget would have \nto run a surplus of $705 billion and we know that will not happen.\n  By the year 2018, the Federal Government will owe the Social Security \nsystem $3 trillion. Those who say that Social Security is not on the \ntable with this amendment are incorrect. It is--bigtime; to the tune of \n$3 trillion of reserves for retirement that will be involved unless our \namendment is passed.\n  Clearly, unless we begin saving the Social Security surpluses and \naddressing the long-term needs of the system, we will be spearheading a \nfinancial Armageddon for Social Security.\n  The only way to save the Social Security surpluses to pay for future \nretirements is to balance the budget exclusive of Social Security.\n  The impact of this, of course, would be that the Federal Government \nwould run a unified budget surplus--a balanced Federal budget and a \nsurplus in the Social Security trust fund. In this way, we would cut \nthe Federal debt and save Social Security funds, not just watch the \ndebt keep growing. That is what the amendment Senator Reid and I are \noffering would do--it would require a balanced Federal budget exclusive \nof Social Security.\n  Social Security system does have a long-term financing problem. In my \nopinion, an expert advisory board should be formed to advise Congress \non how to adjust the system to restore balance and make the system live \nwithin its means.\n  The point, however, is that Social Security changes should be made to \nshore-up the long-term solvency of the Social Security system, not for \nany other reason. By keeping Social Security in this amendment, \nCongress would continue the shell game.\n  My support for maintaining the integrity of the Social Security \nsystem reinforces my support for the balanced budget amendment. But, a \nbalanced budget amendment that uses Social Security funds is not truly \nbalanced.\n  I support a constitutional balanced budget amendment that is honest, \nbut I cannot support a balanced budget amendment which would enshrine \nthe \n[[Page S1904]] theft of Social Security trust funds in the U.S. \nConstitution.\n  If my vote is needed to pass this amendment, then Social Security \nwill have to be exempted.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I yield.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I personally understand what the \ndistinguished Senator from California is saying and trying to do.\n  Keep in mind that although that curve goes up and down, in the year \n2030, it starts going into a deficit. If the balanced budget amendment \nis in play, it will not be allowed to go into the deficit. It is one \nway we can protect Social Security.\n  Under the Senator's approach, it would go into the deficit. The only \nway to protect it is to increase taxes. Now, under the Senator's \napproach, there is no limitation on increasing taxes on Social \nSecurity. They can just go up every year. There is no way to stop it. \nWith a balanced budget amendment, when that heads into deficit, we have \nto balance that account.\n  Now, I might also mention that the distinguished Senator knows that \nevery penny of surplus of Social Security is being used to buy \nGovernment instruments now. Every nickel of that so-called surplus is \nbeing used to buy Government instruments; in other words, pieces of \npaper that say the U.S. Government owes the Social Security fund so \nmuch money. By the year 2030, it goes into deep deficit. The Senator is \nabsolutely right on that. The balanced budget amendment forbids it from \ndoing that because we cannot allow it to go into deficit.\n  The fact of the matter is that during this whole time, while that \ncurve goes up and then down, all of that money is gone anyway, because \nthey have purchased Government bonds, which if we do not get spending \nunder control and if we do not get this economy under control, which \nonly a balanced budget amendment can do, none of that surplus is going \nto be there when we need it, anyway. That is why we have to have a \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  Now, I have listened to my dear friend and colleague from California. \nShe said she wants to support a balanced budget amendment. I do, too. \nIf I had the sole authority to write this amendment, it would \nundoubtedly be different. I did not have that luxury. Neither does my \nfriend from California. As much as the Senator is sincere in trying to \nprotect Social Security this way, she is not protecting it. If I had \nthe sole authority, I would write it differently. I think the Senator \nfrom California would, also.\n  Let me just end this one thought. We have worked on this for 12 \nyears--Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives, moderates, \npeople from all over the country. This is it. This is the best we can \ndo. It is good. It is not perfect; nobody claims that it is. But it is \nas near perfect as we can get it, with the many varying viewpoints and \ndifferences that divide Members on both sides of this Capitol Hill and \nin both parties. So this is it.\n  If we do not pass this balanced budget amendment, then all the \nsincerity in the world that the distinguished Senator from California \nhas in trying to protect the Social Security Trust Fund --and I am with \nher on that, and I will do everything in my power to help her \nthroughout her whole Senate career to get there--everything she is \narguing for will go down the drain for sure.\n  Because interest rates are going to go higher, the debt is going to \nget bigger, our children's future is going to be mortgaged away, and we \nare all going to wind up without the funds anyway because there will \nnot be any way the Government can pay the instruments of debt that it \nis signing everyday on Social Security.\n  So I urge my colleague to really think this through because it is \ngoing to take both sides of the floor to really save Social Security \nfrom what really is a voracious Federal Government, a powerseeking \nmonster that does not seem to care what the future is all about.\n  If we do not take this and seize this one opportunity to put through \nthis bipartisan consensus amendment, which both Democrats and \nRepublicans have worked on, and we let this go, I guarantee you--I \nguarantee you--that if we ever put through another one, it will be a \nlot tougher and a lot worse than this one, in the eyes of most people \nfrom the more liberal persuasion.\n  That is, if we get one at all, and if we do not get a balanced budget \namendment at all, there will be no fiscal mechanism to force us to make \npriority choices among competing programs. I am willing to continue \nthis dialog with my friend because I value her viewpoint, I value her, \nthe distinguished Senator from California.\n  I know the sincerity that she has on this, and I know what she is \ntrying to do. I am there with the Senator, but we will never get there \nwithout a mechanism called a balanced budget amendment in the \nConstitution. We all know it. I do not think anybody doubts it.\n  The fact of the matter is, this is it. There is nothing we can do to \nmake it any better and keep the very close votes that we have to have \nto pass it. I might add, the distinguished Senator from California is a \ncritical vote in this matter. We value that vote. Even though the Reid \namendment went down last time, the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia voted with us because it was the best we could do.\n  I have to say, as a Senator from Utah and as somebody who has worked \non this for years who really, really, really has given everything he \nhas to try and get this done, that I wish it could be otherwise. I wish \nwe could solve every problem there is, but there is no way we can do it \nin this context, there is no way we can do it in this Congress. But we \ncan move ahead by solving a lot of the problems and, I think, in the \nprocess protect Social Security better than it is protected today \nbecause we will be protecting the economy which, after all, is what \nSocial Security depends upon.\n  If we reach a point where the debt has to be monetized, where we use \ncheap and worthless dollars to pay off the debt to get it off our \nbacks, and inflation shoots up dramatically, which it will, 250-\npercent-plus range and we become like most of the Third World countries \nthat are presently going through those problems, where is Social \nSecurity going to be at that time? Where are our seniors going to be? \nWhere are the young people going to be? Where is the future?\n  The greatest country in the world is going to go down because we do \nnot have the fortitude and the strength of mind and presence of mind \nand the guts to do the only thing that we can do right now. Look, there \nare people on my side who feel like killing because they are not \ngetting a three-fifths vote requisite to increase taxes. They are just \nbeside themselves. We saw 252 of them over in the House just beside \nthemselves. I told them at the beginning of this Congress there is no \nway they can get more than 260 votes over there. We certainly do not \nhave the votes here unless somebody tries to manipulate others, who do \nnot want the amendment anyway, into voting that way.\n  (Mr. THOMPSON assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, the Senator does not control the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. The Senator from California controls the floor. I am \ntrying to make this one point: I know what the Senator is trying to do. \nI appreciate it. I want to help her, and I will help her all the time \nthat I am here in the Senate because I do not want to see the Social \nSecurity trust fund compromised in any way. I believe everybody on this \nside will help her. But if her point of view becomes--well, it will not \nbecome because there is no way we will have a balanced budget amendment \nif she insists that this has to be there and enough people do that we \ndo not have the votes, there is no way we can have a balanced budget \namendment.\n  But if her point of view becomes the law, then come the year 2028, \n2029, 2030, we are going to be in a tremendous deficit, that is if we \nmake it that far. In the interim time, of course, our debts are going \nto mount up, our interest rates will go off the charts, our economy is \ngoing to go bust and all those debt instruments that are supposed to \npay this surplus to help people on Social Security are going to \ndefault, or else--we would never let them default--they would be paid \nby cheap dollars, by dollars that are worthless and people on Social \nSecurity will not be \n[[Page S1905]] able to buy the food, clothing, the shelter that they \nneed under those circumstances.\n  So the best thing we can do right now, if we are really concerned \nabout it, is pass a balanced budget amendment, get this mechanism in \nplace, make us make priority choices among competing programs, have us \nlive within our means, and keep this trust fund strong and keep Social \nSecurity strong well into the next century and beyond the year 2030.\n  I wanted to make those points. I am willing to work with the Senator \nfrom California. I am willing to line up with her and try and help \nsolve these problems. It is just there is so much we can do on this \nbalanced budget amendment. This is it. It depends on the good faith of \nall of us here whether we are going to pass it or whether we are not \ngoing to pass it. I believe we will in the end, but it is going to take \nan awful lot of effort by all of us, and I suspect it is going to be a \nlong, hard debate.\n  I hope the distinguished Senator from California will keep an open \nmind and work with us on it, and I promise I will try to help her in \nher goals and her desires to make sure this trust fund is protected for \neverybody in our society.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator from California yield for a question?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, we had a discussion yesterday on the \nfloor about the authority of the courts with respect to a balanced \nbudget amendment, whether they would have authority to enforce that, \nand the distinguished Senator, Senator Hatch, responded to that in \npart. I will have more to say about that later.\n  Mr. President, my question today has to do with the authority of the \nPresident with respect to the balanced budget amendment. I wonder if \nthe Senator from California can tell me when the President, on \nInauguration Day, raises his hand and swears to uphold the Constitution \nof the United States, which at that time, let us assume, includes this \namendment, my question is, what authority or what duty does the \nPresident have under this amendment to balance the budget if the \nCongress, in fact, has not balanced that budget?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I cannot answer that with specificity, but it would \nseem to me that if Congress fails to balance the budget that the \nPresident would have some authority, and whether this automatically \nconfers a line-item veto or whether we do it separately, it would seem \nto me that the President should be a player and a dominant player in \nbeing able to assure that the budget is balanced.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. If the Senator assumes that this amendment gives to the \nPresident that line-item veto, I assume that the Senator also assumes \nthat that power is without limitation; that is to say, if the President \nhas the authority under this amendment to balance the budget if \nCongress has failed to do so, then the President can take whatever part \nof the budget he wants and impound it without limitation. He can \nimpound Star Wars, he can impound Social Security, he can impound \nrailroad retirement, or any part to any degree of the Federal budget. \nWould the Senator agree with me on that?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Not necessarily, I say to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Louisiana.\n  If I might refer this to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I \nthink it would be most interesting to have his response to this \nquestion.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am sorry; I was not listening.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Yes. The question I had, Mr. President, was to what \nextent does the President of the United States have a duty or authority \nunder the Constitution, which he is sworn to uphold, to balance this \nbudget if the Congress has failed to do so?\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, every President has a duty to do his best or her \nbest, to try to bring our fiscal house into order. But for the last 26 \nyears no President has been able to really submit a balanced budget to \nthe Congress. They may have once or twice.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. What I really have in mind is what is the limit of the \nPresident's impoundment authority under this amendment?\n  Mr. HATCH. He has no authority at this point.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Under this amendment, if this amendment passes?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is right. Do you mean under the balanced budget \namendment?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. If this constitutional amendment passes and becomes the \nlaw of the land and the President takes the oath to uphold this \nConstitution----\n  Mr. HATCH. There would be no impoundment authority under this \nbalanced budget amendment. Under Senate Joint Resolution 1, or House \nJoint Resolution 1, there is nothing in either amendment, either the \nHouse or the Senate version--and they are both identical except for one \ncomma----\n  Mr. DODD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I ask for the regular order.\n  Mr. HATCH. Under either version, there is no right to impound. It is \nnot the intention of this amendment to grant the President any \nimpoundment authority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is that the Senator from \nCalifornia has the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. As I understand it----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. And may only yield for a question.\n  Mr. HATCH. As I understand it, she wanted me to answer these \nquestions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That would take unanimous consent.\n  Does the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I would like to pose the question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Then let whoever wishes answer it. I think it is a very \nserious question. And I do not think it is answered by the terms of the \namendment or by the legislative history here. After all, we have a \nBudget Control and Impoundment Act, but this is the Constitution we are \nexpounding. I think it is at least arguable, if not persuasive, that \nthis constitutional amendment would overrule that Budget Control and \nImpoundment Act and would return us to the days of President Nixon \nwhere he felt that he had the inherent power to impound. Indeed, he \nmight feel as if he had the inherent duty to impound. I think we better \nfind the answer to that and, if it is not clear under the amendment, \nmake it clear.\n  I might say to my friend from California that I propose later on to \nmake it clear what the authority of the courts is by an amendment which \nI am working on, and I would like to also make it clear what the power \nof the President is. These are fundamental constitutional questions \nwith overriding importance to the country, and before we pass a \nconstitutional amendment we need to know whether it is enforceable and, \nif so, by whom.\n  So I hope the Senator will work with us and will withhold some \njudgment. Assuming she can get her Social Security issue successfully \nsolved, I hope she will also understand the gravity of the question of \nenforceability and the absolute necessity to clear up what is an \noverhanging ambiguity in this amendment. It is an ambiguity so great \nthat it is almost impossible to fly through that fog, and I hope she \nwill work with us in trying to get that cleared up.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator. I do yield.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I must raise a point of order. Under the \nrules of the Senate, you cannot yield for comments. You cannot yield \nthrough the person who holds the floor for someone else to ask \nquestions. We have people who are waiting to speak. We have an order \nunder which they speak. And I think if people want to speak, they \nshould wait, be recognized, make their point, raise these profound \nquestions about what happens if we do not do what the American people \nwant us to do. The debate here is about how we do what the American \npeople want us to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is going to enforce the rules of the \ndebate. The Senator may only yield for a question.\n  Mr. HATCH. May I ask a question----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n   [[Page S1906]] Mr. HATCH. Of the Senator from California. Then I \nwill bring this to a close.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Absolutely.\n  Mr. HATCH. The question I have is would the Senator like me at this \npoint to answer the question of the Senator from Louisiana?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That would be helpful.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to respond to the impoundment \nargument that Senator Johnston has just raised. In each of the years \nthe balanced budget amendment has been debated, I have noticed that one \nspecious argument is presented as a scare tactic by the opponents of \nthe amendment. This year the vampire rising from the grave is \nPresidential impoundment. Supposedly, a President, doing his best \nCharles I of England impersonation, when faced with the possibility of \nbudgetary shortfalls after ratification of the balanced budget \namendment, will somehow have the constitutional authority--nay duty--to \narbitrarily cut social spending programs or even raise taxes. Well, \nCharles Stuart literally lost his head when he claimed as a prerogative \nthe powers of the Commons. So too, a President may not claim authority \ndelegated by the Constitution to the people's Representatives. The law \nis our Cromwell that will prevent impoundment.\n  I want to emphasize that there is nothing in Senate Joint Resolution \n1 that allows for impoundment. It is not the intent of the amendment to \ngrant the President any impoundment authority under Senate Joint \nResolution 1. In fact, there is a ripeness problem to any attempted \nimpoundment: indeed up to the end of the fiscal year the President has \nnothing to impound because Congress in the amendment has the power to \nameliorate any budget shortfalls or ratify or specify the amount of \ndeficit spending that may occur in that fiscal year.\n  Moreover, under section 6 of the amendment, Congress must--and I \nemphasize ``must''--mandate exactly what type of enforcement mechanism \nit wants, whether it be sequestration, rescission, or the establishment \nof a contingency fund. The President, as Chief Executive, is duty bound \nto enforce a particular requisite congressional scheme to the exclusion \nof impoundment. That the President must enforce a mandatory \ncongressional budgetary measure has been the established law since the \n19th century case of Kendall v. United States ex rel. Stokes, 37 U.S. \n(12 Pet.) 542 (1838). In Kendall, Congress had passed a private act \nordering the Postmaster General to pay Kendall for services rendered. \nThe Supreme Court rejected the argument that Kendall could not sue in \nmandamus because the Postmaster General was subject only to the orders \nof the President and not to the directives of Congress. The Court held \nthat the President must enforce any mandated--as opposed to \ndiscretionary--congressional spending measure pursuant to his duty to \nfaithfully execute the law pursuant to Article II, section 3 of the \nConstitution. The Kendall case was given new vitality in the 1970's, \nwhen lower Federal courts, as a matter of statutory construction, \nrejected attempts by President Nixon to impound funds where Congress \ndid not give the President discretion to withhold funding. E.g., State \nHighway Commission v. Volpe, 479 F.2d 1099 (8th Cir. 1973).\n  The position that section 6 implementing legislation would preclude \nPresidential impoundment was seconded by Attorney General Barr at the \nrecent Judiciary Committee hearing on the balanced budget amendment. \nTestifying that the impoundment issue was in reality incomprehensible, \nGeneral Barr concluded that ``the whip hand is in Congress' hand, so to \nspeak; under section 6 [the] Congress can provide the enforcement \nmechanism that the courts will defer to and that the President will be \nbound by.''\n  What we have here then, is an argument based on a mere possibility. \nUnder the mere possibility scenario of an impoundment we would have to \ninclude any possibility, however remote, in the amendment. The \namendment would look like an insurance policy. Why place something in \nthe Constitution that in all probability could never happen, especially \nif Congress could preclude impoundment by legislation?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am going to get to the issue of Social \nSecurity toward the end of my speech, but I think it is very \ninteresting that the focal point of the debate here is what would \nhappen if we did not do what the American people want us to do, after \nwe have amended the Constitution to require that we do it. It seems to \nme that the focal point of debate ought to be how do we do what the \nAmerican people have demanded in overwhelming numbers that we do. That \nis, how do we balance the Federal budget?\n  Mr. President, there are a lot of issues about which I wish to talk. \nI certainly want to speak about Social Security because one of the \nthings that I believe many people watching this debate do not know is \nthat because of a profound election result on November 8, if every \nDemocratic Member of the Senate were to vote the way that Senator did \nwhen we voted on the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution the \nlast time, we will adopt it--the House has already adopted it--it will \ngo to the States; it will be ratified; and it will become the law of \nthe land.\n  So it is of some profound importance when Senators who voted for this \nvery amendment in the last Congress now raise a multitude of objections \nagainst the very amendment that they voted for in the last Congress \nwhen there was no chance of it being adopted, when we were not shooting \nwith real bullets, because now we are in fact shooting with real \nbullets and we have the opportunity to change the Constitution and to \nchange the history of the United States of America.\n  Mr. President, I wish to begin by pointing out that, while I am sure \nthere are a lot of people who believe this debate on the balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution is driven by the tax and spend \nhistory of our country in the last 40 years, a history of runaway \nGovernment spending, of the explosion in growth of the Federal \nGovernment, of an explosion in the tax burden, in reality we are \nengaged today in an old debate and not a new debate.\n  In fact, no less of an authority than Thomas Jefferson, when he first \nsaw the Constitution, raised his concern about the absence of a \nprovision which in essence is the provision that we are debating today. \nIf some of you will remember, Thomas Jefferson was the Minister to \nFrance when the Constitution was written, and he is one of our Founding \nFathers who did not attend the Constitutional Convention.\n  When Jefferson had an opportunity to read the Constitution and to \nunderstand its provisions, he talked in a letter about one change that \nhe would like to make. Some of us are familiar with this quote, but \nmany engaged in the debate are not, and I wish to read it. Here is what \nJefferson wrote:\n\n       I wish it were possible to obtain a single amendment to our \n     Constitution. I would be willing to depend on that alone for \n     the reduction of the administration of our government to the \n     genuine principles of its Constitution. I mean an additional \n     article taking from the government the power of borrowing.\n\n  So, Mr. President, there is no doubt that we are here today debating \na balanced budget amendment to the Constitution because of the utter \nfailure of the Congress and the President, Democratic Presidents and \nRepublican Presidents, primarily Democratic Congresses, but both to get \nthe job done. But this is not a new debate. Thomas Jefferson recognized \nat the beginning of the Republic that it was desirable to put into the \nConstitution a limit on the ability of government to borrow money, and \nin a sense we are correcting a problem in the Constitution that \nJefferson recognized from the beginning.\n  While I am on the subject of Jefferson, it is important to note that \nwe see each day, I believe, in the numbers that we look at on the \ndeficit, a debate which Jefferson engaged in with John Adams. Jefferson \nand Adams were political enemies during their careers, but once they \nhad retired they became close friends. They engaged in correspondence. \nAnd part of that correspondence has become famous as the Jefferson-\nAdams debate.\n  It is more than I will outline, but the essence of the debate was as \nfollows. \n[[Page S1907]] Adams, ever the pessimist, argued that people would \ndiscover that they could use Government to redistribute wealth and that \nonce they made the discovery that Government power could be used to \nredistribute wealth, Adams argued that it would reward indolence, that \nit would impose a burden on productive behavior, and that democracy \nwould fail.\n  Jefferson, ever the optimist, argued that people would make the \ndiscovery--they would discover that Government, through taxing and \nspending, could be manipulated by special interests and that it could \nbe used to take the fruits of the labor from the laborer and give it to \npeople who were not equally productive or who were more powerful \npolitically. But Jefferson argued that the American people would always \nbe so committed to broad-based opportunity that they would recognize \nthat what the Government could take from someone else today and give to \nthem, they could take from them and give to someone else tomorrow, and \nAmericans would therefore reject Government as an instrument for \nredistributing wealth.\n  In a very real sense, today we are immersed in the Jefferson-Adams \ndebate. While I believe that Jefferson is right, the debate as it is \nnow structured is biased in favor of the Adams argument. Let me give a \npractical example.\n  I guess my first experience in budgetary politics was after I was \nelected to Congress in 1978 as a Democrat. In 1979 and 1980 the country \ngot into trouble. We had 13.5 percent inflation, we had 21.5 percent \ninterest rates under President Carter, and President Carter in 1980 \nwithdrew his budget, in an extraordinary action, and he sent to the \nCongress, as best I can remember, about a $6 billion savings package. \nMost of the package was phony. Some of it supposedly saved money by \nspending money sooner rather than counting it in the future year. We \nhave all seen that happen and some have practiced it. He also moved \nsome spending to a future year. But there was $1 billion of real \nsavings that he proposed by denying Government retirees a twice a year \ncost-of-living increase.\n  That saved $1 billion by giving Government retirees a once a year \ncost-of-living increase instead of a twice a year cost-of-living \nincrease. At the time, 98 percent of all private retirees had no cost-\nof-living increase, but my purpose is not to debate the merits.\n  When we voted on the Carter budget revision, over 250 Members of \nCongress voted with the President to try to save the $1 billion. I was \none of them. And then, when a conservative Republican, as it turned \nout, offered an amendment to force us to vote straight up or down on \nthe twice a year cost-of-living increase rather than voting on the \ngeneral concept of dealing with the deficit, as I recall there were \nabout 50 brave souls in the House who stayed with the once a year cost-\nof-living increase and I was one of them. I was up for reelection at \nthe time. I was running against a candidate who, at least initially, \nappeared to be a potential challenge. So I was doing a poll. It is a \nvery small poll but it made a very big impression on me and I wanted to \nshare it with my colleagues and with the people who are interested in \nthis debate.\n  I asked in that poll: ``How many people knew that we had a vote on \nthe twice a year cost-of-living increase for Federal employees and how \nmany people did not know?'' Interestingly enough, not one person that I \npolled in my district who was not a Federal employee or a Federal \nretiree even knew the vote had occurred. But every Government employee \nand every Federal retiree that we polled knew it. In addition, on the \nsecond question, ``Knowing it, how did it affect your support in the \nupcoming election?'', every person who knew it planned to vote against \nme because of the vote. There is nothing wrong with that. The essence \nof democracy is accountability.\n  But here is my point. The reason the system is biased in favor of \nspending is because we vote on individual issues and every time we vote \non spending money we have special interest groups--and we are all part \nof them--looking over our left shoulder, sending letters back home \ntelling people whether we care about the old, the poor, the sick, the \nretired, the bicycle riders--and the list goes on and on.\n  Nobody is looking over our right shoulder telling people back home \nwhether we care about the people who do the work and pay the taxes and \npull the wagon in America, or whether we care about our children and \ntheir future.\n  I remember in 1979 we were going through a fairly boring period in \nCongress. As a young freshman Member I tried to keep up with real votes \nwe cast. Not votes on big bills that cost billions of dollars where the \nvote would be 380 to 20, but actual amendments. In my little casual \nempiricism I made a discovery. The discovery basically was this. The \naverage little amendment add-on we were voting on cost about $70 \nmillion. The average beneficiary, as best I could estimate, got about \n$1,000 to $1,500 apiece. And since there were 100 million taxpayers the \naverage taxpayer was paying about 70 cents. You did not need a Ph.D. in \neconomics to understand that a few people are willing to do more to get \n$1,500 than a lot of people are willing to do to prevent spending 70 \ncents.\n  My conclusion was that only if we change the way we spend money do we \nhave any chance of gaining control of spending, because what tends to \nhappen--and our colleague in the Chair is a new Member here, but as he \nwill discover--what tends to happen is the only people who ever know \nhow you vote on spending issues are the people who wanted the money and \nthey remember most when they do not get it. It is like in a religious \nsense saying if you do good that when you get to the Golden Gate and \nSaint Peter opens the books that there is not going to be anything \nwritten down; no record of it. You are asking people to be responsible \nsimply because that being responsible is the right thing to do.\n  The problem is, the Lord did not make many zealots. And that is why \nwe have consistently, vote after vote, year after year, been losing the \nbattle on Government spending. And as a result the Government has \nbecome bigger and bigger and bigger, more and more distant, more and \nmore hostile, more and more burdensome. And that is why we are here \ndebating this issue today.\n  In trying to deal with this problem we passed what was called the \nGramm-Rudman law. On the day it passed, I stood up and said in that \ndebate that the bill was the engagement but the balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution was the marriage; that the problem with \nthe Gramm-Rudman law was that it was a law, and what Congress could \nmake, Congress could unmake.\n  I did not realize, when I was saying that in 1985, that exactly that \nwas going to end up happening. What happened under the law is that we \nwere able, in the 4\\1/2\\ years it was in place, to lower the deficit \nburden on the economy by about 42 percent. We were able to limit the \ngrowth of Government spending to 1.4 percent a year while the economy \ngrew by 3.1 percent a year and the Government actually got smaller \nrelative to the economy for the first time in the postwar period of the \ncountry.\n  But what happened is when the hill got steep from the recession and \nS bailout, then Congress bailed out on the Gramm-Rudman law, gave the \nnew President the power to suspend it, and the first official act of \nBill Clinton was to suspend the Gramm-Rudman law.\n  What is the problem we are looking at in terms of the deficit? I have \nsome charts. Let me just basically go through them. We are engaged in \nan intensive debate here on what happens if we balance the budget but \nwith relatively little attention paid to what happens if we do not. \nThis chart is basically the question of when are we going to do it? But \nall of this red shows going back to 1969. The one time in the last 34 \nyears, since 1961, that we have actually had a tiny little surplus was \nin 1969. From that point on, every year, we have run a Federal deficit. \nAnd right here is where we are headed if we do not adopt a balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution and if we continue business as \nusual.\n  This next chart is a projection from the Congressional Budget Office. \nIf you look at the last 34 years, this is what it looks like. Starting \nin 1961, we ran a deficit. We ran a deficit every year to 1969. That \nyear we had a tiny little surplus, which is a lot of money for anybody \nbut Ross Perot; $3.2 billion. But in the big scheme of things, it is a \nfairly \n[[Page S1908]] small surplus. But every year thereafter, since 1970, we \nhave run a cumulative deficit which has raised the debt by $3.4 \ntrillion.\n  Given current projections, nobody can honestly anticipate, short of a \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution, that we will balance the \nbudget anytime in the next 15 years. I ask my colleagues, is it \npossible for a country, year after year after year for half a century, \nto spend more money than it takes in and to pile up these debts so that \nthe interest on the debt in the year 2005 will be greater than the \ntotal level of Government spending in 1975?\n  If we do not pass a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, \ngiven the bills that are already the law of the land, given the \nspending that we are already committed to, by the year 2005, 10 years \nfrom now, we are going to be spending $334 billion a year simply paying \ninterest on all of this debt. That is more money than we spent on \nSocial Security, defense, discretionary spending, and every other \nsingle program of the Government in 1975. In fact, there are a number \nof Members of this body who were Members of the Senate in 1975. We are \nnot talking about that long ago.\n  What happens if we do not balance the budget has to do with real \npeople and real families. People talk about the difficulty of balancing \nthe budget and the supposed excruciating pain that is presumed to \nresult from what we are going to have to do, but I hear relatively \nlittle discussion about the excruciating pain that is going to occur if \nwe do not do something about the deficit. Let me talk about that very \nbriefly.\n  In 1950, the average family in America with two children sent $1 out \nof every $50 it earned to Washington, DC. Today, that average family is \nsending $1 out of every $4 it earns to Washington, DC. And if we do not \npass a single new law in the next 20 years, if we just pay for the laws \nthat are already on the books, if we just pay for the Government that \nwe have already thrust upon the American people, that average family is \ngoing to be sending $1 out of every $3 it earns to Washington, DC. That \nis the cost of doing nothing.\n  The General Accounting Office has estimated that, if we pass a \nbalanced budget amendment and we enforce it, the impact of balancing \nthe budget will mean that our children can expect their family income \nto be 36 percent higher than if we do not eliminate a situation where \ngovernment is borrowing 50 cents out of every $1 available meaning that \n50 cents out of every $1 saved in America does not go to build a new \nhome, a new farm, a new factory, to generate new economic growth; it \ninstead all goes to pay for Government deficit spending.\n  The last time that we had a sustained period of a balanced budget so \nthat the Government was not borrowing 50 cents out of every $1, \nmortgage rates were 3.5 percent. In fact, in the history of this \ncountry, whenever we have had any kind of prolonged period where the \nGovernment was living within its means, long-term interest rates have \nbeen down around 3 percent. The average home in America would have a \nmortgage payment of $500 a month less today if we had the fruits of a \nbalanced budget.\n  So when we are talking about all of the excruciating pain that is \nheld out, about what it would mean if the Government had to do what \nfamilies and businesses have to do every year, I think it is important \nto ask ourselves what is going to happen if we do not do it.\n  A couple of other points: I just mentioned that over the next 10 \nyears, the interest payment on the debt, at the rate at which we are \npiling up new debt, is going to rise by $134 billion. We are going to \nbe paying an additional $134 billion a year in 10 years on interest \npayments because we are not balancing the Federal budget.\n  Do you know what we could do with $134 billion a year? The Senator \nfrom California got up and talked about Social Security. With $134 \nbillion a year put into the Social Security trust fund, we could \nguarantee that we could finance the retirement of the baby boomers. \nWith $134 billion a year, which we are going to be squandering on \ninterest while we debate whether the world will come to an end if we \nhave to live within our means, if we took that $134 billion a year and \nused it to cut taxes, we could double the personal exemption and have a \nflat tax rate of 17 percent.\n  We are talking about a tremendous ability to let working families \nbenefit from their own creativity, from their own hard work. But what \nis going to happen if we do not do it? What is going to happen if we do \nnot do it is that $134 billion is not going to go to Social Security. \nThat $134 billion a year is not going to be returned to families to \ninvest in the American dream. That $134 billion is going to be \nsquandered the way the $200 billion a year we are spending this year is \nbeing squandered in paying interest on a debt that we have run up \nbecause this Congress and others like it have refused to say no to any \norganized special interest groups.\n  How would we balance the budget? This is a much discussed issue. We \nhave heard some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle make \nan argument that runs basically as follows: We have not balanced the \nbudget since 1969. We are out of practice. We do not know how we would \ndo it. How could we commit to do something when we cannot tell you \nexactly how we are going to do it?\n  I am going to talk about how to do it for a moment. But let me submit \nthat is not the way people operate in the real world. In the real \nworld, we commit to do things all the time even though we cannot tell \nyou going in exactly how we are going to get the job done.\n  If, in the real world, you had to be able to say exactly how you were \ngoing to achieve something down to the finest detail, before you \ncommitted to a good and worthy goal, no one would ever commit to one.\n  If you had to know how you were going to pass all those courses when \nyou went off to the university, nobody would ever go off to college. If \nyou had to outline exactly how you were going to make your business \nwork in good times and bad, nobody would ever start a business. If you \nhad to figure out how you were going to make a marriage successful \nbefore you got into it, how you were going to deal with the 1,001 \nproblems that you know are going to come up, nobody would ever get \nmarried.\n  After my wife-to-be turned me down for the second time and I got down \non one knee in San Antonio and said, ``If you will marry me, I will \nspend the rest of my life trying to make you happy,'' my wife did not \nlook down at me and say, ``Well, how are you going to do it?'' She \nlooked at me and tried to gauge how much I was committed to it, and 25 \nyears later I am still working on it. So forgive me if I feel a little \nbit cynical toward my colleagues who say, ``How can we commit to \nbalancing the budget if we cannot sit down and write out in the \ngreatest detail how we are going to do it,'' knowing that if anybody \nwrote out the detail, then they would stand here and say the world is \ncoming to an end if we have to do these things.\n  I hope when people hear this debate, they will always remember these \nnumbers--and nobody disputes these numbers. The White House, the \nCongressional Budget Office, nobody disputes these numbers. What I have \nhere on this chart is a projection of Federal Government spending, \nwhich is the line in red, and then Federal Government revenue, which is \nblue. One thing that is clear, if you look at this chart, is that both \nof them have been growing. Both of them have been growing very rapidly. \nThe problem is that the spending has been growing more rapidly. What \nhas happened is that, since 1969, spending has been growing by an \naverage of 8.7 percent a year. In fact, spending by the Federal \nGovernment has been growing 2\\1/2\\ times as fast as spending by the \nAmerican family has been growing. I think that is a real index of our \nproblem.\n  Revenues have been rising, but they have not been rising as fast as \nspending has been rising. So if you look here, in 1995, where that red \nends and the yellow begins, that is where we are.\n  The Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget \nOffice project that over the next 7 years, the economy is going to \ngrow--not as fast as it is growing now, but at a fairly modest rate \ncompared to the kind of growth we had in the 1950's and 1960's.\n  [[Page S1909]] If we could limit the growth of Government spending to \nno more than 3 percent a year, where we are spending only 3 percent \nmore next year than we spent this year, we would balance the budget by \nthe year 2002, which is what we are calling for in this balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution.\n  Here is my point. I know that there are many people who say we cannot \nbalance the budget, that it means hard choices, and that we have a \nCongress that in 40 years has not said no to any organized group with a \nletterhead. Obviously, it is a self-fulfilling prophecy. But I think if \nyou go to main street America and you say to the people, ``Would you \nwant the Government to balance the budget, to eliminate the kind of \ndebt burden and taxes that we are looking at in the future if we do not \ndo it, if it requires that the total growth of Federal spending be \nlimited to no more than 3 percent a year for 7 years?'' my guess is \nthat 95 percent of the people in this country would say ``yes.'' The \nother 5 percent are the people who understand this well enough to know \nthat they are getting the 7 percent a year spending increase, and that \nthey do not want it balanced; even if it mortgages the future of the \ncountry, it is worth it to them to get this extra spending.\n  I am not saying this is easy. I have worked on the budget as long and \nas hard as any person who has served in the Senate in the period of \ntime I have been here. Limiting the growth of Government spending to 3 \npercent means you have to reform welfare, which we need to do anyway; \nit means you have to reform Medicaid; it means you have to reform \nMedicare.\n  When the average insurance policy in the private sector did not go up \nin price last year, and Medicare went up by 10.5 percent, and the \nGovernment is paying for it and our senior citizens are paying for it, \nwe ought to go back and look at it and we ought to be reforming it. It \nalso means you have to go through discretionary spending, because there \nare some parts of it that are going to grow, and that should grow, and \nyou have to set priorities and cut spending elsewhere.\n  The point is, how many families in Illinois last year, or in \nTennessee, or Texas, had to deal with budgets that were tougher than \nlimiting their growth in spending to 3 percent? On almost every street, \non almost every block in the Nation, there were families that had to \nmake tough decisions last year. They did not like it, but they did it. \nThey had to say ``no,'' not to strangers but to people they love. They \ndid not want to do it, but they did it. How many businesses in America \nhave had to restructure their business in the last 10 or 20 years, \ncompared to which living within a 3 percent growth rate would look like \nchild's play? Literally hundreds of thousands of them. What is the \ndifference? Families and businesses live in the real world, and the \nFederal Government does not. The balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution is an effort to bring it into the real world.\n  I now want to address the Social Security issue. First of all, there \nare profound questions that have to be answered if you are suddenly \ndeciding that you want to not count the second-largest Federal revenue \nflow and the second-largest outlay flow as transactions of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  We heard the distinguished Senator from California talk about \nprotecting Social Security. But the reality is that taking Social \nSecurity out of the budget in no way protects Social Security. In fact, \nwhen we ran into trouble with Social Security in 1982, what did we do? \nWhat we did is we started shifting money from trust funds; we started \nshifting money from among the various trust funds, and we took money \nout of general revenue and we saved Social Security, and we went back--\nfinally, when we were shamed into it, when our parents were about not \nto get a check--on a bipartisan basis and we made the changes we needed \nto make. Had we had this provision in place, we would not have been \nable to do that.\n  But there is a more profound question. If you balance the budget and \nyou did not count Social Security's revenues or the expenditures, you \nwould be, today, running a surplus of about $80 billion. Do we want the \nFederal Government to run a surplus of $80 billion? We have done that, \nby the way. From 1867 to 1879, the Federal Government, as a policy, \ntook in more than it spent. And what happened is, it imposed a \ndeflationary pressure on the economy, prices fell, on average, 1 \npercent a year, and we resumed our gold payment at $20.67 an ounce, \nwhich is what it had been in 1860. That was the objective of the \nGovernment, but it achieved it by pushing prices and wages right \nthrough the floor. Is that a policy we want to undertake? My view is \nthat if we do, it is something we need to make a fundamental decision \nabout. The reality is that we have always lived up to our commitment \nunder Social Security. We have always kept the promise on Social \nSecurity without any constitutional requirement. But we have not \nbalanced the budget in a quarter of a century and with no realistic \nprospect of doing so any time in the next decade, we clearly have an \nurgent need for a constitutional requirement to do so.\n  I also have to admit that I am somewhat amazed at this sudden desire \nof our Democratic colleagues to protect Social Security, because I \nremember that last year when we had the Social Security tax increase go \ninto effect, one of our own colleagues--I believe Senator McCain--\noffered an amendment that said that the Social Security tax increase \nhad to be dedicated to the trust fund,\n and his amendment was defeated on a partisan vote.\n\n  In fact, if you look at your new IRS 1040 income tax form, which \nevery American is about to get in the mail, you are going to find that \non page 7 it has a new section. The new section says ``Social Security \nBenefits.'' And it says, ``If your income, including one-half of your \nSocial Security benefits, is over $34,000 a year,'' and then it goes on \nand says you have to pay taxes on it.\n  This Senate in the last Congress voted to dedicate those taxes not to \nthe Social Security trust fund but to spend on social programs, which \nwas the policy of the Clinton administration. Now we have the same \npeople saying, ``Well, I voted for the balanced budget amendment in the \nlast Congress, but now I do not know that I can vote for it because of \nSocial Security.''\n  My point is this: The way to protect Social Security is to deal with \nthis deficit. If we do not deal with this deficit, if we let it \ncontinue to mount, we are not going to be able to fulfill our promises \nanywhere.\n  If people are for protecting Social Security--which I am absolutely \ndedicated to and I believe that every Member of this Congress \nunderstands that it is a commitment that has been made. The Contract \nWith America makes it clear that Social Security is not going to be \ntampered with as part of the deficit. There is a 60-vote point of order \nin the Senate for doing anything that lowers the solvency of the Social \nSecurity system. So we have a built-in protection.\n  It is clear, when you look at the fact that, if every Democrat who \nvoted for this amendment in the past votes for it again, and based on \nthe election of 11 new Republicans, the balanced budget amendment is \ngoing to pass and subsequently become the law of the land. When we \nstart having people say, ``Well, look, I am for this and I voted for it \nin the past, but before I vote for it again, you have to fix this, you \nhave to fix that,'' it raises the specter that now because we are \nshooting with real bullets, and are actually on the verge of achieving \nsomething, we are starting to see the possibility that this whole thing \ncould come apart. And I hope it does not.\n  I think we have reached the moment of truth. I think we have to \ndecide whether or not we want to force the Government to live on a \nbudget like everybody else.\n  I know that there are some of my colleagues who say, ``Well, what \ncould a President do if you did not fulfill the Constitution?'' Well, I \nhope a President, who had put his hand on the Bible and sworn to \nuphold, protect, and defend the Constitution, would live up to the \ncommitment.\n  But I think we are asking the wrong questions. We are asking the \nwrong questions about what the President will do and what the courts \nwill do. The question we should be asking is: What are we going to do?\n  Everybody understands the current system is broken. Everybody \nunderstands the current system is not working. Everybody understands \nthat if we stay on the road that we are on today, \n[[Page S1910]] in 20 years we are not going to be living in the same \ncountry that we grew up in. We are going to lose the unique opportunity \nthat has been part of America--the opportunity for someone to grow up \nin Tennessee I say to my distinguished colleague in the chair and, from \nvery humble beginnings, have an opportunity to go to college, to go to \nlaw school, to be successful, to become a Senator; the opportunity for \npeople all over the country to do extraordinary things. That is what is \non the line here. That is what this vote is about.\n  A final point--and I have spoken a long time, but I wanted to be sure \nI addressed all these issues. This is not a new amendment that we are \ntalking about. The Senator from Illinois and many people on our side \nand many people on his side have worked on this amendment for many \nyears. I have been working directly or indirectly on this amendment for \n15 or 16 years. I have sat in on numerous meetings with Congressman \nStenholm, who is a Democrat, with Senator Simon, who is a Democrat, and \nwe have worked out an amendment that we can agree on.\n  I would love to have a three-fifths vote requirement to raise taxes. \nI think the country would be better off if we had it. I want to deal \nwith the deficit not by raising taxes but by cutting spending. But I am \nwilling to fight it out. And I can tell you right now, if we impose a \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution and if I am here or if I \nam involved in Government debate, I will not support raising taxes. I \nwant to deal with this problem by controlling spending. I am sure there \nare others who feel differently.\n  But the point is, I cannot get 67 votes for the three-fifths tax \nprotection requirement. There are always things that we could do that \nwould be improvements. But, as Benjamin Franklin said so long ago when \nthe original Constitution was written, you come down to a point where \nyou have to make a decision.\n  If we want to alter American history, this is the amendment to alter \nit with. We have the votes to pass it. The House has already acted. The \nNation is now looking to us to see if we have the will and the courage.\n  And I know you could come up with 1,001 excuses for changing your \nvote. But I believe the American people will understand that this is a \ntest about who is serious about forcing the Federal Government to live \nwithin its means, who is interested in changing politics as usual in \nWashington, DC.\n  I am hopeful, prayerfully hopeful, that those on the other side who \nare now talking about changing their vote at the critical moment when \nwe have the votes to pass the balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution will engage in some prayerful deliberation and realize \nthat, if they do that, we are going to lose a golden opportunity. We \nhave no guarantee that the opportunity is going to come back and \nAmerica's future is going to be permanently altered one way or another \nby what we do here. I hope people will look at this opportunity and not \nsquander it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I rise this afternoon to address the issue of the \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment.\n  Madam President, my intention will be, over the coming days, to \naddress this issue from several different perspectives. I am very much \nopposed to dealing with our serious fiscal problems using this \napproach.\n  It has been pointed out in public survey after public survey that \nthere is deep concern about the fiscal policies of the country and the \ndirection in which we are headed. People are worried about whether or \nnot we are going to be able to reduce significantly the size of the \nnational debt and our deficits. I do not think there is any debate \nabout that at all.\n  Madam President, I arrived here in January of 1981. The deficit in \nthat year was about $35 billion, and the national debt was under $1 \ntrillion. That debt had been accumulated over almost 200 years, through \na Civil War and two World Wars, the Great Depression, and several \nsmaller depressions.\n  I was, I believe, the second Member of my side of the aisle to \nsupport the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit reduction measure at that \ntime. I thought that was an honest and strong effort statutorily to get \nour arms around what was then a very small problem by comparison today. \nRegrettably, that solution did not work, primarily, in my view, because \nan awful lot of exceptions were created to it.\n  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings was to apply to, initially, the entire budget. \nAnd then, because of the way this institution has run for 200 years \nand, I suspect, will for as many more years as we are here we began \ncreating exclusion after exclusion. One constituency group after \nanother with major causes came before us and started to peel away the \neffects of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings so we were incapable of dealing with \nthe budget deficit.\n  I then offered a pay-as-you-go budget--I was in the minority in those \ndays, as I am today. My proposal would have required that every \nincrease in every aspect of the Federal budget had to be paid for it. I \ngot 22 votes for that idea. Had my pay-as-you-go proposal been adopted \nwe could have achieved a balanced budget by 1987. We did not, of \ncourse.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues, if they have some time--and I guess \nthey will in the next couple of weeks as we debate this issue--to read \nDavid Stockman's book where he described the economic policy decisions \nof the early 1980's.\n  I present that, Madam President, as background. I have always \nsupported strong deficit reduction measures, but I believe that a \nbalanced budget amendment will not achieve those goals. Adopting a \nconstitutional amendment is the easy part of this. Clearly the \namendment is popular before you start talking about the cuts it would \nrequire. The amendment would change the organic law of our country to \ndeal with a contemporary fiscal problem. It would incorporate an \neconomic theory as to how we ought to address our current deficit \nproblem.\n  I have deep, deep, reservations about it based, first and foremost, \non my concern that we ought not allow the organic law of the country to \nbecome a place where we deal with contemporary, perplexing problems \nthat we face. I think there is a distinction between the organic law of \na nation and a set of statutes and ordinances that allow us to come to \nterms with those questions.\n  I am also concerned, Madam President, with the view that somehow \nby amending the Constitution of the United States \na bolt of lightning will strike the Congress and we will depart from \nour historic pattern of finding the easy way out of problems.\n  I noticed a moment ago the Senator from Texas was talking about a \nbudget proposal here a year or two ago that included a tax implication \ndealing with Social Security, and Democrats were terrible people over \nhere because we did that. There will be an amendment, I gather, offered \nthat will take Social Security recipients and exclude their benefits \nfrom the constitutional amendment to balance the budget.\n  I suppose it would not do me any good to offer an amendment that to \nexclude 6-year-olds, as well. I could make a pretty good case that \nbeing a child in America today, based on age and circumstances, is very \ndifficult. I am not trying to minimize the problems that all our \nseniors face. I simply cannot imagine anyone wanting to write into the \nConstitution an exclusion for people based on age to avoid the serious \nfiscal problems we face. Yet, that is an example of what some have \nproposed we do to the Constitution.\n  I have strong reservations about the constitutional amendment, and \nother ideas that would preclude us from facing all the difficult \nchoices that we will be forced to confront.\n  Madam President, just briefly this afternoon, I would like to focus \non one particular concern I have about this amendment. It relates to \nthis issue of what I would call the gimmickry associated with the \nconstitutional amendment. My concern, Madam President, is that if we \npass a constitutional amendment, Congress will use every imaginable \ngimmick, sleight of hand, and tool of evasion to get around the \nrequirements of a constitutional amendment to balance the budget.\n   [[Page S1911]] If this happens, in my view, we will first of all \nhave done nothing to get our fiscal house in order. And we will have \ndone a great deal of harm in undermining public faith in the U.S. \nConstitution by increasing the public cynicism that exists about our \nGovernment generally, and more specifically about the institution of \nCongress.\n  My argument, Madam President, is not that Congress is somehow \ninherently dishonest or genetically programmed to cheat, but I do think \nif we showed some political courage and some bold leadership, we could \nhonestly deal with our fiscal problems without resorting to gimmickry. \nIn fact, what we are saying, in many ways, is that by writing a \nbalanced budget requirement into the organic law of the Nation we will \nbe precluded from coming up with other ideas to get around and \ncircumvent our responsibilities. In some ways I wish that were true. \nBut having served here for a few years, I am profoundly convinced that \nit will be untrue.\n  The courage and the leadership, in my view, must come first. We will \nnot create them by changing some words, even in the Constitution. If we \nsimply change the law without mustering the will to do the right thing, \nthen we will come up with ways, in my view, to get around the law.\n  I think all Members know, Madam President, and experience should have \ntaught us, who bears the greatest cost of this gimmickry. That is \nworking Americans. When rosy scenarios lose their luster and the magic \nasterisks lose their magic, and the train wreck inevitably comes \neconomically, it is always working Americans who are left to pick up \nthe pieces and pay the price.\n  Perhaps the boldest budget gimmick of all time was the so-called \nsupply-side economic approach I mentioned earlier. I arrived here in \n1981 in the minority. President Reagan pointed to something called the \nLaffer curve and told all of us we could balance the budget, while at \nthe same time cutting taxes and increasing spending. It was an Alice-\nin-Wonderland view of economics where up was down and down was up, and \ntax cuts always increase revenue. President Reagan's first budget \nsubmission in 1981 projected a balanced budget by 1984 and a $28.2 \nbillion surplus by 1986. The budget confidently stated:\n\n       The new policy of tax rate reduction is expected to expand \n     the economy's productive base, lower unemployment, and reduce \n     budget outlays. As a result, the decline in tax rates is \n     likely to generate both strong economic improvement and \n     impressive gains in receipts, paving the way for a balanced \n     budget.\n\n  That was 1981. Well, that sure sounded very optimistic and nice but \nunfortunately, it does not bear much similarity to what actually \nhappened. Let me tell Members what actually happened. In 1984, the year \nthe supply-siders projected a balanced budget, we had a $185 billion \ndeficit. The deficit went from $35 billion in 1981, to $185 billion by \n1984, 3 years later. By 1986, the year the Laffer curve was supposed to \nproduce a $28 billion surplus, we were $221 billion in the red. That \nwas 5 years after our national deficit was $35 billion. Madam \nPresident, it got worse and worse and worse.\n  During those years, the national debt quadrupled. Today, every \nAmerican--man, woman, and child--owes almost $13,500 on publicly held \ndebt. In inflation-adjusted terms, that is 2.5 times more than what \nthey owed in 1980. That is the legacy.\n  Madam President, I do not fault President Reagan for trying. It was \nan idea. There were many people, Democrats included, who thought it \nwould work. I had my suspicions. I was one of 11 Members here who voted \nagainst it. But the point is here, when it did not work, we could \nchange it. We could change it, and we did. We paid a price. What we \nwere doing is fooling with the appropriations of the country, the Tax \nCode of the country, the statutory law of the country. We made a \nmistake, an awful one, and it has cost us dearly, but it was a \nstatutory mistake. A mistake in appropriations, a mistake in the Tax \nCode, is mistake that could be corrected with much greater ease than if \nthese policies had been written into the Constitution.\n  Imagine, however, in 1981, if we had incorporated in the Constitution \nof the United States an economic approach and then faced what David \nStockman properly has pointed out, by good-intentioned and well-\nintentioned people, similar demands for greater spending. A situation \nwhere the Secretary of Defense said, ``Wait a minute, not me. I \nunderstand you want to cut here, but we have serious problems. We have \na stronger Soviet Union,'' and those here or not here made a strong \ncase and prevailed. And a situation where others came and said, ``Wait \na minute; not Medicare, not Social Security.'' People said, ``Not me.''\n  Does anyone really believe here we will not face similar kinds of \nchallenges? And the difference is that it will not be that easy to \nchange now because it is written into the organic law of the country, \nan economic idea, a theory? Again, I do not fault, necessarily, \nPresident Reagan for having tried an idea. I think we need to do that, \nbut not to write them into the Constitution.\n  In fact, to his credit, to President Reagan's credit, there was a lot \nof pressure on him to push for a constitutional amendment to balance \nthe budget. As most people know, maybe to the disappointment of some, \nit was not really pushed. I suspect, President Reagan had serious \ndoubts and concerns about changing the Constitution of the United \nStates to incorporate economic ideas from people whom he trusted and \nliked and believed in, but had his doubts about whether or not we ought \nto incorporate their ideas into the most fundamental document that \noutlines the principles and the values of our Nation.\n  So, for those reasons, Madam President, I have serious reservations. \nI am willing to try some of the ideas that people have suggested. My \ncolleague from Texas said maybe we just ought to cut across the board 3 \npercent.\n  I have my real suspicions about that approach, but it is an idea. And \nif we have 51 votes here and there is a majority in the House, it might \nbe tried. If it did not work, it could be changed. I hope we will not \nwant to incorporate that idea into the Constitution of the United \nStates. It is economic theory. This is not a science. This is \nspeculation.\n  I am reminded of Harry Truman's wonderful old line that he wished he \ncould find a one-armed economist, someone who talked straight to him, \ninstead of saying, on the one hand, one idea and, on the other, \nsomething else. Economics is full of theories. No one can say with \nabsolute certainty anything. If that was not the case, we would have \nmany more millionaires in the country. Economists talk about the \nprojections of the market and others trust it will work out that way.\n  The point is, working Americans end up paying an awful bill when we \nsubstitute theories, gimmicks and cosmetic changes in law for good old \ncourage and political will. At the end of the day, no matter how many \ntimes you change the Constitution, we are going to have to confront it. \nAmerican workers will have to pay when we dodge and weave to get around \nthe balanced budget amendment.\n  Our Federal budget is a highly complex document, and we necessarily \nrely on projections to forecast spending and taxes. To preserve the \nintegrity of the budget process, I think we should strive to keep \npolitics as much as possible out of those projections and economic \ncalculations.\n  I will point out again that the potential for political abuse is \nhuge, in my view. Last year, Stanley Collender, the director of Federal \nbudget policy for Price Waterhouse, illustrated how effective altering \nsuch projections could be. Collender estimated a 1 percentage point \ndrop in unemployment projections would reduce projected deficits by $37 \nbillion the first year and $57 billion the next. To paraphrase and \nmodify the words of our late colleague, Everett Dirksen, of Illinois, a \npercentage point here and a percentage point there and pretty soon you \nare talking about, of course, real money.\n  There is already some disturbing evidence that the authors of \ngimmickry are abroad, surviving and doing well in the land. The \ndistinguished Speaker of the House of Representatives, and some others, \nhave said they want to change the Consumer Price Index, which measures \ninflation, as a way of trying to cut spending and increase revenues. \nThese advocates of the so-called ``contract'' know that their promises \nsimply do \n[[Page S1912]] not add up. They cannot cut taxes, increase defense \nspending and balance the budget without draconian spending cuts, cuts \nthey so far have been unable to spell out.\n  So we already see people resorting to some of the gimmicks I worry \nabout if this constitutional amendment is adopted to get the job done. \nOne of the first was to try and cook the books with changes in the \ntechnical calculation of the CPI.\n  I think there is a legitimate debate in the country as to whether or \nnot the inflation figure is too high or too low. A lot of very sound \neconomists debate that point. That is a legitimate discussion, and, in \nfact, if it has been too high, it can be brought down, then it seems to \nme we ought to examine that thoroughly and do so. But any changes must \nbe based on sound economic reasons, not political ones.\n  The distinguished Speaker, as my colleagues no doubt have heard, \nthreatened to cut off the funding of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, \nnot exactly what you would call a partisan agency or organization in \ntown, within 30 days if they did not get it right with regard to \ninflation. I admit, there is a legitimate debate about inflation, but I \ndo not think it serves anyone's interest to be threatening the budget \nof an independent agency on whom all of us rely to get some indication \nof what the Consumer Price Index ought to be. That is what I worry \nabout.\n  When people say, ``What do you mean by gimmicks,'' that is what I \nworry about. I worry about people beginning to fool with the numbers to \nmake it all come out right and yet, at the end of the day it is \notherwise and, of course, we are faced with terrible, terrible \nproblems. So I worry about the gimmicks being used.\n  Senator Dorgan, Senator Harkin and I offered a sense-of-the-Senate \namendment in this body that simply stated that the CPI changes ought \nnot to be politicized and economists ought to look at this and give us \ntheir sound judgment. The amendment was rejected, unfortunately. But I \nhope that my colleagues will discourage anyone threatening the budgets \nof agencies because we do not like the numbers we see.\n  Another effort recently to monkey with the books goes by the name of \ndynamic scoring. Dynamic scoring would provide cover for Members of \nCongress whose economic plans for the country simply do not add up. \nThey draw up a budget that balances on paper but bounces in the real \nworld. This dynamic scoring idea is to try and put the most favorable \nlight on tax cuts.\n  I think it is important that we have accurate projections of what \nchanges a tax cut may create. I recall opposing the tax cut on luxury \nautomobiles and boats a few years ago. Those who offered that proposal \nprojected there would be great revenue gains. It turned out quite the \nopposite. In fact, those provisions helped to destroy the boating \nindustry in my part of the country. But they had rosy projections about \nrevenues we were going to gain.\n  Again, I think it is important that as Members of Congress, before we \nvote, we ought to have some idea about what the projections are apt to \nbe in these areas. But do I think we ought to incorporate it as part of \nthe budget process? Should we not, in fact, be more conservative as we \nlook at these matters, hope they turn out better, hope that they will, \nin fact, produce the revenues?\n  I never had anybody come to my office and say, ``You know, Senator, I \nwould like you to support this tax cut and, by the way, let me tell you \nsomething, it is really going to cost the taxpayers some money.''\n  Everyone who ever has come to my office in 14 years here with a tax-\ncut proposal in mind has promised me--promised me--that this was going \nto produce revenues. In some cases they have. In many cases they have. \nBut, not in all.\n  So when we are looking at how to score tax cuts, I would think it is \nin our collective best interests here to look at it with the most \nconservative point of view in mind. If it does a lot better, we are all \nwinners, but if we project it is going to produce some fantastic \nresults and it does not, then you have run right back into the problem \nI am talking about.\n  So, again, I think we have to be very, very careful as we look at \nthese gimmicks. Hence, I come back to the point of why I am concerned \nabout incorporating in the Constitution of the United States \nconclusions, demands that we will then be determined in our own way to \ntry and reach through efforts that will be less than candid or up front \nwith the American people.\n  Going beyond such narrow projections in an attempt to measure the \nimpact of tax changes on the overall economy is very difficult. If we \nare going to get into the game, we can just as easily measure dynamic \neffects in education, I suppose, or job training.\n  I know there are those here who make the case that if we invest in \neducation that we will get returns to the country. In health care, you \ncan make a strong case, I suppose, that if we put all the money needed \nto eradicate some of the major diseases in the country, that would be a \nreal net gainer for us in terms of the budget.\n  I do not know anybody who would want to accept the notion that if we \ninvest x amount of the taxpayers' money to cure a particular disease, \nthat we ought to score that as a great savings to the American public. \nThe same thinking ought to be applied when we talk about tax cuts. As \nmuch as we may hope that they will produce the desired results, if that \nbecomes a part of the budget process, then I think we do ourselves a \ngreat disservice.\n  The argument is often used that balanced budget requirements have \nsuccessfully imposed fiscal discipline on our State governments. But \nthe evidence on this is unclear as well. Gov. Lowell Weicker, a former \nMember of this body, testified in 1992 that Connecticut's $1 billion \ndeficit came to pass in our State despite a balanced budget law that \nhad been on the books for 53 years. The Constitution said balance the \nbudget and yet we had, because of dreadful economic conditions, a $1 \nbillion deficit in our State. All of the language in the Constitution \ndid not change the economic realities.\n  Many States, of course, use creative budgeting now to comply with \ntheir constitutional requirements. Clever tools include: Delaying \npayments to suppliers. That happens all throughout the country.\n  Accelerating tax collections. How many times have we heard that used?\n  Shifting programs off budget. That is a great gimmick we use.\n   Well, we will not count it as part of the budget. That is off \nbudget. Somehow, miraculously, it does not end up in our accounting. \nEven though we are in the red, it has been pushed to a new category so \nit does not fit into the budgetary requirements.\n\n  The gimmick of choice for Governor Whitman of New Jersey has been \ndelaying State contributions to employee pension plans--it is legal and \nit certainly saves money in the short term. But at some point a future \nGovernor, a future legislature is going to have to belly up and pay \nthose costs, and the taxpayers are going to have to pay. So you get a \nrosy picture in the short term but the reality is you are faced with \nthose expenditures down the road.\n  Governor Whitman and others have also taken a lesson from the Federal \nplaybook by shifting costs to more local units of government. In New \nJersey there is going to be a State income tax cut of some $290, close \nto $300. Simultaneously, property taxes are going up in New Jersey \nabout $1,000, a little more than that--roughly $1,000.\n  Now, it is great news that State income taxes are getting reduced, \nbut if, simultaneously, property taxes are going up almost four times \nthat amount, a taxpayer is a net loser. They may see headlines that \nread, ``State income taxes cut.'' You shift the costs to the towns; the \nproperty taxes go up; and you the taxpayers are net losers.\n  I do not think people are fooled by that in this country. Once again, \nwe will have engaged in the kind of gimmickry people so detest and \nmakes them so angry. We will have failed to confront head on the \nproblems of getting our fiscal house in order.\n  So, Madam President, if we pass this constitutional amendment, I fear \nwe are going to borrow some of the clever tactics that have been used \nat the State level. If we mimic their balanced budget requirements, we \nmay also mimic their tricks of getting around them. The balanced budget \namendment is, of course, the grand gimmick that would spawn 100 lesser \nones, I fear.A\n  The amendment itself is a statement that we do not have the will to \nmake the tough choices. If we did, we would not be confronting \nourselves with changing the organic law of the country--if we did face \nup and do it.\n  Let me point out here that for the first time now in almost 4 decades \nwe have had 3 consecutive years of deficit reduction. The last \nPresident to submit a balanced budget was Jimmy Carter, and the last \nCongress and President to achieve a balanced budget was Lyndon Johnson \nin 1969. [[Page S1913]] \n  Now, if we can get back on track and keep reducing our deficits, \ncreate incentives for growth and for people to work, make the kind of \nintelligent investments that reduce long-term costs--then I think we \ncan continue down that path and achieve the desired results.\n  I would suggest to my colleagues and those who are listening that \nmerely writing something into the Constitution, making it sort of a New \nYear's wish list, does not get the job done. Why not add, as I have \nsaid before, the eradication of ignorance, poverty, disease; all of \nthese are desirable goals.\n  If we are going to turn the Constitution into nothing more than a \nwish list, then we devalue the very document that we have relied on for \n200 years. It has only been amended 27 times in 11,000 efforts, by the \nway--11,000 amendments to the Constitution since 1789. We have gone \nthrough a Civil War, a Great Depression, two World Wars. We did not \nfind it necessary when we confronted every contemporary crisis to \nresort to the Constitution as a way of solving the problem. We faced up \nto them and made the tough choices. Our predecessors did the job when \nconfronted with crises that were far more serious than this one, as bad \nas it is.\n  So I would urge my colleagues--and I know there are those who are \nweighing the benefits and the liabilities of approaching our fiscal \nproblems by amending the Constitution of the United States--people do \nwant to see us get our fiscal house in order, but I think they would \nlike us to do it the old-fashioned way. That is, to make the cuts and \nto encourage the kind of growth that can get the job done, not to wait \n7 years and leave it to some future Congresses to grapple with.\n  Madam President, I urge my colleagues to think hard and long before \nthey go this route. My view is the States will very quickly ratify this \nconstitutional amendment, if it is adopted here. It is very appealing. \nThey will assume that someone at a later time will have to deal with \nthe problem.\n  The Constitution requires that we vote on the matter, that we do so \nhere. I do not think it is proper or appropriate for us to just hope \nsomeone else might protect us and protect the document when we have the \nopportunity to do it as Members of the Senate.\n  So I urge rejection of the amendment and hope that we would get about \nthe business of doing the hard work of reducing the cost of Government, \nto shrink the size of Government, to make the proper investments and to \nget people back to work. Those are the kinds of things that I think \nwill get us on a better fiscal path than what we have been on for far \ntoo long.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, we have had an interesting day here \ntoday. We have had a lot of interesting speakers. I particularly want \nto pay tribute to Senator Simon and his very extensive and good remarks \nthat he made this morning. A lot of people feel he is a very unlikely \nperson to be leading the fight on the balanced budget amendment, but I \nfeel he is exactly the type of person who should do it because he \nunderstands the importance of our national spending decisions and he \nunderstands the importance of our taxing decisions and he understands \nthe importance of fairness.\n  There have been a number of other excellent remarks here today. I \nwould like to pay tribute to each and every person who has spoken \ntoday, including persons on the other side. They have raised issues \nthat have been raised before and that we think we have answered before \nand that we intend to answer throughout this debate.\n  On the other hand, this has been an orderly and very sophisticated \ndebate thus far. One thing I really want to make clear. That is, \nregardless of whatever arguments are brought against this amendment, \nthis is the amendment. This is the best we can do. This has been worked \nout among Republicans and Democrats of good faith. It is the only hope \nI see for putting a mechanism into the Constitution or into the daily \nfunctioning of Congress--a mechanism that we cannot avoid--that might \nget us to make priority choices among competing programs. It is the \nonly amendment that the House of Representatives has ever seen fit to \npass by the requisite two-thirds vote, plus 10. It was a big victory \nover there. It was something that never happened before. And it took \nDemocrats and Republicans to do it. Almost every Republican voted for \nit, and we had 72 courageous Democrats who stood up against the \nmajority in their party and voted for it. And only 132 people were \nagainst it.\n  Now, we have an opportunity to do something in the Senate that is \nabsolutely historic. The Senate up to now has been the only body that \nhas passed a balanced budget constitutional amendment by the requisite \ntwo-thirds vote until that House vote.\n  Now, some people have had the temerity to say that the only reason \nthe Senate passed the balanced budget amendment by 69 votes back in \n1982 and the only reason we had 63 votes last year was because some in \nthis body voted for it knowing it would not pass the House.\n  I do not believe that. I believe that people who voted for this voted \nfor it for the right reasons. They voted for it because they knew it \nwas the best we could do. They voted for it because they knew it was a \nbipartisan consensus amendment, and they voted for it because they knew \nit would work and they knew it would force Members of Congress to stand \nup and do what is right for a change.\n  Now we are down to bait-cutting time. It may take us another 2 or 3 \nor 4 weeks. I do not care how long it takes. I want this amendment to \npass, and I am going to do everything within my power, physical and \notherwise, to get this amendment passed. I hope everybody out there in \nthis country will start working with their Senators, help them to \nrealize this is it. This is our best chance to save this country.\n  I hate to put it that dramatically, but that is what it comes down \nto, because if we do not do this, those who are concerned about Social \nSecurity are really going to have a reason to be concerned because we \ncannot continue to be the profligate spenders we are and run the huge \ndeficits we do and have the interest rates go up the way they will and \nlose the jobs we are going to lose and have the interest against the \nnational debt continue to exponentially go higher and higher without \nhurting Social Security, without hurting Medicaid, without hurting \nMedicare, without hurting welfare, without hurting veterans' pensions, \nwithout hurting everybody's pensions, and without reducing the value of \nour dollar to the point where all of us are going to have a rough time.\n  If the United States starts to slide in this way, what about the rest \nof the world? There will be a worldwide recession or depression like \nnever before. That is going to happen unless we bite the bullet and do \nwhat we have to do here.\n  There is good reason why you cannot amend the Constitution easily or \nreadily. There have only been 27 amendments to the Constitution and \nmost, if not all, of them have been hard fought. But never in history \nhas there been a more important amendment than this one at this \nparticular time. This is the chance for us to do something that could \nsave the country. And it will not happen--and I say this to every \ncitizen of this country--it is not going to happen unless you get mad \nand you let the Senators in this body know that you want them to adopt \nthis amendment. They need to vote for this and we need 67 votes to do \nit.\n  The Founding Fathers made it very tough to amend the Constitution. \nThat is as it should be. This amendment has been through 12 years of \nvery tough treatment, very hard fighting, and very serious intellectual \nconsideration. It is the best we can do.\n  Everybody here would like to add something or take something away. \nBut sooner or later we have to come down to the conclusion this is the \nbest \n[[Page S1914]] we can do. We have always looked at anybody's ideas, and \nwe will continue to see if there is some way we could find that will \nhelp to satisfy the distinguished Senator from California, Senator \nFeinstein, and others. But I have to tell my colleagues the more I \nthink about it, the less inclined I am to make a change like that \nbecause of the loophole it would be, and because it will not solve the \nproblem for Social Security anyway. The best thing we can do for Social \nSecurity is pass a balanced budget amendment that will keep our country \nstrong. It will make us live within our means. It will make us treat \nbudgetary matters in a fiscally responsible manner. That is the best \nthing we could do for Social Security, because no matter how much you \npay people, if the money is worthless, it is not going to buy food or \nanything else.\n  There are people today who suffer because of their poor economic \nsituation who rely on Social Security. But they are relatively few, and \nwe have to work on them and try to resolve their problems within our \nbudgetary process. But there are millions who are getting by on Social \nSecurity and consider it their life's blood. They are not going to be \nable to if we do not put this constitutional amendment into the \nConstitution and force the Congress to live within its means.\n  How can anybody doubt that the way we spend, the way we increase \ndeficits, the way our interest against the national debt is \nexponentially rising, that that will affect everybody in this country \nat some time in the future unless we are forced to get serious about \nit?\n  We talk about being serious. We have tried every statutory budget \nmechanism we possibly can and none of them have worked over time. All \nof them have failed. This amendment will force us to succeed. It would \nforce us to get serious. It would force us to do the things that have \nto be done. And that would protect Social Security in the long run.\n  I do not want to just look at things in the short run. I want to look \nat them in the long run, and this amendment will help us in the long \nrun. If we put an amendment in that refers to a statute in the \nConstitution, and try to define in the Constitution what that statute \nmeans, I guarantee it will be a loophole through which you can fit any \nkind of spending program you want. All you have to do is call it \n``Social Security,'' call it ``the trust fund,'' or call it whatever \nfits the language of the statutory reference in the constitutional \namendment and that is it, it is over.\n  I know people are sincere and they are trying to do what is right \nhere. But the place to deal with these issues is in implementing \nlegislation. That is why we have implementing legislation. That is why \nsection 6 says that the Congress has the power to implement this \namendment. Through the implementing legislation we can resolve some of \nthese problems and we can resolve them in a way that still forces us to \nmake priority choices among competing programs, and Social Security \nwill always fare well in competition with other spending programs in \nour budget. I do not think anybody doubts that.\n  So let us not get into an issue that really is a phony issue. Let us \nkeep constitutional amendments the way they should be. Everybody knows \nthe game here. Everybody knows this amendment is written in a \nconstitutional form. Everybody knows what it is intended to do.\n  There will always be those who try to play games to get around a \nconstitutional provision they dislike, but if we stand strong and we \nvote for this and we get it through, I guarantee it will work and it \nwill go a long way toward resolving the problems of this country--which \nare not being resolved at the current time.\n  I know the distinguished Senator from Nevada wants to speak, so I \nyield the floor at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, probably the most famous bank robber of \nall time was a man by the name of Willie Sutton. After Willie Sutton \ngot out of prison, after having spent many, many years there, he was \nasked why he robbed banks.\n  He said, ``Because that's where the money is.''\n  Madam President, Social Security is where the money is and that is \nwhy we must protect Social Security recipients, whether they be my \ngranddaughters or whether they be me or the millions of people around \nthis country who today depend on Social Security.\n  The reason we must exempt Social Security from the balanced budget \namendment is that is where the money is. This year the surplus in the \nSocial Security fund will be some $70 billion. Shortly after the turn \nof the century the surplus in the Social Security fund will be $800 \nbillion. I say ``will be.'' It will be if we protect those moneys. If \nwe do not, if we do not set aside those moneys from the balanced budget \namendment, when people go to draw their Social Security, when my \ngranddaughters go to draw their Social Security, or my children, there \nwill be no money left. Because that is where the money is and that is \nhow the budget will be balanced.\n  There is no place else to get the money in those large sums. I \noffered a year ago on this floor an amendment to the balanced budget \namendment that was then on the floor. In that amendment I included \ncapital budgeting; I included as part of the amendment that, if in fact \nwe were in a recession for a period of 3 years, we could waive the \nbalanced budget amendment. Madam President, I have thought about this \nfor the past year and I have come to the conclusion that what I need to \ndo is focus on Social Security. Capital budgeting is important; 3 years \nof recession are important; but those are to one side. I now am \nfocusing only on Social Security.\n  As my friend, the senior Senator from Utah, knows, I am going to \noffer this same amendment again. I am going to offer this amendment \nwith the support of Senators Conrad, Dorgan, Feinstein, Ford, Heflin, \nHarkin, Graham of Florida, Baucus, and Boxer, and I am sure there will \nbe others. I am doing this because there has been a lot of talk during \nthese past few months about a Contract With America.\n  I think some of the things that have been focused during these past \nfew months in the Contract With America are important. I have supported \nthe two issues that have come through this body already. But I want to \ntalk today for a few minutes, in preparation for the debate that will \ntake place probably next week when we offer the balanced budget \namendment, about the first contract, the real contract of this century \nwith the American people.\n  That contract was initiated in 1935 during the throes of the Great \nDepression when Members of this body and Members of the other body \ntogether with President Roosevelt got together and said we think we \nneed to make a Social Security contract with the people of America, and \nthey did.\n  What was that contract all about? It said if you, the employee, pay \ninto a fund along with your employers, during your golden years you can \ndraw retirement, not welfare. You can draw retirement that you have \nearned, you have paid into this fund. That in fact is what the contract \nis all about.\n  Madam President, what we have done is we have taken these moneys that \nare collected from the employees of America and the employers of \nAmerica and put them into a trust fund. That word of art ``trust fund'' \nmeans something. It means that you have a very important fiduciary \nrelationship. We, the people, who control this trust fund, have a \nfiduciary relationship with the people who will draw money from that \ntrust fund, a relationship that we must do what we can to protect the \nintegrity of that trust fund.\n  I practiced law before coming to the Congress. I had a trust fund set \nup for my clients, a client trust fund. That money that I collected on \nbehalf of my clients I could not make my car payments with, I could not \nbuy myself a suit, I could not pay the law firm rent or the rent at \nhome with any moneys out of that trust fund. If I in fact did that, I \nwould be subject to disciplinary action by the State bar association \nand possibly by the criminal prosecutors in the State of Nevada. I \ncould go to jail for violating the trust that I had in protecting my \nclients' money.\n  The term ``trust fund'' that I used as a practicing attorney is not \nthe same connotation as trust fund for Social Security. It is \nidentical. We have an obligation to protect that trust fund.\n  [[Page S1915]] My friend from Utah, the senior Senator, is someone \nthat I have great respect for. But on his statements regarding Social \nSecurity, he and I disagree. I recognize, as I think we all should and \ncertainly the people within the sound of my voice should appreciate the \nfact, that Social Security does not contribute one penny to the Federal \ndeficit. Social Security, as I have already explained briefly here, is \nrunning in excess, a surplus. It does not contribute to the deficit. In \nfact, it has been used to erase the deficit in years past. We worked \nvery hard to have the Social Security trust funds not be part of the \ngeneral revenues of this country. We set up a separate fund for Social \nSecurity. We set up a separate agency. Social Security does not \ncontribute to the deficit.\n  We have heard statements, rightfully so, that the American public \nsupports the balanced budget amendment. They do. Eighty percent of the \npeople in Texas, Utah--I see my friend from Ohio coming onto the \nfloor--and Nevada. It is about the same all over. About 80 percent of \nthe people support the balanced budget amendment. But when those same \npeople are asked, ``Do you want to balance the budget by taking Social \nSecurity surplus?'' the answer is 70 percent ``no.'' Only 10 percent of \nthe original people who say they want a balanced budget amendment \nsupported it if you say you are going to use Social Security. That is \nthe original Contract With America of the century. That is the program \nthat people want protected. They know Social Security is not welfare. \nThis part of the Social Security fund that we are conducting deals with \nold age benefits. It does not deal with Medicare. It deals with the old \nage portion of that fund.\n  There have been statements made on this floor that the amendment \ncreates a large loophole. I respectfully submit that if we could argue \nthis case to a jury of our peers, we would win because it does not \ncreate a loophole. Anything that changes the long-term actuarial plan \nof Social Security is subject to a 60-vote point of order before this \nbody. If someone wanted to place education or aid to families with \ndependent children into Social Security, it would not work. You would \nhave to get 60 votes. If you use that reasoning, Madam President, you \ncan look at the amendment as it is written. The amendment as it is \nwritten--the one that is before this body now--has exceptions. Congress \nmay waive the provisions of this article, says section 5, for a number \nof reasons. One reason is it can be waived is if there is a military \nconflict in which an imminent and serious military threat to national \nsecurity is declared. Does that mean that, if this were in effect, \ntaking the troops into Haiti would mean that we could waive the \nbalanced budget amendment? It does not say to what extent it can be \nwaived. It does not say it can be waived for the actual cost of the \nimminent danger or whether it could be waived to the tune of billions \nof dollars more.\n  So let us stick with the facts. I do not think that this body would \ndo that. I do not think that we would say that the event taking place \nin Haiti, or Rwanda, would be such that we could waive the balanced \nbudget amendment that was in effect to the tune of billions of dollars. \nHaving Social Security exempted from the balanced budget amendment does \nnot--I repeat, does not--create a loophole. This is one of those \nfigleafs that is being waived around this body so often on this \namendment.\n  A point of order, of course, means that the truth would be brought to \nbear on any form of legislative shenanigans. That is why the 60-vote \npoint of order is in effect. My amendment is intended to safeguard an \neasily identifiable and narrowly defined program.\n  There have been those in this body who have said, ``We will take care \nof this in implementing legislation.'' Let me explain to my colleagues \nand to the American public what this means. This means that there are \npeople who recognize the danger of going where Willie Sutton said you \nneed to go if you need money; that is, where it is. And that is why he \nwent to the bank. The only place we can go is Social Security. But \nthere are those who tell me that we are going to take care of this with \nimplementing legislation. How? ``Well, we are going to pass a law when \nthe balanced budget amendment passes that says we cannot touch Social \nSecurity.'' Boy, we should not fall for that one. I know that the \nsenior groups in this country will not fall for that. The AARP and \nothers are not going to fall for that because they know that a law \nwhich we could pass this morning--it is now 5 o'clock approximately in \nWashington, DC--this morning in Washington, DC, we could pass a law, \nand we could pass another law to take the place of that one at 5 \no'clock this afternoon. We could pass a law and pass another one to \ntake the place of it that same day. Implementing legislation will not \nprotect Social Security. We could pass implementing legislation this \nyear and repeal it next year. It simply is no way to protect Social \nSecurity.\n  Implementing legislation is another one of the figleafs that is so \ntransparent that you should not wear it because it will not work. If \nyou oppose raising the Social Security trust fund, you should support \nthe simple amendment that I am going to offer with my colleagues which \nexpressly prevents any looting of the Social Security trust fund.\n  I was on this floor a year or so ago with Senator Moynihan, the \nsenior Senator from New York. We were talking about the unfairness of \ncollecting Social Security taxes, withholding taxes, when the moneys \nwere not going to Social Security; they were going to help relieve the \ndeficit.\n  During the colloquy between the Senator from New York and the Senator \nfrom Nevada, we talked about the Social Security trust fund, and we \ntalked about maybe it really was not a trust fund; maybe it had become \na slush fund.\n Well, it has not become a slush fund yet. But if we allow the balanced \nbudget amendment to pass and do not protect Social Security, it will no \nlonger be a trust fund, it will be a slush fund.\n\n  Again, I remind everyone here that people who are trying to balance \nthe budget will go to where the money is; that is, Social Security. \nRemember, we are not talking about surpluses of a few thousand a year, \na few million a year, a few billion a year; we are talking about \nsurpluses that, after the turn of the century, will be in the trillions \nof dollars. Why do we need that much money in the trust fund? Because \nthere is going to come a period of time when the outflow from the trust \nfund will be far in excess of what is coming into it. We need those \nsurpluses.\n  We have been told that placing a statute in the Constitution is \nunprecedented. Well, Madam President, it is unprecedented. My friend, \nthe senior Senator from Connecticut, said it the way it is. We have had \n11,000 attempts to amend the Constitution of the United States. We have \nsucceeded less than 30 times. This is the first time that we have tried \nto do an amendment to the Constitution fixing fiscal policy. So if we \nare talking about fiscal policy, should we not be concerned about one \nof the largest fiscal elements of our society, namely Social Security? \nOf course, the answer is yes. And we need to place it not in a statute; \nit would be part of the constitutional amendment. It would lose its \nstatutory life and become part of the Constitution of the United \nStates.\n  We also certainly should not allow talk about future generations \nbeing protected if we lump Social Security into the balanced budget \namendment--that is, that Social Security will be easy picking, prime \npickings to balance the budget. That will not protect future \ngenerations. Quite the contrary.\n  This debate is not about senior citizens versus children; this debate \nis about children who will become senior citizens and need their Social \nSecurity benefits. This is not an amendment that protects old people in \nAmerica today. This is an amendment that protects all people in America \ntoday, because Social Security benefits are for the young and for the \nold because, if we are lucky, we all get old.\n  In effect, safeguarding Social Security in this trust fund means that \nGovernment will not be able to continue to borrow from this trust fund. \nEnding this robbing Peter-to-pay-Paul practice will allow us to \nmaintain the trust fund for future generations of Americans.\n  Madam President, we have also heard last week on this floor that the \nSeniors \n[[Page S1916]] Coalition supports passing the balanced budget amendment \nand does not support my amendment. When I first heard of this \norganization, I was running for office. I was very concerned that a \nsenior organization, after my work on the Aging Committee and doing a \nlot of things over the years for senior citizens, would not be helping \nme. Why would they oppose me? Well, what I have come to realize, Madam \nPresident, is that the Seniors Coalition has a history of employing \nexaggerations and falsehoods--which is a nice word for lies--because \nthey want to make money from senior citizens by scaring them.\n  According to a 1993 article in the National Journal--the founders of \nthis particular group have sent letters out against most Democratic \ncandidates running for public office on the Federal level. The National \nJournal said that the founders of this particular group have been under \ninvestigation for fraud by the FBI, two U.S. attorneys, New York \nState's attorney general, and the Postal Inspector. In 1980, Richard \nViguerie, father of the direct mailing system for the Republican Party, \nor certainly one of the founding fathers of that organization, and a \nman by the name of Dan Alexander, started the taxpayers education lobby \nto raise money through appeals of school prayer and other conservative \npolicies. In 1986, Dan Alexander was indicted for extorting kickbacks \nfrom school construction projects and he served 4 years in prison for \ndoing this.\n  In 1989, the Seniors Coalition was formed by his wife, a woman by the \nname of Fay Alexander, with help from Mr. Viguerie. In 1992, the \ncoalition claimed to become independent of the taxpayers education \nlobby, though there remained a contract that paid Mrs. Alexander \n$20,000 a month, money seniors sent this organization, and paid her \nhusband about $3,000 a month for consulting fees. Remember, this is the \nman that is in jail. In 1992, the board consisted of Fay Alexander and \na business associate. For its first 3 years in operation, the \ncoalition's president was Susan Alexander, the couple's teenage \ndaughter. Mr. Alexander told the New York Times--and I am sure this is \nan understatement--that he hired his daughter because it was hard to \nfind outsiders of any stature to serve on the board in view of his \nrecord. The coalition now has outside directors.\n  I will not go into a lot more detail. But I do not think it would be \na good idea to cite the Seniors Coalition, and we should not base any \nvote in this body on what they do or do not do. I may talk a lot more \nabout them later if we hear a lot more about the Seniors Coalition, \nbecause I have a lot more to say in that regard.\n  Let me say, Madam President, that the balanced budget amendment is \nsomething that should pass--if Social Security is protected. If Social \nSecurity is not protected, everyone should be very, very cautious and \nafraid in this body. But the fear generated from here should be for the \npeople in America, those 70 percent of Americans who say you should not \nbalance the budget on the backs of Social Security recipients, because \nif we do not exempt Social Security, as Willie Sutton has said, ``We \nwill go where the money is,'' and we will balance the budget, which \nwill be fairly easy to do if you use Social Security. That is what will \nhappen, and that is too bad.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio [Mr. DeWine] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I rise today as a person who has spent \nthe better part of the last 4 years traveling my great State and \nlistening to the concerns of the people of Ohio. One thing I have found \nis that people are more skeptical than they have ever been before. I \nhave really heard it everywhere I went. Today, people measure \npoliticians not by the promises that they have made, but rather by the \npromises that they have kept. Empty promises simply no longer work. The \npeople of this country want concrete action, not just promises.\n  Madam President, in 1992, people voted for change. But then there was \nnot enough change, and so people did not see the concrete results. And \nthen in 1994, they voted for change again. I ran in 1992. I ran in \n1994, and I can tell you that people are fed up with promises. They \nwant change and they want action. For the American people, nothing \nsymbolizes Congress' inability to change, to back up words with action, \nmore than Congress' unwillingness to balance the Federal budget.\n  Despite all the talk, year after year, Congress continues to run \ndeficit after deficit. And if it is true that nothing symbolizes \npeople's perception of Congress' inability to change more than our \nfailure to balance the budget, I think it is also true that nothing \nwill do more to restore people's faith in Congress, in the Government, \nin the country, than by passing a constitutional amendment that will \nmandate and compel a balanced budget.\n  The balanced budget amendment to the Constitution does represent \nfundamental change. This, Madam President, is the change the American \npeople demanded, demanded in 1992 and again in 1994.\n  Over the last couple of days, we have had a somewhat academic debate \nabout the balanced budget amendment. And I expect this debate will go \non for a few more days, a few more weeks. The opponents of the balanced \nbudget amendment tell us that we do not really need a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget. They say all we really need is the \npolitical will.\n  Well, Madam President, I suppose that is right. I suppose that is \ntechnically true. But is there really anyone in this Chamber, is there \nreally any Americans who believe that Congress, without a balanced \nbudget amendment, will balance the budget? Nobody I talk to believes \nthat.\n  Let us do a reality check. Let us look at the past.\n  Madam President, we have not had a balanced budget since 1969--1969, \nthe year I graduated from high school. We have had a deficit in 5 of \nthe last 63 years. When we had a Republican President, we had a \ndeficit. When we had a Democrat President, we had a deficit. When we \nhad a Democrat Senate, we had a deficit. When we had a Republican \nSenate, we also had a deficit.\n  The reason the American people, 80 percent of them in a recent poll, \nsupport the balanced budget amendment is that they simply do not \nbelieve Congress will ever balance the budget any other way. And I must \nsay, Madam President, the past would indicate the American people are \nabsolutely correct. For 25 straight years we have not balanced the \nbudget; 25 budgets in a row.\n  Madam President, what are the chances, without a balanced budget \namendment, without the discipline that this will impose on this body, \non the House, on the Congress, on the Government, what are the chances \nin the 26th year or 27th year or 28th year, 30th year, 35th year, we \nwill not continue to do what Congress has done for the last quarter of \na century and that is not balance the budget?\n  Madam President, a lot of people say that Americans are cynical \ntoday. I am not sure that is really true. But Americans have watched \nCongress try to balance the budget in each of the last 25 years and \nCongress has failed every time.\n  What the American people are saying is pretty simple. ``Let's try \nsomething else. Let's try something else and see if that works.''\n  Madam President, I do not call that cynicism. I call it realism.\n  You know, I do not think any of us who support the balanced budget \namendment are really happy that we have to do this. It is a last \nresort. But really it is our only realistic hope. And I believe that we \nhave to do it.\n  (Mr. THOMAS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, the opponents like to talk about how the \nbalanced budget amendment is a threat to our children; that it would \ndevastate the investments we need to make in our children's future. Let \nus look at this and let us look at this argument because it is a very \nserious argument.\n  Mr. President, the word ``cynical'' might be the most appropriate way \nto characterize that particular argument. To run up a colossal mountain \nof debt, $4 trillion and rising, a debt that threatens to leave our \nchildren's generation bankrupt is bad enough. But to use these very \nsame children as an excuse for not biting the bullet on the budget \ndeficit is just plain wrong.\n  Again, Mr. President, let us face the facts. If we do not pass the \nbalanced \n[[Page S1917]] budget amendment, we simply will not have the money for \ninvestment in our children.\n  We are already paying over $235 billion a year in interest on the \ndebt. As my colleague, the Senator from Illinois, pointed out earlier \ntoday, that is eight times what we today invest in education. It is 50 \ntimes what we invest in job training. It is 145 times what we pay for \nearly childhood immunizations.\n  Every year we add to this mountain of debt and every year we are \ncommitting more of tomorrow's resource to pay for Congress' failures of \ntoday.\n  What does the future look like for children if we do not balance the \nbudget? Well, let me tell you. This, Mr. President, is what it would \nmean to continue with business as usual.\n  If we continue with business as usual, next year the Federal budget \ndeficit is set to start growing again. By the year 2003, just 8 years \nfrom now, spending on entitlements and interest alone, entitlements and \ninterest alone, will exceed 70 percent of the whole Federal budget. If \nyou take out defense, it leaves you just 15 percent of the budget for \nall the discretionary spending and domestic needs--15 percent out of \nentire budget.\n  That means less than 15 percent for education--and these are \ncumulative for everything--less than 15 percent for education, for job \ntraining, for the Women, Infants, and Children Program, the WIC \nProgram, for Head Start, for drug treatment, for employment training, \nfor the environment, for housing, for all the other programs that help \nthe American people here at home--just 15 percent of the budget for all \nthese programs, all these programs, Mr. President, combined.\n  And by the year 2012, just 9 years later, we will be looking back on \nthat 15 percent as the absolute golden age of investment in our \ndomestic needs because by that time, by the year 2012, just 17 years \nfrom today, there will be nothing left in the budget for these social \nneeds--zero; no money for children--unless we change the direction we \nare going in. Every last red cent in the Federal budget will go to \nentitlements and interest payments. And 2012 is a year that has \nsignificance for my wife and I and for many other people, I am sure, \nbecause just a year before that, our grandson Albert, we hope, will \ngraduate from high school; our daughter Anna will be in her first year \nof college--2012.\n  This is the human cost of Albert and Anna, all our children and our \ngrandchildren, will have to pay because of Congress' unwillingness to \nchange.\n  Mr. President, to hide these facts and then to hide behind these very \nchildren who will be hurt the most if we do not act is worse than \nabsurd. I find it unconscionable.\n  The American people no longer, Mr. President, care what we say. They \nare tired of excuses, evasions, rhetoric. They do not care if some of \nus say we can balance the budget. What they care about is what we do. \nThey are not listening to what we say. They are watching what we are \nabout to do.\n  To say, Mr. President, that they are not happy with what Congress has \ndone in recent years would certainly be a severe understatement. In the \nname of our future, in the name of our children, they are demanding \nchange.\n  Mr. President, I will vote to create the change. I will vote in favor \nof the balanced budget amendment. It is a vote for less government, \ninstead of more government. It is a vote for responsible government, \ninstead of a runaway spending machine.\n  It is, Mr. President, the last hope of the American people for fiscal \nsanity and long-term solvency. This is the greatest gift we as Members \nof Congress can give to the next generation of Americans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have been interested and I want to \npersonally thank the distinguished Senator from Ohio for the excellent \nremarks he has made today. He has brought this whole matter into focus \nwhen he talks about the effects on his children and his grandchildren. \nI feel exactly the same. Elaine and I have 6 children, and our 15th \ngrandchild is on the way. We have 14 now, but the 15th will be here in \na couple of months, and who knows when there might be some others. We \nare not sure.\n  The fact of the matter is we are very concerned about them. I am \nconcerned about all the children, and grandchildren. The Senator from \nOhio makes a good point. There will not be child care moneys if we do \nnot get things under control. There will not be job training moneys. \nForget about Job Corps. What about welfare? What money we have will not \nbe worth anything. What about Social Security, if money becomes \ndevalued through inflation and, therefore, worthless? How are people \ngoing to live? How are people going to live? There are people today in \nthis affluent society who barely get by. Can you imagine what it will \nbe like for the unlucky ones of the future? Such things should not \nhappen. We ought to do something about it. But I will say, it will be \neverybody who will have trouble getting by if we keep going the way we \nare going.\n  I am not just using scare tactics. It is true. Everybody knows it. \nPeople feel it. This is the first time in the history of this country \nwhere parents are fearful that their children will not have lives as \ngood as they did, will not have opportunities as good as they have. The \nfirst time in history where parents feel that their children will not \nhave the great opportunities for growth and advancement that they had. \nThe reason that is so is because Congress does not have the fiscal \nmechanism in place to force Congress to do what is right.\n  I want to thank the distinguished Senator from Ohio for his excellent \nremarks, and the other Senators today, especially our Senators who are \nhere for the first time. They are here because of this issue, in part. \nPeople out there know this country is in trouble. They are here because \npeople wanted them to vote for the balanced budget amendment. They are \nhere because they make the difference.\n  Each Senator here makes a difference, including those who voted for \nthe balanced budget amendment before. But these new Senators make up \nthe difference from last year. We lost by four votes last time. Four \nvotes. We had seven people who were here who voted with us last time \nwho are now no longer here. That is 11 votes. We have picked up 11 new \nSenators, all of whom are on the Republican side and are going to vote \nfor this balanced budget amendment. All of them were elected on the \nbasis that they would vote for this balanced budget amendment. All of \nthem are part of this revolution in our society, not a Republican \nrevolution, but a revolution of people who are sick and tired of the \nway things are, of the status quo, who want a balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment, for the express purpose of saving this \ncountry. Well, we have such an amendment here. It is not perfect. But \nnothing around here ever is. It is as perfect as it can be, as \ndeveloped by both parties.\n  Now, let me just say a few words in response to the comments of my \ncolleague from Nevada. And I do respect Senator Reid from Nevada. He is \na very dear friend and colleague. I have a great deal of feeling and \naffection for him. He said the Social Security trust fund will be \nraided if the balanced budget amendment is passed. That could not be \nmore wrong. It just could not be more wrong. It will be raided if we \ndevalue the dollar and make the dollars that are paid out in Social \nSecurity benefits worthless. And that is where we are headed if we do \nnot have a balanced budget amendment.\n  The Social Security trust fund is not where the money is. This so-\ncalled surplus the distinguished Senator from California was showing us \nearlier with that big loop in the chart that she had, that money is not \nin a trust fund. Why this year's $70 billion surplus will be used to \nbuy Treasury bonds. There is no stash of cash waiting to be raided. It \nis already going to be taken out of that trust fund. And there is going \nto be a nice little Treasury bond piece of paper saying ``guaranteed by \nthe Government of the United States of America.'' And we will take that \n$70 billion trust fund surplus and we are going to spend it on general \nbudget items and spending programs.\n  That money is gone. There is no question about it. There is no trust \nfund full of money. There is a trust fund of paper promises that will \nbe valuable only if we pass the balanced budget amendment and get this \ncountry's spending profligacy under control. But that big pile of paper \nwill be valueless if we do not.\n   [[Page S1918]] The only way we will get spending under control is to \npass this balanced budget amendment. There are some who think even if \nwe do this we might not get there. I was looking at James Q. Wilson's \narticle yesterday in the Wall Street Journal. He is one of America's \nleading political scientists. He is one who was never for the balanced \nbudget amendment, but boy he is now. He said, in essence, ``I do not \nlike it, but it is the only hope we have.'' I commend his reasons for \nnow supporting the balanced budget amendment to my colleagues, and ask \nthat the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 30, 1995]\n\n                     A Bad Idea Whose Time Has Come\n\n                          (By James Q. Wilson)\n\n       For yours I have been skeptical of a balanced budget \n     amendment to the Constitution for all of the reasons that \n     most of my colleagues in political science and many member of \n     Congress so clearly express. Now I am a reluctant convert, \n     not because I think the arguments against it wrong but \n     because I think them beside the point.\n       There is no economic case for always having a budget that \n     is balanced or in surplus. One doesn't have to be a Keynesian \n     to know the occasional desirability of stimulating the \n     economy by spending more than one takes in or the necessity \n     of going into debt to make capital improvements. There are \n     even a few economists who claim that, if we do our accounts \n     properly, the budget is already balanced.\n       The problem with the economic objections to balancing the \n     budget is that they fail to take into account the changed \n     character of the American people and their representatives. \n     From the time of George Washington to the time of Dwight \n     Eisenhower, budgets were almost never in deficit except in \n     wartime. But in those days the public expected rather little \n     from Washington. They did not expect a federal solution to \n     every problem--drugs, crime, education, medical care, and the \n     environment. Their representatives generally believed that \n     deficit spending was wrong, not simply imprudent, and to vote \n     for it was to risk not only electoral retaliation but public \n     censure.\n       It is astonishing that this culture--one of limited federal \n     responsibilities and stringent fiscal prudence--should have \n     survived for so long. Politics offers citizens this deal: \n     Vote yourself big benefits now and let your grandchildren (or \n     better yet, somebody else's grandchildren) pay for them. If \n     you let the government borrow the money, you can get \n     something for nothing. Yet for more than a century and a \n     half, we turned down that deal. As a result, the annual \n     deficit amounted, as late as 1955, to only 6% of federal \n     outlays. Thirty-five years later, it was 18%.\n       James Buchanan, the Nobel laureate in economics, concluded \n     from his study of our fiscal history that something akin to a \n     Victorian ethos had restrained our spending. Now that ethos \n     is gone, and with looming deficits in Social Security and \n     Medicare, matters can only get worse.\n       There are serious political objections to the amendment as \n     well. Won't Congress somehow cook the books so as to comply \n     with the letter of the amendment but not with its purpose?\n      Or if it doesn't cook the books, what is to prevent Congress \n     from simply appropriating in excess of revenues, no matter \n     what it had earlier resolved to do? For years Congress \n     found ways to circumvent or ignore the Gramm-Rudman \n     balanced-budget resolution.\n       And if Congress evades the amendment in any of these ways, \n     how will it be enforced? Will a taxpayer sue the secretary of \n     the Treasury for writing checks based on deficit \n     appropriations? It is not obvious he or she would have \n     standing in the courts. And even if a court heard the case, \n     what would it do? Send U.S. marshals to arrest the Budget \n     Committees? Issue an injunction to shut down government?\n       Many members of Congress have made these points publicly \n     and many more make them privately. But notice what they are \n     saying: You cannot trust us to do what you, the public, \n     wants. Your amendment will not give us any backbone. We will \n     evade and cheat. Therefore, do not enact such an amendment so \n     that we can ignore your will with complete impunity.\n       And even those members of Congress who say they will comply \n     with it are unwilling to divulge what cuts they would make or \n     what taxes they would raise in order to comply. Critics love \n     to play the Social Security trump card: ``You won't discuss \n     Social Security or other entitlements, and yet you say you \n     favor a balanced budget. Shame!''\n       Now we are at the heard of the matter, face to face with \n     the reason why the balanced budget amendment is a bad idea \n     whose time has come. Congressmen are elected by voters who \n     want lower taxes, no deficit, and continued (or even more) \n     spending. Almost every poll since the 1960s shows the same \n     pattern.\n       The public has inconsistent preferences; the public wants \n     something for nothing. Of course members of Congress will \n     conceal their preferences, pretend that the public need make \n     no hard choices, and take Social Security and Medicare off \n     the table. To do otherwise is to court electoral disaster. \n     Some leaders will try to finesse the issue by saying to the \n     public that it can have lower taxes, no deficit, and more \n     spending if only Washington would eliminate ``waste, fraud, \n     and abuse.'' It was never true, and I doubt many people still \n     believe it.\n       Voters are the problem. The balanced budget amendment is \n     aimed at them, not at politicians. When it is in place, the \n     electoral logic changes. Now challengers can run against \n     incumbents by saying, not simply that they didn't cut \n     spending or didn't fund a popular program, but that they \n     violated the Constitution. The enforcement of this amendment \n     will be political, not legal. It will be an imperfect \n     enforcement, but it will probably make a difference.\n       For one thing, it will put Social Security (and Medicare \n     and everything else) back on the table. Congressmen will have \n     to go to the public and say something like this: ``What do \n     you want, I cannot deliver. I wish I could. But you have to \n     make some choices so that I can make some. What do you want \n     most--lower taxes, more spending, or no deficit? I can't kid \n     you anymore because the Constitution--and my opponent--won't \n     let me.''\n       I am not sure what the public will say. But whatever it is, \n     it will be an improvement over its current free-lunch \n     mentality.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the Social Security trust fund will \ncontinue to invest any surplus in Treasury bills from here on in. We \nwill have that mound of paper that will be worth something only if \nAmerica is viable, but it will be worth nothing if we keep going the \nway we are going. And we will have sold Social Security recipients down \nthe river. We can avert such problems only if we adopt and comply with \nthe balanced budget amendment.\n  I cannot, for the life of me, understand why people are so upset on \nthe other side of this floor about the consensus balanced budget \namendment. They know that if we do not do something to put a fiscal \nmechanism in place which will cause us to make priority choices among \ncompeting programs and get spending under control, that those trust \nfund Treasury bonds are not going to be worth the paper they are \nwritten on.\n  In the year 2015 the trust fund will start to draw down this so-\ncalled surplus by redeeming those Treasury bills. The only way to \nprotect those funds is through a balanced budget amendment. If we did \nnot pass this amendment we will not balance the budget. If we did not \nbalance the budget, the Federal Government will have a tough, if not \ntotally impossible job redeeming those bonds.\n  In fact, if we do not pass this amendment and balance the budget, it \nis highly likely that the Federal debt will be monetized. Now, this \nwill only reduce the value of the Treasury bonds held by the trust \nfund, but by monetizing the debt it means that we print more money, \ninflate the economy, reduce the value of our money, which might go down \nto zero, and we pay off the debt with worthless money, lose our credit \nstanding in the world community in the process, and trigger a worldwide \ndepression.\n  Now, that is where we are headed. Make no bones about it. The only \nway to protect the Social Security trust fund and the Treasury bonds it \nbuys, is to pass this amendment and balance the budget.\n  Now, Senator Reid says we must exempt Social Security because what is \nwhere the money is. That just is not true. That is where the Treasury \nbonds are. There is no money there. There are only IOU's which will be \nvalueless if we do not get spending under control.\n  How do we protect Social Security? We who support this amendment know \nhow, through good economics, and through a balanced budget amendment. \nIt is the best protection we could give them. The Social Security trust \nfund is not where the money is. There is no money there. There are only \nIOU's there.\n  We have already used the money to pay for other bills of the Federal \nGovernment and other spending items. The reason why we need a balanced \nbudget amendment and why it should apply to Social Security is to \nensure that the money is there to pay the IOU's to our seniors when \nthose IOU's come due, and that those dollars they receive, when they \nget them, are worth something. Without a balanced budget amendment, \nthere is some question whether we could repay our debt to our seniors, \nor whether the dollars will be worth anything at all. And Mr. \nPresident, the trust fund itself will run a \n[[Page S1919]] deficit in the future. And if it is allowed to run a \ndeficit through an exemption in the balanced budget amendment there \nwill be no incentive to balance the trust fund. But if the balanced \nbudget amendment applies to Social Security, the Constitution will \nrequire Congress to have the money to pay our retirees. Real money. Not \nIOU's.\n  Not paper promises. Not a mountain of mere good intentions.\n  Well, I think it is very important that we understand these issues. \nIf in the zeal to protect Social Security, such a proposed exemption \ndefeats the balanced budget amendment, these folks in their zeal have \nwill have actually killed Social Security, sooner or later.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Nevada and I disagree on the merits \nof this issue, on the best way to protect Social Security, seniors, and \nour country's future. Let me reiterate that I believe the only way to \nassure that our Government is able to meet its obligation to future \nretirees is through the balanced budget amendment. It will help us \nensure that we will have dollars that have worth, and that we have a \nnation and economy and a government that is worth passing on to our \nfuture generations.\n  That is what we are fighting for here. That is why I am spending this \ntime and have for the last 18 years--now on the 19th year--spending my \ntime trying to see if we can bring both sides together in a way that \nbenefits this country, if not save the country.\n  This amendment is the best we can do, and it is as perfect as we can \nmake it. It has bipartisan support. I really applaud those Democrats \nwho are willing to stand up for it. There are not very many of them, \nbut we hope that there are enough to pass this balanced budget \namendment. We only need 15 to 17 of them out of the 47 that are here. I \ndo not think that is too much to ask. And, frankly, there are \ncourageous Democrats who are standing with us on the floor each day, \nlike Senator Simon, Senator Heflin, and others who are willing to pay \nthe price to get this job done.\n  I just want to personally pay tribute to them and tell them how much \nI personally appreciate it. I really appreciate those 72 Democrats over \nin the House who had the guts to stand up against the majority in their \nparty, had the guts to stand up and do what is right for this country.\n  Mr. President, I just want to make it very clear to everyone \nlistening that if the American people do not get involved in this, if \nthey do not realize that this is really bait-cutting time, if you folks \nout there do not start calling your Senators and letting them know how \nbadly you feel about this and they had better support the balanced \nbudget amendment, we may very well--we may very well--not get this job \ndone.\n  Right now I believe that we have the votes to get it done. I believe \nthat Senators, when they are really faced with the realities of what is \nreally happening, and what will happen if we do not adopt this \namendment at this time--this one rare time in history--after the House \nfor the first time passed the balanced budget amendment, if we do not \nget it done, it is going to be a disaster for this country. I think \nthey will vote for this amendment. We are all counting on it. But they \nwill not do it if the American people do not let them know they want \nthis done.\n  This is the time. We can no longer afford to spend beyond our means. \nWe can no longer afford to not face the music. We can no longer afford \nnot to enact implementing legislation pursuant to a balanced budget \namendment that gets us on a glidepath to a balanced budget in the year \n2002, and we can no longer afford the phony arguments against this.\n  For those who say, ``Well, you ought to outline every cut you are \ngoing to make,'' that is the most phony argument of all. It is \nridiculous. It was said earlier that it is like trying to tell the \nweather each year 7 years from now.\n  The fact of the matter is, during all the years of Democratic control \nof both bodies, they have never been able to come up in these last 26 \nyears with a balanced budget. Not once. And they know and we know that \nit is going to take all 535 Members of Congress working together on \nimplementing the balanced budget amendment, over a period of a year or \nmore, to come up with a glidepath that will get us to the result of a \nbalanced budget in the year 2002.\n  They also know that we will never get there if we do not pass the \namendment which will force us to work together to get there.\n  That is in spite of the sincerity of many people in both bodies who \nwant to get there and are always talking about getting there and saying \nwe ought to do it. But many of those who say that are the biggest \nspenders in Congress. We all say it, but many of those who are saying \nit and saying we do not need a balanced budget amendment--saying that \nwe ought to just have the guts to do it--are those who are some of the \nbiggest spenders in Congress, who never want a balanced budget \namendment because they do not want their spending habits curtailed, \nbecause that is what they believe has reelected them time after time.\n  Unfortunately, in some ways, that is true. But now that time is gone. \nWe have to do what is right for America and get spending under control.\n  Mr. President, we have had a good debate today, and I believe that we \nwill keep plodding ahead until we get to the point where we all have to \nvote and we all have to show where we are going to be on this matter. I \ncan live with whatever the outcome is. I have been through this so long \nthat I can live with whatever it is. But it will be a tragic thing if \nwe do not pass a balanced budget amendment. I believe we will if the \nAmerican people will get involved.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/01/senate-section/article/S1880-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1919-S1920]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NATIONAL WOMEN AND GIRLS IN SPORTS DAY\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

A bill to increase access to, control the costs associated \nwith, and improve the quality of health care in States through health \ninsurance reform, State innovation, public health, medical research, \nand reduction of fraud and abuse, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                       the health partnership act\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, many people count the death of health care \nreform as being in 1994, when the Congress failed to adopt the \nproposals that had been adopted as submitted by the \n[[Page S1921]] President, by various factions within the Congress \nitself, by some groups that were external to the Congress. I personally \nthink that is the wrong date for the death of health care reform in \nAmerica. I believe the appropriate date for health care reform's demise \noccurred 20 years earlier, in 1974.\n  Prior to 1974 we in fact had a very vibrant, innovative, creative set \nof health care reform initiatives. They all had one principal \ncharacteristic, they were emerging from the States. We had a \ndecentralized federalized system of health care innovation.\n  The State of the Presiding Officer was one of those States involved \nin those early efforts of health care reform, as was my State and the \nState of Oregon, the State of our colleague, Senator Hatfield. Maybe \nthe best known example of those innovations that occurred prior to 1974 \nwas the State of Hawaii.\n  The State of Hawaii set some objectives in terms of increasing the \npercentage of its population covered, to reduce the cost of health \ncare, and to focus attention on the prevention of illness rather than \ncrisis intervention. Hawaii, as an example, has achieved almost all the \nobjectives that were established two decades ago.\n  But in 1974 the Congress began to restrict the capacity of States to \nserve as the laboratories for health care innovation through \nrestrictions on the ability of States to secure waivers from Federal \nlaws such as Medicaid, the health care program for indigent Americans, \nand the restrictions on the States' ability to innovate as it related \nto persons who secured their insurance through a place of employment, \nthe so-called ERISA restraints. States, for 20 years, have largely been \nrestricted from their role of serving as centers of innovation, of \nfield-based experience on what would actually work in terms of \nimproving the health of Americans.\n  The legislation we are going to introduce today seeks to reverse that \n20-year period of sterility. As Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis \nonce said,\n\n       It is one of the happy incidents of the Federal system that \n     a single, courageous State may, if its citizens choose, serve \n     as a laboratory and try novel social and economic experiments \n     without risk to the rest of the country.\n\n  We propose to restore that opportunity of States to serve as that \nnovel laboratory to try things to see if they work; if they do, to \nenlarge them; if they do not, to discard them--but not put the entire \nNation at risk as we experiment with new approaches to achieve the \nobjective of better health for all Americans.\n  There are some principles behind the bill that Senator Hatfield and I \nwill introduce, and those principles include the concept of \nincrementalism. Incrementalism is not just a synonym for drift and \nindecision that you move willy-nilly from one step to the other. \nIncrementalism infers that you have a clear set of goals, destinations, \nand then you understand the steps that are required to get from where \nyou are to that destination.\n  While these goals can be defined with greater specificity--and they \nshall be--the basic goals that we seek\n to attain with this legislation are:\n\n  First, to increase the access of Americans to health care services;\n  Second, to contain the level of increase of the cost of health care \nservices;\n  Three, to reduce the incidence of illness and disease by a greater \ninvestment in those things that we know will tend to maintain a state \nof good health.\n  A second principle of our proposal is decentralization. One of the \ncommon elements of all of the health care legislation considered in \n1994, no matter how much they differed in specifics, is that they all \nshared one thing in common; that is, they assume that the solution to \nhealth care was a centralized solution. There was an assumption that \nhealth care can be dealt with by one-suit-fits-all approach.\n  Senator Hatfield and I believe that is fundamentally flawed--that in \na Nation that is as large and diverse as the United States of America \nthe attempt to have a central health care system for all of our almost \n260 million citizens is an inherent prescription for failure. The \ndifferences just between let us say a State such as Wyoming, which has \nlarge land area and relatively few people who have a principal problem, \nis how to provide not the financing but just the actual access to \nhealth care professionals in such a diffused population compared for \ninstance to a highly urbanized State such as New Jersey where the \nissues are fundamentally different. To attempt to have such a health \ncare approach to such extreme circumstances is in our opinion not a \nlogical beginning point for health care reform.\n  Finally, we believe in the concept of partnership, that States and \nlocal communities and individual citizens will bring a great deal to \nthe table. They are the ones who are most directly affected by gaps in \nour current health care system. They are the ones who are most likely \nto have precise reality-based prescriptions to fill those gaps and \ncurrent concerns with our system.\n  We believe that the sense of arrogance that has sometimes pervaded \nFederal-State relations--in which we assumed that we knew what the \nsolution was and it was only for others to accept our infinite wisdom--\nthose days are over, and we need to have a respectful relationship.\n  Let me, Mr. President, just briefly review the principal titles of \nour legislation. I will submit the legislation for introduction as well \nas a section-by-section analysis of the proposal. But the bill contains \na title which relates to insurance reform.\n  In this area, we are building on a very successful recent experience \nwhich related to problems including out outright fraud that existed in \nthe sale of so-called Medigap insurance policies. These are the \npolicies that extend the normal reach of Medicare. The way in which the \nCongress chose to go about dealing with the problem of Medigap \ninsurance was to ask the State insurance commission to work together to \ndevelop a standard set of principles to govern those types of insurance \npolicies. Each State must then be required to adopt the basic \nprinciples that have been developed by these State officials. Each \nState deserves the right to go beyond what the standard set of \nprinciples were.\n  We are proposing a similar policy as it relates to health insurance. \nWe are going to call on the 50 insurance commissioners of America to \ndevelop the programs on portability, on preexisting conditions, on the \nother gaps in health insurance coverage that have caused such anxiety \nand loss of insurance coverage to American families.\n  The second title is State innovation. It has two basic approaches. \nOne, we are going to seek relief for States from some of the shackles \nthat have been imposed upon them for 20 years so that they will have \nthe ability to innovate. We want to make it easier for States for \ninstance to get waivers from a risk, easier for States to get waivers \nfrom Medicaid, easier for States to shape their own approach to what \nthey believe will best meet the needs of their people. We are going to \ngo beyond this in that we are going to provide grants, grants over the \nnext 5 years totaling $50 billion to States which apply and which can \ndemonstrate that they have a plan that will move\n toward the three objectives of increased coverage, cost control, and \nprovision. We believe this will give a positive encouragement to the \nStates to accelerate a process of innovation that has been asleep for \n20 years.\n\n  Third, in the area of public health we are proposing for a \nsignificant increase in the Federal role in public health. The Federal \nGovernment used to be the primary level of government in public health. \nIt is a partnership with the States. Our partnership has been \nfaltering. States have been taking up a larger and larger share. With \nthe States' financial constraints, one of the problems is we are going \nto see frays in our public health system. Tuberculosis, for instance, \nwhich is a disease that we thought had been eradicated, has made a \nresurgence and a significant part of the reason for that resurgence is \nlaid to the fact that we have gaps in our public health service that \nhave allowed that to occur.\n  We also are proposing, in the next title, increases in assistance to \nmedical research. Again the States will have a major role since many of \nthe most significant health care training and research institutions are \nhospitals and medical centers which are associated with State \ngovernment. We also are proposing increased funding for the National \nInstitutes of Health. We believe \n[[Page S1922]] that Americans want to have investments that will \nincrease our knowledge, and therefore ability to arrest adverse health \ncare conditions.\n  Finally, we come to what may be the bitter pill of that; that is, how \nwe pay for it. We are proposing a $1 per unit increase in the tax on \ntobacco products as a means of financing these initiatives in State \ninnovation, public health, in medical and health research. We believe \nthis is appropriate in terms of the contribution that reduction in the \nuse of these products will have on the health of America. It also will \nraise approximately $68 billion over the next 5 years which will be \nnecessary in order to finance the various initiatives that we have \noutlined.\n  Finally, we have a provision that relates to fraud and abuse. I want \nto particularly commend Senator Cohen of Maine whose ideas are heavily \ninvolved in this particular title. He has done outstanding work in the \narea of Medicare fraud and abuse, and has helped to bring to the \nNation's attention the shocking level of abuse in terms of \ninappropriate services, services not rendered, overbilled services \nwhich are estimated to be costing us $1 out of every $10 in our \nMedicare expenditures. But fraud and abuse is not limited to Medicare. \nIt also occurs in other governmental programs such as CHAMPUS, which is \nthe program for the Department of Defense. It occurs in Medicaid with \nthe State-Federal partnership program, and it occurs in many private \ninsurance programs. We believe that the frontal assault on fraud and \nabuse is an important element of this health care reform effort.\n  I close, Mr. President, by quoting a fellow Floridian, columnist and \neditorial writer of the St. Petersburg Times, Martin Dyckman, who \nstated that this approach that we are suggesting to health care reform \nis.\n\n       * * * of course, is how most of this country's important \n     social reform including public schools, child labor laws, \n     anti-sweatshop legislation, wage-hour laws and workers' \n     compensation, came into flower. They originated not in \n     Congress but with the States. It is the genius of federalism.\n\n  We seek to unleash that genius to the benefit of all of the American \npeople. As we will learn more about what policies actually contribute \nto increased coverage, containment of cost and the prevention of \nillness, we will improve the lives of individual citizens within their \nStates. And with that experience, we will have the opportunity to make \nbetter policies across America that will improve the lives of all of \nour citizens.\n  Mr. President, during the long, arduous and extended debate over \nhealth care last session of Congress, Senator Hatfield and I were \nconcerned that Congress had become fixed on thinking about health care \nreform from a single, centralized, one-size-fits-all, national model. \nIn the bipartisan rush to attempt to solve the Nation's problems and \nfederalize health care, Congress overlooked what may be the best \nopportunity we have--State-led reform.\n  In fact, that has been the case for over two decades. In the early \n1970's, many States were working on initiatives to develop health care \ninfrastructure or were, as in the cases of Hawaii, Maine, and \nCalifornia, undertaking progressive reform proposals to expand \ncoverage. Hawaii passed its Prepaid Health Care Act in 1974 and has \nbeen the only State to receive necessary implementation waivers from \nCongress. As a result, Hawaii has managed to cover 96 percent of its \ncitizens and has costs below the national average.\n  Unfortunately, most other State reform initiatives have been stalled \nby the overriding national health reform efforts of President Nixon and \nCongress in 1974, the growing federalization of Medicaid policy \nthroughout the period and the passage of the Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act or ERISA in 1974.\n  These three efforts to nationalize health care have worked together \nto stall or limit State health reform efforts over the past two \ndecades. In fact, ironically, due to the very fact that very little \nexperimentation or innovation occurred in the States over the last two \ndecades, virtually all of the national health reform proposals--whether \nit was managed competition, single payer, employer or individual \nmandates, pay or play, vouchers, the expansion of Medicare or market \nreform--had as their centerpiece a variety of untested reform theories \nin American society. In short, past efforts to limit state flexibility \nparadoxically helped thwart Congress' reform efforts last year.\n  As a result, on September 22, 1994, Senator Hatfield and I introduced \nlegislation that would attempt to attain the goals of health reform--\nexpanded coverage and access, cost containment and improved quality--\nwith State innovation as an underlying theme. After working to improve \nthe legislation over the recess, we are reintroducing the Health \nPartnership Act today. We introduce this legislation as a working \ndocument and encourage any and all comments to help further refine the \nproposal.\n  First, the legislation recognizes that, in a nation as diverse as \nours, one solution or means cannot be formulated for the wide range of \nhealth programs and needs in our country. For example, Florida, \nPennsylvania, Iowa, Rhode Island, and West Virginia have 50 percent \nmore elderly per capita than do Alaska, Utah, Colorado, and Georgia. \nAddressing the long term care needs and specific health care problems \nassociated with aging would clearly be a greater point of emphasis in \nthe former States than in the latter.\n  As former Governors and as Senators from States that have enacted \nsubstantial health reform plans, Senator Hatfield and I believe the \nStates have demonstrated some tremendous creativity and ability to \nimplement innovative health care initiatives often in the face of stiff \nresistance from the Federal Government.\n  As Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandies said in 1932,\n\n       It is one of the happy incidents of the Federal system that \n     a single courageous State may, if its citizens choose, serve \n     as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic \n     experiments without risk to the rest of the country.\n\n  To summarize the Health Partnership Act, the bill establishes \nincreased coverage, cost containment, improved quality and \ndecentralization as its overriding goals. Our proposal would achieve \nthis through Federal-State partnerships in five areas: insurance \nreform, state innovation, public health, medical and health research, \nand fraud and abuse.\n\n\n                            Insurance reform\n\n  The first title deals with insurance reform. Through recommendations \nfrom our Nation's State insurance commissioners, our bill would address \nthe longstanding problems of portability, preexisting conditions, \nsolvency standards, community rating, and other needed insurance market \nreforms.\n  The State insurance commissioners would establish a set of national \nminimum insurance standards that would be approved by the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services. This is modeled after the Baucus amendment \nto the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 that related to the \ndevelopment of the largely successful Medicare supplemental insurance \nstandards or Medigap. In our bill, States that wish to do beyond the \nminimum standards established by NAIC could proceed with more \nprogressive reforms.\n\n\n                            State Innovation\n\n  Title II is concerned State and local innovation. Both States and \nlocalities would be allowed to submit health reform projects that--if \nthey meet the health reform goals of expanding coverage, cost \ncontainment and improving quality--would enable them to receive broad \nflexibility in the Medicaid Program, Public Health Service programs, \nthe maternal child health block grant and the social services block \ngrant.\n  To further improve the Federal-State partnership, our legislation \nwould grant these waivers and greatly expanded flexibility through the \nvast reduction of process requirements and regulation. Instead, the \nFederal Government and States would jointly develop performance and \naccountability measures that specifically relate to the State's \nproject. For example, if a State were to submit a children's health \ninitiative as a health reform project, performance measures might \ninclude infant mortality, immunization rates or unnecessary pediatric \nhospitalization rates.\n  Eligible States would also have available $50 billion in grants to \nenact their reforms over a 5-year period.\n  The bill also gives states greater flexibility by clarifying the \nimpact of \n[[Page S1923]] the ERISA preemption. While ERISA was intended to \nrecognize the desire by multi-State corporations to have uniformity in \ntheir employee benefit programs, it has gone beyond what is required \nfor that purpose. The result has been the preemption of an increasing \nnumber of State laws.\n  For example, it does not make sense to preclude States from having \naccess to data, from establishing quality standards for HMO's and from \nraising revenue through providers to fund uncompensated care pools. In \neffect, States are prevented by ERISA from enacting some reforms that \nwould reduce the numbers of uninsured, contain costs and ensuring, or \nenhancing quality. Our intention in the bill is to find a balance \nbetween the legitimate and proper interests on business and labor in \nERISA and that of States.\n  Consequently, the bill provides for the establishment of an ERISA \nReview Commission to study the issues affected by ERISA and to make \nrecommendations on points of compromise between States, business, and \nlabor.\n\n\n                             public health\n\n  Title III promotes prevention, public health, cost effective \ntreatment, and improved overall health through four distinct \napproaches: First, strengthening the partnership with and capacity of \nlocal and state public health departments to carry out core public \nhealth functions; second, expanding access to preventive and primary \ncare services for vulnerable and medically underserved communities; \nthird, supporting applied research on prevention and effective public \nhealth interventions, and fourth, addressing public health work force \nneeds and access problems.\n  At a time when tuberculosis, AIDS and other public health problems \nsuch as E. coli increasingly threaten the public's health, as \ninvestment in our Nation's public health infrastructure as necessary \nand overdue.\n  Dr. C. Everett Koop and other members of the Health Project \nConsortium published an article in the New England Journal of Medicine \nin 1983 noting that 70 percent of all illness is preventable and that \nthere are about 1 million deaths annually that are preventable. That \namounts to in excess of $600 billion annually in costs. However, our \nNation now invests less than 1 percent of our total health care costs \non health care. The waste of both lives and money must be addressed.\n  As a result, our legislation would increase the investment in public \nhealth by $9 billion over 5 years.\n\n\n                      medical and health research\n\n  Title IV emphasizes medical and health research. Our initiative \nrecognizes the importance of medical and health research and would \nprovide $6 billion over a 5-year period in increased funding for that \nfunction. This builds on the excellent track record of medical research \nin our Nation's State-supported research and medical centers. In \naddition, if finding the cure for diseases such as AIDS, Alzheimer's, \nand cancer is to be achieved, such an investment is critical.\n\n\n                            fraud and abuse\n\n  Title V is a section tackles the issue of fraud and abuse. Senator \nBill Cohen, who has studied this issue at length and contributed to \nthis section, recently said,\n\n       As much as $100 billion is lost each year to fraud and \n     abuse, driving up the cost of health care in America for \n     million of patients and families--as well as for the American \n     taxpayer. Losses over the last 5 years are almost four times \n     the total costs to date of the entire savings and loan \n     crisis.\n\n  One of the provisions establishes closer coordination of fraud \ninvestigation among the Federal, State, and private sector. This would \npositively impact State and local governments as providers, payers, and \nemployers.\n\n\n                                  cost\n\n  The bill's costs over a 5-year period would be $65 billion which \nSenator Hatfield and I propose to be financed with a $1 tax on tobacco \nproducts. This funding source, while providing funds for our proposal, \nwould also discourage smoking and improve the overall health of \nAmericans.\n\n\n                         why state-led reform?\n\n  Why federalism or state-led reform? First and most obvious, the \nFederal Government failed and will continue to fail to truly address \nthe agreed upon goals of this nation in health care.\n  Second, the combination of Federal failure, hinderance of State \nflexibility through Medicaid regulations and ERISA, and anticipate \nbudget cuts to Medicare and Medicaid this year would\n result in what I would call triple-negative health reform. We should \nbreak that downward spiral at the second point and grant State and \nlocal governments increased flexibility to improve our Nation's health \ncare. The contrast would be further Federal inaction and abritrary \nbudget cuts, neither prescriptions for improved health.\n\n  Third, the diversity in our Nation dictates federalism. As St. \nPetersburg columnist Martin Dyckman said in a column endorsing our \napproach,\n\n       This, of course, is now most of this country's important \n     social reform including public schools, child labor laws, \n     anti-sweatshop legislation, wage-hour laws and workers' \n     compensation, came into flower. They originated not in \n     Congress but with the States. It is the genius of federalism.\n\n  Fourth, States have historically led in reform--Hawaii, Minnesota, \nFlorida, New York, Maryland, Oregon, and Washington and others come to \nmind. States have led in reform because they can respond quicker to the \nrapid changing dynamics of health care. They are also more efficient. \nOne look at the Medicare fraud problem in south Florida would shy \nanybody away from having Washington, DC, too involved in reform.\n  Fifth, doing nothing is unacceptable. State and local governments \ncontinue to bear the brunt and serve as much of our Nation's safety \nnet. As last year's Advisory Committee on Intergovernmental Relations \nreport entitled ``Local Government Responsibilities in Health care'' \nnoted, ``Local governments spend an estimated $85 billion per year on \nhealth care services--about one of every eight dollars spent by local \ngovernments.''\n  Failing to recognize this important contribution and failure to \naddress it will only increase this heavy burden. Uninsured rates will \nonly continue to increase, costs will continue to explode while \nproblems such as infant mortality, where the United States ranks 21st \nin the world, are not going away.\n  Finally, waiting for uniformity is a pipedream. As many of you know \nonly too well. Medicaid regulation and ERISA have effectively preempted \nthe ability of State and local government from enacting anything other \nthan incremental reform for 20 years due to what everyone thought was \nimpending national health care reform. Since that time, States have \nlargely been held back from enacting reforms while Presidents Nixon, \nFord, Carter, Reagan, Bush, and Clinton have all failed to enact \ncomprehensive national health reform.\n  Therefore, the purpose of our bill is to free the States to be \ninnovative to addressing their specific health care needs and problem \nwhile providing States the resources to encourage and accelerate the \nprocess. Mr. President, I believe the time for State-led reform is now.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nadditional material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 308\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Establishment of Health Care Reform Trust Fund.\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Americans support universal coverage. The people of \n     this country agree that all Americans should be guaranteed \n     access to affordable, high-quality health care.\n       (2) Although there is common agreement on the goal of \n     universal coverage, there are many different ways to achieve \n     this goal. The States can play an important role in achieving \n     universal coverage for our population, demonstrating \n     additional health reforms that may be needed on a national \n     level to enhance access to affordable, high-quality health \n     care. A number of States have already initiated health care \n     reform that takes into account their special economic, \n     demographic, and financial conditions. These State models \n     combine unique reform innovations with the various strengths \n     of their existing State health care systems, including market \n     competition, employer pools and association plans, technology \n     review and public health outreach projects. The States can \n     also serve as testing grounds to identify effective \n     alternatives for making the transition to universal coverage, \n     while maintaining the strengths of the current health care \n     system.\n       (3) Maintaining the high quality of health care Americans \n     expect and controlling costs are also important goals of \n     health care reform. As payers of health care, the States have \n     a strong incentive to ensure that such States purchase high-\n     quality, cost-effective services for the residents of such \n     States. The States can develop and test alternative payment \n     and delivery systems to ensure that these goals are achieved.\n       (4) In light of the success of various State-initiated \n     reforms and in the absence of comprehensive Federal health \n     reform, there are many health-related issues that should be \n     addressed at the State level. As with social security and \n     child labor protections, States can lead the way in testing \n     ideas for national application or application in other \n     States.\n       (5) The States should have the flexibility to test \n     alternative health reforms with the objectives of increasing \n     access to care, controlling health care costs, and \n     maintaining or improving the quality of health care.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       Unless specifically provided otherwise, as used in this \n     Act:\n       (1) Naic.--The term ``NAIC'' means the National Association \n     of Insurance Commissioners.\n       (2) Performance measures.--The term ``performance \n     measures'' means measurable indicators that are used to \n     assess progress towards achieving the broad goals of \n     increasing access to care, controlling health care costs, and \n     maintaining or improving the quality of health care.\n       (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Health and Human Services.\n       (4) State.--The term ``State'' means each of the several \n     States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin \n     Islands, the Northern Marina Islands, and America Samoa.\n                    TITLE I--HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM\n\n     SEC. 1001. ESTABLISHMENT OF STANDARDS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary shall request that the NAIC \n     develop, not later than 6 months after the date of enactment \n     of this Act, standards for health insurance plans with \n     respect to--\n       (1) the renewability of coverage under such plans;\n       (2) the portability of coverage under such plans, \n     including--\n       (A) limitations on the use of pre-existing conditions;\n       (B) the concept of an ``amnesty period'' during which \n     limitations on pre-existing conditions would be suspended; \n     and\n       (C) the advisability of open enrollment periods;\n       (3) guaranteed issue with respect to all health insurance \n     coverage products;\n       (4) the establishment of an adjusted community rating \n     system with adjustment factors limited to age (with no more \n     than a 2:1 variation in premiums based on age) and geography;\n       (5) solvency standards for health insurance plans \n     regulations under Federal and State law, including the \n     development of risk-based capital standards for health plans, \n     solvency standards for health plans, self-funded employer-\n     sponsored health plans, and multi-employer welfare \n     arrangements and association plans;\n       (6) stop-loss standards for self-funded health insurance \n     plans and multi-employer welfare arrangements and association \n     plans;\n       (7) the identification of minimum employer size for self-\n     funding and the interrelationship between self-funding and \n     the community-rated pool of enrollees; and\n       (8) any other areas determined appropriate by the \n     Secretary, including enforcement of standards under this \n     section.\n       (b) Review.--Not later than 60 days after receipt of the \n     standards developed by the NAIC under subsection (a), the \n     Secretary shall complete a review of such standards. If the \n     Secretary, based on such review, approves such standards, \n     such standards shall apply with respect to all health \n     insurance plans offered or operating in a State on and after \n     the date specified in subsection (d) herein.\n       (c) Failure To Develop Standards or Failure to Approve.--If \n     the NAIC fails to develop standards within the 6-month period \n     referred to in subsection (a), or the Secretary fails to \n     approve any standards developed under such subsection, the \n     Secretary shall develop, not later than 15 months after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, standards applicable to health \n     insurance plans, including standards related to the matter \n     described in paragraphs (1) through (8) of subsection (a) \n     (``Federal standards'') and such standards shall apply with \n     respect to all health insurance plans offered or operating in \n     a State on and after the date specified in subsection (d) \n     herein.\n       (d) Effective Date.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), the \n     effective date specified in this subsection for a State is \n     the date the State adopts the standards developed under this \n     section or 1 year after the date the NAIC or the Secretary \n     first adopts such standards, whichever is earlier.\n       (2) Exception.--In the case of a State which the Secretary, \n     in consultation with the NAIC, identifies as--\n       (A) requiring State legislation (other than legislation \n     appropriating funds) in order for health insurance policies \n     to meet the standards developed under this section, but\n       (B) having a legislature which is not scheduled to meet in \n     1996 in a legislative session in which such legislation may \n     be considered,\n\n     the date specified in this subsection is the first day of the \n     first calendar quarter beginning after the close of the first \n     legislative session of the State legislature that begins on \n     or after January 1, 1996. For purposes of the previous \n     sentence, in the case of a State that has a 2-year \n     legislative session, each year of such session shall be \n     deemed to be a separate regular session of the State \n     legislature.\n       (e) Working Group.--In promulgating standards under this \n     section, the NAIC or Secretary shall consult with a working \n     group composed or representatives of issuers of health \n     insurance policies, consumer groups, health insurance \n     beneficiaries, and other qualified individuals.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Nearly 4 of 5 peer reviewed research projects deemed \n     worthy of funding by the National Institutes of Health are \n     not funded.\n       (2) Less than 2 percent of the nearly one trillion dollars \n     our Nation spends on health care is devoted to health \n     research, while the defense industry spends 15 percent of its \n     budget on research.\n       (3) Public opinion surveys have shown that Americans want \n     more Federal resources put into health research and support \n     by having a portion of their health insurance premiums set \n     aside for this purpose.\n       (4) Ample evidence exists to demonstrate that health \n     research has improved the quality of health care in the \n     United States. Advances such as the development of vaccines, \n     the cure of many childhood cancers, drugs that effectively \n     treat a host of diseases and disorders, a process to protect \n     our Nation's blood supply from the HIV virus, progress \n     against cardiovasculor disease including heart attack and \n     stroke, and new strategies for the early detection and \n     treatment of diseases such as colon, breast, and prostate \n     cancer clearly demonstrates the benefits of health research.\n       (5) Among the most effective methods to control health care \n     costs are prevention and cure of disease and disability, \n     thus, health research which holds the promise of cure and \n     prevention of disease and disability is a critical component \n     of any comprehensive health care reform plan.\n       (6) The state of our Nation's research facilities at the \n     National Institutes of Health and at universities is \n     deteriorating significantly. Renovation and repair of these \n     facilities are badly needed to maintain and improve the \n     quality of research.\n       (7) Because the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 \n     freezes discretionary spending for the next 5 years, the \n     Nation's investment in health research through the National \n     Institutes of Health is likely to decline in real terms \n     unless corrective legislative action is taken.\n       (8) A health research fund is needed to maintain our \n     Nation's commitment to health research and to increase the \n     percentage of approved projects which receive funding at the \n     National Institutes of Health to at least 33 percent.\n\n     SEC. 4003.

In light of the inability of \n     Congress to enact comprehensive reform, this bill would \n     provide the states with the flexibility to continue their \n     reform efforts. It would also provide limited federal funding \n     to assist states in this effort.\n       The bill includes the following provisions:\n\n\n                    title i--health insurance reform\n\n       Establishment of National Minimum Standards.--Congress \n     would direct the National Association of Insurance \n     Commissioners (NAIC) to develop national minimum standards \n     with respect to renewability, portability, guaranteed issue, \n     community rating, solvency and stop-loss. The Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services (HHS) would review the standards \n     developed by NAIC. Upon approval, these national minimum \n     standards would be established for the states, but they would \n     be given authority to enact and implement more progressive \n     reforms than those specified. This is modeled after the \n     Baucus Amendment to OBRA-90 relating to the development of \n     Medicare Supplemental Insurance Standards or Medigap.\n       Medicare Select.--The 1990 Medigap legislation created 10 \n     standard Medicare supplemental benefit packages that could be \n     offered nationwide. Managed care networks could offer these \n     benefits to Medicare beneficiaries in 15 states. This \n     program, Medicare Select, provides supplemental coverage to \n     hundreds of thousands of Medicare beneficiaries, but the \n     program will expire on June 30, 1995. This provision would \n     reauthorize the program and extend it to all 50 states.\n                       Title II--State Innovation\n\n       State Innovative Health Reform Projects.--States interested \n     in enacting health reform proposals that achieve the goals of \n     increased health coverage and access, control costs and \n     maintain or improve the quality of health care could submit \n     their projects to the Secretary for Medicaid, Maternal Child \n     Health Block Grant, Social Services Block Grant and Public \n     Health Service Act waivers and approval. An approved state \n     innovative project that can demonstrate the ability to meet \n     the goals of health reform would receive grant monies from \n     the federal government to encourage and help states funds the \n     projects. $50 billion will be made available to states over a \n     five-year period.\n       Limited State Health Care Waivers.--States would also be \n     allowed to pursue more limited state health care waivers that \n     are likely to increase administrative efficiencies or provide \n     guidance for the development of improved health delivery \n     systems. The waiver application for both the comprehensive \n     and limited waiver projects would be placed on an expedited \n     approval process.\n       Evaluation, Monitoring and Compliance.--The Secretary and \n     an established State Health Reform Advisory Board would be \n     responsible for monitoring the waiver projects. Waiver \n     projects could be terminated by the Secretary for good cause \n     and states would not be allowed to supplant state funding \n     with grants received under this program.\n       Lessons from the States/Report to Congress.--At the end of \n     the five-year period, the Board would report to Congress on \n     the progress made by states with respect to expanding health \n     insurance coverage and cost containment. The Board would also \n     make recommendations to Congress concerning any further \n     action Congress should take concerning health care reform \n     from the information and experiences drawn from the states.\n       Existing State Laws.--States that have existing Medicaid \n     and Medicare waivers are continued and not preempted by this \n     Act. Hawaii would be granted a continued exemption from ERISA \n     preemption.\n       ERISA Review.--To allow states to move forward with \n     meaningful comprehensive health care reform while fully \n     recognizing the needs of employers in administering self-\n     funded plans across state lines, an ERISA Review Commission \n     is established to find common ground, clarify what is \n     permissible under ERISA and ensure the interests of self-\n     insured plans are addressed. The Commission will be composed \n     of representatives from state and local government, business, \n     labor and the federal government.\n\n\n   title iii--public health, rural and underserved access improvement\n\n       Core Functions of Public Health.--Core functions are those \n     activities and programs that emphasize population-based \n     health \n     [[Page S1944]] measures such as the investigation and control \n     of threats to the health of communities such as communicable \n     diseases (tuberculosis, HIV, measles, influenza), \n     environmental hazards (air pollution, radon, radiation, waste \n     and sewage disposal), toxic pollutants (lead-based paint, \n     contaminated drinking water) and emerging patterns of acute \n     and chronic disease and injury (food borne poisoning, cancer, \n     heart disease).\n       Other Programs.--Funding is also made available for \n     comprehensive evaluation of disease prevention and health \n     promotion programs, Schools of Public Health, Area Health \n     Education Centers, Health Education Training Centers, \n     Regional Poison Control Centers, school-related health \n     services, Community and Migrant Health Centers, the National \n     Health Service Corps, satellite primary car clinics and \n     community health advisors.\n       Funding.--This title is allocated $9 billion over a five-\n     year period.\n                       Title IV--Medical Research\n\n       National Institute of Health (NIH) Funding.--$6 billion \n     would be allocated over a five-year period under this title \n     to expand our national commitment to health research. Monies \n     are allocated to the NIH Institutes and Centers on the same \n     basis as annual appropriations. Five percent of the monies \n     will be directed to extramural construction and renovation of \n     research facilities, the National Library of Medicine and the \n     Office of the Director.\n\n\n                        Title V--Fraud and Abuse\n\n       Federal-State-Private Sector Coordination.--This title \n     tracks much of the language from Senator Bill Cohen's \n     ``Health Care Fraud Prevention Act of 1995''. An improved \n     federal-state-private sector collaboration to combat fraud \n     and abuse would be established. Moreover, certain existing \n     criminal and civil penalties would be expanded to eliminate \n     waste in the health care system.\n\n\n                     Title VI--Financing Provisions\n\n       Tobacco Tax.--The bill will be financed through a $1 tax on \n     tobacco products. This tax is expected to raise $65 billion \n     over five years.\n\n\n                Not Included--Medicaid and Medicare Cuts\n\n       There are no Medicaid and Medicare cuts included in the \n     Graham-Hatfield proposal.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/01/senate-section/article/S1920-4", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1944-S1961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       THE HEALTH PARTNERSHIP ACT\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, on the first day of the 104th Congress, \nI introduced a package of five bills--my legislative priorities for the \ncoming session. At that time, I stated that one of my main priorities \nduring the 104th Congress will be to look for ways to redefine Federal \nprograms to enhance the efforts toward reform already underway in the \nStates. The three bills I introduced on that first day are designed to \ndecrease the burden of Federal compliance and oversight measures in key \npolicy areas. In exchange for loosening the Federal regulatory \nstraitjacket, we will transform accountability from paperwork \nrequirements to performance-based results. I call this the flexibility \nfactor in Government and it entails finding a path through every \nFederal agency where innovation at the State and local levels is \nnurtured and rewarded.\n  It is in that context today that I join my good friend and colleague \nfrom Florida, Mr. Graham, in introducing the Health Partnership Act of \n1995. This bill is very similar to the legislation we introduced at the \nend of the 103d Congress when it became apparent that efforts to pass \ncomprehensive reform would fail. Rather than federalizing health care, \nthis bill would encourage the States to innovate and help build the \nbest approaches to addressing our health care problems--a return to the \ntrue essence of federalism.\n  To date, six States have enacted comprehensive health care reform \nproposals--Hawaii, Massachusetts, Oregon, Minnesota, Florida, and \nWashington. In addition, 44 States have enacted small group insurance \nreform; 44 have enacted data collection systems, and 41 have Medicaid \nmanaged care experiments underway.\n  Although many reforms are underway, States have often had to struggle \nwith the Federal Government to move forward with their reform plans. \nSecuring the necessary waivers from the Federal Government has become \nan increasingly burdensome process. For example, it took nearly 3 years \nand two administrations for Oregon to obtain the Medicaid waivers it \nneeded to implement its Medicaid expansion. This expansion has provided \nhealth care for nearly 100,000 additional Oregonians since its \nimplementation in February 1994. And although there have been problems \nthat came with implementation, the overwhelming majority of Oregonians \ncontinue to support the Oregon health plan.\n  Mr. President, I am fortunate to come from a State which is willing \nto look at new and innovative approaches to reform in the public and \nprivate sectors. Recently, Oregon was granted a welfare waiver to \nimplement their Jobs Plus Program. Oregon has also recently signed a \nmemorandum of understanding with the administration to move forward \nwith the Oregon Option, a partnership designed to deliver Government \nservices in a better and more efficient manner. We are also hopeful \nthat our State will be designed an ``ed-flex partnership State'' by \nSecretary Riley as soon as the Goals 2000 process is in place. This \ndesignation will allow our State to waive Federal law in certain areas \nin which the State has already demonstrated a commitment to change. \nFrankly, it seems like I am spending much of my time these days \npursuing waivers of Federal law for my State--nearly all of the \ninnovation that has come forth from my State in recent years has \nrequired a Federal waiver for implementation. Oregon is willing to \npersevere--but not all States are.\n  Due to the arduous process a State must go through to obtain Federal \nwaivers to enact comprehensive health care reform, many States have \nheld off in attempting comprehensive reform. In addition, one of the \nbiggest barriers to State reform is the Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act [ERISA]. This Federal law is one of the broadest Federal \nlaws on the books, and it has effectively prevented States from \nenacting reform that achieves universal coverage. ERISA waivers can \nonly be granted by the Congress and have been few and far between--only \nHawaii has one and it was granted 20 years ago.\n  The issue of ERISA reform is a sensitive one. On one hand, States \nfeel that ERISA preemption is a major roadblock to their reform \nefforts. States argue that ERISA prevents them from reaching a \nsignificant percentage of the insurance market in order to fully \nimplement reform proposals that increase access to health care and \ncontrol costs. On the other hand, business, especially employers with \nbusinesses in many different States, argue that they need uniformity in \nthe administration of their employee health benefit plans. They argue \nthat their ability to manage their health care costs and assure that \nall employees are getting equal benefits will be undermined by State \nhealth care reform if the ERISA preemption is lifted.\n  Both sides raise compelling arguments, but where does that leave us? \nIn the absence of comprehensive national reform, the status quo is not \nacceptable. Thus, in the bill we are introducing today, we have \nincluded a mechanism which will hopefully lead to a fair and equitable \nresolution of this problem. In order to allow States to move forward \nwith meaningful comprehensive health care reform, while fully \nrecognizing the needs of employers in administering self-funded plans \nacross State lines, an ERISA\n Review Commission is established to find common ground, clarify what \nis permissible under ERISA and ensure the interest of self-insured \nplans are addressed. This limited duration Commission will be charged \nwith making recommendations on ERISA reform to the Secretary of Labor, \nand will be composed of representatives from State and local \ngovernment, business, labor, and the Federal Government.\n\n  We consider this piece of our bill as work in progress. We firmly \nbelieve that the dialog between the two sides must begin. And we look \nforward to finding ways to improve and expand upon the proposal we put \nforward in today's legislation.\n  I have long advocated that we look to the States to help develop the \ndatabase we need to determine the appropriate Federal role in health \ncare reform. In my opinion, this is the essence of the federalism on \nwhich our country was founded. With no consensus on comprehensive \nreform in Congress, we should turn to the States to lay the foundation \nfor reform. All of the ideas that we debated last session--from \ninsurance reform to universal coverage to malpractice reform--are being \ntested in our States. We should then distill the information and data \nobtained from these innovations and use it to reach consensus on \nnational reform.\n  [[Page S1945]] The bill that we are reintroducing today does that. It \nsays to the States, we believe in you. Put together a plan to expand \naccess to health care, control costs, to improve quality and health \noutcomes in your State and we will give you the waivers you need to \nimplement your innovative ideas. We believe this should be a \npartnership and so we will even provide you with some Federal funds to \nhelp you achieve your goals. Then at the end of 5 years, we will \nevaluate what you have done. Has it been successful? Have you met your \ngoals? How can we use this information to put together a plan that \nworks for the rest of the Nation?\n  And if a State wants to develop a more limited plan, the bill will \nallow that State to apply for a limited project waiver. This will \nencourage more of the limited reforms that are already proceeding so \nsuccessfully in many States, on a much more rapid basis.\n  In addition, the bill includes provisions to improve public health \nservices and access to health care in rural and underserved areas. This \nwill spur the development of our health care delivery infrastructure \nand will lead to better health outcomes.\n  This bill also includes a proposal I have long-championed with \nSenator Harkin of Iowa--the National Fund for Health Research. While I \nintend to introduce this piece of the bill as free-standing legislation \nlater in the year, I feel it is important to have at least one option \non the table for increasing our commitment to medical research. \nTherefore, a minimum of $6 billion will be provided over 5 years to \nsupplement the annual appropriations to the National Institutes of \nHealth.\n  Medical research is the sole hope we can provide to millions of \nAmericans who will face disease and disability either in their own \nlives or in their families. We can care for them in our hospitals and \nclinics but we cannot alleviate their pain or end their suffering \nwithout cures and preventative treatments. Cures are the direct result \nof our investment in medical research.\n  Mr. President, our Nation spends about $1 trillion each year on \nhealth care, but only 2 to 3 percent on medical research. I submit to \nthe proponents of cost containment, that the cornerstone of cost \ncontainment is the cures and improved treatments arising from medical \nresearch.\n  I want to cite two examples of the tremendous strides taken in \nmedical research that have totally reversed the prognostic indications \nfor certain diseases. In 1960, we had a U.S. Senator, Richard L. \nNeuberger, die of testicular cancer. At that point in time, this \ndiagnosis carried a death sentence. Today, because of the advances in \nmedical research, 95 percent of testicular cancer is curable. That is \nbut one example of the strides we have made in the eradication of \ndisease. Research in other fields such as heart and lung disease, \nstroke, and juvenile leukemia have increased the quality of life and \nlifespans of many afflicted individuals.\n  The other day, I was amused by the current commercials on treatments \nfor upset stomachs and more specifically, petic ulcers. A research \nstudy at the Michigan Research Center concluded that petic ulcers are \nnot caused by stress or diet, but by simple bacteria. The causative \nbacteria is treatable with common antibiotics and, therefore, ulcers \nare curable. That one singular research project was responsible for \naltering our treatment of a common ailment, and alleviating the \nconstant pain of its sufferers.\n  Additionally, I want to emphasize that medical research has a broad \nbase of public support. One recent poll indicated that 77 percent of \nthe American people supported a health care premium increase of $1 per \nweek, if it were earmarked for medical research. Another 75 percent of \nthe American people said they would accept a $1 increase per week on \ntheir income tax bill, if it were earmarked for medical research.\n  The American public realizes that there is a direct link between \nmedical research and improved health care, cost containment, and \ndiscovery of disease cures. I cannot emphasize enough the necessity of \nundergirding the National Institutes of Health with better funding \nmechanisms than what exists in the annual appropriations process.\n  Finally, we have added a title to our bill to address the enormous \nproblem of fraud and abuse in our health care system. The focus of this \ntitle is on Federal, State, and private sector coordination to combat \nfraud and abuse. Much of the language in the title tracks the \nlegislation recently introduced by the Senator from Maine [Mr. Cohen] \nin the Health Care Fraud Prevention Act of 1995.\n  Beginning the process to reforming our health care system does not \ncome without cost.\n  Currently, we are witnessing increasing doubts about the \ndependability of funding for our medical research initiatives. With the \nsqueeze on discretionary nonmilitary funding, we are going to have even \ngreater pressure put upon our ability to find innovative financial \nsupport.\n  Thus, our proposal will be fully funded by a $1 tax on tobacco \nproducts. The Congressional Budget Office has indicated that a $1 \nincrease will result in $65 billion in revenues. As a long-time \nadvocate of increased tobacco taxes, I believe this is an appropriate \nrevenue source not only because of the revenue that is gained through \nthe tax, but more importantly, because of the health benefits that \nresult from such a tax. This tax will save lives and will have a great \neffect on the number of teens who smoke. As my colleagues know, the \nnumber of teenage smokers is rising significantly despite our efforts \nto educate teens about the health dangers of tobacco use. We must \nredouble our efforts to halt this increase in young smokers.\n  Mr. President, I strongly believe that the approach we are putting \nforward today is a positive first step toward the foundation of \nnational reform. There will be those who argue that a State approach \nwill lead to a fragmented health care system. I disagree. We will \nlikely not achieve comprehensive national health care reform this year. \nLet us not make the mistake of missing an opportunity to gather data \nfrom the States that will help us in the years ahead. Ours should be a \npartnership with the States to facilitate the development of health \ncare reform--we should invite them into the process as our partners, \nnot fight their innovative efforts.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BENNETT (for himself, Mr. Bumpers, and Mr. Johnston):\n  S. 309. A bill to reform the concession policies of the National Park \nService, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n                the concession policy reform act of 1995\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a piece of \nlegislation which will be known, I hope, when it becomes law as the \nNational Park Service Concessions Policy Reform Act of 1995.\n  This particular act is cosponsored by two of my friends on the Senate \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, the former chairman of that \ncommittee, Chairman Bennett Johnston and Mr. Bumpers, Dale Bumpers, \nfrom Arkansas, who was the chairman of the subcommittee that handled \nthis legislation in the previous Congress.\n  Mr. Bumpers has been pursuing reform in the Park Service concession \npolicy for, I think, his entire career in the Senate. I was delighted \nto join with him last year and bring about the passage of this bill in \nthe committee and the Senate. It was reported out by the committee by a \nvote of 16 to 4, a majority of Republicans and a majority of Democrats \nboth supporting it. And it was passed on this floor a year and a half \nago by a vote of 90 to 9, demonstrating tremendous bipartisan support \nfor this.\n  Unfortunately, our friends in the House did not act with the same \ndispatch that we did and, as a consequence, it got hung up there, \ntragically, for enough months to mean that when the conference report \ncam before this body, it ultimately got caught in the trap of the \nyearend logjam, traffic jam and, as a result, the conference report was \nnot adopted.\n  So it is necessary for us to introduce it again this year. I think \nthis year we will see it move rapidly through both the Senate and the \nHouse and become law.\n  The bill that I am introducing is very similar to the one that passed \nthis body 90 to 9 last year, and the arguments in favor of it are the \nsame as they were on that occasion. Very specifically, Mr. President, \nour national parks, like everything else in life, are \n[[Page S1946]] changing. That is, the number of visitors to the \nnational parks is going up. As a consequence, the need for services is \nchanging.\n  If I can refer to a national park in my own home State--and we in \nUtah are proud of the fact that we have as many national parks as any \nother State in the Union, it is a particularly gorgeous place in Utah--\nZion National Park in the last 10 years has seen the number of visitors \ngo from 1.4 million in 1983 to 2.9 million in 1993, doubling in a 10-\nyear period. Obviously, in that kind of a circumstance, the sort of \nconcession policy that you had 10 years ago needs to be examined in the \nlight of this increase.\n  There, of course, are other reasons why this needs to be\n   examined. The Park Service is itself running out of money. It is one \nof the tragedies that we have the crown jewels of the National Park \nSystem being starved for resources just as more and more Americans want \nto take advantage of the beauty of these parks. As a consequence, one \nof the places people are looking for money is to the royalty payments \nto come from the concessionaires.\n\n  Oh, say some, well, that means the Government is trying to beat up on \nthe concessionaires, the Government is trying to punish the \nconcessionaires for being successful. I do not think so. What we are \ntrying to do in this legislation is open up the concessions for \ncompetitive bidding and let the marketplace determine what these \nconcessions are worth.\n  I come from the business community. I have listened to the \nconcessionaires as fellow business people when they come and say to me, \nSenator, you can't change the rules. Well, the rules change all the \ntime as markets change. I knew that when I was in business. I reminded \nthem of that in their business circumstance.\n  But the most important reason we need to change this is because we do \nneed the power of competition to help set the rates. We do need the \nopportunity for new blood and new ideas to come in, even if the \nconcessionaire does not change. I say to those who are saying, We're \ngoing to lose what we have now under the new policy you are proposing, \nSenator, we're going to lose the concession that we have, I say,\n\n       No you are not. If, indeed, you are as capable as you say \n     you are, and I believe you are, if you have the expertise of \n     10, 15, 20 years experience as you say you have, you will be \n     able to compete. But the mere fact that you will be forced to \n     compete with an outside bidder will, indeed, make you sharper \n     even if you are, indeed, the ones who hang on to the \n     concession as it currently exists.\n\n  So, Mr. President, we are dealing with a piece of legislation here \nthat really is relatively noncontroversial, given the vote that it had \nin the last Congress; something that I think is long overdue, given the \nchanges that are occurring in the national parks; something that is \nsound financial policy, given the fact that the parks do not have the \nkind of money that I think they should have. It is good public policy.\n  I was pleased to be associated with it in the previous Congress, and \nI am happy to have the opportunity to offer it again in this Congress.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 8 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, now that the Senator from Arkansas has \njoined us in the Chamber, I do not intend to use the remainder of my \ntime. I would like to comment now that he is here on his leadership on \nthis issue.\n  I came to the Senate knowing nothing about it. I sat in the committee \nlistening to the hearings where the issue was outlined and decided that \nthe Senator from Arkansas was correct, that something needed to be \ndone. I conferred with my then ranking member on the committee, the \nSenator from Wyoming, Mr. Wallop, who suggested that with my business \nbackground it might be appropriate that I get involved in this.\n  I must, for the accuracy of the Record, point out that Senator Wallop \nwas not convinced and was one of the four in the committee and one of \nthe nine in the Chamber who decided they could not support this \nparticular approach. But I was very grateful to him for his overall \nsupport of my involvement and to the Senator from Arkansas for his \nleadership and tenacity on this issue. He was very instrumental in \ngiving me the background and the education and the understanding of \nthese issues. Had he not been willing to act as my tutor and mentor in \nthis circumstance I undoubtedly would not have come to the point that I \nhave here today.\n  So as I yield back the remainder of my time and end my statement, I \ndo so with a comment of gratitude to the senior Senator from Arkansas \nfor his leadership and his tutelage on this issue.\n  I also must add to that my gratitude to the senior Republicans on the \nenergy committee who also helped me understand this issue and who \nsupported this in committee: Senator Hatfield, Senator Domenici, \nSenator Nickles, and others who supported us in committee on the \nRepublican side. As I said in my earlier comment, the bill was \nsupported by a majority of both Republicans and Democrats, even though \nthere were both Republicans and Democrats in committee who decided they \ncould not support it.\n  So, Mr. President, I am delighted to turn the floor over to the \nsenior Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers] and thank him for his \npatience in helping this more junior Senator understand the nature of \nthis issue and the importance of it. I am delighted to have him as an \noriginal cosponsor on this bill.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join Senator \nBennett in sponsoring the National Park Service Concession Policy \nReform Act of 1995.\n  I first started trying to reform park concession policies in 1979. \nOver the past 16 years, we have held numerous legislative and oversight \nhearings, but until last year, had been unable to move the bill beyond \nthe hearing stage. During last year's hearing, Senator Bennett offered \nto work with me to find a compromise, and in large part because of his \nefforts, we reported a bill with bipartisan support from the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee. That bill, S. 208, was overwhelmingly \nsupported by the Senate, passing by a vote of 90 to 9. The bill enjoyed \nequally strong support in the House of Representatives, passing with \nrelatively minor changes by a vote of 386 to 30. Despite such strong \nsupport in both Houses, the bill died last Congress because two \nSenators refused to allow the final compromise version to be brought up \non the Senate floor during the final days of the 103d Congress.\n  The bill that Senator Bennett and I are introducing this year is \nessentially the same as last year's Senate-passed bill. This bill will \nmake much-needed changes in the current system and ensure that the \nAmerican public receives a fair return for allowing private entities \nthe privilege of doing business in units of the National Park System. \nAs I have said many times, the Concessions Policy Act of 1965, the law \nunder which the National Park Service authorizes concessions to provide \nvisitor services inside units of the National Park System, is outdated \nand anticompetitive, and should be repealed.\n  Private visitor service facilities have been operating in our \nnational parks for nearly 100 years. Prior to 1965, the National Park \nService provided for in-park visitor services by administrative action \nunder very general provisions in the 1916 National Park Service Organic \nAct. In 1965, Congress enacted the Concession Policy Act, making the \nNational Park Service the only Federal land-managing agency with a \nspecific concessions statute.\n  Current concession operations in parks vary in size from small, \nfamily-owned businesses providing services such as canoe rentals and \nguiding services, to major hotel and restaurant facilities operated by \nlarge corporations. Although the number fluctuates because of seasonal \nchanges, there are currently about 650 concessioners operating inside \nunits of the National Park System.\n  Concession permits are issued for most smaller or seasonal \noperations, while concession contracts are used for larger, more long-\nterm operations. Total gross revenues generated by concessioners \ncurrently amount to more than $657 million annually. Significantly, \nabout 50 concessioners--less than 8 percent--account for over 80 \npercent of these revenues.\n  [[Page S1947]] Concession policy and the need for significant reform \nhave been topics of intense interest for many years. In addition to the \nhearings we have conducted, this issue has been the subject of numerous \nstudies, reports, and analyses prepared by the Congress, the General \nAccounting Office, the Department of the Interior's inspector general, \nthe National Park Service, and a variety of private research \norganizations. All of these studies have identified problems with the \ncurrent law which need to be addressed.\n\n\n                             franchise fees\n\n  One of the problems with the current system concerns franchise fees, \nthe fees paid by concessions to the United States for the privilege of \noperating a business inside a national park. These fees are too low and \nshould be increased. This is especially true for the larger \nconcessioners who are operating under long-term concessions contracts \nentered into many years ago. At present, the U.S. Treasury receives \napproximately $18 million in franchise and related fees from \nconcessioners who do in excess of $657 million worth of business in our \nnational parks. In addition, another $7.8 million is retained within \nparks in special accounts. Combined, these franchise fees and special \naccounts average only 4 percent of the total gross revenues earned by \nconcessioners. This low rate of return results in a giveaway of some of \nour Nation's most valuable resources.\n  I am pleased to note that some of the most recent contracts have \nprovided for a better rate of return. For example, the new contract to \nprovide visitor services at Yosemite National Park increased the rate \nof return to the Government from three-quarters of 1 percent to almost \n20 percent. However, this change was the result of a very unique set of \ncircumstances which permitted several companies to compete for the new \ncontract; in general, the Concession Policy Act of 1965 continues to \nprevent serious competition for the awarding of any new contract. In \naddition, there is no assurance that a future administration would not \nreverse course and return to the abysmally low returns of the past.\n  Rather than arbitrarily establishing a minimum franchise fee in the \nlegislation, my bill will ensure that these fees be set at more \nrealistic levels by encouraging and facilitating increased competition \nfor concession contracts.\n  In addition, under existing law, franchise fees are deposited as \nmiscellaneous receipts in the U.S. Treasury. Since these funds do not \ndirectly benefit the parks or the people who use them, there is little \nincentive for the Park Service to aggressively pursue increased fees, \nor for concessioners to pay them. The Concession Policy Reform Act of \n1995 would deposit these receipts into a special account in the \nTreasury to be used to benefit park operations, resource management \nmaintenance, visitor services, et cetera. The bill also directs the \nPark Service, where practicable, to establish a park improvement fund \nin lieu of collecting all or a portion of the franchise fees.\n  While I believe it is important to try and ensure that the Federal \nGovernment achieves a higher return from these contracts, the operation \nof facilities in national parks should not be determined simply on the \nbasis of the highest bid. This legislation explicitly states that \nconsideration of revenue to the United States shall be subordinate to \nthe objectives of protecting and preserving park areas. In addition, \nthe bill grants the Secretary the authority to reject any bid, \nregardless of the amount of franchise fee offered, if the Secretary \ndetermines that the bidder is not qualified, is likely to provide \nunsatisfactory service, or is not responsive to the objectives of \nprotecting and preserving the park area. So that there is absolutely no \ndoubt about the priority of concessions operations within national \nparks, the bill explicitly directs the Secretary to evaluate franchise \nfee proposals only from among those companies that the Secretary \ndetermines will be responsive to protecting and preserving park \nresources.\n\n\n                     preferential right of renewal\n\n  Perhaps the most significant impediment to competition concerns the \nstatutory preferential right to contract renewal which, as currently \ninterpreted by the Park Service, gives an existing satisfactory \nconcessioner the right to meet the terms of a better offer submitted by \na competitor and to retain the contract if the existing concessioner's \noffer is substantially equal. In my view, in most cases, this is \nanticompetitive and should not be granted as a matter of law. While \nsuch a preference may have been warranted years ago to encourage \ncertain developments in parks and ensure the continuity of concession \noperations, it can also limit both the Park Service's\n influence in dealing with concessioners and the ability of most \nAmericans to compete for concession contracts. In many instances, the \nright to provide visitor services inside National Parks is a very \ndesirable and very valuable privilege which can attract a host of \nextremely competent and qualified prospective concessioners. The Park \nService ought to be able to choose from these qualified applicants \nwithout being constrained by a preferential right. This legislation \nwill eliminate the preferential right of renewal in future concessions \ncontracts, with the limited exception of outfitter and guide operations \nwho currently operate in a largely competitive environment, and small \ncontracts with gross annual revenues of $500,000 or less, which I will \ndiscuss in detail shortly.\n\n\n             Notice of Opportunity to Bid on New Contracts\n\n  It is apparent that the Park Service does not adequately publicize \nnew concession contracts or contract renewal opportunities, nor does it \nalways provide interested parties with the specific financial and other \nsubmission requirements needed to submit competitive proposals. The \nConcession Policy Reform Act would establish a detailed competitive \nbidding procedure for the awarding of all concessions contracts. This \nprocess would require that advance notice of all concessions contracts \nbe published, that specific minimum bid requirements be established and \nmade public, and that the details of the previous contract for the park \narea and other important information be made available to prospective \nconcessioners.\n\n\n                          Possessory Interest\n\n  The other most significant obstacle to competition for concession \ncontracts involves a provision in the current law which allows the \ngranting of a possessory interest to a concessioner. When a \nconcessioner makes an improvement on land inside a National Park, that \nconcessioner is entitled, with the approval of the Secretary, to a \npossessory interest in that improvement, which consists of all \nincidents of ownership except legal title. The method of valuation for \nthis property interest as set forth the 1965 act is sound value. Sound \nvalue is defined as current reconstruction cost, less depreciation, not \nto exceed fair market value. This effectively gives concessioners a \nright of compensation for the appreciated value of their improvements. \nThis current practice of routinely granting sound value can result in \nconcessioners being entitled to millions of dollars in possessory \ninterest, which can effectively make it impossible for the National \nPark Service to terminate a contract or award it to a new concessioner. \nThis practice is not financially warranted in all circumstances, serves \nas a barrier to new and qualified concessioners, and limits the Park \nService's flexibility in managing concessions facilities.\n  The Concession Policy Reform Act of 1995 will continue to recognize a \ncurrent concessioner's possessory interest, if there is one. With \nrespect to new concessions contracts, however, the bill provides that \nif a concessioner's contract is terminated, the concessioner shall be \nentitled to the actual cost of building or acquiring the structure, \nless depreciation. Last Congress, the legislation was modified to \nprovide for the depreciation of the structure over its useful life, up \nto the depreciation period used for Federal income tax purposes, which \nis currently 39 years. As modified, I believe the bill allows for a \nmore reasonable depreciation schedule, while at the same time, \npermitting a concessioner to be compensated for its nondepreciated \ninterest in the structure, thus protecting the concessioner's \ninvestment.\n  In addition to these major changes, the legislation would adopt a \nnumber of other recommendations identified by the General Accounting \nOffice, the Inspector General, and the Department's Concessions Task \nForce.\n  [[Page S1948]] Over the past few years, the bill has been modified \nseveral times to incorporate many constructive suggestions and \nproposals. These changes include eliminating what some perceived to be \nexcessive reporting and regulatory requirements, clarifying the \ncriteria by which a contract is to be awarded, narrowing the uses for \nrevenues generated from franchise fees, and other clarifying and \nconforming changes.\n  This year's bill retains the provision in last year's Senate passed \nbill to recognize a preferential right of renewal for outfitters, \nguides, and river runners, as well as for small operations with gross \nannual revenues of under $500,000. While I believe such a right is \nanticompetitive in general, I believe a limited exception is warranted \nin these cases. Unlike most concessioners, river runners and other \ncompanies providing\n outfitter and guide services operate in a competitive environment \nwithin a park, with several companies providing the same or similar \nservices. In addition, guide and outfitter operations do not have a \npossessory interest in park structures, unlike many other \nconcessioners. The legislation directs the Secretary to grant a \npreferential right of renewal for these outfitters, but only if the \noperator does not have a possessory interest in a structure, and only \nif the company has been evaluated as operating satisfactorily during \nthe previous contract. I think this approach recognizes the needs of \nthis class of concessioners, but is consistent with the overall thrust \nof this legislation.\n\n  The bill also provides a preferential right of renewal for small \noperations with gross annual revenues of less than $500,000. This \nencompasses almost 80 percent of all concession operations. I have \nalways maintained that concession reform should not be a means to force \nsmall operations, especially family operations, who have in many \ninstances provided service to a particular park for decades. At the \nsame time, the bill ensures that the contracts with gross annual \nrevenues exceeding $500,000, which account for over 90 percent of all \nconcession revenues, are awarded based on a competitive basis.\n  I would also like to repeat an observation that I have made \ncontinuously during the past several years, one that I am sure Senator \nBennett would agree with. The purpose of this bill is not to eliminate \nconcession operations from our national parks. I do not subscribe to \nthe theory all visitor facilities in national parks are inappropriate. \nMany of the facilities and services provided by concessioners are \nentirely appropriate and benefit the park visitors. I only want to \nensure that when concession contracts are awarded, the American people \nreceive a fair return, and that there is an opportunity for competition \nfor these desirable business opportunities.\n  Mr. President, this bill represents responsible reform of national \npark concession policy. As demonstrated last Congress, this issue has \nstrong bipartisan support in both Houses of Congress. In addition, \nconcession reform has been a high priority within the Department of the \nInterior. I urge my colleagues to continue their strong support for \nthis much-needed reform, and I look forward to its swift enactment this \nyear.\n  In summary, Mr. President, I again wish to pay tribute to my \ndistinguished colleague and very good friend, the Senator from Utah, \nRobert Bennett. I have to confess that after working 16 years to reform \nthe concessions policy of this country in the national parks, I had \nannually hit a stone wall until Bob Bennett came to the Senate.\n  I am not only grateful to him and to his values and his integrity, \npolitical, and every other way, but also because of his background in \nbusiness and the recognition, once he delved into the issue, that this \nwas a policy which was long, long ago outdated and needed dramatically \nto be reformed.\n  Let me further say that even my own efforts on this through the years \nhave not been, as some concessionaires thought, punitive in nature. It \nis just one of those things that has been going on for 50 to 100 years \nin this country and nobody ever did anything about it.\n  Once I realized how badly it needed reform, I went to work on it. As \nI say, it was not until 1993 and 1994, after Senator Bennett came and \nsat on the Energy Committee with me where the original jurisdiction on \nthis issue lay--and I never will forget the morning that he made what I \nthought was one of the most sensible presentations in the committee I \never heard, and that was we believe in competition. We pride ourselves \non being a capitalistic nation. We believe in free enterprise, and that \nentails competition. And there was, Mr. President, virtually no \ncompetition in this field.\n  In 1993, the concessions of this country took in $657 million, and \nthe U.S. Treasury derived the princely sum of $18 million. The one \ncontract that we have let under something similar to this bill was let \nin Yosemite, and this Yosemite contract pays up to 20 percent.\n  Now, we want to keep the rentals as low as we can because the lower \nthey are, the lower the prices are and that is good for the American \npeople who visit the park. But we also want the U.S. Government, which \nowns the parks and is responsible for them, to get a decent return \nbased on competition.\n  So, Mr. President, I wish to say this is a very happy day for me. We \npassed this bill out of our committee last year, and one Senator killed \nthe bill in the last 2 weeks of the session. As a matter of fact, that \nsame Senator killed about 35 to 40 bills out of the National Parks \nSubcommittee of the Energy Committee and now we have to have hearings \non those bills all over again this year at a staggering cost to the \ntaxpayers, report the bills, go through the House, go through \nconference, go through everything we went through before in order to \npass the bills again.\n  One other thing I would like to point out is that one of the things \nthat occurred to me, which made this concessions policy absolutely \nnecessary, was the policy of allowing concessionaires in the parks to \nbuild hotels and other structures and, of course, depreciate those \nthings on their tax books but at the end of the lease, if they lost the \nlease, be entitled to what was called sound value, which was \neffectively market value.\n  If you had the concession at Yosemite and you decided to put $5 \nmillion into a hotel, at the end of your lease, say 15 years later, you \nare entitled to the market value of the hotel if you lost the lease, \nand that might be $20 million. The fair market value of the hotel might \nactually be more than it was when you paid for it, yet you had been \nable to depreciate that hotel on your tax books for tax purposes for 15 \nyears. It gets a little more complicated than that, but I just want to \nsay that was the thing that first caught my attention on these leases. \nThe other was the extremely low rental that the Federal Government was \ngetting.\n  What the Government will get in years to come is not going to balance \nthe budget. It is not a large amount. But it does deal with what \nCongress ought to be alert to all the time, and that is the elemental \nprinciple of fairness.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, today I am joining with Senator Bennett \nand Senator Bumpers in sponsoring the National Park Service Concession \nPolicy Reform Act of 1995. The legislation that we are introducing \ntoday is very similar to a bill which passed both the Senate and House \nlast year by overwhelming margins but failed to clear the Senate in the \nfinal days of the 103d Congress.\n  This legislation, which is supported by the Department of the \nInterior as well as a number of other conservation and park user \ngroups, would correct the many deficiencies of the 1965 act which \ncurrently governs concession operations inside units of the National \nPark System. It would end the granting of a preferential right of \nrenewal to an incumbent concessioner; it would end the granting of a \npreferential right of renewal to an incumbent concessioner; it would \nreformulate the method by which possessory interest is valued; it would \nestablish a competitive bidding procedure to ensure competition and \nthat the Government receives fair value for the privilege of doing \nbusiness in our national parks; and it would provide that franchise \nfees and other revenues collected from concessioners are available for \nuse in the parks rather than simply returned to the Federal Treasury.\n  In this regard, I am pleased that the bill we are introducing today \nincludes language which I offered as an amendment during the \ncommittee's deliberations last year which would authorize \n[[Page S1949]] the Secretary to establish park improvement funds in the \nindividual park units where franchise fees could be deposited by the \nconcessioner and used at the direction of the Secretary of the Interior \nfor badly needed projects in the parks. This practice is currently \nfollowed in several parks, most notably the recent Yosemite contract, \nand has proven very successful.\n  I look forward to working with Senators Bennett, Bumpers, and others \nwho were supportive of our efforts last year, and hope we can enact \nthis measure early in this Congress.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. WARNER (for himself and Mr. Robb):\n  S. 310. A bill to transfer title to certain lands in Shenandoah \nNational Park in the State of Virginia, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n           the shenandoah national park transfer act of 1995\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to once again introduce \nlegislation for myself and Senator Robb which would authorize the \nSecretary of Interior to transfer without reimbursement all right, \ntitle, and interest in certain lands in Shenandoah National Park to the \nCommonwealth of Virginia, town of Front Royal, and Warren County School \nBoard.\n  In order to recognize the need for this legislation one must first \nunderstand the history of the creation of the Shenandoah National Park.\n  In 1923, Stephen Mather, Director of the National Park Service, \npersuaded Secretary of Interior Hubert Work to appoint a five-member \ncommittee to investigate the possibility of establishing a national \npark in the southern Appalachians. At that time there were no parks in \nthe country east of the Mississippi River. In 1924, the committee was \nformed to find a site for such a park. Thus began a difficult 11-year \neffort to establish a park in the southern Appalachians.\n  On February 21, 1925, President Coolidge signed into law legislation \nwhich had been introduced by Senator Swanson of Virginia and Senator \nMcKellar of Tennessee which called for the creation of a national park \nin the southern Appalachians and the Great Smokey Mountains.\n  In 1926, Congress authorized the park to be acquired by donation, \nwithout the expenditure of any Federal funds. This act did not \nofficially create the parks but set forth the conditions of their \nestablishment although in indefinite terms. The Secretary of Interior \nand the committee were given the difficult task of raising the \nnecessary funds for land acquisition. Therefore, while there was strong \nsupport for the creation of the park, its realization remained highly \nconditional since no Federal funds would be made available to purchase \nthe park lands.\n  Although private donations were being made, then-Governor Harry F. \nByrd, realized the need to pursue other financing means if sufficient \nfunds to acquire the acreage were to be obtained. In January 1928, \nGovernor Byrd asked the general assembly for a $1 million appropriation \nto make possible the purchase of park lands. A few days later, the \nState legislature agreed and appropriated the funds. This $1 million \nappropriation, coupled with the $1.25 million raised from private \nsources, enabled Virgina to purchase the necessary acreage to establish \nthe park.\n  With the financial means in hand, the Virginia General Assembly \npassed in 1928 the National Park Act which authorized the State \nCommission on Conservation and Development to acquire land for transfer \nto the Federal Government to establish the\n Shenandoah National Park. In that same year, Senator Swanson and \nRepresentative Temple--both of Virginia--introduced legislation in both \nHouses of Congress ``to establish a minimum area for the Shenandoah \nNational Park, for administration, protection, and general development \n* * * '' This legislation passed both Houses of Congress and was signed \ninto law by President Coolidge on February 16, 1928.\n\n  Due largely to the appropriation by the Commonwealth of Virginia and \nwhat historians called Virginia's ``heroic land acquisition efforts,'' \nthe necessary acreage was acquired and the land titles were given to \nthe Federal Government. On December 26, 1935, the Shenandoah National \nPark was officially established.\n  The Commonwealth's generous donation of lands to the Federal \nGovernment for the creation of this great park has now placed the \nCommonwealth in an unfortunate situation in which the State can no \nlonger maintain the roads within the park. My legislation addresses \nthis situation.\n  The transfer of land from the Commonwealth to the Federal Government \nspecifically voided all rights of way for road purposes except for U.S. \nHighway 211 and 33. According to the deeds, the Commonwealth \ntransferred ownership of all other roads and road rights of way on \nthose lands to the Federal Government. Absolutely no reservations were \nretained by the Commonwealth for such roads.\n  Since 1935, the National Park Service at Shenandoah National Park has \nallowed the Commonwealth to maintain existing secondary roads on the \nfringes of the Park that it wished to maintain through documents called \nspecial use permits. The Department of Interior Solicitor General has \nreviewed the applicable statutes in 16 United States Code and has \ndetermined that continuation of these special use permits is not \nappropriate. Special use permits may be used only to grant a temporary \nuse of lands in national parks. The Solicitor has ruled that the \nestablished roads are not a temporary use and require complete \nownership and control of the lands by the user. These permits expired \nover 3 years ago and the Department of the Interior will not reissue \nthem. VDOT has been maintaining the roads without the permits, although \nthere is no guarantee this maintenance can continue. Furthermore, the \nNPS does not have the necessary equipment to maintain these roads at \nShenandoah National Park and, therefore, future maintenance of these \nroads is in serious question.\n  Federal law does not allow the National Park Service to convey park \nland for secondary road purposes. The only legal means to grant the \nCommonwealth road rights of way is an equal value land exchange \nauthorized under the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act.\n  Mr. President, facing this dilemma, the Virginia Department of \nTransportation has acquired land for this purpose, thereby placing the \nCommonwealth in the position of buying private land to give to the \nFederal Government to reacquire the right of way of land that the \nCommonwealth gave away when the park was established.\n  Due to the unique circumstances of the park's creation, this equal \nvalue land exchange requirement is strongly opposed by the local \ncommunities and elected officials. I, too, strongly join in this \nopposition. The Department's position has led to the Virginia General \nAssembly's passage of a resolution prohibiting the Virginia Department \nof Transportation from exchanging land for the road segments in the \npark.\n  Mr. President, I have introduced legislation to resolve this \ncontroversy. My bill would allow the Secretary of Interior to transfer \nto the Commonwealth, the town of Front Royal, and the Warren County \nSchool Board--without reimbursement--all right, title, and interest in \nand to the roads within the park specified in the legislation.\n  Due to the Commonwealth's generous donation of lands to the Federal \nGovernment for the creation of the park, the Commonwealth should not be \nrequired to give the Federal Government additional land in exchange for \nmaintaining and improving roads within the Park.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 310\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to elevate the position of Director of Indian Health \nService to Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services, to provide \nfor the organizational independence of the Indian Health Service within \nthe Department of Health and Human Services, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n                   indian health service legislation\n\n Mr. McCAIN Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nto redesignate the position of the Director of the Indian Health \nService [IHS] to that of an Assistant Secretary for Indian Health \nwithin the Department of Health and Human Services. I am pleased that \nSenator Ben Nighthorse Campbell and Senator Craig Thomas have joined me \nas original cosponsors of this important legislation. Last Congress, I \nintroduced a similar measure which was overwhelmingly passed by the \nSenate. Unfortunately, the bill was not considered by the House prior \nto adjournment.\n  The Indian Health Service is an agency under the Public Health \nService within the Department of Health and Human Services. Under the \ncurrent structure the Indian Health Service Director's authority to set \nhealth policy for American Indians is extremely limited. For example, \nthe Indian Health Service Director must report directly to the \nAssistant Secretary for Health, and yet the Director is responsible for \nadministering the entire branch of the Indian Health Service health \ncare delivery system.\n  The Indian Health Service consists of 143 service units composed of \nover 500 direct health care delivery facilities, including 49 \nhospitals, 176 health centers, 8 school centers, and 277 health \nstations and satellite clinics and Alaska village clinics. It provides \nservices ranging from facility construction to pediatrics, and serves \napproximately 1.3 million American Indians and Alaska Native \nindividuals each year. The IHS serves the most impoverished population \nin the United States. American Indian and Alaska Native populations are \nafflicted by diabetes at a rate that overwhelmingly exceeds other \nnational populations. American Indian and Alaska Native populations \ncontinue to suffer from mortality rates that exceeds all other segments \nof our population for tuberculosis, alcoholism, accidents, homicide, \npneumonia, influenza, and suicides. American Indians have also \nexperienced a tremendous increase in the number of individuals \ncontracting HIV and AIDS. Yet, today American Indians and Alaska \nNatives are among the least served and the most forgotten when it comes \nto improving America's health care delivery systems.\n  There are several critical reasons which lead me to believe that this \nlegislation is necessary. First, designating the IHS Director as an \nAssistant Secretary of Indian Health would provide the various branches \nand programs of the IHS with better advocacy within the Department and \nbetter representation during the budget process. The IHS Director \ncurrently relies on the Assistant Secretary for Health to advocate for \nthese programs.\n  Last Congress, the Principal Deputy to the Assistant Secretary for \nHealth at the Department of Health and Human Services testified before \nthe Senate Committee on Indian Affairs that a priority within the \nDepartment was to listen to the health care delivery concerns of Indian \ncountry. Obviously, this message was never received. At the same time \nthat the Department was listening to Indian country, the funding \nrequest to meet Indian health care needs was dramatically cut at every \nlevel of the administration by the Public Health Service, the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, and the Office of Management \nand\n Budget. As a result of this process, the President's budget for the \nIHS for fiscal year 1995 called for a $247 million reduction and the \nelimination of nearly 2,000 staff positions. Once all of the budget \ngimmicks were eliminated, such as the incredible assumption that the \nIHS would be able to increase third-party collections by 463 percent, \nthe IHS budget cuts surpassed $300 million. At the same time, the \nDepartment was listening to the calls of Indian country for resources \nto meet the growing health problems in Indian country.\n\n  I am convinced that neither the Public Health Service, the Secretary \nfor Health and Human Services, or the Office of Management and Budget \nhave an adequate understanding of the day-to-day health care needs of \nAmerican Indians. Therefore, I believe that the IHS is in dire need of \na senior policy person who is both knowledgeable about the programs \nadministered by the IHS and can strongly advocate for the health care \nneeds of Indians and Alaska Natives.\n  Second, an Assistant Secretary for Indian Health would eliminate \nunnecessary bureaucracy that plagues the Indian Health Service system \nand permit timely decisions to be made regarding important Indian \nhealth care issues. For example, an Assistant Secretary for Indian \nHealth would have the authority and ability to communicate directly \nwith the other operating divisions within the HHS. Requesting the \nexpertise and assistance of other HHS departments on problems of \nalcohol and substance abuse, HIV/AIDS, and child abuse for American \nIndians and Alaska Natives would be easier and have more far-reaching \nresults. Currently, the IHS Director must forward such requests for \nassistance through the Assistant Secretary for Health.\n  Third, an Assistant Secretary for Indian Health would have the \nability to call on private sector organizations that have not \ntraditionally focused on Indian health care needs and concerns, but who \nhave the expertise and resources that can enhance IHS' ability to \ndeliver the highest quality of health care, by providing technical \nassistance to Indian tribes who choose to operate their own health care \nprograms.\n  Finally, I would like to clarify a couple of points relating to \nsection 2 of the bill. Section 2 of the bill provides for the \norganizational independence of the Indian Health Service within the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services. This section is necessary \nbecause the IHS is currently an agency of the Public Health Service \nwhich is headed by the Assistant Secretary for Health. Creating an \nAssistant Secretary for Indian Health will require relocating the IHS \nto the same organizational level as the Public Health Service.\n  Section 2 also clarifies that this bill is not intended to diminish \nthe ability of the IHS to utilize the service of the U.S. Public Health \nService Commissioned Corps. While I certainly hope that the HHS would \nnot prohibit the IHS from being served by the Commissioned Corps \npersonnel in the delivery of health care to the Indian people, in light \nof the prevoius budget and staff reductions recommended by the Clinton \nadministration I am compelled to insert bill language to make clear the \nintent of the Congress on this particular matter.\n  Mr. President, the Senate passage of this legislation last Congress \nindicates that this legislation is long overdue. Redesignating the \nDirector as an Assistant Secretary for Indian Health would not only \nreaffirm the special relationship that exists between Indian tribes and \nthe Federal Government, it would send a powerful message to Indian \ncountry. At a time when the Nation focuses on health care reform, it \nis \n[[Page S1951]] critical that the health care needs of the American \nIndian are taken into consideration. For those in the administration \nand the Congress who would make a plea for a national health care \nsystem, passing this legislation would serve as an example of a \ncommitment to improving this Nation's first health care system for \nAmericans, the Indian Health Service.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nand section-by-section be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 311\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for an Assistant Administrator for Indian \nLands in the Environmental Protection Agency, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n       the assistant administrator for indian lands act for 1995\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to \nprovide for an Assistant Administrator for Indian Lands in the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency [EPA]. I want to thank my friend, the \ndistinguished Senator from Hawaii and the vice chairman of the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs, Senator Inouye, for joining with me as an \noriginal cosponsor of this bill.\n  The bill we are introducing today would establish the position of \nAssistant Administrator for Indian Lands at EPA. The President would \nappoint this individual, subject to confirmation by the Senate. The \nAssistant Administrator for Indian lands would be responsible for \ncoordinating and implementing Federal environmental laws and all EPA \nactivities with respect to Indian lands, including the 1984 Indian \npolicy.\n  This bill is similar in concept to an amendment which I offered in \nthe last Congress to provide for an Assistant Secretary for Indian \nlands in the proposed Department of the Environment. That amendment won \nthe overwhelming bipartisan support of the Senate with 79 Senators \nvoting in favor of it. As we all know, no final action was taken by the \nHouse of Representatives on the issue of cabinet status for EPA. Many \nIndian tribal governments supported the Senate's action in the 103d \nCongress, and I fully expect that there will be strong support for the \nbill we are introducing today.\n  I want to take a moment to express my gratitude to Administrator \nBrowner for the actions she has taken in the past year to establish a \nTribal Operations Committee and an American Indian Environmental Office \nwithin EPA which is under the leadership of a highly qualified native \nAmerican, Mr. Terry Williams. Each of these actions reflects a sincere \ncommitment on the part of the Administrator to try to ensure that EPA \naddresses environmental protection on Indian lands.\n  While I support the actions which have been taken by Administrator \n[[Page S1952]] Browner, I believe that much more needs to be done. \nIssues involving Indian land must be addressed at the\n highest policy levels of EPA on a consistent basis. This will only \noccur when the Indian tribes are assured a seat at the policy table. \nThe bill we are introducing today will provide that assurance.\n\n  Indian lands comprise nearly 5 percent of all of the lands in the \nUnited States. This is an area equal to the size of New England and the \nStates of Maryland, Delaware, and New Jersey combined. The Navajo \nNation alone is equal to the size of the State of West Virginia.\n  Mr. President, the environmental problems on Indian lands in the \nUnited States are serious, widespread, and complex:\n  There are at least 600 solid waste landfills on Indian lands that do \nnot meet Federal standards. Many of these sites are potentially \nhazardous.\n  Federal officials have testified before the Committee on Indian \nAffairs that of 108 sanitary landfills constructed by the Federal \nGovernment on Indian lands, no more than 2 are in compliance with EPA \nregulations.\n  The Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota has contaminated drinking \nwater from uranium mining and numerous unsanitary landfills.\n  Landfills located on the Devil's Lake Sioux Reservation in North \nDakota and the Oneida Reservation in Wisconsin have been described as \nbeing laced with arsenic, mercury, and other illegally dumped \nchemicals.\n  The Navajo Reservation in New Mexico, Arizona, and Utah has an \nestimated 1,000 sites polluted by old uranium mines or uranium waste. \nNavajo officials have testified that there are as many as 1,200 open \nsolid waste dumps on the reservation, some of which were built and used \nby Federal agencies.\n  Mercury pollution on Seminole land in Florida threatens fishing and \nthe gathering of food.\n  The worst spill of low-level radioactive waste in American history \noccurred 13 years ago at a uranium mine on the Navajo Reservation in \nNew Mexico.\n  I want to remind my colleagues that these environmental maladies are \nafflicting the very poorest communities in the United States. \nUnemployment in Indian country averages 50 percent and on some \nreservations exceeds 90 percent. More than 15 percent of Indian homes \nlack basic sanitation facilities--rate eight times worse than the rest \nof the United States. On the Navajo Reservation alone, more than 11,000 \nhomes lack running water and sewage disposal.\n  These disturbing facts have a definite cost in human\n   lives. According to the Indian Health Service, over half of the \ninfant deaths in Navajo country in 1989 occurred in homes without \nrunning water.\n\n  In monetary terms, the funds that are needed to address environmental \nproblems on reservations are enormous, and far beyond the scarce \nresources of most Indian tribes. The Indian Health Service has \nestimated that the unmet needs of tribes for health related water \nsystems, sewage treatment, and solid waste disposal are at least $700 \nmillion.\n  A 1989 EPA report found that since 1972, $48 billion in Federal funds \nhad been awarded to the States to construct wastewater treatment \nfacilities, but only $25 million had been made available to the Indian \ntribes by the States. The same EPA report estimated that the tribes \nwill need at least $470 million to comply with the wastewater treatment \nprovisions of the Clean Water Act.\n  Since 1986, the Congress has acted to ensure that Indian tribes are \neligible for treatment as States under the Clean Water Act, the Clean \nAir Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and Superfund. We have enacted \nthe Indian Environmental Regulatory Enhancement Act and the Indian \nEnvironmental General Assistance Act to authorize funding to assist \nIndian tribes in the development of environmental regulatory capacity. \nFunding from EPA to the tribes has steadily increased since the \nannouncement in 1984 of EPA's Indian policy. All of these steps were \nimportant, but the record clearly demonstrates that much more must be \ndone.\n  The bill we are introducing today constitutes another important step \nin the process of ensuring that Indian lands receive the full measure \nof environmental protection afforded to other areas of the United \nStates. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill and a summary of it be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 312\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Subsection (a) of this section provides that the \n     President shall appoint an Assistant Administrator for Indian \n     Lands in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The \n     appointee is subject to Senate confirmation and will be \n     compensated as a level V Executive branch employee.\n       Subsection (b) provides that the Assistant Administrator \n     for Indian Lands will coordinate all of the activities of EPA \n     with respect to Indian lands and federally recognized Indian \n     tribes, including the implementation of the 1984 Indian \n     Policy.\n       Subsection (c) is a conforming amendment to section 5316 of \n     title 5 of the United States Code.\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Chairman John \nMcCain of the Committee on Indian Affairs in introducing legislation \nwhich would provide for the creation of an assistant administrator for \nIndian Lands within the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  Mr. President, in 1984, the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] \nadopted an Indian policy. In the ensuing 10 years, major environmental \nstatutes have been amended to recognize the importance of tribal \ngovernments in the administration of environmental regulatory \nactivities on Indian lands. Its record of action makes clear that the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency is committed to achieving the goals of \nits Indian policy.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to commend the \nhead of the Environmental Protection Agency, Administrator Carol M. \nBrowner, for initiating efforts to improve communications with Indian \ntribal governments through the recent establishment of the new Indian \nEnvironmental Office in EPA.\n  However, although we have accomplished a great deal working together, \nit is also clear that our work is not complete.\n  This legislation will be a key to the continued successful \nimplementation on the Environmental Protection Agency's Indian policy \nby ensuring that the Agency develops a national infrastructure to \nprotect and ensure equitable treatment for Indian tribal governments \ncomparable to the treatment afforded the programs that are administered \nby the several States.\n  Mr. President, one of the obstacles to effective implementation of \nEPA's Indian policy has been the lack of involvement, including line \nauthority, in decisionmaking processes. The solution is to authorize \ncritical positions in the chain of command. The process of reviewing \nAgency actions for their consistency with EPA's Indian policy must be \ninstitutionalized; it must become second nature to all levels of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency organizational structure.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the creation of an assistant \nadministrator for \n[[Page S1953]] Indian lands would be an effective means of addressing \nthis problem.\n  The assistant administrator would have responsibility for ensuring \nthat the decisions and actions of the central or regional offices are \nconsistent with EPA's Indian policy in areas ranging from major policy \nand legislative initiatives to the most basic programming decisions.\n  This legislation will continue to move the Environmental Protection \nAgency in a direction that will enhance environmental quality on \nreservation lands and help build strong tribal governmental capacity \nfor the management of the environment in Indian country.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to give their careful \nconsideration to this legislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. EXON (for himself and Mr. Gorton):\n  S. 314. A bill to protect the public from the misuse of the \ntelecommunications network and telecommunications devices and \nfacilities; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                     the communications decency act\n\n Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation \nto expand the decency provisions of the Communications Act of 1934 to \nclearly cover the new technologies which are increasingly part of the \nAmerican way of life.\n  As a strong supporter of telecommunications reform, I am anxious to \npass legislation which will free the private sector to create the \ninformation superhighway. This exciting technology will put \nunprecedented information power into the hands of every citizen. The \nopportunities for education, culture, and entertainment are limitless.\n  Sadly, there is a dark side to the bright flicker of the computer \nscreen. The explosion of technology also threatens an explosion of \nmisuse. The legislation I introduce today, known as the Communications \nDecency Act, establishes legal protections against that misuse.\n  It modernizes the current law against telecommunications misuse in \nthe digital age.\n  This legislation will extend and strengthen the protections which \nexist against harassing, obscene, and indecent phone calls to cover all \nsuch uses of all telecommunications devices and increase the penalties \nfor misuse of the public switched network.\n  This much-needed legislation increases the penalties for obscene \ncable and radio broadcasts. The bill also insures that adult pay-per-\nview programs are fully scrambled, so that homes which do not subscribe \nto such services are not invaded by unwanted audio or video. The \nlegislation also prohibits the use of toll free 800 numbers from being \nused as a ruse to\n charge callers or telephone numbers for adult and other pay-per-call \nservices.\n\n  In addition, the legislation modernizes the protections against \nunauthorized eavesdropping on conversations, electronic or digital \ncommunications.\n  In addition, this legislation includes provisions Senator Gorton and \nI crafted last year to give cable operators the power to refuse to \ntransmit any public access or leased access program or portion of such \nprogram which includes obscenity, indecency, or nudity.\n  Mr. President, the information superhighway should not become a red \nlight district. This legislation will keep that from happening and \nextend the standards of decency which have protected telephone users to \nnew telecommunications devices.\n  Once passed, our children and families will be better protected from \nthose who would electronically cruise the digital world to engage \nchildren in inappropriate communications and introductions. The Decency \nAct will also clearly protect citizens from electronic stalking and \nprotect the sanctuary of the home from uninvited indecencies.\n  Mr. President, to illustrate the need for this legislation, I ask \nunanimous consent that a Washington Post article be included in the \nRecord. The article warns parents about the dangers of pedophiles who \nuse computers to lure children. It is a sad day in America when this \ntype of warning is necessary.\n  Mr. President, I urge all my colleagues to carefully study this \nimportant legislation. It was approved last year by the Senate Commerce \nCommittee as a part of the Communications Act of 1994.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                [From the Washington Post, Aug. 2, 1994]\n\n                     Molesting Children by Computer\n\n                           (By Sandy Rovner)\n\n       Those amazing computer games, bulletin boards and E-mail \n     services that bedazzle children and bewilder many parents may \n     not be as benign as they appear.\n       Some of them, in fact, may be prowled by real-life villains \n     every bit as evil as those in the fantasy games the \n     youngsters play on-line.\n       ``You can become very close to people very quickly when \n     you're on-line,'' says Dan Fisher, a Palm Bay, Fla., police \n     investigator and a member of the Law Enforcement Electronic \n     Technology Assistance Committee, part of a new effort to make \n     police as familiar with the computer world of virtual reality \n     as these savvy criminals. Law enforcement officials say that \n     children, often not realizing the danger, sometimes give out \n     their names, addresses and phone numbers to people they meet \n     over the computer network. This makes them vulnerable targets \n     for a number of illegal activities, including sexual abuse, \n     officials say.\n       For people who have computers with modems that allow them \n     to call outside the home and connect up with networks, there \n     are a number of online services, such as Prodigy, America on \n     Line and Compuserve, that offer a wide variety of options to \n     users. Included in these services are forums called bulletin \n     boards that allow users to talk electronically with other \n     users by posting public notes. These boards are divided into \n     special interests, such as arts, television, lifestyles, \n     seniors, health or teens. These permit individuals to contact \n     other computer users privately by sending electronic mail, \n     known as E-mail, through the Internet, the vast network of \n     computer connections throughout the world.\n       Although there are laws banning transmission of child porn \n     by computer, the FBI does not monitor bulletin boards, and, \n     in a special statement issued recently on computer bulletin \n     boards, it notes that it does not keep statistics on the \n     problem. Law enforcement efforts are complicated by the fact \n     that E-mail transmissions are ``regarded as having the same \n     privacy rights of surface mail,'' the FBI statement noted.\n       Frank Clark, a computer crime specialist in Fresno, Calif., \n     who helps teach other police departments about electronic \n     crimes, said there are about 25,000 private boards on the \n     Internet in the country. Yet, ``we found that virtually no \n     one was working those kinds of crimes at all,'' he said.\n       He travels throughout the United States and Canada giving \n     courses to law enforcement agencies on computer crimes. He \n     cites one episode at a meeting last month in Ottowa at which \n     he had a group of investigators sign on to a major computer \n     service with false identifications and pretend to be \n     children. ``Then I had them post a couple of innocuous \n     messages on teens' boards,'' he says. ``The next day we had \n     solicitations for nude pictures, phone sex and offers to meet \n     in person for sex.''\n       Myrna Blinn, an Idaho grandmother, has worked with child \n     abuse groups for years and is among a number of volunteers \n     who warn teenagers via computer bulletin boards not to give \n     away too much personal information to overly friendly \n     electronic mail pals.\n       She said she received an anguished E-mail letter from a 14-\n     year-old girl who had been corresponding on-line with someone \n     she thought was a teenage boy. She had given him her phone \n     number, but the boy turned out to be a 51-year-old man and he \n     began barraging her with indecent phone calls. She was afraid \n     to tell her family. Blinn and two of her friends confronted \n     the man electronically and turned over information about him \n     to police officials, who are investigating the case. They \n     have arranged for the girl to get counseling.\n       Clark believes the tide is beginning to turn as parents and \n     law enforcement officials are recognizing the possibility of \n     problems. Computer services are also beginning to monitor \n     their bulletin boards and helping police stop any unlawful \n     activities, he said.\n       Despite increasing concerns, parents are often stymied in \n     their efforts to monitor their kids because ``the children \n     are more computer-literate than the parents,'' Clark says. To \n     counter that, Clark and his colleagues have developed a \n     brochure they distribute at schools, churches and community \n     meetings. It recommends:\n       If possible, keep the computer in a common area of the \n     home. If a modem is being used, monitor times and numbers \n     dialed.\n       Know the warning signs of ``computer addiction'' to make \n     sure children aren't becoming obsessed with the computer \n     service. One clue is the storage of computer files ending in \n     GIF, JPG, BMP, TIF, PCX, DL and GL. ``These,'' the brochure \n     notes, ``are video or graphic image files and parents should \n     know what they illustrate.''\n       The brochure also offers ``Tips for Safe Computing'' for \n     teens and parents.\n       Never give out personal information, especially full names, \n     addresses or financial information, to anyone you meet on \n     computer bulletin boards.\n       Never respond to anyone who leaves you ``obnoxious, sexual \n     or menacing E-mail.''\n       [[Page S1954]] Never set up face-to-face meetings with \n     anyone you meet on a bulletin board.\n       The brochure also urges parents to notify police of ``all \n     attempts by adults to set up meetings with your children. \n     This is by far the most dangerous situation for children.''\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mrs. KASSEBAUM (for herself and Mr. Dole):\n  S. 322. A bill to amend the International Air Transportation \nCompetition Act of 1979; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n                the wright amendment repeal act of 1995\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, the distinguished Republican leader, \nSenator Dole, joins with me today in offering this bill to address an \ninjustice that has developed out of current law. The bill would repeal \na restriction in the International Air Transportation Competition Act \nof 1979 pertaining to air carrier service at Dallas' Love Field. There \nis now broad recognition of the anticompetitive situation that has \ndeveloped because of this section of law, and it is our intent to \nresolve the unfairness of this situation.\n  The restriction which this bill seeks to repeal was originally passed \nto protect the then-relatively new Dallas-Fort Worth International \nAirport [DFW] and ensure that commercial air carriers moved from Love \nField to the new airport. Today, DFW is the third busiest airport in \nthe country. The gates at DFW are full, and planes wait in long lines \nfor takeoff. It is clear that DFW has reached a point where it no \nlonger needs to be protected from competition.\n  Under current law, commercial air carriers are prohibited from \nproviding service between Dallas' Love Field and points located outside \nof Texas or its four surrounding States. This effectively limits travel \ninto and out of this airfield to destinations only in Texas, Louisiana, \nOklahoma, Arkansas, and New Mexico. Flights originating from any other \nState must fly into the Dallas-Fort Worth airport in order to have \naccess to the highly traveled Dallas area. This limitation on flights \ninto Love Field is arbitrary and, in many cases, forces passengers to \npay artificial and unreasonably high air fares. Moreover, the \nrestriction causes unnecessary delay and inconvenience for passengers \nattempting to fly into or out of Love Field from cities outside Texas \nand its four contiguous States.\n  The criteria the current law uses to restrict flights into Love \nField--that a flight must originate in Texas or one of its contiguous \nStates--are not based on any standard appropriate for the airline \nindustry. It is not based on the number of miles flown. It is not based \non the size of the city served. It is not based on the amount of noise \ngenerated by an aircraft. Instead, it is based on State boundaries that \nwere in place long before the Wright brothers began flying airplanes.\n  Today, planes are allowed to fly directly from Love Field to El Paso \nwhich is 576 miles from Dallas. Yet, direct flights are prohibited \nbetween Love Field and many cities which are much closer to Dallas, \nsuch as St. Louis, Kansas City, Memphis, Birmingham, and Wichita. This \nmakes no sense.\n  Mr. President, a great deal has been written recently about unwanted \nand unnecessary Government rules and regulations. People are frustrated \nby Government rules that are out of touch with reality, that lack \ncommon sense. I think the Wright amendment is a prime example of why so \nmany people have lost confidence in their Government.\n  In addition to being a law based on policial concerns rather than \npractical realities, the Wright amendment has distorted the free \nmarket. For a number of Americans, the restrictions on Love Field have \nforced them to pay more to travel to Dallas than their neighbors. \nAgain, this is regardless of the flight distance or the size of the \ncity served by the flight. The reason for this absurd situation is that \nthe one airline which serves Love Field is the low-cost carrier for the \nmarket, Southwest Airlines. In those cases where Southwest is allowed \nto compete with the major airlines for direct flights to Dallas, the \ncost of a ticket to Dallas is dramatically cheaper than when \nrestrictions prevent Southwest from offering competitive flights.\n  Another effect of the Love Field restrictions is that they work a \nterrible inconvenience for those travelers located outside of Texas and \nthe contiguous States who choose to take a nondirect flight to Dallas \non Southwest Airlines. Passengers in this situation are not allowed to \nbuy a round-trip ticket to Dallas on a flight which has a stop-over in \na city that meets the Love Field restrictions. Instead, these \npassengers must buy two round-trip tickets. One round-trip ticket to a \ncity in Texas or one of the contiguous States and another from that \ncity to Dallas. This requires the travelers not only to change planes \nin the connecting city but to collect their baggage and recheck it to \nDallas. The unnecessary inconvenience of having to collect and recheck \nbaggage can be especially difficult for the elderly, the disabled, or \nthose traveling with small children.\n  To allow this situation to continue would be to condone \nanticompetitive law and to encourage discrimination against many for \nthe benefit of a few. I believe it is essential to encourage \ncompetition within the transportation community in order to protect the \ninterests of the traveling public. The case with Love Field is no \ndifferent than that of all the other small airfields across the \ncountry, none of which is restricted based on their location. Love \nField has been subject to this unique statute for more than 15 years, \nand it big time to close this loophole.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, today I join my distinguished colleague from \nKansas, Senator Kassebaum, to introduce legislation to repeal the so-\ncalled Wright amendment. Senator Kassebaum and I have been working to \nrepeal this anti-competitive regulation which restricts commercial \nairline flights to and from Dallas Love Field. Make no doubt about it, \nthe time to act is now.\n  Last year's U.S. Supreme Court decision which let the Wright \namendment stand makes the legislation we are introducing all the more \nimportant. I stated at the time the decision was issued that I would \ncontinue to work to ground the Wright amendment and protect air \ntravelers from getting gouged and now the only relief for the traveling \npublic is through this legislation we are offering today.\n  The Wright amendment was originally introduced to protect the \nfledgling Dallas-Forth Worth [DWF] International airport. This airport \nis now one of the busiest airports in the Nation. Dallas is the top \ndestination for passengers flying from Wichita, and there is no reason \nthey should not have the option of flying into Love Field or Dallas-\nForth Worth airports. This regulation not only places restrictions on \npassengers from Kansas, but from 44 States across the Nation. In my \nview, the DWF airport no longer needs protection, and it is time to \nlift the restrictions on Love Field.\n  The restrictions placed on flights from Love Field 15 years ago deny \naffordable air transportation to citizens of my State and States \nthroughout a vast portion of our country which do not fall into the \nlimitations of the Wright amendment. The restrictions make it \nimpossible to fly directly into Love Field except for those flights \noriginating within Texas and States neighboring Texas. Not only is it \nimpossible to take a direct flight, but if you are flying into Love \nField, a passenger is required to purchase separate tickets, reclaim \nbaggage, and change planes in these neighboring States. Let's assume \nthis passenger is traveling from Wichita. At Oklahoma City, the \npassenger, having used the first ticket must change aircraft. And not \njust that, the passenger must take physical possession of all checked \nbaggage, haul the baggage back to the ticket counter and recheck the \nbaggage for the flight into Love Field.\n  A 1992 U.S. Department of Transportation study reported that these \nrestrictions cost air travelers $183 million a year in higher air \nfares. That's why Kansans have been demanding the repeal of the so-\ncalled Wright amendment--they're tired of higher air fares, reduced \ntravel options, and a distinct second-class status for Kansas air \ntravelers.\n  Not only are Kansans inconvenienced, but Texans as well. I have a \nletter from a Texan who has to fly to the connecting airport in another \nState to assist her mother in a wheelchair who must ``change planes, \nmeet her there, transfer her luggage, and recheck her onto another \nflight.'' I would like to \n[[Page S1955]] enter her letter of concern in the Record.\n  The Wright amendment is a burden for Kansas consumers and a barrier \nto economic development. It's high time we grounded the Wright \namendment.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                November 29, 1994.\n\n     Re: Wright amendment--its repeal.\n     Hon. Robert Dole.\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dole: I agree with you 100 percent--the Wright \n     Amendment restricting the use of Love Field in Dallas, Texas, \n     is wrong, wrong, wrong!\n       I believe the amendment needs to be challenged in terms of \n     the Americans Disability Act. It is my understanding that the \n     purpose of this act is to give better access to public places \n     to people with a disability. I feel this right is being \n     severely restricted by the Wright Amendment. It is almost \n     impossible for a person with a walker, wheelchair, crutches, \n     etc. to disembark from a Southwest flight, get to baggage \n     claim, pick up their luggage, and get rechecked at another \n     gate, without considerable inconvenience, pain, and \n     discomfort. Have you ever tried to carry luggage and \n     manipulate a wheelchair, crutches, or the like? This is \n     certainly not granting better access.\n       My mother is 82 years old and was faced with that very \n     problem. She is in a wheelchair and was unable to accomplish \n     all of the above. The fares were prohibitive for her to fly \n     with another airline. I had to fly to the airport where she \n     had to change planes, meet her there, transfer her luggage, \n     and recheck her onto another flight. It seems to me that the \n     Wright Amendment unfairly discriminates against the elderly \n     and people with a handicap.\n       I think on these grounds the Wright Amendment should be \n     challenged and eliminated. I would be more than happy to work \n     with you or any other group that is interested in pursuing \n     this course of action. Repeal of the Wright Amendment is \n     becoming a mission in my life.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Paulette B. Cooper.\n       Dallas, TX.\n\n       P.S. I noticed recently that Continental Airline is being \n     given access to several gates at Love Field. Will the Wright \n     Amendment affect them in the same ways that it affects \n     Southwest Airlines? If not, why not?\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mrs. KASSEBAUM.\n  S. 323. A bill to amend the Goals 2000: Educate America Act to \neliminate the National Education Standards and Improvement Council, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\nthe national education standards and improvement council repeal act of \n                                  1995\n\n Mrs. Kassebaum. Mr. President, I introduce legislation to \neliminate the National Education Standards and Improvement Council \n[NESIC]. NESIC was created by the Goals 2000: Education America Act \nsigned into law last year for the purpose of reviewing and certifying \nvoluntary national education standards.\n  The recent controversy over proposed standards in the field of \nhistory underscore the difficulties with any Federal involvement in the \nstandard-setting process. No matter how much one might emphasize the \nvoluntary nature of any standards, the perception remains that the \nFederal Government is prescribing a uniform curriculum for our Nation's \nstudents.\n  Writing recently about the history standards, University of Chicago \nhistory professor Hanna Holborn Gray observed:\n\n       The trouble with the ``national standards'' is not that \n     they are far-out, or radically revisionist, or aimed at \n     brainwashing the impressionable young. * * * No, the real \n     trouble with the national standards, is that they exist at \n     all--or exist under that title and under quasi-official \n     auspices and with some kind of ``certification'' in the \n     offing.\n\n  As one who believes strongly that the strength of our education \nsystem lies in its local base and community commitment, I do not \nbelieve it is appropriate to expand Federal involvement into areas \ntraditionally handled by States and localities. For this reason, I was \ntroubled when we first started down the path of providing Federal \nfunding for the development of national standards--an action which \npredated the enactment of the Goals 2000 legislation.\n  One reason I opposed the Goals 2000 legislation is that it took \nFederal activities in this area yet another step further by including \nan authorization for a national council--NESIC--to review and certify \nthe national standards. The existence of such a council only serves to \nsow further confusion regarding whether the standards are truly \nvoluntary.\n  As has been repeatedly emphasized in various congressional debates on \nthis subject, there is no Federal law which requires that these \nstandards be adopted or used by any State or school district. Although \nstandards in various subject areas have been developed with the support \nof Federal funds, they have been designed by professionals in the \nfield, not by Federal employees as some may think. However, there is \nstill great confusion and serious concern by the public about the \nnature of the Government's involvement in this whole endeavor.\n  I believe it is time to clear up some of this public confusion and \nconcern. My bill will help do that by getting the Federal Government \nout of the loop in an area which I believe is best handled by States \nand localities. Most of our States are already developing standards \nwith the input of their own teachers and parents. Those States clearly \ndo not need to have a Federal seal of approval to validate their \nefforts.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of my bill and a summary of its \nprovisions be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 323\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \nexclude from the definition of employee firefighters and rescue squad \nworkers who perform volunteer services and to prevent employers from \nrequiring employees who are firefighters or rescue squad workers to \nperform volunteer services, and to allow an employer not to pay \novertime compensation to a firefighter or rescue squad worker who \nperforms volunteer services for the employer, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n         the volunteer firefighter and rescue squad worker act\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. This is a \ncompanion measure to legislation, H.R. 94, introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives by Virginia Congressman Herb Bateman.\n  My bill may be referred to as the Volunteer Firefighter and Rescue \nSquad Worker Act of 1994.\n  The purpose of the Volunteer Firefighter and Rescue Squad Worker Act \nis to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to exclude from the \ndefinition of ``employee'' firefighters and rescue squad workers who \nperform volunteer services. In addition, it will prevent employers from \nrequiring employees who are firefighters or rescue squad workers to \nperform volunteer services, and will allow an employer not to pay \novertime compensation to a firefighter or rescue squad worker who \nperforms volunteer services.\n  The need for this legislation stems from a 1993 U.S. Department of \nLabor ruling which found that a career firefighter cannot serve as a \nvolunteer firefighter within the same county as\n they are employed. This ruling is commonly referred to as the \nMontgomery County, Maryland decision.\n\n  The Department of Labor's interpretation of the Fair Labor Standards \nAct in the Montgomery decision has promoted a great deal of concern \nfrom volunteer fire and rescue groups across the Nation, including \nVirginia. The decision was made to prevent counties--employers--from \ncoercing career firefighters to work overtime without overtime \ncompensation.\n  While protection from coercion is a worthy and necessary element of \nthe Fair Labor Standards Act, the administrative decision offers a \npresumption of guilt on the part of law-abiding counties. In addition, \nit precludes men and women who wish to volunteer their services within \ntheir own community from doing so, if they reside in the same community \nas they are employed. \n[[Page S1957]] Finally, it represents yet another unfunded Federal \nmandate and an intrusion on the rights of citizens to decide for \nthemselves what services local government should provide.\n  Historically, volunteer fire and rescue services have played an \nimportant role in our communities. These men and women are private \ncitizens who selflessly answer the call to duty, day and night, to \nprotect the lives and property of others.\n  In many parts of Virginia today, indeed in many parts of the Nation \nstill, the difference between life and death in the ``golden hour'' is \nthe initial emergency medical services provided by volunteer rescue \nworkers. Many localities are a good 45 minutes to an hour away from the \nnearest hospital and the aid administered by volunteers is critical to \nthe survival of victims.\n  The volunteer fire departments and rescue squads provide fire and \nemergency medical services [EMS] for 82 percent of all fire and EMS \nservices in Virginia. Of the 602 fire departments in the Commonwealth \nof Virginia, 67 are combined career and volunteer departments and 535 \nare strictly volunteer departments. These statistics only begin to tell \nabout the important role that the 20,000 volunteer firefighters in \nVirginia play in our daily lives.\n  Mr. President, the intent of my legislation is quite simply to help \nto preserve the spirit of volunteerism in our communities and to assist \nour volunteer fire and rescue workers in their mission to provide vital \nlifesaving and property protection services.\n  Many of our valiant career firefighters come from the ranks of the \nvolunteers and received their initial training from those departments. \nIn turn, many career firefighters have volunteered their service and \nexpertise to the volunteer departments. I believe that my legislation \nwill help to preserve this unique relationship.\n  For the benefit of my colleagues, I would briefly like to outline \nwhat my legislation would do.\n  Section one simply cites the legislation as the Volunteer Firefighter \nand Rescue Squad Worker Act.\n  Section two would exempt career firefighters and rescue squad workers \nwho volunteer their off-duty services at locations--fire companies--\nwhere they are not employed during the course of normal duty hours from \nthe Fair Labor Standards overtime provisions.\n  Section three would allow career firefighters and rescue squad \nworkers to waive their claim to overtime compensation.\n  Section four would prohibit employers from directly or indirectly \nrequiring firefighters or rescue squad workers to volunteer their \nservices during any period in which they would otherwise be entitled to \nreceive overtime compensation.\n  Mr. President, I urge my fellow Senators, particularly members of the \nCongressional Fire Caucus, to join me in support of this important \nmeasure.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. THOMAS:\n  S. 325. A bill to make certain technical corrections in laws relating \nto native Americans, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian \nAffairs.\n\n\n                       indian statute amendments\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today as a member of the Committee \non Indian Affairs--and a former ranking member of the House \nSubcommittee on Native American Affairs--to introduce legislation to \nmake certain technical amendments to laws relating to native Americans.\n  Congress typically considers legislation like this once or twice a \nyear. It affords us the opportunity to address a series of technical \ncorrections or minor amendments to Indian bills in one fell swoop, \nwithout having to introduce several separate bills.\n  Sections 1 and 2 deal with two bills that were passed last year which \nextended Federal recognition to three Indian groups in Michigan: the \nPokagon Band of Potawatomi, and the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa \nIndians, and the Little River Band of Ottawa Indians. The bills, passed \nin September, failed to include a usual provision requiring the newly \nrecognized groups to submit membership rolls to the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs. These rolls are important because they allow the BIA to know \nexactly who is a member of the band and thus entitled to Federal \nbenefits available to members of recognized tribes.\n  To correct this oversight, in October--as part of another technical \ncorrections bill--we amended both the September bills to include the \nmembership roll requirements. Unfortunately, in the crush of \nlegislation of the final days of the session, the two amendments were \ntransposed. The Pokagon bill, which deals with only one band, was \namended in the plural; concomitantly, the Odawa/Ottawa bill, which \ndeals with several bands, had an amendment worded in the singular. This \nbill would simply retranspose the October amendments.\n  Section 3 of the bill repeals the Trading With the Indians Act. \nEnacted in the early 1800's, the act prohibits Federal employees from \ntrading with Indians. At the time, the act was seen as a way to protect \nthe unsophisticated tribes from unscrupulous War Department employees \nwho might have used their positions over the tribes to enter into \nbusiness deals with them on terms less than advantageous to the \nIndians.\n  Today, though, the act has become both an anachronism and a nuisance. \nNot only are the tribes no longer in need of the paternalistic \nprotections the act affords; but it makes criminal such simple everyday \nacts as the sale of a used car by the wife of a BIA employee to an \nIndian neighbor. Both the Department of Justice and the Department of \nthe Interior agree that the act is unnecessary, and should be repealed. \nMy good friends Senators McCain and Kyl worked diligently on this issue \nin the last Congress, but time constraints prevented its passage by \nboth Houses before adjournment sine die.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working closely with my chairman, \nSenator McCain, in securing swift passage of this legislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HATFIELD (for himself, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Feingold, Mr. \n        Bumpers, and Mr. Harkin):\n  S. 326. A bill to prohibit U.S. military assistance and arms \ntransfers to foreign governments that are undemocratic, do not \nadequately protect human rights, are engaged in acts of armed \naggression, or are not fully participating in the U.N. Registrar of \nConventional Arms; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n                   code of conduct on arms transfers\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, a little more than a year ago I \nwas approached by citizens who share my concern about conventional \nweapons transfers. They told me of an international effort to curb the \narms trade by limiting transfers only to nations which adhere to \nprinciples of human rights, democracy, and peace. This initiative, \ncalled the Code of Conduct, appeared to be a common-sense approach to \ndecisions regarding weapons transfers and I agreed to introduce it as \nlegislation in the Senate.\n  Last year on this day Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney and I held a \npress conference to announce our intent to push the Code of Conduct \nthrough Congress. Both of us have spent a great deal of time over these \npast months promoting the bill and contributing to the public's \neducation about the glut of conventional weapons. It is with great \npleasure that I reintroduce this bill today and that I am again joined \nby Representative McKinney, who is introducing its companion in the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  The legislation alters U.S. arms transfer policy by significantly \nincreasing the conditions upon which a nation may receive U.S.-built \nweapons. By stating as a basic requirement that U.S. arms should not go \nto nations which have poor human rights records, are undemocratic or \nare engaged in illegal acts of war, our policy allows arms transfers \nonly to nations which are unlikely to emerge as security threats to \ntheir neighbors or to the United States themselves.\n  I have spoken to groups around the country about this bill and the \nresponse has been very strong. Americans agree that no arms should go \nto dictators. Many citizens are beginning to question why millions of \ntheir tax dollars are going to subsidize weapons manufacturers who seek \nto export fighter jets, tanks, and other armaments. And many \nindividuals have shared with me their concern that we will have repeats \nof Panama, Somalia, Iraq, and Haiti, where United States \n[[Page S1958]] troops faced weapons either paid for or provided by our \nown Government.\n  Despite the fact that the safety of our troops has been threatened by \narms exports, the administration seems intent upon broadening the \njustification for arms sales approval to also include considerations of \nU.S. economic interests. In other words, the administration wants to \nallow jobs to dictate whether or not lethal weaponry should go to \nnations, many of which have poor human rights records and are not \ndemocratic.\n  The escalating global arsenal must be reduced and nonproliferation \nmust start with the United States. I believe that the only hope for \nfundamental change in policy is Congress and I will ask the Senate to \nvote on the Code of Conduct this year because I believe it is time for \nCongress to assume a greater responsibility for our arms export \npolicies. I hope that my colleagues will take time to review this \nproposal, join me as a cosponsor and support this bill when it comes to \nthe floor.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Exon, Mr. Lieberman, \n        Mr. Grassley, Mr. Johnston, and Mr. Kerrey):\n  S. 327. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nclarification for the deductibility of expenses incurred by a taxpayer \nin connection with the business use of the home; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                       home office deduction act\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the Home \nOffice Deduction Act of 1995. I am joined today by my friends and \ncolleagues, Senators Baucus, Exon, Lieberman, Grassley, Johnston, and \nSenator Kerrey of Nebraska. This bill will clarify the definition of \nwhat a ``principal place of business'' is for purposes of section 280A \nof the Internal Revenue Code, which allows a deduction for an office in \nthe home. An identical bill has been introduced by Representative Bill \nArcher in the House as part of H.R. 9.\n  Last year, we introduced similar legislation that had 15 bipartisan \ncosponsors in the Senate. Also, the companion bill in the House, \nintroduced last year by Representative Peter Hoagland, had the \nbipartisan support of 88 cosponsors.\n  This bill is designed to reverse the 1993 Supreme Court decision in \nCommissioner versus Soliman. When this decision was handed down, it \neffectively closed the door to legitimate home-office deductions for \nhundreds of thousands of taxpayers. Moreover, the decision unfairly \npenalizes many small businesses simply because they operate from a home \nrather than from a store front, office building, or industrial park.\n  Mr. President, until the Soliman decision, small business owners and \nprofessionals who dedicate a space in their homes to use for business \nactivities were generally allowed to deduct the expenses of the home \noffice if they met the following conditions: First, the space in the \nhome was used solely and exclusively on a regular basis as an office; \nand second, the deduction claimed was not greater than the income \nearned by the business. Through the Soliman case, the Supreme Court has \nnarrowed significantly the availability of this deduction by requiring \nthat the home office be the principal business location of the \ntaxpayer. This requirement that the home office be the principal \nbusiness location has proven to be impossible to meet for many \ntaxpayers with legitimate home-office expenses.\n  For example, under the Soliman decision, a self-employed plumber who \ngenerates business income by performing services in the homes of his \ncustomers would be denied a deduction for a home office. This is \nbecause, under the rules, his home office is not considered his \nprincipal place of business because the business income is generated in \nthe homes of the customers and not in his home office. This is the case \neven though the home office is where he receives telephone messages, \nkeeps his business records, plans his advertising, stores his tools and \nsupplies, and fills out Federal tax forms. In fact, having a full-time \nemployee in the office who keeps the books and sets up appointments \nwould still not result in a home-office deduction for the plumber. This \nis preposterous, Mr. President, and we need to correct it. My bill \nwould rectify this result by allowing the home office to qualify as the \nprincipal place of business if the essential administrative or \nmanagement activities of the business are performed there.\n  The truly ironic effect of the Supreme Court's decision is that a \ntaxpayer who rents office space outside the home is allowed a full \ndeduction, but one who tries to economize by working at home is \npenalized. This makes no sense to me.\n  The Home Office Deduction Act of 1995 is designed to restore the \ndeduction for home-office expenses to pre-Soliman law. Rather than \nrequiring taxpayers to meet the new criteria set out by the Court, the \nbill allows a home office to meet the definition of a ``principal place \nof business'' if it is the location where the essential administrative \nor management activities are conducted on a regular and systematic \nbasis by the taxpayer. To avoid possible abuses, the bill requires that \nthe taxpayer have no other location for the performance of these \nessential administrative or management activities.\n  Mr. President, today's job market is rapidly changing. New \ntechnologies have been developed and continually improved that allow \ninstant communication around the once expansive globe. There is even \ntalk of virtual offices, which are equipped only with a telephone and a \nhookup for a portable computer. These mobile communications have \nrevolutionized the definition of the traditional office. No longer is \nthere a need to establish a business downtown. Employees are \ntelecommunicating by facsimile, modem, and telephone. Today, both a \nhusband and wife could work without leaving their home and the \nattention of their children. In this new age, redefining the deduction \nfor home-office expenses is vital. Our tax policy should not \ndiscriminate against home businesses simply because a taxpayer makes \nthe choice, often based on economic or family considerations, to \noperate out of the home.\n  In most cases, startup businesses are very short on cash. Yet, for \nmany, ultimate success depends on the ability to hold out for just a \nfew more months. In these situations, even a relatively small tax \ndeduction for the expenses of the home office can make a critical \ndifference. It is important to note that some of America's fastest \ngrowing and most dynamic companies originated in the spare bedroom or \nthe garage of the founder. Our tax policies should support those who \ndare to take risks. Many of tomorrow's jobs will come from \nentrepreneurs who are struggling to survive in a home-based business.\n  Mr. President, the home-office deduction is targeted at these small \nbusiness men and women, entrepreneurs, and independent contractors who \nhave no other place besides the home to perform the essential \nadministrative or management activities of the business. The Soliman \ndecision drastically reduced the effectiveness and fairness of this \ndeduction and must be reversed.\n  This legislation can also have an important effect on rural areas, \nsuch as in my home State of Utah. Many small business owners and \nprofessionals in rural areas must spend a great deal of time on the \nroad, meeting clients, customers, or patients. It is likely that many \nof my rural constituents will be unable to meet the requirements for \nthe home-office deduction under the Soliman decision. Mr. President, we \nmust help these taxpayers, not hurt them, in their efforts to \ncontribute to the economy and support their families.\n  The Home Office Deduction Act of 1995 not only has strong bipartisan \nsupport in the Congress, but also has the support of the following \norganizations: The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, \nthe National Federation of Independent Businesses, the Family Research \nCouncil, the Small Business Legislative Council, the National \nAssociation of the Self-Employed, the National Association of the \nRemodeling Industry, the National Association of Small Business \nInvestment Cos., the Direct Selling Association, the Promotional \nProducts Association International, the Illinois Women's Economic \nDevelopment Summit, the Alliance of Independent Store Owners and \nProfessionals, the American Veterinary Medical Association, the Bureau \nof Wholesale Sales Representatives, the National Association of Home \nBuilders, the International Home \n[[Page S1959]] Furnishings Representatives Association, the National \nAssociation of Women Business Owners, Communicating for Agriculture, \nand the National Society of Public Accountants.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join us as a cosponsor of this \nimportant legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 327\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in \n     Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

CLARIFICATION OF DEFINITION OF PRINCIPAL PLACE OF \n                   BUSINESS.\n\n       Subsection (f) of section 280A of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 is amended by redesignating paragraphs (2), (3), and \n     (4) as paragraphs (3), (4), and (5), respectively, and by \n     inserting after paragraph (1) the following new paragraph:\n       ``(2) Principal place of business.--For purposes of \n     subsection (c), a home office shall in any case qualify as \n     the principal place of business if--\n       ``(A) the office is the location where the taxpayer's \n     essential administrative or management activities are \n     conducted on a regular and systematic (and not incidental) \n     basis by the taxpayer, and\n       ``(B) the office is necessary because the taxpayer has no \n     other location for the performance of the essential \n     administrative or management activities of the business.''\n\n     SEC. 3.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The amendments made by this Act shall apply to taxable \n     years beginning after December 31, 1991.\n\n Mr. LIERBERMAN, Mr. President, I am delighted to join in the \nintroduction of this important bill to restore the home-office \ndeduction. As an original cosponsor of this bill in the last Congress, \nI hope that we will succeed in passing this bill in the 104th Congress.\n  After being turned down by two tax courts, the IRS succeeded in \nnarrowing the definition of the home-office deduction by taking their \ncase to the Supreme Court. In essence, the early 1993 decision narrowed \nthe home-office deduction test to businesses where income is generated \nin the home and to businesses where customers come to the home.\n  These new tests are flawed. They disallow the deduction for a whole \nhost of legitimate home businesses. Take plumbers or house painters. \nBoth plumbers and painters may run virtually all aspects of their \nbusinesses from the home but in the end they must travel to the \ncustomer. A plumber simply cannot insist that a bathtub be brought to \nthe office. There is a clear and compelling reason for a house painter \nto make house calls.\n  Mr. President, this issue is of particular importance to my home \nState of Connecticut where laid-off workers are using severance \npackages to start businesses out of their homes, where underemployed \nworkers are making ends meet through part-time home businesses. There \nare people I think of as forced entrepreneurs. They are people who have \nstruck out on their own in such numbers that they appear to be showing \nup in labor statistics in my region of the country. To quote an October \n1993 report by the New England Economic Project:\n\n       Households have been reporting more buoyant employment \n     conditions than establishments have. The number of New \n     Englanders now indicating they are working is 2 percent \n     higher than a year earlier. This upturn appears to reflect a \n     rise in self-employment and the emergence of small young \n     businesses that are not yet tabulated in the establishment \n     survey. In other words, people may be adjusting to shrinking \n     job opportunities at the region's traditional employers by \n     becoming entrepreneurs.\n\n  Mr. President, these rules take us in the wrong direction. They \nignore the trend toward home-based businesses by those who have lost \ntraditional office jobs, they ignore those who are working second jobs \nto make ends meet, and they ignore those parents who choose to stay at \nhome with the children while still earning a much-needed income.\n  In the past, there have undoubtedly been abuses of this deduction. I \nbelieve there has been cause to tighten these rules. But the solution \nto these abuses has clearly not been found. To exclude whole sectors of \nlegitimate home-office businesses is hardly the answer to the problem \nof abuse of this deduction. I should also point out that in this \neconomy, the last thing we should be doing is hurting legitimate \nbusinesses.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me as a sponsor of this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 330. A bill to amend the Agricultural Act of 1949 to require \nproducers of an agricultural commodity for which an acreage limitation \nprogram is in effect to pay certain costs as a conditions of \nagricultural loans, purchases, and payment, and for other purposes.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 329. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to submit a \nplan to Congress to achieve full and fair payment for Bureau of \nReclamation water used for agricultural purposes, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                       water subsidy legislation\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, yesterday all Senate offices \nreceived a copy of a new report entitled ``Green Scissors,'' written by \nFriends of the Earth and the National Taxpayers Union and supported by \n23 other environmental and consumer groups. The premise of the report \nis that there are a number of subsidies and projects, totalling $33 \nbillion in all, that could be cut to both reduce the deficit and \nbenefit the environment. This report coalesces what I and many others \nin the Senate have long known, we must be diligent in eliminating \npractices that can no longer be justified in light of our enormous \nannual deficit and national debt.\n  I am pleased today to reintroduce two related pieces of legislation \nthat I introduced in the 103d Congress aimed at reducing water \nsubsidies that cost the Federal taxpayers millions of dollars each \nyear. This legislation was profiled in the ``Green Scissors'' report, \nand the high cost of these subsidies was highlighted in yesterday's \nWashington Post, New York Times, and USA Today. These are part of a \nseries of subsidy reducing measures that I will propose in the 104th \nCongress. The first bill, amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to \nrequire agricultural producers that grow a crop for which an acreage \nlimitation program is in effect to pay the full cost of water provided \nby the Federal Government. The second bill requires the Secretary of \nthe Interior to submit a plan to Congress to continue these savings by \nhighlighting ways to eliminate water subsidies for agricultural \nproducers growing crops that do not fall under the commodity program.\n  Mr. President, the first bill eliminates multiple subsidies codified \nin our Federal law which provides dual payments to agricultural \nproducers--one as a direct payment to limit production of certain \nsurplus crops and the other as a discount, undercharging for federally \nsubsidized water to produce these crops. Its premise is simple. If an \nagricultural producer is receiving Federal payments under a Federal \nacreage limitation program--payments designed to discourage production \nof a particular crop--that producer is not eligible to receive below-\ncost water from the Federal Government to produce the crop which the \nFederal Government is paying the producer not to grow. In other words, \nthe Federal taxpayers should not be asked on the one hand to provide \npayments to discourage production of a crop while at the same time \npaying for the delivery of below-cost water for that same crop.\n  It has been estimated that the cost of providing below-cost water to \nagriculture producers in the acreage limitation program costs the \nFederal Government between $66 and $830 million each year. The \nDepartment of Agriculture pays farmers approximately $500 million not \nto grow these same crops. Mr. President, these double payments cannot \ncontinue. Elimination of western water subsidies, and a wide range of \nreclamation subsidies, should be pursued as legitimate deficit \nreduction opportunities. It is clear that the conflicting policies of \nthe Federal Government in this area are examples of Federal waste and \nabuse.\n  [[Page S1960]] The second bill, Mr. President, creates an \ninstitutional obligation to review agricultural water subsidy \npractices, and provides Congress with important information necessary \nto proceeding along a path of reducing burdens on the Federal budget. I \nam proud to be joined by my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Kohl, \nintroducing this measure. The Bureau of Reclamation will be required to \ndevelop a plan for charging accurate water prices no later than \nSeptember 1995 and to report that plan to Congress. At that time I will \nask my colleagues to think aggressively about new legislative changes \nthat may be needed to bring market prices to irrigation water provided \nby the Federal Government.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I am pleased that these bills will be \namong the first of major efforts by this Senate to seek opportunities \nto reduce the deficit by reforming subsidy practices. I will continue \nto remain committed to that goal. I ask unanimous consent that the text \nof the bills be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 329\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor the rollover of gain from the sale of farm assets into an \nindividual retirement account; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                   family farm retirement equity act\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Family \nFarm Retirement Equity Act of 1995, a bill to help improve the security \nof our Nation's retired farmers.\n  As we begin the 104th Congress, we can anticipate legislative action \ndealing with the tax treatment of retirement savings. President Clinton \nhas laid out his proposals for changes in tax rules on savings, and the \nRepublicans have made their proposed changes to the individual \nretirement account rules, as well; 1995 will also be the year that \nCongress reauthorizes the farm bill. This heightened attention to both \nretirement taxation issues and farm income issues affords this Congress \nthe perfect opportunity to address an issue of great importance to \nrural America: farmer retirement.\n  Farming is a highly capital-intensive business. To the extent that \nthe average farmer reaps any profits from his or her farming operation, \nmuch of that income is directly reinvested into the farm. Rarely are \nthere opportunities for farmers to put money aside in individual \nretirement accounts. Instead, farmers tend to rely on the sale of their \naccumulated capital assets, such as real estate, livestock, and \nmachinery, in order to provide the income to sustain them during \nretirement. All too often, farmers are finding that the lump-sum \npayments of capital gains taxes levied on those assets leave little for \nretirement. It is with that problem in mind that I am introducing the \nFamily Farm Retirement Equity Act.\n  This legislation would provide retiring farmers the opportunity to \nrollover the proceeds from the sale of their farms into a tax-deferred \nretirement account. Instead of paying a large lump-sum capital gains \ntax at the point of sale, the income from the sale of a farm would be \ntaxed only as it is withdrawn from the retirement account. Such a \nchange in method of taxation would help prevent the financial distress \nthat many farmers now face upon retirement.\n  Another concern that I have about rural America is the diminishing \ninterest of our younger rural citizens in continuing in farming. \nBecause this legislation will facilitate the transition of our older \nfarmers into a successful retirement, the Family Farm Retirement Equity \nAct will also pave the way for a more graceful transition of our \nyounger farmers toward farm ownership. While low prices and low profits \nin farming will continue to take their toll on our younger farmers, I \nbelieve that this will be one tool we can use to make farming more \nviable for the next generation.\n  This proposal is supported by farmers throughout the country, and I \nam proud to introduce this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be included in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 331\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 75\n\n       Whereas January 30, 1995, is the 113th anniversary of the \n     birth of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in Hyde Park, \n     New York;\n       Whereas almost a half-century after the death of President \n     Roosevelt, his legacy remains central to the public life of \n     the Nation;\n       Whereas before becoming President of the United States, \n     Franklin Delano Roosevelt served in the New York State Senate \n     and later was appointed Assistant Secretary of the Navy, and \n     in 1928 became Governor of New York;\n       Whereas as President of the United States between 1933 and \n     1945, Franklin Delano Roosevelt guided the Nation through 2 \n     of the greatest crises of the twentieth century, the Great \n     Depression and the Second World War, and in so doing, changed \n     the course of American politics;\n       Whereas a memorial in stone in the District of Columbia \n     will soon be dedicated to his memory, as authorized by \n     Congress in 1955; and\n       Whereas a month commemorating the history of Franklin \n     Delano Roosevelt would complement the dedication of the \n     memorial: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That October, 1996, should be designated \n     ``Roosevelt History Month''. The President is requested to \n     issue a proclamation calling on the people of the United \n     States to observe the month with appropriate ceremonies and \n     activities.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to submit a resolution \ndesignating October 1996 as ``Roosevelt History Month,'' to coincide \nwith the dedication of the new Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial now \nbeing built in the District of Columbia. A national history month \ncelebrating the achievements of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt is an \nappropriate and necessary complement to the new memorial.\n  Franklin Delano Roosevelt was born on January 30, 1882, in Hyde Park, \nNY, and entered politics in 1910 with his election to the New York \nState Senate. Later, he was appointed Assistant Secretary of the Navy \nand then sought and lost a bid for a seat in the U.S. Senate. Despite a \ndebilitating attack of polio, he went on to become Governor of New York \nin 1928, establishing New York's first program of unemployment relief.\n  As President of the United States from 1933 to 1945, Franklin Delano \nRoosevelt guided this Nation through two of the gravest crises of the \n20th century, the Great Depression and the Second World War. In so \ndoing, he defined our national stature and secured his place as one of \nthe greatest American Presidents of the 20th century.\n  It is therefore fitting that our country honor his efforts, and those \nof his wife, with a celebration of Roosevelt History Month. Citizens \nand\n organizations across the Nation may observe the month with appropriate \nceremonies and activities to learn about a President and a generation \nwho gave much to the Nation. Soon, a new granite memorial will be \ndedicated to President Roosevelt. I rise today and urge my colleagues \nto join me in dedicating a month to his legacy, a memorial of thought \nand history to complement the one of stone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/01/senate-section/article/S1962-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 76--RELATIVE TO THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ETHICS\n\n  Mr. HELMS submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Rules and Administration:\n\n                               S.

Ms. Duke has also directed countywide \ncantatas that encompassed a group of singers from all denominations.\n  Ms. Duke has been actively involved in many civic organizations. She \nis a member of the Historical Society of both Butler and Ohio Counties. \nShe was involved in the Women's Civic League. She has contributed her \nenergy and talents to many other organizations and projects in which \nshe volunteered tirelessly.\n  Mr. President, Ms. Duke's church and community should be very pleased \nto have such an outstanding member. Her community owes her a debt of \ngratitude and I feel that she deserves much recognition for her \naccomplishments and contributions.

Mr. President, Everett McKinley Dirksen of Pekin, \nIL, who served this body so well as the Republican leader of the U.S. \nSenate, was one of the most capable political figures of his time and \nof the modern era.\n  Historians generally acknowledge, for instance, that without Everett \nDirksen's backing, such landmark legislation as the 1964 Civil Rights \nAct almost certainly would not have passed.\n  Thomas McArdle, offers an insightful profile of Everett Dirksen in a \nrecent article published by Investor's Business Daily.\n  Mr. President, I call the attention of my colleagues to this article \nand ask that it be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n     Sen. Everett Dirksen: He Epitomized the Notion of ``Pragmatic \n                             Conservatism''\n\n                          (By Thomas McArdle)\n\n       Today, the country's most influential Republican leader, \n     Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., proclaims that he \n     will cooperate with President Clinton, but is unwilling to \n     compromise.\n       What a contrast to the late Senate Republican Leader \n     Everett McKinley Dirksen, who was fond of replying to \n     detractors who accused him of not standing for very much, \n     ``If there were no compromise, there might not have been a \n     Constitution of the United States.''\n       Dirksen is remembered as a honeytoned orator who could \n     endear himself even to a hostile audience. His baggyclothes \n     and unkept hair were legendary, but it was a rumpled, folksy \n     image he deliberately cultivated.\n       Moreover, he was far from being just the colorful, lovable \n     clown political cartoonists loved to peg him as. He may have \n     been the senator who delivered an annual speech in praise of \n     the marigold, but there was substance underneath of \n     idiosyncracies.\n       Dirksen was both in 1896 in Pekin, Ill., part of Rep. \n     Abraham Lincoln's congressional district in the 1840s. As a \n     boy, Dirksen knew some old-timers in the town who actually \n     knew Lincoln personally. His sentimentality towards Lincoln \n     would pervade his speeches and statements all of Dirksen's \n     career.\n       His parents were immigrants from Ostfriesland in northern \n     Germany. His father, like many of his fellow German-immigrant \n     and native-born neighbors in Pekin, had an unquestioning \n     loyalty to the Republican Party unheard of today. Dirksen's \n     middle name came from then-Ohio Governor William McKinley, \n     soon to become the next Republican president. His twin \n     brother was named after the sitting GOP speaker of the House \n     and his older brother after the last Republic president, \n     Benjamin Harrison.\n       When he was five, Dirksen's father suffered a debilitating \n     stroke and the young sons were forced to work hard on the \n     family's small farm. Rising before dawn each workday was a \n     habit Dirksen would maintain all his life.\n       He displayed extraordinary political acumen early on, \n     gaining his first term in the House of Representatives by \n     beating a multimillionaire, five-term GOP incumbent in the \n     party primary. He then handily defeated the Democratic \n     challenger--in 1932, the year voters were so mad at \n     Republicans for the Great Depression that Franklin Roosevelt \n     won the presidency in a landslide and a national realignment \n     in favor of the Democratic Party began. Dirksen won the \n     district by almost as great a margin as Roosevelt.\n       [[Page S1964]] Republican leaders were wary of him even \n     this early. He had run a campaign aimed at garnering the \n     votes of those who would be supporting FDR, and even praised \n     Democratic candidates for other offices.\n       It was a pragmatism that would characterize Dirksen \n     throughout his career. On his death in 1969, conservative \n     columnist William F. Buckley, Jr., then much more a firebrand \n     than today, would assess the senator in an otherwise glowing \n     obituary as ``so much the pragmatist that you couldn't really \n     count on him in a pinch.''\n       The Chicago Sun-Times once estimated that in his 17 years \n     in the House of Representatives, Dirksen changed his mind 62 \n     times on foreign policy, 31 times on military affairs, and 70 \n     times on agriculture issues. Then, in the Senate he outdid \n     that record.\n       His most famous about-faces were on the nuclear test-ban \n     treaty and the Civil Rights Act. In the summer of 1963 he \n     opposed the enactment of federal guarantees of the right of \n     blacks to use any hotel, restaurant or other public \n     accommodation on property rights grounds, the core of the \n     proposal by President Kennedy, though he supported its other \n     provisions.\n       The next year, with Johnson having replaced the \n     assassinated JFK, some savvy maneuvering by Democrats for \n     Republican support in the House forced Dirksen in the Senate \n     to soften. He ended up becoming instrumental in passage of \n     the Civil Rights Act, using his party to provide the margin \n     of victory.\n       Sen. Richard Russell, D-Ga., ``says the Attorney General \n     (Bobby Kennedy) has nailed my skin to the barn door to dry,'' \n     Dirksen told a reporter in typical Dirksenesque language. \n     ``Well, nobody has hung up my conscience and my sense of \n     history to dry. Pardon me for the sermon.''\n       Dirksen also immediately opposed upon hearing about it the \n     administration's treaty with the Soviet Union to ban nuclear \n     tests in the atmosphere. But by September Dirksen realized \n     that public support for the treaty was very strong. He ended \n     up turning 180 degrees, supporting the test ban entirely, but \n     only after he persuaded Kennedy to write a letter assuring \n     that the U.S. nuclear weapons program would not be slowed \n     down.\n       ``They called him the Wizard of Ooze,'' recalled former \n     National Review Publisher William A. Rusher, author of ``The \n     Rise of the Right,'' a chronicle of conservatism's struggle \n     to power in the GOP. But Dirksen's smoothness never seemed to \n     leave him alienated from conservatives the way many of \n     today's Republican ``pragmatists'' are. Much of that \n     undoubtedly stemmed from his support of isolationist Sen. \n     Robert Taft's R-Ohio, failed run for the party presidential \n     nomination in 1952 and Dirksen's opposition to the Senate's \n     censuring of Sen. Joseph McCarthy, R-Wis., in 1954 (though he \n     severed relations with McCarthy very soon after that).\n       ``Certainly, speaking as a conservative, I regarded Everett \n     Dirksen as a friend and I think he would be delighted to see \n     all that's happened,'' Rusher added.\n       Lee Edwards, president of the Center for International \n     Relations and author of a soon-to-be-released biography of \n     Barry Goldwater, noted that Dirksen had a strong role early \n     on the Goldwater's rise to power.\n       On a trip to speak to the Arizona GOP, Dirksen personally \n     took Goldwater aside and advised him to run for the U.S. \n     Senate when the Arizonan was only a city councilman.\n       ``Goldwater has admitted on more than one occasion that it \n     did make a difference in his decision to run,'' according to \n     Edwards.\n       His heavy smoking and drinking eventually caught up with \n     Dirksen and he died of complications from lung cancer surgery \n     in 1969. One of the three Senate office buildings across the \n     street from the U.S. Capitol bears his name, the two others \n     named after Democratic senators. He lay in state under the \n     dome of the Capitol on the same black catafalque as Lincoln, \n     then only the third senator so honored.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/01/senate-section/article/S1963-3", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO KATHERINE M.

Mrs. \nLiddle was a long-time resident of Pineville, KY, and will be \nremembered and missed by many.\n  Mrs. Liddle was born in Oaks, KY. She was a graduate of Pineville \nHigh School and Union College in Barbourville, KY. Mrs. Liddle began \nteaching within the county system in a one-room school with six grades. \nIn 1973 she began teaching the sixth grade at the Pineville Independent \nSchool where she finished her teaching career 20 years later.\n  Mrs. Liddle was the wife of the late James J. Liddle. She had one \nson, Jack, who now resides in Reston, VA. She was a long-time member of \nthe First Baptist Church in Pineville, KY.\n  Mr. President, I ask that my colleagues join me in sending the \nChamber's sincere condolences to the family of Katherine M. Liddle. I \nam confident that her strength of character will remain a standard of \nexcellence for generations to come.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/01/senate-section/article/S1964-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT ON TIBET\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today the Department of State has \ntaken an important step toward recognizing the reality of the status of \nTibet. The annual ``Country Reports on Human Rights Practices'' was \nreleased today and for the first time there is a separate section on \nTibet.\n  For years there has been a fundamental difference in the way Congress \nand the executive branch have viewed Tibet. While the executive branch \nhas attempted to obscure the fact that at one time we did support \nTibet, Congress has stated its determination that Tibet is an occupied \ncountry. By separating the Tibet section from the China section on the \nhuman rights report, there is finally an acknowledgement that the \nadministration recognizes Tibet as distinct from China.\n  This new Tibet section fulfills one aspect of a provision which I \nintroduced and was later signed into law as part of the State \nDepartment authorization act for fiscal year 1994-95. While I do not \nagree with certain portions of the report on Tibet, it is not without \nmerit, and its authors deserve respect as able diplomats.\n  This will send a clear signal to those in Beijing as well as those in \nDharmsala, India where the Dalai Lama lives in exile, that the United \nStates recognizes the special situation the Tibetans face. Those in \nDharmsala have long known Congress supports them; now they can more \nclearly gauge the sentiments of the administration. This has been \nconfusing. As the eminent journalist A.M. Rosenthal, who visited the \nTibetans in exile in 1988, wrote:\n\n       People in Dharmsala are understandably hazy about the \n     intricacies of American government. They cannot quite get it \n     straight how the Congress can be so warm to Tibet and the \n     State Department and the White House make it clear that they \n     intend to disregard Congress and continue the sellout of \n     Tibet.\n\n  Perhaps this marks a new chapter in United States foreign policy in \nwhich support for the people of Tibet will no longer be hazy.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/01/senate-section/article/S1964-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1964-S1968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           LAWSUIT REFORM ACT\n\n Mr. McCONNELL.

Where reproduction \n     costs would be significant relative to the size of the \n     settlement offer, the claimant's attorney, may, in the \n     alternative, offer other forms of access to the materials, \n     convenient and at reasonable cost to allegedly responsible \n     party's attorney.\n       (D) A contingent fee attorney who fails to file a demand \n     for compensation under this paragraph shall not be entitled \n     to any fee greater than 10 percent of any settlement or \n     judgment received by the claimant client after reasonable \n     expenses have been deducted.\n       (5) Time limit for response setting forth settlement \n     offer.--(A) An allegedly liable party shall have 60 days from \n     the date of the receipt of a demand for compensation under \n     paragraph (4) to issue a response stating a settlement offer.\n       (B) If within 30 days after the date of the receipt of a \n     demand for compensation under paragraph (4), an allegedly \n     liable party notifies the attorney of the claimant that such \n     party seeks to have a medical examination of the claimant, \n     and the claimant is not made available for such examination \n     within 10 days after the date of the receipt of such a \n     request, the 60-day period described under subparagraph (A) \n     shall be extended by one day for each day that such request \n     is not honored after the expiration of such 10-day period. \n     Any such extension shall also include a further period of 10 \n     days from the date of the completion of the medical \n     examination.\n       (C) A response under this paragraph shall be open for \n     acceptance for a minimum of 30 days from the date of the \n     receipt of such response by the attorney of the claimant and \n     shall state whether such response expires in 30 days or \n     remains open for acceptance for a longer period or until \n     notice of withdrawal is given.\n       (D) A settlement offer in a response under this subsection \n     may be increased during the 60-day period described under \n     subparagraph (A) by issuing an additional response.\n       (E) If an additional response has been sent under this \n     paragraph, the time for acceptance shall be 10 days from the \n     date of the receipt of such additional response by the \n     attorney of the claimant or 30 days from the date of the \n     receipt of the initial response, whichever is later, unless \n     the additional response specifies a longer period of time for \n     acceptance as described under subparagraph (C).\n       (6) Material to accompany settlement offer.--An allegedly \n     responsible party and the attorney of such party shall \n     include in any response stating a settlement offer under \n     paragraph (5) copies of materials in their possession \n     concerning the claim upon which the allegedly liable party \n     relied in making a settlement offer, except for material \n     which such party believes in good faith would not be \n     discoverable by the claimant during the course of litigation. \n     Where reproduction costs would be significant relative to the \n     size of the settlement offer, the allegedly responsible \n     party, may, in the alternative, offer other forms of access \n     to the materials, convenient and at reasonable cost to \n     claimant's attorney.\n       (7) Effect of pre-demand settlement offer.--A settlement \n     offer under this subsection to a claimant represented by a \n     contingent fee attorney made prior to the receipt of a demand \n     for compensation, which is open for acceptance for 60 days or \n     more from the time of its receipt and which conforms to the \n     requirements of paragraph (6), shall be considered a post-\n     retention offer and shall have the same effect under this \n     subsection as if it were a response to a demand for \n     compensation.\n       (8) Pre-retention offer.--(A) An attorney retained after a \n     claimant has received a pre-retention offer under this \n     subsection may not enter into an agreement with the claimant \n     to receive a contingent fee based upon or payable from the \n     proceeds of the pre-retention offer which remains in effect.\n       (B) An attorney entering a fee agreement that would \n     effectively result in a claimant's paying a percentage of a \n     pre-retention offer to the attorney for prosecuting the claim \n     shall be considered to have charged an unreasonable and \n     excessive fee. With respect to an attorney where a pre-\n     retention offer has been provided--\n       (i) the attorney may contract with a claimant to receive an \n     hourly rate fee or fixed fee for advising the claimant \n     regarding the pre-retention offer;

and\n       (B) the product of multiplying the contingent fee \n     percentage negotiated between the contingent fee attorney and \n     claimant and the amount by which the subsequent settlement or \n     judgment exceeds the post-retention offer, after reasonable \n     expenses have been deducted.\n       (12) Provision of closing statement.--Upon receipt of any \n     settlement or judgment under this subsection, and prior to \n     disbursement thereof, a contingent fee attorney shall provide \n     the claimant with a written statement detailing how the \n     proceeds are to be distributed, including the amount of the \n     expenses paid out or to be paid out of the proceeds, the \n     amount of the fee, how the fee amount is calculated, and the \n     amount due the claimant.\n       (13) Effect on contravening agreements.--(A) A contingent \n     fee attorney who enters into a fee agreement with a claimant \n     which violates the provisions of this subsection is deemed to \n     have charged an unreasonable and excessive fee.\n       (B) A claimant who has entered into an agreement with a \n     contingent fee attorney which violates the provisions of this \n     subsection is entitled to recover from the attorney any \n     reasonable fees and costs incurred to establish such \n     agreement violated the provisions of this subsection.\n       (C) The failure by the claimant's attorney, or the attorney \n     for an alleged responsible party, to comply with the \n     provisions of this subsection may be considered grounds for \n     disciplinary proceedings and sanctions as determined \n     appropriate by the licensing or regulatory agency or court of \n     the State in which the claim arose.\n       (c) Amendment to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.--\n     Rule 11(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is \n     amended--\n       (1) in the matter preceding paragraph (1) by striking out \n     ``may'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``shall'';\n       (2) in subdivision (1)(A) in the third sentence by striking \n     out ``may'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``shall''; and\n       (3) in paragraph (2)--\n       (A) by amending the first sentence to read as follows: ``A \n     sanction imposed for a violation of this rule shall be \n     sufficient to deter repetition of such conduct or comparable \n     conduct by others similarly situated and to compensate the \n     parties that were injured by such conduct.''; and\n       (B) in the second sentence by striking ``, if imposed on \n     motion and warranted for effective deterrence,''.\n       (d) Prevailing Party Costs and Attorneys' Fees.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), in any \n     civil action filed against any person in any Federal or State \n     court, based on any cause of action (including, but not \n     limited to negligence, strict or product liability, breach of \n     implied warranty or professional malpractice) in which \n     damages are sought for tortious physical or mental injury, \n     property damage, or economic loss the court may award each \n     prevailing party costs and reasonable attorneys' fees.\n       (2) Amount of award.--An award of costs and reasonable \n     attorneys' fees under paragraph (1) may not exceed--\n       (A) the actual cost incurred by the nonprevailing party or \n     the attorneys' fee payable for services in connection with \n     such civil action; or\n       (B) if no such cost was incurred by the nonprevailing party \n     due to a contingency fee agreement, an amount equal to the \n     reasonable costs that would have been incurred by the \n     nonprevailing party for a noncontingent attorneys' fee \n     payable for services in connection with such civil action.\n       (3) Limitation.--\n       (A) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) or (2), the court shall \n     not award an attorney's fee in any case in which the \n     nonprevailing party--\n       (i) had a taxable income of less than $75,000 in the \n     calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the civil \n     action was filed, if the nonprevailing party is an \n     individual; or\n     [[Page S1967]]   (ii) had an average taxable income of less \n     than $50,000 for the 3 calendar years preceding the calendar \n     year in which the civil action was filed, if the \n     nonprevailing party is not an individual.\n       (B) The court shall retain discretion to refuse to award or \n     may reduce the amount awarded as an attorney's fee under \n     paragraph (1) to the extent the court finds would be in the \n     interests of justice.\n\n     SEC. 6.

ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION.\n\n       (a) General Policy.--The policy of the United States is to \n     encourage the creation and use of alternative dispute \n     resolution techniques, and to promote the expeditious \n     resolution of such actions, because the traditional \n     litigation process is not always suited to the timely, \n     efficient, and inexpensive resolution of civil actions.\n       (b) Notice of Availability of Alternative Dispute \n     Resolution.--In any civil action or claim arising under any \n     Federal law or in any diversity action in Federal court, each \n     attorney who has made an appearance in the case and who \n     represents one or more of the parties to the action shall, \n     with respect to each party separately represented, advise the \n     party of the existence and availability of alternative \n     dispute resolution options, including extra judicial \n     proceedings such as minitrials, third-party mediation, court \n     supervised arbitration, and summary jury trial proceedings.\n       (c) Certification of Notice.--Each attorney described under \n     subsection (b) shall, simultaneous with the filing of a \n     complaint or a responsive pleading, file a certification to \n     the court that the attorney has provided the notice required \n     under subsection (b) to the client or clients of such \n     attorney. The attorney shall state in the certification \n     whether such client will agree to one or more of the \n     alternative dispute resolution techniques.\n       (d) Agreement To Proceed With Alternative Dispute \n     Resolution.--If all parties to an action agree to proceed \n     with one or more alternative dispute resolution proceedings, \n     the court shall issue an appropriate order governing the \n     conduct of such proceedings. The issuance of an order \n     governing the proceedings shall constitute a waiver, by each \n     party subject to the order, of the right to proceed further \n     in court.\n     SEC. 11. RELIABILITY OF EXPERT EVIDENCE.\n\n       Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence is amended--\n       (1) by striking out ``If'' and inserting in lieu thereof \n     ``(a) In General.--Subject to subsection (b), if''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end thereof the following:\n       ``(b) Adequate Basis for Opinion.--Testimony in the form of \n     an opinion by a witness that is based on scientific knowledge \n     shall be inadmissible in evidence unless the court determines \n     that such opinion is--\n       ``(1) based on scientifically valid reasoning; and\n       ``(2) sufficiently reliable so that the probative value of \n     such evidence outweighs the dangers specified under rule 403.\n       (c) Expert Opinions on Novel Scientific Principles or \n     Discoveries.--Where testimony in the form of an opinion by a \n     witness is sought to be used to establish a novel scientific \n     principle or discovery, it shall be admissible only if the \n     principle or discovery, or its scientific underpinning, is \n     sufficiently established to have gained general acceptance in \n     the field in which it belongs.\n       ``(d) Disqualification.--Testimony by a witness who is \n     qualified as an expert under subsection (a) is inadmissible \n     in evidence if such witness is entitled to receive any \n     compensation directly or indirectly contingent on the legal \n     disposition of any claim with respect to which such testimony \n     is offered.''.\n\n     SEC. 12. EXPRESS AUTHORIZATION FOR PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 85 of title 28, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end thereof the following \n     new section:\n\n     ``Sec. 1368. Private right of action\n\n       ``No district court shall have jurisdiction over any civil \n     action filed by a party based on a private right of action, \n     unless such private right of action is expressly authorized \n     in the statute on which such action is based.''.\n       (b) Technical and Conforming Amendment.--The table of \n     sections for chapter 85 of title 28, United States Code, is \n     amended by adding at the end thereof the following new item:\n\n``1368. Private right of action.''.\n\n       (c) State Courts.--No Federal statute shall be construed to \n     give rise to a private right of action in a State court, \n     unless such private right of action is expressly authorized \n     in the statute on which such action is based.\n\n     SEC. 13. APPLICABILITY.\n\n       (a) Preemption.--This Act shall preempt and supersede other \n     Federal or State laws only to the extent any such law is \n     inconsistent with this Act. This Act shall not preempt any \n     Federal or State law that provides for defenses in addition \n     to those contained in this Act, places greater limitations on \n     the amount of attorney's fees that can be collected, or \n     additional disclosure requirements upon attorneys, or \n     otherwise imposes restrictions on economic, noneconomic, or \n     punitive damages. Any issue arising under this Act that is \n     not governed by the provisions of this Act shall be governed \n     by applicable Federal or State law.\n       (b) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this Act shall be \n     construed to--\n       (1) waive or affect any defense of sovereign immunity \n     asserted by any State under any provision of law;\n       (2) waive or affect any defense of sovereign immunity \n     asserted by the United States;\n       (3) affect the applicability of any provision of chapter 97 \n     of title 28, United States Code;\n       (4) preempt State choice-of-law rules with respect to \n     claims brought by a foreign nation or citizen of a foreign \n     nation; or\n       (5) affect the right of any court to transfer venue or to \n     apply the law of a foreign nation or to dismiss a claim of a \n     foreign or of a citizen of a foreign nation on the ground of \n     inconvenient forum.\n       (c) State Election Regarding Applicability.--A provision of \n     this Act shall not apply to a State if such State enacts a \n     statute--\n       (1) citing the authority of this subsection; and\n       (2) declaring the election of such State that such \n     provision shall not apply to the State.\n\n     SEC. 14. SEVERABILITY.\n\n       If any provision of this Act or the application of any such \n     provision to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the \n     remainder of this Act and the application of any provision to \n     any other person or circumstance shall not be affected \n     thereby.\n\n     SEC. 15. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act shall take effect and apply to claims or actions \n     filed on and after the date occurring 30 days after the date \n     of enactment of this Act.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/01/senate-section/article/S1964-3", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 2, 1995\n\n  Mr. HATCH.
