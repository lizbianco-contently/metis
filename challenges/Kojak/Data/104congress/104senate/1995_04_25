Mr. President, I rise today as a replacement, pinch-\nhitting for the Senator from Wyoming, Senator Thomas, who usually \nguides this half hour of time for the freshmen. We call this our \nfreshman focus, 11 freshman Republicans who on Tuesday and Thursday \nmornings come to the Senate floor to talk about issues of importance to \nthe Senate, to the country. Senator Thomas has done a fine job in doing \nthat. He is at the National Press Club today, so he is not available to \ndo that. But I will do my best to fill in for him and try to lead the \ndiscussion this morning with my colleague from Maine and others who \nwill appear on the floor to talk about our theme for today, which was a \nquestion I received a lot in town meetings and other meetings when I \nwas back in Pennsylvania, when I was home in the last few weeks: What \nis ahead for the Senate? What is the Senate going to be doing with not \njust the Contract With America, but a whole bunch of other things?\n  So we thought we would take on that question head on: What is the \nagenda for the Senate? What are we going to be doing? Is it relevant, \nand how relevant is it, for the American public and what they are \nconcerned about?\n  I had lengthy discussions at home at these town meetings and I got a \ngood feel that we are on the right track. What is in our sights here in \nthe U.S. Senate is on track with where the American public would like \nus to go.\n  The issue we are debating here on the floor today and for the next \nweek or so is an issue of very great importance to the economic well-\nbeing of this country, legal reform. We have a much too costly legal \nsystem. It is one that makes us uncompetitive and inefficient, and one \nthat is not fair to society as a whole. While we may have people, \nindividuals, who hit the jackpot and win the lottery in some cases, \nthat is not exactly what our legal system should be designed to do. It \nshould have the societal benefit of spreading risk around, and also \ncreating justice not just for the individual but for society as a \nwhole. I do not think our system achieves that as well as it can, and I \nthink legal reform we are facing here on the Senate floor will be a \nhelp to everyone in our society. That, I believe, is very relevant for \nthe average American.\n  The other thing we are obviously going to be bringing up, that may be \nsomewhat expedited as a result of the tragedy in Oklahoma City, is a \ncrime bill with very tough provisions on antiterrorism that is going to \nbe, I believe, a bipartisan effort. Senator Hatch has talked about \nmoving forward the crime bill, parts of which have passed the House, \nand moving it to the Senate floor with some tough antiterrorism \nmeasures, to quickly respond. Hopefully, the crime bill we are trying \nto push through will get an expedited path as a result of some of the \nactivities over the last week or so. Hopefully, the Senate can quickly \nrespond. Again, it is a matter of whether the other side is going to \nallow this body to move in an expeditious though thoughtful way or \nwhether we are going to play delaying tactics and stalling tactics, to \nbe a roadblock to progress.\n  There are two other things I want to focus on. If I heard about an \nissue back home from folks who were trying to make a living, small \nbusinessmen in particular, it was regulatory reform. More than anything \nelse, having the Government regulators be more reasonable in dealing \nwith the laws that we put forward and for the Congress and for the \nregulators to work together to put forward regulatory schemes that make \ncommon sense, not these overly bureaucratic and harmful procedures we \nput in place today to overregulate our society. Again, they cause a lot \nof personal pain and suffering and problems and affect lives in ways \nthat are almost incalculable as a result of the scheme we put in effect \nover the last 30 or 40 years. We need to look at this, recreate \nGovernment anew, do something commonsense oriented to make Government \nwork better for people back home. I believe the regulatory reform \nmeasures we will be considering here in the next month or so will go a \nlong way toward doing that.\n  The last thing we are going to be looking at, and I will combine \nthese two, is we are going to be looking at a tax cut bill and we are \ngoing to be looking at a budget resolution that is going to put this \ncountry on a road to a balanced budget in 7 years. I know the Senator \nfrom Maine is going to talk about this in detail as a member of the \nBudget Committee. In fact, we are going to have on the floor of the \nSenate a budget that will bring us to balance in 7 years. We will be \nable to vote for a balanced budget. I think it is the first time that \nhas been the case, that the majority party in one of the bodies has \nproposed a balanced budget, since 1969. So it is in fact historic and \nit is a great opportunity. It is a great challenge for not only the \nMembers of the Senate, but for this country, to take a step back and \nlook and see what we are going to do, not just to get the numbers to \nadd up right but simply how are we going to save this country? How are \nwe going to provide for some stability and financial future of this \ncountry?\n  This is not about just balancing the budget; this is about saving the \ncountry. Because if we do not take this course, if we do not act \nseriously on this fiscal crisis we are in right now, it is only going \nto get harder in the future. It does not get easier. Anyone who will \ntell you we can just put this off a little bit and it will get easier \nin the future is wrong. The budget deficit gets worse and worse the \nlonger we wait. You jeopardize programs like Medicare and Social \nSecurity and every other popular program that is here in Washington by \ndelaying and playing politics with this issue.\n  I am hopeful we will not play politics, that we will be able to stand \nup here and have an intelligent debate on the floor of the Senate and \ntalk about what we are going to do to set priorities and put this \ncountry on a sound fiscal footing in the future so we can make sure \npeople who are banking on Social Security and Medicare in their \nretirements, people who need the welfare systems that we have and \nhopefully will be able to reform, that those systems will be available \nand are not just going to be squeezed out because of our inability to \nset fiscal priorities today. The chance of them being squeezed out in \nthe future is not just a possibility, it is a certainty. We will \nsqueeze these programs out, a lot of them, if we do not set our house \nin order now.\n  So I am excited about that. I think it is a great opportunity for the \nSenate to shine, for us to really step forward and have this kind of \ndeliberative discussion about issues at the core of who we are as a \ncountry and what direction we are going to take. I am anxious to get \nahead, to look ahead at the next few months and see what we are going \nto do here in the U.S. Senate. I think it bodes well for this country \nfor us to have this kind of aggressive agenda for the American public.\n  I will be happy to yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                           A Balanced Budget\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding. I am \npleased to be able to join my freshman colleagues in talking about the \nagenda for the coming weeks and months as we return from our spring \nrecess and have the opportunity to discuss with our constituents \nexactly what is on their minds. I can assure you, it is the same thing \nthat it was in November.\n  People are still clamoring for institutional, economic, and political \nchange. \n[[Page S5621]] They recognize that some of the monumental achievements \nthat we have already made in the first 100 days, many of the issues \nthat have laid dormant in this institution for years and years, have \nbeen acted upon, such as requiring Congress to live by the same rules \nthat apply to the rest of society, stopping the tide of unfunded \nmandates, and giving the President line-item veto authority. So we have \nmade progress. But they want to continue our assault on the status quo. \nI cannot think of a better way to demonstrate our commitment to \nchanging the status quo than to show the American people that deficit \nreduction and balancing the Federal budget is going to be on the top of \nour agenda.\n  I know that many people have said here on the floor of the Senate \nwhen we were debating a constitutional amendment to balance the budget \nthat we do not need a constitutional amendment, that it is not \nnecessary. Unfortunately, history has just disproved us in that regard \nbecause we have had a fiscal losing streak with 26 years of unbalanced \nbudgets. Mr. President, 1969 is the last time in which we had a \nbalanced Federal budget.\n  I hope that we can disprove history. I hope that we are able as we \nmeet this week in the Senate Budget Committee on Thursday to begin the \nprocess of marking up the budget resolution that we will engage in a \nbipartisan effort to balance the Federal budget. Our goal is to put our \nbudget on a glidepath toward balancing it by the year 2002.\n  So I hope all who have mentioned that we do not need a constitutional \namendment will join us in that effort to ensure that we will in fact \nhave a statutory commitment toward the balancing of the Federal budget.\n  The administration unfortunately has perpetuated the fiscal status \nquo with a budget that was submitted by the President several months \nago. In fact, back in 1992 the President said he would offer a 5-year \nbudget plan that would balance the Federal budget. He has not done \nthat. He then said that he would reduce the Federal budget deficit by \nhalf by 1996. Of course, that has not occurred. Instead, we received a \nbudget that only eliminates one agency, the Interstate Commerce \nCommission, out of a grand total of a budget of $1.2 trillion. In fact, \nthe Congressional Budget Office reestimated the administration's \nprojections on deficits. And it is quite alarming as well as disturbing \nwhen you see the upward trend of the deficits as well as the interest \npayments. That is what makes our action on the budget deficit and \nbalancing the Federal budget so compelling.\n  According to the CBO, the 1996 deficit will be $211 billion, not the \n$197 billion projected by the administration. The 1998 deficit will \nrise to $231 billion, not the $196 billion projected by the \nadministration. In 1999, the deficit will reach an estimated $256 \nbillion, far from the $197 billion the administration had forecasted. \nFinally, in the fiscal year 2000, the Congressional Budget Office said \nthe deficit will reach $276 billion rather than the $194 billion the \nadministration has projected.\n  It means according to CBO reestimates that the size of our national \ndeficit over the next 5 years will increase by 55 percent. It will grow \nfrom 2.5 percent of the gross domestic product to 3.1 percent of the \nGDP, which is contrary to what the administration had indicated, that \nin fact they had said that the deficit would be 2.5 percent of GDP and \ndecline to 2.1 percent of GDP. Obviously, that is not now the reality. \nThe gap between the administration's projections on the deficits and \nthe Congressional Budget Office really amounts to more than $209 \nbillion that will be spent over the next 5 years; $209 billion. It is \nincredible when you consider the fact that by the year 2000 we will in \nfact have had our revenues exceed the 1995 revenues by $323 billion.\n  So you would say then we must have a much smaller deficit in the \nfiscal year 2000. Well, no. We are not going to. We are going to have a \ndeficit of $273 billion. It will be $100 billion more than it will be \nin 1995, even though we will have $323 billion more in additional \nrevenue.\n  We will be spending $422 billion over the next 5 years. That \nrepresents a 28-percent increase during a time when inflation is \nprojected to rise by half that rate.\n  The administration said it is going to cut the budget over the next 5 \nyears by $144 billion. In fact, it is being reestimated by the \nCongressional Budget Office. In fact, the administration's budget will \nonly reduce Federal spending by $32 billion over the next 5 years, \nmeaning just about $6 billion a year, thirty-nine one-hundredths of 1 \npercent of total Federal spending, hardly enough, and certainly is not \ngoing to put us on a stable fiscal path for the future. And that is \nwhat we are talking about, the future for this country because deficits \nare affecting not only taxes but productivity, savings, the deficit, \nand employment. It affects all of those categories. We need to be \ninvesting in the future. Otherwise, we are going to create a second-\nrate economy.\n  That certainly is not exaggerated because 1969, the last time the \nFederal Government had a balanced Federal budget, the dollar traded for \n4 German marks and 360 Japanese yen. And, since then, while the Federal \ndebt has increased by 1250 percent, or $4.5 trillion, the dollar has \nlost two-thirds of its value against the mark, and three-fourths \nagainst the yen.\n  I guess in reality what we are saying is that it will continue to \ncost the American people millions, if not billions, of dollars because \nthe link between a lackluster and unfocused and uncontrolled Federal \nbudget policy and a decline of the dollar is indisputable. In fact, the \nFederal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan, told the House Budget \nCommittee recently that all told a Federal program of fiscal restraint \nthat moves the deficit finances to sounder footing almost surely will \nfind a favorable reception in financial markets. He added that a key \nelement in dealing with the dollar's weakness is to address our \nunderlying fiscal balance. In layman's terms that means only one thing. \nIt means balancing the Federal budget.\n  So I hope we can work in unison on a Republican and Democratic basis \nand in conjunction with the administration to produce just that, a \nbalanced Federal budget, not only for this generation but future \ngenerations to come.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, at this time I would like to yield 5 \nminutes to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania, and \nwould also just say in response to the remarks of our colleague from \nMaine that she has been a long-time advocate beginning with her service \nin the House of Representatives for sensible fiscal policy, and in \nparticular support for the balanced budget amendment. I just again \nexpress my appreciation to her for all of the hard work that she did \nthere and for what she has since carried forward to this body in \nattempting to get us to support the balanced budget amendment this \nyear. We failed by one vote. But I think, as has been noted, we are \ngoing to get it passed sooner or later.\n  One of the things my constituents told me during the last 2 weeks \nwhen I was out in Arizona was that we need to balance the Federal \nbudget. In fact, if there was any one theme that came across during the \nvisits that I had with people all over the State in my tour of the \nState, it was that the Senate needed to keep up the good work that the \nHouse began, and that includes passing the balanced budget amendment. \nWhen I asked them what they thought about the first 100 days and the \nHouse Contract With America, they were overwhelmingly in support of it.\n  We traveled during the first week. We got in my old Suburban and \ntraveled to Miami and Globe and Thatcher, and Pima. These are names \nthat are not known to very many of you, but they are little towns in \nArizona. We had a town hall meeting in Safford with 130 people one \nnight. They were all just as interested and engaged as you would hope \nthat our American citizens would be on these issues that we have been \nworking on here.\n  Their primary message was we are appreciative of what the House did. \nNow you in the Senate need to do the same thing. They were pleasantly \nsurprised when I noted we had already passed three of the contract \nitems here in the Senate. That message had not really gotten out too \nmuch. They were also somewhat skeptical that the Senate would do as \nwell as the House, and \n[[Page S5622]] in particular with regard to the budget issues.\n  We went on to the small towns of Willcox, and Benson. These are \nranching communities primarily, and regulatory reform is very high on \ntheir agenda. They deal with the Federal Government every day because \nmany of them ranch on Federal lands and in other respects have dealings \nwith the Federal Government, which are not always the most pleasant.\n  So their view was that regulatory reforms, the kind of things that \nthe Senate will be marking up in the Judiciary Committee tomorrow, the \nDole regulatory reform bill, are the kind of reforms that they want us \nto carry forward. Of course, that was done in the House of \nRepresentatives as part of its Contract With America.\n  Then over to Yuma, AZ, up to Flagstaff, AZ, the Grand Canyon, where \nthere is obviously a need to support our National Park System to begin \nto make it a better experience for the now millions of people who visit \nthe Grand Canyon every year and also to balance very carefully the \nenvironmental concerns with the other economic needs of our citizens.\n  All of these subjects were discussed during these 2 weeks as I went \naround the State, but there is a sense of optimism that we have \nactually changed things. There is a desire that we keep going. I think \nthere is still a residuum of skepticism that the Congress really will \nfollow through with these promises, but people are very pleasantly \nsurprised that so far it seems to be happening.\n  Then finally, Mr. President, when the very tragic events of just a \nweek ago began unfolding in Oklahoma City, it began to remind people \nall over this country of how unified we are as a people in condemning \nthat kind of violence, in feeling the most heartfelt sympathy for the \nvictims of the tragedy, and for sharing a commitment to bring to \njustice the people who are responsible.\n  I spent a good deal of my time, since I serve on both the \nIntelligence Committee and the Judiciary Committee, talking to people \nabout the threats that are out there and for the need to support the \nagencies that we count on to prevent these threats or to bring to \njustice the people responsible when they occur. Our agencies, such as \nthe Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, we are extremely pleased with the way this investigation \nhas gone so far, but we know that there is much work to be done.\n  It is important for us to recognize that this does not just happen \nautomatically. It happens because hundreds of dedicated Americans are \nworking very long hours under difficult circumstances to find out what \nthese kinds of groups are up to, to try to prevent them from acting \nand, when they do, to bring them to justice. We cannot reflect on it \njust when there is a tragic event such as this. We have to support \nthese agencies throughout the year and year in and year out.\n  I am very disturbed by the calls that I have heard in the beginning \npart of this year from those who would dismantle the Central \nIntelligence Agency, for example, because the cold war is over, not \nappreciating the fact that there are hundreds of organizations around \nthe world, some State sponsored, others not, but all of which have in \nmind conducting the kind of terrorist activities that occurred in \nOklahoma City. It can happen from without our borders as well as \nwithin, and it is critical that we remember that and support these \norganizations when the appropriations issues come before us very soon. \nIt is the only way we will be able to bring to justice the people \nresponsible for this kind of heinous activity.\n  So, Mr. President, it was an Easter recess that was edifying for all \nof us and at the end something that because of the tragedy I think \nunified us all in expressing support for the people in Oklahoma City.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator from Arizona for his fine remarks \nand for his zealous participation in trying to get the Senate moving \nand working. This is a tough place to get activated, but the Senator \nfrom Arizona has been a delightful thorn in the side of a lot of folks \naround here to try to get things going, and I commend him for his \nactivity.\n  Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven minutes and forty seconds remain.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from Tennessee, \nSenator Thompson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                         No Time To Go Lukewarm\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania.\n  I, first of all, wish to also commend the Senator from Arizona. I \nthink his remarks concerning the need for our strong law enforcement \nagencies was most timely and most eloquent. Before I address the main \npoint I wanted to make, I must reinforce that.\n  I think too often in this country, whether it be our law enforcement \nagencies or our military, once we pass a crisis, it is as if we do not \nneed them anymore; once we have won a war, it is as if we do not need \nthe military anymore. And historically we have downsized too rapidly \nand too much. I think sometimes when things are peaceful here \ndomestically, we feel we do not need a strong CIA, we do not need a \nstrong FBI and law enforcement authorities. These people are out here \nevery day and, as the Senator pointed out, they need our support on a \ncontinuous basis. They need the support of the Congress on a continuous \nbasis, not just when there is a crisis, when people tend to overreact.\n  So I am very proud of these agencies. We must do everything we can to \nmake sure that they remain strong, not talking about cutting back the \nbudgets of these agencies, certainly not talking about eliminating them \nas some have done because they have gotten in a little trouble, and \ncertainly they need oversight. But I think the tragic events of the \nlast several days have just gone to underscore the fact that we must \nremain strong both domestically and with regard to foreign matters.\n  I was also impressed with what my colleague from Arizona said \nconcerning the time he had over this last recess. I shared many of the \nsame experiences he had. We ran the last campaign based on a very \nsimple notion, and that was the notion of changing the way we do \nbusiness in this town, in the Congress of the United States. And now we \nbegin to see in newspaper articles, people have gone back home, and the \nPresident indicates that some people are not so sure, maybe things are \nmoving too fast, people are not willing to make sacrifices--sure, they \nwant these things done in the broad sense of the word, but when it \ncomes to them, individuals are too selfish to be willing to make any \nkind of incremental adjustment if it affects them directly; et cetera, \net cetera, et cetera.\n  That is not my experience. I have gone back to Tennessee every \nweekend since I was elected to the Senate. These last few days have \nbeen no different than any other days I have spent out in the country, \nin country stores, in cafes, talking to people. The message that I get \nconsistently is that this is no time to go lukewarm on our basic \ncommitments, on basically what we ran on. It is not time to go soft on \nour commitment for a balanced budget amendment. It is not time now to \nget cold feet on deregulation. It is not time to get lukewarm on \nwelfare reform.\n  These things are our commitments, these things they expect us to \nfollow up on, and they look forward to the leadership that they think \nwe are providing. They only ask that we be fair.\n  I have never talked to a grandparent in the State of Tennessee who \nwas not willing to make some incremental adjustment if they thought it \nwould go to the benefit of their grandchild. And that is the message we \nhave to bring back here. For all of those among our colleagues and in \nthe media who think that Americans are so individually self-centered \nand selfish that we are not willing on an individual basis to do the \nthings necessary to make for a stronger country, to make a stronger \ncountry for our children and grandchildren, I will have to point out to \nthem that they are very much mistaken. The House of Representatives, of \ncourse, has been very active and very busy. They have gotten a lot of \nattention over their agenda and what they have done.\n  [[Page S5623]] I would just like to say this. Regardless of what any \nindividual might think about the Contract With America or any \nparticular provision of the contract, the House of Represenatives did a \nvery, very significant thing that overshadows any individual provision \nin that contract or the contract in its totality, and what they did was \nwhat they said they were going to do. Never before in the history of \nthis country was a program so plainly and simply laid before the \nAmerican people which said, if we get elected, this is what we will do.\n  They got elected and then they went about doing it. Now it has come \nto the Senate. It has been pointed out many times that the Senate is \nnot the House. It has been pointed out that things will move slower in \nthe Senate because that is what it is designed to do. This is where the \ncoffee is poured into the saucer to cool.\n  All of that is true. All of that is well and good. I have no problem \nin spending days on end in the Senate debating the national issues, \ndebating the issues of strong contention where people have legitimate \nconcerns over issues of broad policy that affect the future of this \ncountry. I have no problem with debating those matters on end. We do \nnot have any agenda over here except to do the right thing in the right \namount of time.\n  What I have problems with is taking days on end on matters which \nessentially are not controversial, where at the end of the day they \npass by 90 or 95 votes to 5. I see no reason why we should get hung up \non delay over here for delay's sake. I hope that does not happen. If we \nhave controversial matters that take days, let us take them. But if we \nhave things that we know the American people want and we know that most \nof the Members of this body want, I say let us get on with it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee for \nhis fine remarks and very cogent points on a number of issues, \nparticularly his comments on our downsizing too quickly, not just with \nthe military but with our domestic intelligence agencies, law \nenforcement agencies. I think the Senator has hit the nail right on the \nhead there and I congratulate him for his statements on that matter.\n  I would like to yield our remaining time that was allocated to us \nthis morning to the Senator from Oklahoma, who I know will be in the \nChamber shortly with a resolution concerning the tragedy in his home \nState of Oklahoma, to talk about the agenda for the future here in the \nSenate.\n  Senator Inhofe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 4 minutes and 50 seconds remaining.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n                               The Agenda\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Thank you, Mr. President, and I thank the Senator from \nPennsylvania for the time.\n  As he stated, in just a few minutes, Senator Nickles and I will make \nsome comments concerning a resolution that will be voted on at noon \ntoday having to do with the disaster that struck Oklahoma less than a \nweek ago.\n  However, I do think on this subject of the agenda that there is a \nmisconception that is floating around out there that the Senate has not \nbeen doing anything because most of the focus has been on the other \nbody. And it is understandable, because that is where most of the \nactivity was. Procedurally, things happen quicker in the House than \nthey do in the Senate.\n  For those of us who have served in the House of Representatives and \nare now serving in the U.S. Senate, I can understand for the first time \nin my lifetime why our Founding Fathers perceived that we should have a \nbicameral system. And, in fact, things are more deliberate here. And I \nthink it is, without pointing any fingers or being critical, that many \nthings pass the House of Representatives with the understanding that \nthey know that it will get a more thorough examination when it gets to \nthe Senate.\n  But, having said that, I would have to say that the Senate has done \nan incredible amount of work. While I cannot document it, I would \nsuggest that the Senate has accomplished more in the first 90 days or \nthe first 100 days of this session than they have at any other time. We \npassed the line-item veto. We passed congressional accountability, \nforcing Members of Congress to live under the same laws that they pass. \nWe passed unfunded mandates. Those of us who have previously been \nmayors of major cities understand that that is a major problem facing \nthe cities and other political subdivisions around the country. And we \nhave done that. We have had moratoriums passed. I really believe that \nthe Senate has acted responsibly, but in a much more deliberative way.\n  Now the time has been pretty much occupied on what are we going to do \non the budget. I think it is somewhat tragic, and I have to be critical \nof our President. When he talks about the deficit reduction, he makes \ncomments as if we are actually doing something about reducing the debt. \nAnd it is a matter of terminology, that if there is anything that can \ncome from this debate, I hope that the American people, and I think \nthey are, are aware right now that we are talking about two different \nthings when you talk about debt and deficit.\n  In fact, the President's budget that has come in has built into it \ndeficits each year that will have a dramatic increase on our Nation's \ndebt.\n  I am still of the belief that we in Congress, in both Houses of \nCongress, as well as the administration, are incapable of fiscally \ndisciplining ourselves in the absence of a balanced budget amendment to \nthe Constitution. And I really believe it is going to happen. Of \ncourse, it did pass the other body, and it lacked one vote of passing \nin the U.S. Senate.\n  I would remind those who share my concern for this nonpassage that it \nis under a motion for reconsideration and that we are going to be able \nto do something about it, I believe, before this term is over.\n  So, Mr. President, Senator Nickles will be joining me in just a \nmoment and we will have an opportunity to talk a little bit about the \ntragedy that struck my State of Oklahoma.\n  I yield back my time.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask that I might be allowed to speak \nfor up to 12 minutes on the matter which the Senator from Oklahoma \nindicated will be the subject of the remaining of our morning debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank the Chair.\n                the paranoid style in american politics\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, as we think and, indeed, pray our way \nthrough the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing, asking how such a \nhorror might have come about, and how others might be prevented, \nSenators could do well to step outside the Chamber and look down The \nMall at the Washington Monument. It honors the Revolutionary general \nwho once victorious turned his army over to the Continental Congress \nand retired to his estates. Later, recalled to the highest office in \nthe land, he served dutifully one term, then a second, but then on \nprinciple not a day longer. Thus was founded the first republic, the \nfirst democracy since the age of Greece and Rome.\n  There is not a more serene, confident, untroubled symbol of the \nNation in all the Capital. Yet a brief glance will show that the color \nof the marble blocks of which the monument is constructed changes about \na quarter of the way up. Thereby hangs a tale of another troubled time; \nnot our first, just as, surely, this will not be our last.\n  As befitting a republic, the monument was started by a private \ncharitable group, as we would now say, the Washington National Monument \nSociety. Contributions came in cash, but also in blocks of marble, many \nwith interior inscriptions which visitors willing to climb the steps \ncan see to this day. A quarter of the way up, that is. For in 1852, \nPope Pius IX donated a block of marble from the Temple of Concord in \nRome. Instantly, the American Party, or the Know-Nothings--``I know \nnothing,'' was their standard reply to queries about their platform--\ndevined a Papist plot. An installation of the Pope's block of marble \nwould signal the Catholic uprising. A fevered agitation began. As \nrecorded by Ray \n[[Page S5624]] Allen Billington in ``The Protestant Crusade, 1800-\n1860'':\n\n       One pamphlet, ``The Pope's Strategem: `Rome to America!' An \n     Address to the Protestants of the United States, against \n     placing the Pope's block of Marble in the Washington \n     Monument'' (1852), urged Protestants to hold indignation \n     meetings and contribute another block to be placed next to \n     the Pope's ``bearing an inscription by which all men may see \n     that we are awake to the hypocrisy and schemes of that \n     designing, crafty, subtle, far seeing and far reaching Power, \n     which is ever grasping after the whole World, to sway its \n     iron sceptre, with bloodstained hands, over the millions of \n     its inhabitants.''\n\n  One night early in March 1854, a group of Know-Nothings broke into \nthe storage sheds on the Monument Grounds and dragged the Pope's marble \nslab toward the Potomac. Save for the occasional ``sighting,'' as we \nhave come to call such phenomena, it was never to be located since.\n  Work on the monument stopped. Years later, in 1876, Congress \nappropriated funds to complete the job, which the Corps of Engineers, \nunder the leadership of Lt. Col. Thomas I. Casey did with great \nflourish in time for the centennial observances of 1888.\n  Dread of Catholicism ran its course, if slowly. Edward M. Stanton, \nthen Secretary of War, was convinced the assassination of President \nLincoln was the result of a Catholic plot. Other manias followed, all \nbrilliantly described in Richard Rofstadter's revelatory lecture ``The \nParanoid Style in American Politics'' which he delivered as the Herbert \nSpencer Lecture at Oxford University within days of the assassination \nof John F. Kennedy. Which to this day remains a fertile source of \nconspiracy mongering. George Will cited Hofstadter's essay this past \nweekend on the television program ``This Week With David Brinkley.'' He \ndeals with the same subject matter in a superb column in this morning's \nWashington Post which has this bracing conclusion.\n\n       It is reassuring to remember that paranoiacs have always \n     been with us, but have never defined us.\n\n  I hope, Mr. President, as we proceed to consider legislation, if that \nis necessary, in response to the bombing, we would be mindful of a \nhistory in which we have often overreacted, to our cost, and try to \navoid such an overreaction.\n  We have seen superb performance of the FBI. What more any nation \ncould ask of an internal security group I cannot conceive. We have seen \nthe effectiveness of our State troopers, of our local police forces, \nfire departments, instant nationwide cooperation which should reassure \nus rather than frighten us.\n  I would note in closing, Mr. President, that Pope John Paul II will \nbe visiting the United States this coming October. I ask unanimous \nconsent that Mr. Will's column be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 25, 1995.]\n\n                      Fevered Minds, Marginal Men\n\n                          (By George F. Will)\n\n       The Tennessee marble on the side of the Morgan bank \n     building in lower Manhattan still bears, defiantly, scars \n     inflicted on Sept. 16, 1920, when a horse-drawn wagon loaded \n     with sash weights exploded amid a lunchtime crowd. Among \n     those blown to the pavement was Joseph P. Kennedy. He was one \n     of the fortunate. The blast, which shattered windows over a \n     half-mile radius killed 30 and injured more than 100.\n       There were no arrests, or explanations. Someone probably \n     had taken too seriously some socialist critique of \n     capitalism, but the incident fed J.P. Morgan Jr.'s many \n     phobias, which included: ``The Jew is always a Jew first and \n     an American second, and the Roman Catholic, I fear, too often \n     a papist first and an American second.''\n       Today, as the nation sifts and sorts the many jagged and \n     tangled fragments of emotions and ideas in the\n      aftermath of Oklahoma City, it should remember that this was \n     not America's baptism of lunacy. Bleeding Oklahoma City is \n     a few hundred miles down the road from Pottawatomie in \n     what once was bleeding Kansas, scene of a memorable \n     massacre. John Brown's body lies a-moldering in the grave, \n     but his spirit--massacres in the name of God--goes \n     marching on in the paranoia of a few.\n       A very few, on society's far fringes. Which is progress. \n     After Brown killed the mayor of Harpers Ferry and seized the \n     arsenal, he was sentenced to be hanged. Yet America's \n     preeminent intellectual, Ralph Waldo Emerson, said of him, \n     ``That new saint, than whom nothing purer or more brave was \n     ever led by love of men into conflict and death ... will make \n     the gallows glorious like the cross.'' Morgan wrote the words \n     above about Jews and Catholics to A. Lawrence Lowell, \n     president of Harvard, of which institution Morgan was an \n     overseer. It is unthinkable that such sentiments could be \n     expressed in such circles today.\n       Today when the fevered minds of marginal men produce an \n     outrage like the Oklahoma City bombing, some people rush to \n     explain the outrage as an effect of this or that prominent \n     feature of the social environment. They talk as though it is \n     a simple task to trace a straight line from some social \n     prompting, through the labyrinth of an individual's dementia, \n     to that individual's action.\n       Now, to be sure, it is wise to recognize that ideas, and \n     hence the words that bear them, have consequences. Those who \n     trade in political ideas should occasionally brood as William \n     Butler Yeats did when he wrote this about the civil war in \n     Ireland:\n\n       Did that play of mine send out\n       Certain men the English shot?\n       Did words of mine put too great strain\n       On that woman's reeling brain?\n       Could my spoken words have checked\n       That whereby a house lay wrecked?\n       However, an attempt to locate in society's political \n     discourse the cause of a lunatic's action is apt to become a \n     temptation to extract partisan advantage from spilled blood. \n     Today there are those who are flirting with this contemptible \n     accusation: If the Oklahoma City atrocity was perpetrated by \n     individuals gripped by pathological hatred of government, \n     then this somehow implicates and discredits the current \n     questioning of the duties and capacities of government.\n       But if the questioners are to be indicted, the indictment \n     must be broad indeed. It must encompass not only a large \n     majority of Americans and their elected representatives but \n     also the central tradition of American political thought--\n     political skepticism, the pedigree of which runs back to the \n     Founders.\n       The modern pedigree of the fanatics' idea that America's \n     government is a murderous conspiracy against liberty and \n     decency--a money-making idea for Oliver Stone, director of \n     the movie ``JFK''--runs back to the 1960s. Those were years \n     John Brown could have enjoyed, years when the New York Review \n     of Books printed on its cover directions for making a Molotov \n     cocktail, and a student died when some precursors of the \n     Oklahoma City fanatics practiced the politics of symbolism by \n     bombing a building at the University of Wisconsin.\n       Today, when some talk radio paranoiacs spew forth the idea \n     that the AIDS virus was invented by Jewish doctors for \n     genocide against blacks, it is well to remember that the \n     paranoid impulse was present in the first armed action by \n     Americans against the new federal government. During the \n     Whiskey Rebellion 200 years ago a preacher declared:\n       ``The present day is unfolding a design the most extensive, \n     flagitious and diabolical, that human art and malice have \n     ever invented. . . . If accomplished, the earth can be \n     nothing better than a sink of impurities.''\n       It is reassuring to remember that paranoiacs have always \n     been with us, but have never defined us.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, seeing the distinguished Senators from \nOklahoma on the floor, I know we all look to hear from them. I thank \nthe President and yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in morning business \nfor 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/25/senate-section/article/S5620-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5624-S5627]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          DISASTER IN OKLAHOMA\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, 5 days ago we had a disaster that occurred \nin Oklahoma. I happened at the time to be in Dallas in a regional \nmeeting on base closure when I got a call from the President of the \nUnited States. At that time, the entire Nation, only hours after the \nblast, was watching as the smoke still had not yet cleared.\n  The President advised me as to what the Federal Government was doing. \nHe told me about the FEMA team that was coming in, about the FBI, about \nlaw enforcement, all having to do with the tragedy, and asked if there \nwas anything more that I could think of that could be done from the \nFederal level. Of course, I told the President there was nothing else I \ncould think of that could happen, and I proceeded back to Oklahoma.\n  When you see something like this that happens and you see the \nresources that are poured in from the Federal Government, the State \ngovernment, the city government, but then most of all from the \nindividuals, it is, indeed, heart warming. I agree with Billy Graham, \nduring the memorial service, when he made the statement that it draws \nus together, it brings out the best in people when a tragedy of this \nnature takes place. It is one thing to watch it on the television, and \nit is another thing to experience it knowing that you have personal \nfriends that are \n[[Page S5625]] inside the building. And as we speak today, I have \npersonal friends that are inside the building. It was 5 days ago--5 \ndays and 1 hour ago--that the blast went off. When you look at the \nbuilding and see that it happened from the north side, the lower half \nof the building on the south side is still intact to some degree. I \nhave hope and faith that there will be some individuals who are still \nalive in the building.\n  But when I think back and remember the 4 days that I spent over \nthere, some of the experiences that we have had are very difficult to \ndescribe. My son is an orthopedic surgeon. There is a doctor who \npractices with him. The doctor had to go in and amputate a lady's leg, \nin order to extract her alive from the rubbish--it was a decision that \nshe had to make--with no anesthetic. Do you want to die or do you want \nus to take your leg off and pull you out? And she chose the leg.\n  On the first night when the rains came and it turned cold, I watched \nin cadence some 200 firemen marching down with all their regalia on--\ntheir crash helmets, their fire suits, their boots--knowing that 40 at \na time would have to go inside this building and crawl around on their \nhands and knees, not knowing whether the structure of the building \nwould hold up and allow them to remain alive. They did risk their \nlives. I was told that there was not one that went in that was ordered \nin. They all volunteered to do it. As you know, we have lost some lives \nof those who have been a part of the medical and rescue teams.\n  During this time, we had an occasion to look at where do we go from \nhere? I was asked by the President 2 hours after the blast, ``What \ncould be done to preclude something like this from happening?'' I have \ncome to the conclusion that nothing in terms of added security or \nnothing in terms of taking away more freedoms is going to preclude some \nmad person from doing something like this if he has his mind set on \ndoing it. This was a mobile unit, it was an explosion put together \nusing fertilizer, using things that are certainly legal on the market. \nAnd if we were to take those things off the market, they would find \nsomething else, we know that. It would just make it more challenging to \nthem.\n  I think that if we try to approach this providing more security, we \nare wasting our time. However, I do think there are some things that \ncan be done. Senator Nickles, Senator Dole and I have submitted a \nresolution which we will be voting on in just a few minutes.\n  The resolution calls for condemning the violence in the strongest \npossible terms. We send condolences to the families. It applauds the \nrescue workers and supports the death penalty and commends the \nPresident and the Attorney General for their quick action. But it also \npledges to approve legislation to combat terrorism.\n  I remember in 1990 when we had the airport security bill. I had an \namendment on the floor--at that time, it was in the other body--to have \nthe death penalty in cases where a terrorist was carrying out a \nhijacking and it resulted in a death. You never heard so many bleeding \nhearts in your life standing up saying, ``You can't do that, that's \ninhumane.'' I believe something like that today will pass. While \nnothing good comes from tragedies like this, if anything good were to \ncome, it would be that we are going to be able to get tough on these \nguys and actually punish them.\n  I look at our system--I am not a lawyer--but when I see Roger Dale \nStafford, of the Sirloin Stockade murder, sitting there watching color \nTV year after year, when I see that it takes an average of 9\\1/2\\ years \nto carry out an execution, then something is wrong.\n  I had a debate during the course of this with Mr. Ron Cubie, who is \nthe defense lawyer in the World Trade Center case. He was contending \nthat the 1994 crime bill was one that could take care of problems like \nthis, that it provided the death penalty in case of terrorism. That is \nnot true. The 1994 crime bill was a farce. It did not provide any \nexclusionary rule reform. It did not provide any habeas corpus reform. \nSo while they had on record the death penalty, they did not do anything \nabout the endless delays that keeps the invocation of the death penalty \nfrom becoming a reality.\n  That being the case, there is no deterrent. It is no deterrent for a \nterrorist who is proposing to do something as was done in Oklahoma 5 \ndays ago.\n If he thinks the very worst scenario, the worst thing that can happen \nto him, is that he is going to wait 9\\1/2\\ years and then be executed, \nhe looks at our system and laughs at our system.\n\n  I am one of those rare individuals who honestly believes in his own \nheart that punishment is a deterrent to crime. And when we wait for the \npunishment, long delayed periods, many of those people are waiting in \nan environment that is more livable than the environment that they are \naccustomed to. And to many of the people who might be involved from \nsome other nations, Middle Eastern nations, that is not a deterrent. I \nhave long sensed, in the years that I spent in the other body, that one \nof the problems we have in combating crime in this country is that the \nmajority of people in Congress prior to the election of November 8 \nhonestly did not believe in their hearts that punishment was a \ndeterrent to crime. Now we have the ACLU and these organizations \nsitting around saying that we are so concerned about these poor people \nwho are involved in these crimes. We have been much more concerned \nabout the criminals than we have been about the victims.\n  Mr. President, that is something that is going to change. Maybe it \ntook this tragedy in Oklahoma to make that change. I suspect that is \nthe case. There are some bills that have been introduced prior to this \ntragedy--one was introduced by Senators Biden and Specter--that are \ngoing to do something about our ability to use resources out there to \nbring people to justice. Wiretapping for law enforcement officers to \nuse. Is that an invasion of privacy? Yes, maybe it is. But somebody has \nto do something about it. We have a lot of procedural things that can \nbe done that are addressed in that legislation that I think should \npass.\n  I think the resolution submitted by my colleague from Oklahoma, \nSenator Nickles, and our majority leader, Senator Dole, and others, is \ngoing to set the stage for the passage of tough legislation, providing \ntough and swift penalties for those people in America that are involved \nin terrorist activities or those people who are proposing to become \ninvolved in any other crime.\n  I think that it may be that we will look back 10 years from now and \nsay that because of those individuals that died painful deaths out in \nOklahoma, maybe that resulted in doing something about crime in \nAmerica.\n  I do not think that it is over yet. As we speak today, there are \nfirefighters and rescue workers crawling through the rubbish on their \nhands and knees, hearing the cracks. When you walk by, as Senator \nNickles and I did, and see the human flesh that is on jagged pieces of \niron--my office is located three blocks away, my Senate office in \nOklahoma City. Our windows were blasted out. It is very difficult to \nexplain to people the magnitude of that explosion--one that they \noriginally said was a 1,200-pound explosion. They now say it had to be \n5,000 pounds. To put that in perspective, in World War II, that was \nabout 10 of the largest nonatomic bombs they used in the war. And this \nwas all perpetrated by one or two deranged minds, who somehow feel \npeople had to be murdered to prove some type of a point.\n  Lastly, I am going to hope that those individuals--and there are some \naround--who would try to exploit this tragedy into saying that we were \nwrong in the elections of 1994 in rebelling against some of the \nintrusions into our lives by Government, or that somehow this \nphilosophy is tied into this far extreme fringe right wing that appears \nto be responsible for this tragedy, when in fact the revolution, as I \nhave referred to it, that took place in the ballot box on November 8, \n1994, should not be reversed and people should not try to exploit this \ntragedy in reversing it.\n  Finally, I want to commend those who have joined me and those whom I \nhave joined in putting together this resolution. I am sure it will pass \nat noon today. I think that will be the predicate for doing something \nvery meaningful about this type of activity in America.\n  As we speak, there is a funeral taking place in Oklahoma City. It is \nfor a daughter of a very close, personal friend of Don Nickles and \nmyself. There will be many more funerals. I \n[[Page S5626]] think the Nation will be standing by and watching. I am \nsure that all the Nation grieves with us. I have been called by people \nnot just from all over the Nation but all over the world. We should \ntake any action necessary to make sure that something like this does \nnot happen again. It has been said many times that if it can happen in \nthe heartland of America, in Oklahoma City, it could happen anywhere. \nNo one is immune.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague, Senator \nInhofe, for his statement and appreciate his assistance in putting this \nresolution together. It is with a sense of sadness that we have this \nresolution before the Senate today. We will be voting on it at 12 \no'clock. I wish that we were not here. I wish the tragic disaster that \nhappened last Wednesday, April 19, had not happened. The deadliest \nterrorist attack that ever happened on our soil happened in Oklahoma \nCity at 9 o'clock.\n  This resolution is cosponsored by Senators Inhofe, Dole, and Daschle, \nand a total of 75 of our colleagues have cosponsored. My guess is that \nmany more will join in cosponsoring by the time we finish our vote.\n  This resolution speaks for the Senate but really speaks for America \nwhen it says we want to condemn this type of violence. It is a cowardly \nact, an evil act, one that is responsible for at least 80 deaths that \nnow have been confirmed, with 150 missing and will probably be \nrecovered in the next couple of days. Most of those are expected to be \nfatalities. In excess of 400 were injured. I visited some of those \ninjured. Some were injured very severely. Some will be significantly \ninjured for the rest of their lives as a result of this cowardly \nterrorist attack.\n  Mr. President, it becomes very personal when you see and know the \nindividuals affected. Senator Inhofe mentioned that we have a very good \nfriend who is having a funeral today for his daughter. I talked to \nanother friend today whose wife almost lost her life. She is a very \ngood friend of ours as well. I talked to another friend who actually \nworked for the Senate, worked for my colleague, Senator Boren, for \nseveral years. His child was almost killed and is still listed in \ncritical condition.\n  At the memorial service or prayer service on Sunday, I talked to a \nlot of the victims. I talked to one young couple that lost two \nchildren, and that experience makes it all become very personal. I \ntalked to two children who lost their mother.\n  I talked to an individual who lost a spouse. The stories go on and \non. This is a real tragedy of immense proportions with great damage \ninflicted on those lives.\n  This resolution expresses our condolences, sympathies and prayers for \nthe families of the victims, to the injured and also for the deceased. \nWe pray for them and we want them to know of our outrage for the crime \nand our compassion for those individuals as well.\n  This resolution states our strong support for the President and for \nthe law enforcement officials who are doing everything within their \npower to apprehend and try and punish those people who are responsible, \nand it states that we support the President and the Attorney General as \nthey say this is certainly a case in which the death penalty is \nappropriate. I concur with that.\n  This resolution also goes a little bit further and says we want to \nthank the volunteers and the countless people who have put so much into \nalleviating the pain. Senator Inhofe mentioned some of the \nfirefighters. I remember I was also in Dallas, and I flew up in the \nfirst plane available, returning to Oklahoma City, and I was \naccompanied by three firefighters who donated their time and money. \nThey wanted to be there to help rescue innocent people. We have met \ncountless people, and not just from Oklahoma. We have had firefighters \nacross our State, but we met firefighters from Arizona and from \nMaryland and from all corners of the country. They are working \nunbelievable hours, and it is not easy work. I might mention that the \nwork was very difficult at that time and very dangerous.\n It is not any easier now, because the likelihood of finding survivors \nis diminishing by the day.\n\n  So their task right now is very gruesome, very difficult, and it \ncontinues to be dangerous. And our heartfelt thanks--and I am speaking \non behalf of all Oklahomans, but really all Americans--for their \ncourageous efforts.\n  When we see this type of evil deed, it makes people think, how in the \nworld could society degenerate to such a low level, or how could evil \nbe so prevalent to have such an act of violence destroy so many \ninnocent lives.\n  I might also mention, maybe the light that comes after this evil is \nto see so much good that has come from so many people, so many \nthousands of people, all across the State of Oklahoma and all across \nthe country, who are not only condemning the violence but reaching out \nto help those people who have been injured, to help those families that \nhave been torn apart, to comfort and console.\n  It has been heartwarming to hear President Clinton's remarks, \nReverend Graham's remarks, Governor Keating, Mayor Norick, all of which \nI will say did an outstanding job not only at the prayer service, ``the \ntime for healing,'' as Mrs. Keating referred to it, but really to reach \nout to the families and to comfort and console those families and let \nthem know that we really do care.\n  It is very heartwarming and it made us feel good, and as Reverend \nGraham said, ``Good will overcome evil.'' We want to thank the \nvolunteers, all the people that worked in the hospitals. I talked to a \nsurvivor's family, and he said had it not been for the outstanding work \nof so many volunteers and the rescue operation, his wife would not have \nsurvived, and she is now anticipated to be a healthy survivor.\n  We want to thank those countless people who risked their lives and \nwere willing to make that kind of sacrifice for other people. It makes \nme very proud of my State. It makes me very proud of my country. \nInstead of this being the low mark which devastated not only our city \nand our State and our Nation, I think it is giving us the chance to \nrally around and say, yes, good will prevail. There are a lot of good \npeople in this country, and people are reaching out and trying to \nassist and trying to help. We thank them for that.\n  Mr. President, I want to address just another item, a development \nthat has happened in the last day or so that I find very troubling in \nrelation to this event. The issue is pointedly noted and cautioned \nagainst by columnist George Will, who noted that an attempt to locate \nthe cause of a lunatic's action is ``apt to become a temptation to \nextract partisan advantage over spilled blood.'' With respect to this \ntragedy, the contempt for those people who try to gain political \nadvantage from the Oklahoma City bombing will only be exceeded by the \ncontempt for the perpetrators of this crime.\n  Mr. President, where should our hearts be? What should our goals be? \nWhere should our compassion be? Surely it should be to reach out to \nthose families that are affected, and that has to be our focus, and \nthen to arrest and convict and punish those people who are responsible \nfor this atrocious, cowardly, evil act.\n  Yet, even before the missing have been recovered, I see politicians \nand some pundits contemptibly jockeying for position, trying to blame \nthe other side for the evil actions of a few individual criminals.\n  The bombing in my State was not the work of the left or the right, of \nconservatives or liberals, Republicans or Democrats, or even right-wing \nextremists, as some people would say. The Reverend Billy Graham laid \nthe blame on the proper place, noting that the tragic event has proved \nagain that ``Satan is very real, and he has great power.'' He noted \nthat the Bible tells us evil is real and the human heart is capable of \nlimitless evil when it is cut off from God and cut off from moral law. \nI agree 100 percent.\n  I am ashamed, I am bothered, even appalled by hearing politicians or \npundits who would stoop so low as to play politics with this tragedy.\n  A reporter on a talk show, Juan Williams, just recently linked the \nattack to Republicans in Congress saying, ``It's the same kind of idea \nthat has fueled so much of the right-wing triumph over the agenda here \nin Washington.''\n  In an attempt to blame Republican leaders in general, columnist Carl \nRowan was quoted in the Washington \n[[Page S5627]] Post as saying, ``I am absolutely certain the harsher \nrhetoric of the Gingriches and the Doles * * * creates a climate of \nviolence in America.''\n  I do not know who the President was talking about yesterday when he \nsaid ``loud and angry voices'' spread hate and ``leave the impression \nthat, by their very words, that violence is acceptable.''\n  Mr. President, this tragedy took the lives of innocent young children \nand adults alike. Surely in the effort to lay blame, our focus must \nrest with the criminals--the evil, cowardly, individuals who took the \nlives of so many innocent people. Surely, the focus of our hearts and \nour passion and our prayers must remain with the families that have \nbeen devastated.\n  I just hope and pray that those people who may be tempted to extract \npartisan advantage from this unbelievable act will look inwardly and \nfind compassion in their hearts and not resort to playing politics with \nthe lost lives of my fellow Oklahomans.\n  If you were there--Senator Inhofe and I were there, Governor Keating \nand others--and walked around in the ruins, and talked to the firemen \nand talked to the rescue people who were struggling to find additional \nsurvivors, the very idea that someone might be playing politics with \nthis is almost beyond comprehension. It is offensive. I hope we do not \nhear it again.\n  Let us find those people responsible and punish them and show \ncompassion for the families. Those families have had their lives \nruined. They lost loved ones. They lost a child, a daughter, a spouse. \nThey lost a father or a mother. Their lives in many cases have been \nmore than devastated by a tragedy from which they may not be able to \nrecover. If it were not for the grace and comfort of God, they may not \nbe able to recover.\n  This Senate, by our resolution today, I think, will be expressing \ncomfort and consolation to those families, our outrage at this \nunbelievable, unspeakable crime, and our sense that we in Congress want \nthe law enforcement people to apprehend them and to punish them.\n  We compliment the law enforcement people for the outstanding job that \nthey have done. We compliment the rescue efforts that are going on \ntoday and will probably be going on for some days ahead. We compliment \nour political leaders from President Clinton, Governor Keating, and the \ncity officials, Mayor Norick, and many others who have put in so many \ntireless efforts, including fire officials and others.\n  We want them to know we support them and we appreciate their efforts. \nWe appreciate the sacrifices they made to show that good can overcome \nevil. I think we have seen that in my State. I am very proud of the \nState of Oklahoma and our country as a result. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may consume \nsuch time as I may require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/25/senate-section/article/S5624-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5627-S5631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SENATOR JOHN STENNIS\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President once again, the silver cord has been loosened \nand the golden bowl has been broken: ``Then shall the dust return to \nthe earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave \nit.'' These words from Ecclesiastes--spoken probably ten centuries \nbefore the birth of Christ--bare the indelible stamp of permanency. \nSomewhere, every day, every hour, every minute, they are brought home \nto someone, and in their train, follow the inevitable pain and sorrow \nand tears, that we all must bear when loved ones and friends depart \nfrom us in this earthly life. The angel of death is no respecter of \npersons, and each of us will one day hear the beating of his wings--\n\n     Leaves have their time to fall,\n     And flowers to wither at the north wind's breath,\n     And stars to set--but all,\n     Thou hast all seasons for thine own, O Death!\n\n  Mr. President, it was with sorrow that I heard the sad news over the \npast weekend that our former colleague and friend, John Cornelius \nStennis, had passed away at the age of 93. When I came to the United \nStates Senate in January 1959, John Stennis was a Member of this body, \nand we served together 30 years--until he retired at the close of the \n100th Congress in 1989. So, it is with sadness that I pay tribute to \nthe memory of this departed colleague today. As we grow older, we are \nobliged to bid farewell to some friend almost every day, and thus does \nthe circle gradually, and all too rapidly, diminish; for--\n\n     There is no union here of hearts\n     That finds not here an end.\n\n  Mr. President, John Stennis was a man who achieved greatly in life. \nFor 41 years and 2 months, he represented a great and patriotic \nconstituency in this Chamber, where some of the greatest men of the \nRepublic have served and aspired to serve, and that achievement alone \nwould mark him as a man among men. When we add to this the fact that he \nserved as a member of the Mississippi State House of Representatives \nfor 4 years, as district prosecuting attorney from 1932 to 1937, and as \na circuit judge from 1937 to 1947, we begin to realize what a wonderful \ncareer we are remembering today--60 years in the public service--in \nelective positions, where neighbors and friends, who are often more \ncritical than strangers, are the electors! What more could be said by \nway of eulogy? Volumes could be written and less said. Yet, that is the \nrecord of our former colleague and friend, who, in the merciful \ndispensations of an all-wise Providence, has now passed on to the other \nside.\n  John Cornelius Stennis was born near DeKalb, Kemper County, \nMississippi, on August 3, 1901. He attended the county schools; \ngraduated from the Mississippi State College in 1923, and graduated \nfrom the University of Virginia Law School in 1928. He was admitted to \nthe bar in 1928 and commenced practice in his home town of DeKalb. I \nhad the honor of serving on the Arms Services Committee and on the \nAppropriations Committee with Senator Stennis, of both of which \ncommittees he had served as chairman before his voluntary retirement at \nthe close of the 100th Congress.\n  John Stennis was an honest man, and he was a good man, as good men go \nin this life--plain and modest. He was amiable, courteous, and \ncourtly--a southern Christian gentleman, in every sense of the word. He \nwas intellectually honest, a man of great moral rectitude, simple in \nhis habits, and completely devoid of hypocrisy. He was a Senator who \nloved the Senate and who was dedicated to its traditions. He was \nconscious at all times, of the great trust confided in him by the \npeople he represented, and he carried in his heart a great reverence \nfor this institution and for the Constitution of our country. His was a \nsteady hand, an upright character. He was a man of justice and fairness \nto all. He was unassuming in his manner, sincere and firm in his \nconvictions. Devoid of envy, he was ambitious only to serve the cause \nof justice and humanity, and being of, for, and from the people, he \ngave his life to their service. In him, the great people of Mississippi \nhad an ever faithful friend and servant.\n  Mr. President, John Stennis was not a large man physically. He was \nactually rather slight. But he was a giant. The breadth of his \ncharacter was huge, and the steel of his courage was formidable. \nNothing defeated him--not the bruises of the legislative \nbattlefield; not the frightful attack by thugs in the \nstreet, who almost caused his death, near his home; not the death of \nhis beloved wife; not the loss of his leg to cancer.\n  Nothing defeated him. Nothing held him down for long. He always got \nup again and went on. He struggled, but he prevailed and endured. And \nhe did it all with a quiet, unassuming dignity.\n  He was courtly--ever the gentleman. I called him a Senator's Senator. \nHe represented everything fine about the Senate and everything fine \nabout the human spirit. He was the cream of all things decent that one \nlooks for in a leader and in a man.\n  Had he lived in another age he would have been just as great, as \nrespected, as beloved, and as revered as he has been in his own time. \nHe would have enhanced any company in any situation in any age.\n  But most of all, the indomitable fortitude stands out. There is a \ncourage \n[[Page S5628]] possessed by some men which is extraordinary--far beyond \nwhat most individuals can ever muster in even their best and bravest \nmoments. It is rarely accompanied by bombast and breast beating. It is \ncarried with a quiet and calm demeanor. No outward show is necessary. \nIn his case, the kindly visage gave no clue to the inner steel. He bore \nhis duties and his crises, his joys and his sorrows, with equal \ndignity.\n  But it was awesome actually to watch. How many times have I come to \nthis Chamber for a vote, bone-weary, and at some dreadful hour in the \nmorning, and seen him sitting straight as an arrow at his desk! There \nhe would be, 17 years my senior, frail, missing one leg, with a \npleasant greeting for all, in spite of the hour. In this age of clock-\nwatching, and quality-of-life advocation, that kind of dedication may \nseem an anachronism. But John Stennis was dedication and duty \nepitomized in the human flesh. He showed us by his example. He never \nlectured, never said, ``Do as I do.'' He just lived an exemplary life, \nand that was enough to teach all who were fortunate enough to be around \nto learn. He taught us how to be Senators, he taught us how to bear \nsadness and brutality without bitterness or surrender or despair. He \ndid so by just being what he was.\n  Mr. President, all that even the greatest of scientists can do is to \ntry to interpret and apply the laws, the immutable laws, the eternal \nlaws of God. Scientists cannot create matter and they cannot create \nlife. They can mold and develop and shape and use them, but they cannot \ncall them into being. They are compelled to admit the truth of the old \nnursery rhyme, which I am sure the Presiding Officer and the other \ndistinguished Senator from Oklahoma will remember along with me:\n\n     Nor you, nor I, nor nobody knows,\n     how oats, peas, beans, and barley grows.\n\n  But the Scriptures tell us of the laws of God, and reveal to us the \nSource from whence this Earth, the universe, and all of us who dwell \nhere--for a split second, as it were--between two eternities: ``In the \nbeginning, God created the heaven and the earth.'' The Scriptures also \nreveal to us that God created man from the dust of the ground, and \n``breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a \nliving soul.'' God then gave Adam a helpmate, Eve, and from those \nancient parents, we have all descended, and from them, we have all \ninherited death. Only a Milton could so incisively provide a fitting \nepilogue to man's fall from grace.\n\n     They, looking back,\n     all the eastern side beheld of Paradise,\n     so late their happy seat,\n     waved over by that flaming brand; the gate\n     with dreadful faces thronged and fiery arms.\n     Some natural tears they dropped,\n     but wiped them soon;\n     the world was all before them where to choose\n     their place of rest, and Providence their guide.\n     They, hand in hand, with wondering steps and slow,\n     through Eden took their solitary way.\n\n  As so, it is our inevitable lot to die. But the Scriptures also tell \nus that we may live again in that long lost paradise from whence our \nparents came. There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name appears in \nextra-Biblical texts as early as 2000 years before Christ. His name was \nJob, and from his patient, suffering lips came the age-old question, \n``If a man die, shall he live again?'', and later from his lips came \nthe answer to his own question: ``Oh, that my words were written and \nengraved with an iron pen upon a ledge of rock forever, for I know that \nmy Redeemer liveth and some day He shall stand upon the earth; and \nthough after my skin worms destroy this Body, yet, in my flesh shall I \nsee God; whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and \nnot another.''\n  Mr. President, many years ago I read a story of an old Anglo-Saxon \nking who had his barons at a great banquet. They were eating their \nvenison and quaffing their ale. It was a bitter night outside. The \nstorm raged. The snow was falling thick and fast. Suddenly, into the \nrude chamber in which they were gathered, there flew through some crack \nor crevice in the roof a little bird. Blinded by the light and \nperplexed, it flew wildly here and there and beat itself against the \nrude beams. Finally, it found another crevice and out it went again \ninto the night. The king, advanced in years, spoke to his barons and \nsaid,\n\n     That bird is like a life;\n     it comes from out of the night.\n     It flits and flies around a little while,\n     blinded by the light,\n     and then it goes back out into the night again.\n\n  Mr. President, as we witness the passing of a great and good man like \nJohn Stennis, we may well take appraisal of our own public and private \nmerits and remember that we, too, only flit about for a little while, \nour voices resound in this Chamber for a few days or months or years, \nand then we are gone. These things are evanescent. Real substantial \nqualities of honesty, integrity, gentleness, modesty, and generosity \nwill make the life of John Stennis remembered when much of what we say \nand do here in this Chamber shall have passed away and perished. John \nStennis is gone,\n\n     . . . with your skysail set\n     For ports beyond the margin of the stars . . .\n\n  And those of us who had the honor and privilege of serving with him \nmay say of him:\n\n     His life was gentle,\n     and the elements so mixed in him\n     that Nature might stand up and say to all the world,\n     ``This was a man.''\n\n  To the family and friends of John Cornelius Stennis, my wife Erma and \nI extend our deepest sympathy.\n\n     I saw the sun sink in the golden west,\n     No angry cloud obscured its latest ray.\n     Around the couch on which it sank to rest\n     Shone all the splendor of a summer day.\n     And long, though lost to view, that radiant light,\n     Reflected from the sky, delayed the night.\n\n     Thus, when a good man's life comes to a close,\n     No doubts arise to cloud his soul with gloom.\n     But faith triumphant on each feature glows,\n     And benedictions fill the sacred room.\n     And long do men his virtues wide proclaim,\n     While generations rise to bless his name.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to compliment my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Byrd, for the tribute to our colleague, Senator \nStennis, who served in this body so ably, so well, for so long. His \nservice of 41 years--only the Senator from West Virginia would know who \nhas exceeded that besides Senator Hayden, I guess--but he had a \nremarkable tenure in the Senate.\n  I had the pleasure of serving with Senator Stennis. He was a person \nthat had enormous credibility and reputation prior to my coming to the \nSenate going back for many years. He was even referred to in the Senate \nas a person known as the ethical watch guard of the Senate, and \ncertainly a Southern gentleman in every single way. He was a real asset \nto this body, certainly to the State of Mississippi and to our country, \nas well. We shall all miss him, but not forget the contributions that \nhe made to his State and country.\n  I compliment my colleague from West Virginia for a beautiful tribute \nto a wonderful colleague and Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my friend.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, today the Senate formally adds its voice of \ncondemnation and outrage of the mindless and heartless massacre carried \nout in Oklahoma City last week. I join my colleagues in stating in \nabsolute and unequivocable terms that such acts will never be tolerated \nin this country and that we resolve to do all in our power to make sure \nthat the perpetrators of this heinous crime are found and brought to \njustice. In our society, the rule of law reigns over the rule of terror \nand it follows that swift and assured retribution must await those who \nharbor the thought that such acts can somehow alter that equation. The \nvictims deserve no less; the criminals can expect no more.\n  As this tragic event causes us to pause and reflect upon a myriad of \nquestions as to how and why such an event could occur, I urge us all to \nexercise the temperance and reason which are the characteristics of a \ncivilized society. This most uncivil and unhuman of acts cannot be \nexplained simply or logically by rational thought. In the rush to \npinpoint blame and cause, already occurring it seems in the public \ndiscourse about this incident, too often we overstep the mark and \ncompound the harm already suffered. For the moment, let us attend to \nthe most immediate tasks at hand, that of the continued efforts to \nsearch for survivors, to \n[[Page S5629]] care for the wounded, to comfort the families and \nfriends who have lost loved ones, and to apprehend and punish those \nresponsible. That is more than enough for now and it will keep us busy \nfor days to come. Then we will have the time for reflection on the \nbroader, though not any less important, questions as to what we may be \nable to do to thwart such acts in the future.\n  My heart goes out to those families and friends grievously affected \nby this unthinkable tragedy. The losses they have suffered are \nimmeasurable and I join the entire country in expressing the \nconsolation and sympathy. I also salute the heroic efforts being made \nto deal with this event and in particular commend the Oklahoma City \nPolice, Fire, and Emergency Medical Departments, President Clinton, \nAttorney General Reno, the Justice Department, the FBI, FEMA, and all \nothers for their excellent work in dealing with this incident. I pledge \nwhatever assistance I may be able to give and will work to do what I \ncan to diminish the chances of such an event from occurring in the \nfuture.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to support Senate Resolution 110 \nand join with my colleagues in denouncing the violent attack on Federal \nworkers and their children last week in Oklahoma City.\n  Our world is full of daily tragedies, so much so, that each of us \nruns the risk of growing numb to the pain. But this violence struck \nclose to home in many ways. Those murdered by the cowardly terrorists \nwho planned and carried out this bombing appeared to be targeted \nbecause they worked for the U.S. Government, or were the children of \nthese workers. I urge the administration to employ the strongest \nefforts under law and our Constitution to bring the killers to justice.\n  These killings also struck home in another way for me. In my current \nrole as chairman, and previously as vice chairman of the Committee on \nIndian Affairs in the Senate, I have seen firsthand the squalid housing \nconditions that plague many Indian and native American communities. I \nhave also noted the many fine efforts of dedicated Federal employees \nwho try to counteract these conditions with funds and authorities that \nare all-too-often inadequate to address the overwhelming need.\n  Among those killed in this bombing were a number of Federal employees \nwho have dedicated their lives to improving Indian and Alaska native \nhousing conditions. Killed in the blast, or still missing or \nunaccounted for as of yesterday, are 10 individuals who have played \nvery prominent roles in supporting the development of housing \nopportunities in Indian communities. While I do not give up hope that \nthose missing or unaccounted for will still be located alive, I do wish \nto take this opportunity to describe what I know about 10 of these \nemployees.\n  These 10 people have worked for the Office of Native American \nPrograms [ONAP] within the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment [HUD], or for the HUD Area Counsel's Office on Indian \nhousing issues. Under Secretary Cisneros' leadership, HUD recently had \nannounced a substantial streamlining of its administrative structures \nso that it could dramatically bolster its efforts to improve housing \nconditions in Indian communities. These employees were part of the new \nthinking underway at HUD, and I, and many tribal leaders, will sorely \nmiss each one of these HUD workers and their dedicated efforts.\n  Most Americans would be shocked if they saw the housing conditions \nthat Indian and Alaska Native families must endure day in and day out. \nApproximately 90,000 Indian families are homeless or underhoused. One \nout of every five Indian homes lacks complete plumbing facilities. \nAccording to 1990 census figures, 18 percent of all American Indian \nhouseholds on reservations are ``severely crowded.'' The comparable \nfigure for non-Indians is 2 percent. Likewise, while 33 percent of all \nreservation households are considered crowded, the comparable figure \nfor all households nationally is 5 percent. The typical Indian home on \na reservation has 4.4 rooms, nearly a whole room less than the national \nmedian of 5.3 rooms.\n  These are the conditions that the 10 Oklahoma HUD workers who are \nconfirmed dead or missing sought to improve. I am outraged that their \nconstructive efforts are cut short by the destructive acts of cowardly \nterrorists.\n  HUD officials have informed me that ONAP maintained a staff of 26 in \nOklahoma City. Another 10 Oklahoma City HUD employees, including the \nOffice of Area Counsel, provided support to the native American \nprograms. I know from the reports of Indian tribes in Oklahoma, Kansas, \nLouisiana, and Texas that ONAP staff had developed a very cooperative \nand productive relationship with the native American communities there. \nI am told that the Oklahoma HUD staff have been exemplary in their \nprofessional respect for the rich cultural traditions of their \ncounterparts among tribal Government staff. It was not unusual to see \nONAP staff at pow-wows and other native American events on the \nweekends, joining with those they served in celebration of the beauty \nand enduring cultures of these communities.\n  The bombing exacted an extremely heavy toll on ONAP personnel. As of \nyesterday, two staff members were confirmed as casualties, George \nHoward and Lanny Scroggins. Three additional staff members were still \nunaccounted for--Jules Valdez, Don Burns, and Dave Burkett. From the \nArea Counsel's Office, Clarence Wilson, Mike Weaver, Kim Clark, and Lee \nSells remain unaccounted for. Susan Ferrell, the lead attorney for \nnative American programs and one of HUD's top Indian law attorneys, has \nbeen confirmed as a casualty.\n  Mr. President, these staff were some of HUD's best. They were \ndedicated, loyal, hardworking, and personally committed to the goal of \nproviding decent, safe, and sanitary housing and community development \nfor this Nation's native American communities. Their contributions over \nthe years have been extremely important to HUD's vital work in Indian \ncountry. Their loss at the hand of these senseless killers means the \ntribes and Indian families they served in that region will pay a high \npersonal cost. Equally high will be the price paid by the dedicated \ncolleagues left behind in HUD's ONAP and Area Counsel's Office. Many of \nthese survivors carry physical injuries from the blast, some quite \nserious. All of them carry emotional scars that understandably run \nquite deep. I hope these survivors can find courage for these days.\n  The bombing was the act of cowards. I condemn it in the strongest of \npossible terms. I mourn the loss it has caused to the family members of \nits victims, to its survivors who now must live with this great pain, \nand to HUD's Indian offices and the Indian tribes who must now piece \nback together a program that has always struggled against nearly \ninsurmountable odds.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, like every Member of this body and \nmillions of people around the globe, I deplore in the strongest \npossible terms the senseless murders of the innocent children and \nadults in Oklahoma City. This was an atrocity and a barbaric act \nagainst humanity that truly shocks the conscience. I have joined in \nvoting for the resolution presented by the majority leader and the \nminority leader because I wholeheartedly agree with virtually every \nstatement made in the resolution.\n  Congress must condemn, in the strongest possible terms, the heinous \nbombing attack against innocent children and adults.\n  Congress should sent its heartfelt condolences to the families, \nfriends, and loved ones of those whose lives were taken away and \ninjured by this abhorrent and cowardly act; and express its hopes for \nthe rapid and complete recovery of those wounded in the bombing.\n  Congress should commend the rapid actions taken by the President to \nprovide assistance to the victims and apprehend the perpetrators of \nthis horrible crime. I also believe that we should be sure that Federal \nlaws aimed at combating acts of terrorism are comprehensive and \neffective in preventing and punishing these acts.\n  At the same time, I must express one reservation concerning one \nprovision of the resolution that indicates cogresssional support for \nthe President and the Attorney General's position that Federal \nprosecutors will seek the maximum penalty authorized by law, including \nthe death penalty, for those responsible. I am opposed to the death \npenalty, but I recognize that current \n[[Page S5630]] federal law provides for the death penalty in cases such \nas Oklahoma City.\n  I understand the feelings which lead people to call out for \nimposition of the death penalty in heinous cases, such as this. \nHowever, I do not believe that it is generally the Senate's role to \nmake a statement on what specific type of penalty the prosecutors \nshould seek in any particular case, whether it be the death penalty of \nlife imprisonment or whatever. Congress should not endeavor to step \nacross the line which separates the judicial functions of the United \nStates to attempt to direct prosecutors in the discharge of their \nfunctions. The law currently provides for the death penalty in this \ncase and regardless of whether I support or oppose these provisions in \nexisting law, it is for the Federal prosecutors, not Congress, to \ndetermine what penalty should be sought and ultimately, it is for a \njury of Americans to make the final judgment as to guilt and punishment \nfor those who are brought to trial in this case.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to ask my colleagues to \ncontinue mourning the brave and innocent men, women, and children who \nlost their lives this past Wednesday in Oklahoma City.\n  As I speak, I know that search and rescue workers continue to dig \ntoward the bottom of the Alfred Murrah Federal Building where the \nbodies of more Federal workers lay. These public servants paid the \nultimate price in the service of their country.\n  Mr. President, most of the victims of this tragedy were men and women \nof our Federal Government. These people put their lives on the line \njust by being associated with the U.S. Government. These were common, \ndecent human beings that were trying to make their Government work \nbetter. I urge my colleagues to always remember the countless, nameless \nFederal workers who work long, hard hours, committed to making our \nsystem of government work for the better who put their lives on the \nline for the U.S. Government.\n  It was also an American community--working women and men with \nfamilies providing for their children, who were affected by this \nhorrible tragedy. The past week, this American community has come \ntogether as a shining example of why America is so strong. Local police \nand firefighters, Federal law enforcement agents of the FBI, ATF, \nSecret Service, and Federal Emergency Management Agency personnel show \nus what Americans want from their public servants: efficiency, \ncompetence, cooperation. Americans rallying to overcome a crisis that \nthreatens their stability. This is the American spirit.\n  I urge my colleagues to keep the victims and their families in your \nthoughts and honor them with your prayers. Thank you, Mr. President, \nand I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nexpressing our outrage at the senseless, brutal murders and injuries \nsustained by defenseless citizens and children in Oklahoma City last \nweek.\n  We all know that Oklahoma City, and indeed our Nation, will never be \nthe same again. We all know that we will never have all the answers as \nto why something this tragic can happen. But one thing we can know is \nthat we will not rest until the perpetrators of this heinous act are \nbrought to justice.\n  The resolution we will approve overwhelmingly today is just the first \nstep Congress will take in attempting to address this tragedy. We will \nwork with the administration to pass legislation expanding the FBI's \npowers to combat such acts of terrorism. We will work to do all we can \nto see that no one has to go through this experience again.\n  Mr. President, there are not words to express the sorrow we feel for \nthe families who have lost loved ones. No one can prepare themselves \nfor a tragedy of this magnitude. No one can prepare themselves to see \ninnocent infants robbed of their futures. And no one can prepare \nthemselves for the grief and loss we know those personally affected by \nthis tragedy will experience for the rest of their lives.\n  One thing we can do is reach out to them, offer our prayers, our \ncomfort and support. As the President recently said, ``you have lost so \nmuch, but you have not lost everything. And you certainly have not lost \nAmerica, for we will stand with you for as many tomorrows as it \ntakes.''\n  In closing, Mr. President, I want to personally express my sincere \nthanks and appreciation for the tireless efforts of this \nadministration, the Oklahoma officials, the rescuers, investigators, \npolice officers, and firemen, our clergy, and so many thousands of \nothers who have given of themselves in this tragedy. They are all \nheroes and their work will never be forgotten, just as we as a nation \nwill never forget April 19, 1995.\n              militia groups and the oklahoma city bombing\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, 2 weeks from today, we mark the 50th \nanniversary of the Nazi surrender in World War II. And just a week ago, \nwe witnessed an event that should remind us all of just what we were \nfighting.\n  I am speaking, of course, of the bombing in Oklahoma City. Our \nsympathy and solidarity go out to the victims of this terrible crime \nand their families. And we learn that 50 years after the war, the \nbattle against hate is not over.\n  We Montanans like to call our State the ``last, best place.'' We take \npride in our low crime rate and our civil society. And we like to think \nwe are immune to the crime and violence that so sadly affects our \ncountry.\n  But we are not immune. Our easy-going ways now seem to attract some \nof the worst elements in our country. We find that anti-Semites, right-\nwing extremists, and terrorists believe they can find a home in our \nState.\n\n\n                      the militia and the freemen\n\n  In the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing, you may have heard \nabout the so-called Militia of Montana. Let me tell you something about \nthis group and its friends.\n  The Militia of Montana was founded by a few people associated with \nthe neo-Nazi Aryan Nations group. Their literature and videos talk \nabout international conspiracies, shadow governments, and banking \nelites--code words that anyone familiar with the history of anti-\nSemitism recognizes immediately.\n  Associated with the militia leaders is the even more extreme Freemen \nmovement. This group says in public that the income tax is illegal and \nthe Federal Government is a conspiracy. In private, it says people who \nare not white are beasts; the Bible was written for the white race.\n  With these organizations come hate, lawlessness, and terror.\n  The Federal Government and Federal officials are targets. Jews are \ntargets. We had a swastika painted on a house in Big Timber last month. \nA Jewish child taunted in Helena. Militia members have gone so far as \nto distribute hate literature--Nazi-style pamphlets called ``Strength \nof a Hero'' and ``Warrior Song''--in the Montana Legislature.\n  Women are targets. In the past year, fanatical opponents of abortion \nrights bombed a clinic in Kalispell and burned the Blue Mountain \nWomen's Clinic in Missoula to the ground.\n  And law enforcement is a target. Just a few weeks ago, seven armed \nmilitia members threatened the marshal in the small town of Darby with \nguns after he had pulled over one of them for driving in a car whose \nlicense plates expired 3 years ago. On the other side of the State, \nFreemen have posted bounties for law enforcement officials, saying they \nwere to be executed by hanging.\n  Thoughtless politicians and radio broadcasters encourage this by \nloose talk of revolution, and intemperate attacks on Federal \nbureaucrats--which is to say, our neighbors who work for USDA, the \nForest Service, and law enforcement. Some have even brought militia \nproposals before the Montana Legislature.\n  The results of this toleration for hate are obvious. In March, an \neastern Montana county attorney wrote me to say:\n\n       The more the federal and local law enforcement agencies \n     behave with a ``hands-off'' attitude, the more bold and \n     daring these groups become.\n\n  And a constituent from Ravalli County writes, just 9 days before the \nbombing:\n\n       You see Freemen with guns in the post office, grocery store \n     and gas stations. If it gets to any one of them that a person \n     doesn't like the ``Freemen,'' they will call or confront a \n     person face to face. They tell people that we are all going \n     to ``die like the Jews.''\n                    [[Page S5631]] no place for hate\n\n  The situation is serious. But if we face up to it, we can solve it \nbefore it gets worse.\n  The ringleaders of the hate groups are few in number. Garfield County \nAttorney Nick Murnion has studied them closely. He believes the Freemen \nand militia have no more than 25 to 30 core members around the State.\n  The hard-core leaders, in many cases, are common criminals. They \nrefuse to pay their taxes and will not live by the laws. Those who have \nbroken the laws should be arrested, tried and put in jail. And we can \ndo it if we give law enforcement the support it requires.\n  But dealing with the rank and file is a responsibility of the entire \ncommunity. Most militia members are not Nazis or potential terrorists--\nmerely loud, deluded people who are an embarrassment but not a threat. \nAnd all of us need to show them that hate has no place under Montana's \nbig sky, and no place in America.\n  Hate groups, threats of violence and racism must be met in the open. \nThey grow and spread in darkness and silence but they vanish in the \nsunlight. The entire American family must show them that they are not \nwelcome.\n\n\n                     the billings menorah movement\n\n  And that will work. I know, because I have seen it work. When the \nvast majority of ordinary, decent people stand together, the small \nnumber of haters and extremists are always defeated.\n  In November 1993, a group of skinheads came to a Jewish house in \nBillings, MT, and threw a bottle through the glass door. A few days \nlater they put a brick through the window of another Jewish house, with \na 5-year-old boy in the room. Then they smashed the windows of Catholic \nHigh School, which had a ``Happy Hanukah'' sign on its marquee.\n  Events like these can isolate their victims. They can silence people \nof good will and open broader campaigns of hate and violence. But that \ndid not happen. Instead, Billings rallied with the Jewish community.\n  The Billings Gazette printed up thousands of paper menorahs. People \nall over town pasted them in their windows as a sign of solidarity. \nBillings held the largest Martin Luther King Day march ever in our \nState. And the skinheads left town.\n  As good people again speak out, that will happen with the militias \nand Freemen too. They must know they are not welcome in our churches, \nour grocery stores, our towns. We must stand with law enforcement as \nthey track down clinic bombers and arrest radical tax protesters. And \nwhen the American family stands together against the hate groups, as \nBillings stood against the skinheads, they will vanish.\n  Mr. President, nothing will undo the pain in Oklahoma City. But the \nsuffering of the bombing victims and their families need not be in \nvain.\n  Let us reflect on this horrible event.\n  Let us remember the sacrifice our fathers made across the seas 50 \nyears ago.\n  And let us rededicate ourselves to ending hate here at home in \nAmerica.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/25/senate-section/article/S5627-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5631-S5635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      THE ENVIRONMENT OF EXTREMISM\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, on the matter of the extremism which the \ndistinguished Senator from Montana so thoughtfully addressed, I want to \njust address the environment; not necessarily the extremists, not the \nhate groups--I want to address our conduct, namely the public servants.\n  We read in the morning's paper, for example, where David Broder uses \nthat description of this Government here in Washington, the greatest \ngift to free people the world around, a representative form of \ngovernment that works so well--he uses the words of our distinguished \nSpeaker, ``the corrupt liberal welfare state.''\n  You know Mr. Gingrich is not going to blow up any buildings and \nneither is Senator Hollings. But what has come from my experience is a \nreaction against this particular environment, because it is created by \npollster politics.\n  I ran for 20 years without ever seeing a political poll. You \naddressed the issues as concern the citizenry, going down the Main \nStreet, out into the farms, the rural areas, the small towns, as well \nas the civic club meetings in the cities. You had a feel for what is \ngoing on. But that is not allowed today in the pollster world. What you \ndo is you take a poll, find out what they call the six or seven hot \nbutton issues, and take the popular side of those particular issues and \nblame everybody else.\n  Specifically, if you want to run for office up here in Washington, it \nhas gotten to an environment of running against the Government. This is \nsheer nonsense, but this is the fact. I think we are elected to make \nthis Government work. The approach of the environment, under the \ncontract and otherwise, is to get rid of the Government, dismantle it. \nIt is not needed. Cut the money so they cannot do the job or whatever \nelse it is. But as long as you can run against the Government, with the \ncry, ``The Government is not the solution, the Government is the \nproblem,'' that is the problem I wish to address here. Because all the \nattention and editorials will now go with respect to the hate groups.\n  Unfortunately, they have prospered over the past 15 years. I was \ninaugurated as Governor of South Carolina in 1959. After I took the \noath of office, I ran back up the steps to get on different clothes for \nthe parade. I looked on my desk and I found a green envelope, gold \nembossed, from the Ku Klux Klan, Grand Klavern of America, giving me a \nlifetime membership. Well, I was lawyer enough. I said, ``We are going \nto return that with a return receipt requested.'' But I asked for the \nhead of my law enforcement division, Mr. Pete Strom, I said, ``Have him \nhere at the end of the parade. I want to see about this.''\n  At the end of the parade, I asked Chief Strom. I said, ``We have the \nKlan in South Carolina?'' I was down in Charleston, and we did not have \nthat activity in the city of Charleston, not that we were any better \nthan any part of the State.\n  But he says, ``Yes. We got 16,721 members.''\n  I said, ``You keep a count?''\n  He said, ``Yes. We keep a count of them but none of the Governors \nwanted to do anything.''\n  I said, ``Do anything?''\n  He said, ``Yes. Get rid of the crowd.''\n  I said, ``Well, I agree with you. We ought to get rid of them. What \ndo you need?''\n  He said, ``I need your cooperation. If you can get me a little money \nfor informant fees, if you can help me infiltrate this group, we will \nget rid of them.''\n  And at the end of my 4-year term we integrated now Clemson \nUniversity--then Clemson College--without incident, because we were \nable to bring it down from 16,721 to less than probably 200.\n  In fact, they told me. I did not know about any meetings. But some of \nmy informants were called in the meetings and informing and everything \nelse, and we dispelled the Klan from South Carolina. But unfortunately, \nMr. President, that now has grown back.\n  When they talk, and write in erudite fashion in the morning news, do \nnot worry about this violence and racism, that we had it back in the \n1920's. Do not give me the 1920's. Let us go back just 30 years ago or \n40 years ago, from 1954 with the Brown against the Board of Education \ndecision and come on up 40 years to 1994. I can tell you categorically \nwe have more racism today in my home State than we had at that \nparticular time.\n  This environment really bothers me in the context of what I \nexperienced back home just this past Easter break. We had an annual \nmeeting of our State Chamber of Commerce. To that meeting I was \ninvited, of course, the two Senators, and the six Congressmen. Most of \nus, of course, were in attendance and we answered the questions. One of \nour distinguished Congressman had gotten on to the matter of the \nabolition of, getting rid of, closing down the departments of \nGovernment. I was just sort of taken aghast. But I thought I would hit \nthem right head on.\n  When my turn came, I said, ``Wait a minute. You folks are talking now \nof abolishing the Department of Commerce?'' Here I am meeting with the \nState Chamber of Commerce, and I could see the faces light up, and they \nstarted almost clapping saying, yes. I said, ``The Department of \nCommerce, Education?'' We had former Governor, \n[[Page S5632]] very popular and outstanding Governor, Dick Riley, who \nis the Secretary of Education up here now. They said, yes, yes. They \ngot even louder. I said, ``Energy, and HUD?'' Yes. They were almost \nstanding up cheering. They were almost standing up cheering.\n  Let us do not talk of the extreme. That is easy to address. Let us \ntalk of the responsibility of middle America. Everybody wants to buy \nthe vote around here of middle America. We are it. We are middle \nAmerica and we are developing that attitude of dismantling it and \ngetting rid of the very thing we are supposed to build and represent to \nrespond to. We certainly are not responding by paying for any bills.\n  I fought that, now years on end, trying to get fiscal responsibility. \nBut I want to emphasize that my feeling is not just on account of the \ndisaster in Oklahoma, which I think is reflective. When we set up the \nenvironment of that kind, then extremism can prosper. I saw it in 1963 \nunder our hero John Fitzgerald Kennedy. I will never forget at that \nparticular time the anti-Kennedy environment that persisted. I have \nnever thought anyone was more eloquent, more intelligent, more dynamic \nthan John Fitzgerald Kennedy. And he did attract in a sense the best \nand the brightest to our Government at $1 a year and we had things \nmoving.\n  But an environment had developed somewhat similar to this environment \ntoday that I feel when I go to these meetings and see these reactions--\nPresident Kennedy was about as popular as an itch. I can tell you here \nand now when the news came over that he had been assassinated, public \nschoolchildren in my backyard stood and clapped.\n  We are responsible--not the extreme groups--we in Government are \nresponsible for these responses, with this kind of environment, and \nthis kind of feel amongst the people. Yes. The talk show hosts. Good \nheavens above. They cannot plead not guilty now. They are as guilty as \nget out. They have talked of arms and shooting. And, yes, this morning \nas they talk now they refer to ourselves up here as the corrupt liberal \nwelfare state. They have got all the buzzwords. The Republican Party \ngives instructions on using the proper buzzwords. The Senator from \nNorth Dakota put that in the Congressional Record. We know those \nparticular buzzwords, and they will tell you to use those buzzwords \nbecause that fires up the people and engenders support for your \nparticular position. That is what has been going on, to my dismay.\n  I felt after the election in November that rather than a Contract \nWith America, that what we needed was a challenge. Rather than \nreinventing Government, we needed to restart it. After all, we had 12 \nyears of Reagan-Bush, and Heaven knows they had cut enough spending, \nexcept in the field, of course, of defense. We had cut, cut, cut--this \nminute with even further cuts, 50 percent of WIC, 50 percent of Head \nStart, 50 percent of title I for the disadvantaged. All of those have \nbeen not embellished and fleshed out to their fulfillment whereby we \nsave money--$3 for every $1 invested in WIC, $4.50 for every $1 \ninvested in Head Start, $6.50 for every $1 invested in title I for the \ndisadvantaged. Yes, health research has been cut. We saved $13.50 for \nevery $1 we invest there.\n  Some were talking about the flu. I just was reading David \nMcCullough's book on Truman, and after World War I; 1918, 1919. We had \n500,000 deaths from a flu epidemic, more than was killed in World War \nI. We had 25,000 GI's in camp that never got to war that died as a \nresult of the flu. With problematic research, we have saved those \nlives, and the report now is we have less than 5,000 here in the year \n1994, or 1995, the most recent figures.\n  So we save and we ought to understand by investing in education, \ninvesting in these various programs, we actually are saving money. But \nthe drumbeat to election has gotten so that there is a total disrespect \nfor anybody that serves in public office almost today, and particularly \nat the Washington level.\n  I thought with the problems that we had what needed to be done is a \nchallenge for America in the context of a Marshall plan on the one \nhand, and a competitive trade policy on the other hand. Specifically, \nas we started the year, we have 39.9 million in poverty in the United \nStates of America, and that has not diminished. We have over 10 million \nhomeless on the sidewalks tonight when you are on the way home. We have \n12 million children going hungry. We have 39 million without health \ncare. Those who have a full-time job are making 20 percent less than \nwhat they were making 20 years ago. According to the census figures \nlast year, that is the groups from 17 to 24--73 percent of that age \ngroup cannot find a job or they cannot find a job out of poverty.\n And with our lack of a trade policy whereby 10 percent of manufactured \ngoods, back in 1970, 25 years ago, only 10 percent of manufactured \ngoods consumed in your and my United States represented imports; now \nover 50 percent. If we had gone back in the last few minutes or as of \ntoday back to the 10 percent, that is 10 million manufacturing jobs. We \nare going out of business. We are headed the way of England. As they \ntold the Brits some years back, ``Don't worry; instead of a nation of \nbrawn, we are going to be a nation of brains, and instead of producing \nproducts, we are going to provide services and have a service economy. \nInstead of creating wealth, we are going to handle it and be a \nfinancing center.'' And England has gone to hell in an economic \nhandbasket.\n\n  When you lose your economic power, Mr. President, you lose your power \nin foreign relations. As of today, we are not the biggest contributor \nto foreign aid. Japan is the biggest contributor. They are holding the \nschools on Fredrich List, the Japanese model, whereby the wealth of the \neconomy is measured not by what it can buy but by what it can produce \nand the decision is not based on be fair, be fair, level-the-field \nnonsense. It is whether the decision strengthens or weakens the \neconomy. And this is the competition we have in the Pacific rim, and \neven now the emerging nations in Eastern Europe are not adopting the \nfree trade of Adam Smith and David Ricardo but, rather, following the \nFredrich List model, and that is the competition we have to wake up to.\n  So I thought the first order of business now with the fall of the \nWall was that we could start rebuilding this land and we are \nimmediately going to the distinguished President George Bush, who, in \nhis State of the Union, said we have got more will than wallet. False. \nWe have got more wallet than will. I can tell you that. We have the \nmoney. We are spending it $1 billion a day for interest costs, for \nnothing. We are wasting it. If they want to get a Grace Commission--and \nI was very sorry to see my friend passing here, Peter Grace, who headed \nup that Commission, just this last week. I served on that Commission, \nand he acted with tremendous distinction for the good of the Government \nhere in Washington.\n  But if you want to get waste, fraud and abuse, the biggest we have--\nand nobody wants to talk about it--is the increase of the debt. And all \nyou need to do, if you want to find out what the real deficit is, is \nsee what the debt was in 1994, what it is going to be in 1995--we will \ngo backward--and what it was in, say, 1990 and how much it increased in \n1991, and then in 1991, how it increased in 1992. And you can see, not \nof this structural debt or other kind of debt that they describe, but \nyou can see we are spending on an average of $300 billion more than we \nare taking in. That is the deficit as I see it.\n  In January, they estimated $338 billion, but we have had six \nincreases in the interest rate since that time. So it is going to be \n$350-some billion no doubt--$1 billion a day--and we are into a \ndownward spiral. You can have all the freezes, and I favor them. You \ncan have all the spending cuts, and I favor them. I absolutely oppose \nany tax cut. We do not have the money to cut. I can tell you that now. \nBut that is buying the vote, the pollster will tell you, not only to \nuse the pejorative terms but to come out for middle America.\n  That is what distresses me. The leadership of the Republicans and the \nleadership of the Democrats are both talking about middle-class bills \nof rights and buying that vote and leaving us who have been in \nGovernment and trying to work to get us operating in the black and get \nthis Government going again scrambling back to the environment. We can \nput in a value added tax along with spending freezes, along with \nspending cuts, along with closure of \n[[Page S5633]] the loopholes, tax expenditures and along with a tax \nincrease.\n  I knew in my heart--and I can see Howard Baker there, the leader back \nin 1981, 1982 when we talked about a freeze. In 1981, Howard turned to \nme and he said, ``Now, Fritz, I can't come out and endorse it, but we \nare going to have to get on top of this. We are going up to the hundred \nbillion deficit.''\n  We never had had that before. We do not even blink at the $300 and \n$400 billion deficits that we are having today. He said, ``You come out \nwith your freeze, and I will support it in the context of I will say, \n`Well, that is interesting; let's study it and let's see if we can go \nfrom there.''' And when I did, the next morning Don Regan, the \nSecretary of Treasury, tackled us from behind and said, ``No way; we \nare not going to do that.'' And as a result the rest is history.\n  Under President Reagan, we got the $100 billion deficit, the first \n$200 billion deficit. Under President Bush, we got the first $300 \nbillion deficit and the first $400 billion deficit. Now, yes, President \nClinton came to town and cut $500 billion in spending. He taxed Social \nSecurity. He taxed cigarettes. He taxed liquor. He taxed gasoline. He \nlet go some 100,000 Federal employees, and he was on the right track \nuntil November when the contract now is the attention, almost like \nspectator sport up here. And so it is Annie get your gun; anything you \ncan do, I can do better.\n  We are not really talking in terms of substance. We are only talking \nin terms of symbols. You can adopt the Contract With America in the \nnext 10 minutes and not a single bill is paid and not a single job is \ncreated. So if we could put in the Marshall Plan and start investing in \npeople--we are talking about putting people first--if we can go back to \nthe theme upon which the distinguished President was elected and then \nturn to a competitive trade policy, we can start rebuilding our economy \nand our strength and thereby our influence.\n  Our foreign policy and security as a nation is like a three-legged \nstool. You have the one leg of the values of the country, and we feed \nthe hungry in Somalia; we build democracy in Haiti. We have the second \nleg unquestioned there, too, that of the military. The third leg, the \neconomic leg, has been fractured, intentionally so, over the past 45 \nyears with the special relationship that we had to support the fight of \nthe cold war against communism. But now with the fall of the Wall, it \nis our opportunity not to dismantle the Government but to rebuild the \nGovernment, not to reinvent the Government but to rebuild it.\n  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that ``Perspective--Challenge \nfor the New America,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Charlotte Observer, Mar. 12, 1995]\n\n                     Challenge for the New America\n\n                          (By Ernest Hollings)\n\n       Our economy is broken. Our society is splitting apart. Our \n     nation is in decline. Forty million Americans live in \n     poverty; 10 million Americans are homeless; 12 million \n     children go hungry every day; and more than 39 million of us \n     don't have health care.\n       America, land of opportunity, today is a frightening \n     picture. The cities have become centers of crime and \n     violence, the schools have become shooting galleries, the \n     land drug-infested. The hard-working have no job security. \n     Those with full time jobs are making 20% less than they did \n     20 years ago. And 73% of the generation of the future--those \n     who are 17 to 24 years old--can't find a job or can't find \n     one that will lift them out of poverty. For the first time in \n     our history, today's younger generation will not live better \n     than their parents. We're developing into a two-tiered \n     society of the haves and have-nots.\n       And what does the Contract with America promise? Procedure \n     Process. Delay. Adopt the Contract in the next 10 minutes and \n     no job would be created, no bill would be paid. It's true \n     that the Contract makes a lot of headlines about issues of \n     concern. But it makes no headway.\n       We in Washington act as if we were elected to cheer rather \n     than to govern. Our duty is to get out of the grandstand, get \n     down on the field and score. To score, the United States \n     needs to launch a Marshall Plan to rebuild America. But many \n     feel we don't have the money. Like George Bush, they contend \n     we ``have more will than\n      wallet.'' Nonsense. We have more wallet than will. We just \n     refuse to pay our bills. As a consequence, our wealth is \n     wasted on paying the interest costs of a soaring debt.\n       Pretending that economic growth and spending cuts alone \n     could cure the deficit, David Stockman said, ``We have \n     incessantly poisoned the political debate with a mindless \n     stream of anti-tax venom.'' The result today? A spending \n     spree of $1 billion a day that services a debt that grows \n     like topsy. To put a tourniquet on this hemorrhage, we must \n     freeze spending, cut spending, close tax loopholes and enact \n     a 5% value-added tax, which would put the government on a \n     pay-as-you-go basis. With this in place, we can provide a \n     Marshall Plan to rebuild America.\n       First, we must invest in proven programs that save money \n     and people, such as the WIC (Women, Infants and Children) \n     nutrition program: childhood immunizations; Head Start; \n     education; biomedical research and more. Next, we should \n     promote savings and investment with revamped Individual \n     Retirement Accounts and research tax credits for industry. \n     And we should reinstitute revenue-sharing to pay for unfunded \n     mandates and to rebuild the decaying infrastructure--roads, \n     bridges, schools--of our cities and states.\n\n\n                           competitive trade\n\n       At another time of crisis, Abraham Lincoln said we must \n     think anew, act anew and disenthrall ourselves. If we can \n     think anew, about spending and taxes to develop an American \n     Plan for America, we must disenthrall ourselves from the \n     buzzwords of this town--``protectionism,'' ``industrial \n     policy'' and ``distrust of government.''\n       The very fundamental of government is protection. We have \n     the Defense Department to protect us from enemies without, \n     and the FBI to protect us from enemies within. Medicare and \n     Medicaid protect us from ill health. Social Security protects \n     from the ravages of old age. We have clean air and clean \n     water provisions to protect the environment. And of course, \n     we have a raft of protections against free market forces--\n     minimum wage, unemployment security, anti-trust laws, safe \n     machinery, safe working places, plant closing notices, \n     parental leave--which all added to the costs of production. \n     All of these protections have sweeping bipartisan support so \n     we can maintain our high standard of living.\n       In today's low-wage, controlled global competition, the \n     U.S. living standard must be protected. But after 50 years of \n     operating--and losing--under the free trade model developed \n     by Adam Smith, the United States must realize that it needs a \n     competitive trade policy to win the war of ever-increasing \n     trade deficits. Unlike Smith, who believed the wealth of a \n     nation was measured by what it could buy, we live in a world \n     where wealth is measured by what a nation can produce. Trade \n     policy is not a moral question of ``being fair,'' but a \n     question of whether it strengthens or weakens the economy.\n       Our government should stop kowtowing to the\n        multinationals and start protecting our economy. Instead \n     of having 28 departments and agencies in government that \n     deal with trade, we need to orchestrate them into one \n     entity to guide national trade policy. Similar to the \n     National Security Council, we need a statutory National \n     Economic Council to direct trade policy and globalize our \n     industrial policy. We don't need a bunch of new laws. We \n     need to enforce the trade and dumping laws that are on the \n     books now.\n       To augment a competitive trade policy, we need to embellish \n     the Advanced Technology Program, regional manufacturing \n     centers and small business loans for technological \n     development. We should use market access to encourage \n     voluntary restraint agreements for those products important \n     to our national security. We must change archaic securities \n     laws to favor long-term investment. And if forced, we can \n     translate the inspection practices and nontariff barriers of \n     our competitors into English by withholding market access \n     until the United States is permitted market access.\n       Ten years ago, 26% of our work force was engaged in \n     manufacturing. Now, it's dwindled to 16%. If we lose our \n     manufacturing power, we'll cease to be a world power. We need \n     a competitive trade policy and an American plan for America \n     to get the country moving.\n\n\n                              u.s. can-do\n\n       The United States is a can-do country. Since the beginning, \n     it always has looked to the people's government in Washington \n     to lead the way. And today, as spiraling deficits and free \n     trade threaten our standard of living, our challenge is to \n     use government to get us out of this mess. Look how \n     successful we've been:\n       It was the Washington government that enacted the land \n     ordinances that opened the West to pioneers.\n       The Washington government built the roads, canals, harbors \n     and the transcontinental railroad that poured our rich \n     resources into factories.\n       The Washington government produced the water projects that \n     transformed the Midwest desert into the breadbasket of the \n     world.\n       The Washington government brought electricity to rural \n     America.\n       When free enterprise failed in the Depression, the \n     Washington government lifted us from despair and rebuilt our \n     economy.\n       The Washington government saved the world from fascism.\n       The Washington government broke the back of racial \n     discrimination and set us on the road to equal justice.\n       The Washington government joined science, industry and \n     education and put a man on the moon.\n       [[Page S5634]] We can repeat our past successes. Enough of \n     this chant to get rid of the government. As John Adams said, \n     ``The declaration of hostility by a people to a government \n     made by themselves, for themselves and conducted by \n     themselves is an insult.''\n       And enough of these information-age buzzwords of \n     reinvention, reassignment, dismantling and devolution. Now is \n     the time to quit playing with symbols and go to work on \n     substance.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Let me just read this because this is what we had in \nmind and spoke of back right after they submitted the contract and \ntalked about in November so reverently, and I read now because I do not \nwant people now to think I am joining the comments with respect to \nextremism. I do not differ with them. I salute the distinguished \nSenator from Montana, the Senator from Minnesota and others, but I read \nbecause we have got to give the people hope in this environment. And I \nread this.\n\n       The United States is a can-do country. Since the beginning, \n     it has always looked to the people's government in Washington \n     to lead the way. And today, as spiraling deficits and free \n     trade threaten our standard of living, our challenge is to \n     use Government to get out of this mess. Look how successful \n     we have been.\n       It was the Washington government that enacted the land \n     ordinances that opened the West to pioneers.\n       The Washington government built the roads, canals, harbors \n     and transcontinental railroad that poured our rich resources \n     into the factories.\n       The Washington Government produced the water projects that \n     transformed the Midwest desert into the breadbasket of the \n     world.\n       It was the Washington Government that brought electricity \n     to rural America. When free enterprise failed in the \n     Depression, the Washington Government lifted us from despair \n     and rebuilt our economy. The Washington Government saved the \n     world from fascism. The Washington Government broke the back \n     of racial discrimination and set us on the road to equal \n     justice. And it was the Washington Government that joined \n     science, industry and education and put a man on the Moon.\n       We can repeat our past successes. Enough of this chant to \n     get rid of the Government. As John Adams said, ``The \n     declaration of hostility by a people to a Government made by \n     themselves for themselves and conducted by themselves is an \n     insult.''\n\n  I yield the floor.\n                         loud and angry voices\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon with a question: \nWhere are the loud and angry voices?\n  President Clinton traveled to my home State of Minnesota yesterday to \nspeak out against what he called the ``loud and angry voices * * * the \npurveyors of hatred and division'' that he claims have fostered a \nclimate of profound distrust in government.\n  Mr. President, I will concede that there is indeed deep discontent in \nthe heartland, some of it focused on the Federal Government; discontent \nwas reflected at the ballot box in November.\n  People are fed up with a government they believe has grown too big, \ntoo overpowering, too unresponsive. They heard the conservative message \nof less government and it hit home. Just as Americans have done time \nand time again throughout the history of this Nation, they started a \nrevolution of ideas by voting for a change.\n  Now, that is what courageous Americans do--they vote. Courageous \nAmericans do not plant bombs. Courageous Americans do not murder their \nneighbors and their neighbors' children. Cowards do.\n  I have been receiving telephone calls from angry constituents, \nfurious that--simply because they consider themselves opponents of \nbigger government or higher taxes--that their President would seek to \nsomehow tie them to the actions of the desperate few who committed \nunspeakable violence in Oklahoma City. Why stop there? Why not blame \nfertilizer producers and the folks who sell it? Why not blame the \nemployees who rented out the truck that carried the bomb? Or the \nFederal Government itself?\n  I will tell Americans why we cannot--and must not--play the blaming \ngame: because the only individuals responsible for this tragedy are the \nvery cowards who built the bomb, parked in front of that building, and \nin that horrible explosion, took innocent American lives.\n  For some things that happen, there is no reason, and out of anger we \ntend to blame. We must not blame each other.\n  Those who did this--they alone are responsible, and they should be \nbrought forth in the American tradition of justice and held accountable \nfor their actions.\n  We must remember the pain of Oklahoma City, but this is not a time to \nscore political points or to somehow use the victims of this tragedy as \nthe pawns of some crazy chess match. This is a time for healing, for \nsticking together. We should be drawing ourselves closer to our fellow \nAmericans--not pushing each other apart.\n  Mr. President, democracy can be a hazardous endeavor. There are deep \nrisks--but equally deep riches to be gained--every time a civilization \nis entrusted with the freedom to govern itself. A government ``of the \npeople, by the people, and for the people'' can never be sealed off \nfrom the world.\n  We cannot pass enough laws to prevent what happened in Oklahoma City. \nBut with the promise of punishment that is swift and severe, we make a \nbold statement that the vicious actions of a few will not be tolerated \nwithin a democracy.\n  If President Clinton had listened carefully during his visit to \nMinnesota, he would have heard the same loud and angry voices that I \nhear echoing across this country. The loud and angry voices I hear are \nnot political or ideological. They are the voices of real people--in \nOklahoma, in Minnesota, and across the country--who have witnessed this \nawful tragedy and are demanding justice.\n  We would not serve them well by politicizing tragedy. Instead, we \nmust punish those who committed this act, stand by those who were \ninjured in the blast, and keep forever in our memories respect for \nthose who lost their lives on April 19, 1995.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, my heart goes out for the families and \nfriends of those brutally murdered by the senseless bombing in Oklahoma \nCity last week. It was a cowardly act, perpetrated against fathers and \nmothers, children, aunts and uncles, brothers and sisters, friends and \nfellow Americans. While our prayers go to the survivors, the community \nand the brave soles doing the gruesome work of recovery, I am sure each \nof us, in our own way have uttered, why and ``there but by the grace of \nGod go I.''\n  There is not justification for such an act of barbarism; no \ncircumstances under which our society can tolerate such actions. Those \nwho would wantonly take the lives of innocent citizens, also destroy \nthe fabric of our freedom. They must be caught. If found guilty, they \nmust be dealt the harshest penalty the law will allow.\n  As a nation, we must draw a clear line between what is acceptable \ndisagreement with Government and what is just plain lawless brutality. \nBut in our sorrow and anger, we must be mindful to draw that line \ncarefully.\n  Our Constitution dictates the middle ground between measured justice \nand reckless retribution. It is a time tested outline for what is too \nmuch Government and what is too little. It is the very framework of our \nliberty. Even so, there are plenty of instances in the history of our \nNation where its umbrella of protection was bent by public outrage or \nfear and the rights of individuals or groups have been suspended for \nwhat was viewed as ``the public good.'' And in almost every case, those \nhave been mistakes.\n  In retrospect, few of us can really defend the wholesale \nincarceration of Americans of Japanese descent at the outset of World \nWar II. It must have seemed the proper action at the time.\n  None of us can now defend Senator Joe McCarthy's witch hunt for \ncommunists in the entertainment business, although we were a nation in \nfear of spreading communism.\n  Few of us who remember the civil disobedience of the late sixties, \ncan defend the excess of Federal investigators who tapped the phones of \ndissidents, investigated the lives of civil rights leaders or spied on \nthose whose only crime was having strongly held opinions that opposed \nthe official position of our Government.\n  Make no mistake. Those who executed this bombing are outlaws of the \nworst kind; misguided and sick people hiding behind some cause so they \ncan inflict human suffering on people they don't even know.\n  But they in this case doesn't include everyone in America who opposes \nGovernment excess.\n  [[Page S5635]] It doesn't include people who choose to exercise their \nconstitutional right to assemble, right to free speech, right to keep \nand bear arms, to practice responsible civil disobedience, or to \ndisagree with the Federal Government.\n  Neither the ultra right nor the ultra left, neither conservative \nradio programs nor the liberal media are guilty of this crime. The \ncriminals who did it are responsible.\n  Those who would use this act of barbarism to lay blame on their \npolitical or ideological enemies, do every citizen of this Nation a \ngreat disservice. They are attempting to place the blame somewhere \nother than on the shoulders of the criminals themselves, not because of \ntheir grief, but the callous political self interest.\n  It also shows they have a shallow understanding of what makes our \ncountry great.\n  In this Nation, the rights of the individual come first. The guilty \nmust be found, tried and punished.\n  The rights of the innocent must be preserved.\n  In this Nation, ideas and beliefs are not crimes. God forbid that \nthey ever will be.\n  That is the constitutional prescription for our freedom. It should \nnot be sacrificed for the short term political gain or national \ncomfort.\n  (At the request of Mr. Dole, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, the sense of the Senate \nresolution offered by the Senators from Oklahoma and the majority \nleader and minority leader reflects the desire of the U.S. Senate to \nvoice its outrage at the horrible bombing of the Federal building in \nOklahoma City as well as our desire to see swift punishment for those \nresponsible. The resolution also offers the Senate an opportunity to \nexpress concern and sympathy for the lives tragically affected by this \ncrime.\n  To the families of those injured or lost in the bombing, I offer my \ndeepest sympathies. We all offer our thanks to the rescue workers, \nvolunteers and law enforcement officials who have responded to the \ncrisis with bravery, compassion, and extraordinary professionalism. Out \nof the depths of the despair caused by this criminal act, Americans are \nfinding renewed unity and strength as we face together this adversity.\n  Right after the blast I was asked if this type of attack is the price \nour Nation must pay for a free and open society. I do not accept the \nthesis that we must live in fear--for our lives, for the safety of our \nchildren, or for our own ability to express ourselves. After all, our \nNation is founded on the principles of protecting life, liberty and the \npursuit of happiness. None of these precepts was honored by the \nterrorists who ended or forever altered the lives of the victims of the \nOklahoma City blast.\n  I personally rely upon my faith to help understand this tragedy and \ngain a sense that justice will be served. As a Senator, I will join \nevery other government official in the effort to ensure that the hunt \nfor the perpetrators of this crime is successful and swift. And \nalthough I cannot support the imposition of the death penalty because \nof my longtime conscientious objection to it, I nonetheless condemn the \ncrime in the harshest terms and am eager to know that the criminals are \nbehind bars.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/25/senate-section/article/S5631-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n      THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE COMBINED JEWISH PHILANTHROPIES\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join today in \ncelebrating the 100th anniversary of the Combined Jewish \nPhilanthropies.\n  The Combined Jewish Philanthropies has always been at the forefront \nof issues vital to the Jewish community, and I have been proud to work \nwith members of this organization. As an organization that grew from 5 \nJewish agencies in 1895 to more than 80 agencies in 1995, it has \ndeveloped into one of the most successful charitable organizations in \nthe world. Throughout these years, the CJP has had extraordinary \nsuccess in improving the lives of countless people.\n  The CJP has helped to alleviate the horrors of the past by assisting \nin the rescue and resettlement of hundreds of thousands of survivors of \nthe Holocaust, and it has faced the challenges of the present by \nassisting in the emigration and resettlement of large numbers of Soviet \nJews. It has also laid a solid foundation for promoting social justice \nthrough programs that create jobs, help the needy, care for the \nelderly, and educate children.\n  During my years in the Senate, I have been proud to work with members \nof the CJP on many social programs in Massachusetts, including Jewish \nvocational services, family services, and Big Brother/Big Sister \nprograms. We have worked together to develop counseling and job \ntraining initiatives for the Jewish community in our State, and we have \nhelped over 5,000 Jewish immigrants during the past 6 years find jobs \nin Massachusetts. We have also worked together to ensure that young \npersons in need of role models have the opportunity to participate in \nthe Big Brother/Big Sister programs in Massachusetts. It has also been \na privilege to work with the CJP against antisemitism in the former \nSoviet Union and for the right of emigration.\n  The CJP's centennial celebration comes during a time of great \nchallenge and great opportunity for the friends of Israel. All of us \ndeplore the tragic violence that continues to plague the peace process \nin the Middle East. But I look forward to working closely with the CJP, \nthe Clinton administration, and my colleagues in Congress, to secure a \njust and lasting peace and to ensure that Israel's vital security \ninterests are protected.\n  I extend my respect and warmest wishes as the CJP enters its second \ncentury.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/25/senate-section/article/S5635-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               VOLUNTEERS HELP KEEP CALIFORNIA BEAUTIFUL\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of thousands of \nCalifornia volunteers who have contributed their time and hard work \nthis month to ensure California remains the Golden State that its \npeople, the rest of the country, and the world have come to treasure.\n  April is Keep California Beautiful Month, and the nonprofit Keep \nCalifornia Beautiful, Inc., supported by thousands of individuals and \nbusinesses, as well as county, State and Federal agencies, have \norganized more than a hundred community-based projects to improve and \nmaintain our publicly owned lands and facilities, from parks in inner \ncities to the wide-open spaces we all love. The specific objectives are \nto reduce litter, remove graffiti, expand recycling, and enhance \nnatural resources in urban and rural areas.\n  This year, 1995, is the beginning of what we all hope will be an \never-increasing annual event in the years to come. As we tighten our \nbelts and streamline government at all levels, volunteer efforts like \nKeep California Beautiful become even more important. In fact, the \nsynergy created by the private-public partnership of this effort will, \nI believe, actually multiply our capability to do the hands-on work \nneeded in all parts of the State.\n  This year's success will be the first of an ongoing annual event for \nyears and years to come. That way, not only are we improving California \nfor our children, but hopefully our children will improve it for their \nchildren. It is that kind of spirit that makes California special.\n  I commend my fellow Californians for their efforts and encourage \neveryone to get involved in Keep California Beautiful Month next year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/25/senate-section/article/S5635-2", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5635-S5636]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE? THE VOTERS HAVE SAID YES\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the skyrocketing Federal debt, which long \nago soared into the stratosphere, is in a category like the weather--\neverybody talks about it but almost nobody had undertaken the \nresponsibility of trying to do anything about it until immediately \nfollowing the elections last November.\n  When the 104th Congress convened in January, the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives approved a balanced budget amendment. In the Senate \nonly 1 of the Senate's 54 Republicans opposed the balanced budget \namendment; only 13 Democrats supported it. Thus, the balanced budget \namendment failed by just one vote. There will be another vote later \nthis year or next year.\n  [[Page S5636]] As of the close of business yesterday, Monday, April \n24, the Federal debt stood--down to the penny--at exactly \n$4,839,548,467,525.15 or $18,371.01 for every man, woman, and child on \na per capita basis.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/25/senate-section/article/S5635-3", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5636]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       A NATIONAL DAY OF SERVICE\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I commend Americans who are \nparticipating in the National Day of Service. Today, people all across \nthis Nation are working together in community service. As we speak, \npeople of all ages and backgrounds are using their hands and hearts to \nshow their American spirit.\n  This day should remind us all of what it means to be an American, for \ntoday, our people are standing side by side. They are gathering, not to \ndiscuss their differences, but to pursue common goals.\n  Today, Americans are standing side by side immunizing infants. They \nare standing side by side tutoring school-age children. They are \nstanding side by side restoring urban parks, feeding and sheltering the \nhomeless, and rehabilitating housing and community centers. Today, we \nstand united as Americans.\n  In West Virginia, people in Braxton County will work together to \ncreate a nature trail near the Braxton County Middle School so students \ncan learn more about their environment. In Welch, people are working to \nclean a vacant school so it can be converted in a facility to offer a \nsafe shelter for victims of domestic violence by the local agency known \nas SAFE, Stop Abusive Family Environments. These activities for \nNational Youth Service Day are just a few examples of important \ncommunity work sponsored by the West Virginia Commission National and \nCommunity Service.\n  This day strikes a warm, familiar chord for me personally. From \npersonal experience, I know the benefit of working with others to build \nbetter communities.\n  In 1964, the VISTA program brought me to a coal camp community in \nEmmons, WV. There, I followed Kennedy's call to service and worked with \nthe people of Emmons, trying to do my small part in building a stronger \ncommunity.\n  Together, we built a baseball field and a community center. We \nbrought the people much needed preventative health care. We rallied to \nbring a schoolbus to Emmons and helped to keep Emmons' kids in school.\n  From personal experience, I know that community service benefits \nparticipants as much as it benefits communities. My work with VISTA \ntaught me a very important lesson: That I can make a difference.\n  Today, the people of America celebrate that same lesson: Each and \nevery American can make a difference.\n  Let us all be careful not to forget that important lesson at the end \nof the National Day of Service. Let us remember and reaffirm that \nlesson every day of the year.\n  Why must we remember the lesson every day of the year? The reason is \nsimple: Community service programs work.\n  Just look at the resounding success of AmeriCorps. AmeriCorps gives \nthousands of young Americans the tools to make a difference in their \nown lives and in the lives of others.\n  AmeriCorps participants perform vital services in America. Just over \n6 months ago, 85 West Virginians were sworn into AmeriCorps. Today they \nare working with 20,000 people nationwide to keep schools safe, restore \nnatural resources, tutor teenagers, and more--all in exchange for \neducation.\n  Programs like AmeriCorps simultaneously open doors to higher \neducation and help build stronger communities. They allow Americans to \nhelp each other, and build trust, understanding, and hope.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to stand in support of the National Day of \nService. I salute everyone working in community service. I congratulate \neach of them for making a difference.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/25/senate-section/article/S5636-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5636]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DAVID MARTIN\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to David Martin, \na distinguished public servant, an inquisitive adventurer, and a \nuniquely warm individual.\n  I came to know David when he served on the staff of my father, the \nlate Senator Thomas J. Dodd. To my siblings and me, however, David \nMartin was much more than an employee of one of our parents. He was \nmore like a beloved uncle and insightful teacher wrapped into one.\n  I recall spending a number of delightful evenings at David's home \nwith my family engaged in stimulating conversation. One could not come \naway from talking with David Martin without learning something new. He \nwas a gripping conversationalist.\n  He was very unassuming and did not aggressively advertise his \nsuperior knowledge. You had to probe to find that rich vein, but once \nyou succeeded, your reward was real and immediate.\n  David had such a dynamic and engaging intellect that he was a magnet \nfor some of the 20th century's foremost authors and thinkers. He \ncounted Ralph Ellison, George Orwell, Norman Mailer, William F. \nBuckley, Jr., and Edward Teller among his friends.\n  David's biography is so varied and fascinating that it reads more \nlike that of a protagonist in a novel than a real-life individual. He \nwas a veteran, a war correspondent, a noted author of political \nscience, a human rights advocate and a legislative expert. He even \ncoordinated Richard Byrd's last expedition to the South pole. David \nMartin was a true renaissance man.\n  His three books on Yugoslavia are still required reading for anyone \nwho wants to understand that troubled part of the world. He was a \npassionate advocate for refugees, and as executive director of the \nRefugee Defense Committee from 1946 to 1947, he was instrumental in \nending the inhumane practice of forcible repatriation of war time \nrefugees to the Communist eastern bloc.\n  David was legendary in the Senate for the breadth and depth of his \nexpertise. During the 11 years he served on my father's staff, David \nwas a key mover behind the eventual adoption of the limited test ban \ntreaty. He also advised my father on a range of foreign policy hot \nspots, from Germany to Africa, from the Dominican Republic to Southeast \nAsia.\n  After working for my father, David went on to the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, where he organized hearings on marijuana that are generally \ncredited with alerting the public to the true danger of the drug.\n  David's first wife, Judy Asti, whom he married in 1947, died in 1971. \nHe remarried in 1974 to Virginia Worek Levy. He is survived by \nVirginia, as well as his two children, Joe and Rebecca; his brother, \nMaurice Manson; and two stepsons, Ian and Raoul Levy.\n  Today we live in a better country and a better world thanks to David \nMartin. I think that is among the highest praise that can be given to \nan individual who has passed away, and in David Martin's case it is \nrichly deserved.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/25/senate-section/article/S5636-2", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5636-S5637]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          ANNIVERSARY OF COL. CHARLES SHELTON CAPTURE IN LAOS\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, Saturday, April 29 marks the 30th \nanniversary of Col. Charles Shelton's capture in Southeast Asia.\n  Colonel Shelton grew up in my hometown, Owensboro, KY, where you \ncould find him playing football for the high school team, courting his \nwife, and developing the values that would later serve him so well as \nhe served his country.\n  Like so many other dedicated American soldiers, the day he left the \nUnited States to fly secret reconnaissance missions over Laos, he put \nhis life on hold, whether that meant the dreams and ambitions of an \nindividual life, or the simple pleasure of watching his five children \ngrow into adults.\n  But, when he was shot down on April 29 and captured, the notion of \nputting a life on hold took on a new and horrible dimension for Colonel \nShelton and his family. That's because for the next 29 years, Colonel \nShelton remained an official prisoner of war--the final U.S. military \npersonnel to be so listed by the American Government.\n  Because of numerous reports of sightings and escape attempts well \ninto the 1980's, it wasn't until 1994 that his children requested the \nPentagon to change his status to presumed killed in action.\n  While we can't begin to imagine what this wait was like for Colonel \nShelton or his family, we can pay tribute to his service and to the \nordeal he and his \n[[Page S5637]] family endured in order to protect the freedoms we all \nenjoy in this country.\n  Mr. President, let me close by saying to the children of Colonel \nShelton that we can never replace the years you lost with your father, \nbut his marker in Arlington National Cemetery will serve as a reminder \nfor generations to come of his heroism, his courage, and his unyielding \nlove for this country.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/25/senate-section/article/S5636-3", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5637-S5638]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, morning business is \nclosed.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate your recognition. I would \nlike to use my leader time to make a statement on the pending \nresolution prior to the time to take our vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, 7 days ago, a brutal attack on a Federal \noffice building in Oklahoma City left over 80 people dead, more than \n400 injured, and a city and Nation shaken to its core.\n  On Sunday, the Nation observed a day of mourning. All Americans \njoined President Clinton, the families of victims, and the people of \nOklahoma City in thought and prayer at the memorial service. With them, \nwe thanked and honored the brave men and women who have aided in the \nrescue efforts at the bomb site. It was an added tragedy to learn \nSunday that one of the rescuers, a nurse, lost her own life in the \ncourse of helping others.\n  The swift and efficient work of FBI and other Federal law enforcement \nin apprehending suspects reinforces the well-earned reputation of those \nagencies. Terrorists must know that no matter who they are, domestic or \nforeign, there is no place to hide from the reach of our law. President \nClinton has made clear that those who committed this act will be \npursued, found, convicted, and punished to the full extent of the law. \nHe has the support of every law-biding American in that determination.\n  An act of terror--the intentional murder of innocent men, women, and \nsmall children--shattered the sense of security that Americans have \nenjoyed in an increasingly violent world. Our world has made us all \nvulnerable to the deranged and to the enraged. No one's security can be \nguaranteed against people determined to attack, to kill, to pursue \ntheir mad plans, Security cannot be guaranteed against those who have \nno concern for human life.\n  But that does not mean we are doomed to give in to the forces of \ninsanity or mad rage. The human world has always been one of risks and \ndangers. Throughout human history, violence has erupted in wars and \nbetween individuals; human beings have been at risk from the forces of \nnature, from disease and accident.\n  Today's violence and terrorism come into our homes through television \nimages. They have an impact that written reports of battles and \ntornadoes could never have.\n  No sooner had Wednesday's bombing been reported than scores of faked \nbomb threats began to be received from coast to coast. Federal \nbuildings in Kansas City; Miami; Portland, OR; Dayton and Steubenville, \nOH; Casper, WY, and Boise, ID, were closed. In Omaha, the Zorinsky \nFederal Building was closed, and its day center emptied, by a bomb \nthreat.\n  Television and wire service stories reported all these threats and \nothers. No wonder Americans all over the country immediately felt at \nrisk. The immediacy of live television, the awful images of wounded, \nbleeding, shaking people staggering out of the Federal building in \nOklahoma City made every American watching a participant in this \nhideous tragedy. No one who saw the small children covered with blood, \ndazed and bewildered, will ever forget their eyes.\n  The deaths and injuries, have brutalized families all across America. \nA young woman from Spearfish, SD, serving in the Air Force, is among \nthe missing. Married just 4 days before the bombing, she left her duty \nstation at Tinker Air Force Base on Wednesday morning to go to the \nSocial Security office in the Federal building in Oklahoma City to \nregister her married name, and she has not been found. Her father, \nDavid Koch of Rapid City, her high school classmates from the 1993 \ngraduating class at Spearfish High, and all who knew her have been \ndevastated by this terrorist attack. That is true for literally \nhundreds of families and people nationwide.\n  The immediacy of television brings us closer together as a Nation \nmourning national tragedies, but it also makes each of us feel less \nsafe, less secure in our daily lives.\n  We should not let ourselves forget that outbreaks of insane violence \nhave occurred before. In 1927, for instance, a Michigan farmer unable \nto pay his property taxes bombed a school full of children, killing \nmore than 40, because he blamed the construction of the school for his \nhigh property taxes.\n  Incidents like that were not as frequent in a smaller, younger \nnation. But they did not occur and despite the fact that they occurred, \nAmericans in every generation remained true to the constitutional \nstructure of Government that has given us the world's most free \nsociety.\n  We need to remember this fact, as my colleagues from Oklahoma said so \neloquently this morning, of our history in the face of the Oklahoma \nCity tragedy. This act of terrorism will have achieved a purpose if it \nrobs Americans of their sense of security. It will have achieved a \npurpose if it leads us to respond irrationally. It will have achieved a \npurpose if public discourse turns to invective.\n  The deaths and injuries caused by the bombing of the Federal building \nmust not be allowed to rip apart the fabric of our society.\n  The resolution the Senate is about to pass expresses the outrage and \nsadness of the Senate and the American people with respect to the \nbombing in Oklahoma City. It commends all those involved in the rescue \nefforts and the investigation. It offers our sincere condolences to all \nthose who lost family members and friends in, and all those who were \ninjured by, the bombing.\n  I want to clarify one point with respect to the resolution. It states \ncorrectly that the law authorizes the death penalty for terrorist \nmurderers. Although the death penalty is not a sentencing option for \nthose convicted of\n the World Trade Center bombing, the 1994 crime bill, which was enacted \nafter the World Trade Center bombing, does provide for the death \npenalty in cases such as the bombing of the Federal building in \nOklahoma City.\n\n  The resolution also expresses support for the President's and the \nAttorney General's statements that Federal prosecutors will seek the \nmaximum punishment allowed by law for those convicted of the bombing. \nWhile some Senators support the death penalty for certain crimes and \nothers oppose the death penalty as a matter of principle, there is a \nstrong belief among all Senators that the apprehension, prosecution, \nand punishment of those who commit heinous crimes such as this one \nshould be pursued as aggressively as possible. That belief is reflected \nin the strong support for this resolution.\n  Of course, words can never express the depth of our emotions at a \ntime like this. Furthermore, our national response must be \nmultifaceted.\n  We have to relearn the hard fact that our technologically advanced \nsociety has created new ways to make us vulnerable. And it will never \nbe possible to develop enough technological security to make us \ninvulnerable. Metal detectors and x-ray machines, and electronic ID \ncards all have their place in necessary security actions. But the \nbombing in Oklahoma City proves that you need not even enter a building \nto blow it up.\n  At the same time, we must become more vigilant and more aware. The \nnumber of bombing incidents in the United States has gone up more than \nfourfold in the last decade. In 1983, the FBI reported 683 bombing \nincidents. In 1993, the last year for which complete figures are \navailable, the FBI reported 2,980 bombing incidents.\n  Few Americans realize this, but in an increasingly violent and \nfragmented world, we cannot afford to be complacent. There are some \nsteps we can take to respond more forcefully and pro-actively to the \nthreat of terrorism, whether it is home-grown or comes from abroad.\n  [[Page S5638]] We must do more and focus more attention on the \nintelligence resources that may help detect potential terrorist attacks \nbefore they can be consummated. We should take up and pass President \nClinton's anti-terrorism proposals. We should determine what additional \ntools the FBI and other law enforcement agencies may need to carry out \ntheir missions.\n  We should examine proposals for improved visa tracking of overseas \nvisitors to the United States, so that those who overstay their visa \ntime cannot simply vanish into society without a trace. We should take \nsteps to alter our asylum procedures, so that those legitimately \nseeking political refuge can be admitted, while those using asylum \nbacklogs as a pretext are not allowed to stay indefinitely, but let us \nremember, as well, that this tragedy was not the work of overseas \nterrorists, but of Americans, people who enjoyed the great freedom our \nNation offers.\n  We have become accustomed to seeing terrorist attacks in other parts \nof the world--Bosnia, the Middle\n East, Europe, and Latin America. Americans have seen hundreds of \nsmoke-stained people streaming out of the World Trade Center Buildings \nin New York City. In response, we have been quick to explain that the \ncauses are nationalism, or religious fanaticism, or some other belief \nsystem with which Americans have nothing in common.\n\n  Americans have always been quick to seek reasons to explain what \nhappens in the world around them. But there are events so monstrous, so \nevil, that they cannot be explained away. No human reasons can account \nfor the minds that could conceive, or the hands that could carry out, \nthis deed.\n  Nevertheless, it is natural and healthy for each of us to question \nand try to understand how this could have happened, and to think--\nbeyond laws--about what we as a society might do to reverse the trends \nof violence and intolerance in America.\n  It is imperative that we find ways for Americans from diverse \nbackgrounds with sometimes very divergent points of view to live \nharmoniously.\n  The first step toward that goal is for us to talk to each other. We \nmust find better ways to do that. We must restore civility to private, \nand especially public, discourse. We should not permit our political or \nracial or ethnic or other differences to blind us to each other's \ntruths.\n  If we listen to one another, we are likely to find our differences \nare not as great as some of the intemperate rhetoric makes them appear. \nWe are likely to remember that what divides us is much less important \nthan what unites us as a nation. We will never eliminate all our \ndifferences, but we will learn that we can live with them.\n  Each of us--as parents, neighbors, teachers, elected officials, \ncandidates for office, journalists--has an affirmative responsibility \nto promote that kind of environment.\n  The bombing in Oklahoma City is the result of evil, misguided people. \nWe do not yet know what their motivation was; we can only speculate. \nBut we can ask ourselves if our increasingly hateful public discourse \nis falling on ears receptive to hate, if it is providing a context for \nhands ready to undertake hateful acts.\n  No one believes that the actions of any man are the fault of the \nspeech of anther, but people are inspired and uplifted by words and \nideas. We saw that at the memorial service in Oklahoma City. Words and \nideas can and do inspire and uplift. But they can mislead and delude. \nAll of us who speak and act in the public arena have an obligation to \nbear that in mind, for every time we speak, in effect, we are making a \nchoice about what kind of environment we promote. The privilege of \nserving our community carries with it the obligation not to damage that \ncommunity.\n  Americans now can and must do what earlier generations of Americans \nhave done. We must mourn with the families of victims and pray for all \nthe shattered lives and hopes. We must identify changes in the law that \nhave the promise of making us safer. And we must continue to live our \nlives, saddened by the enormous loss, but rededicated to the social \ncontract that binds us together and allows all of us from different \nbackgrounds, with different ideas, to live together in peace.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/25/senate-section/article/S5637-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5638]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                CONDEMNING THE BOMBING IN OKLAHOMA CITY\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, awaiting others who wish to address this \nparticular problem, I would like to emphasize, of course, the good that \nhas been done over the many, many years when we have debated product \nliability. The sponsors of the bill here are looking for a problem to \nsolve and disregarding the fact that the United States of America is \nthe safest society with respect to manufactured products in the history \nof the world. That has been done in large measure due to that group of \ntrial lawyers, damage suits, punitive damages, and other verdicts. With \nrespect to punitive damages, they can only come about as a result of \ngross negligence and willful misconduct. And in my State, and in many \nof the States, some States do not even allow them. But in my State, if \nthe trial judge himself does not find proof of willful misconduct to \nhis own satisfaction, he just throws out that particular finding.\n  So punitive damages have been used very judiciously, and in reality, \nare seldom used. For example, we asked the particular witness who \nappeared before us at the hearings who had presented the issue of \npunitive damages before the U.S. Supreme Court, we asked him to please \nstudy and come back and report to us over the past 30 years the total \namount of punitive damages found. I know from my own experience and \notherwise that it was a small amount, relatively speaking. I cited at \nthat particular time the $3 billion punitive damage verdict in the \nExxon Valdez case.\n  And the gentlemen studied the particular findings of punitive damages \nover the 50 States in the past 30 years and it was $1.3 billion. Of all \npunitive damage findings, in all product liability cases, there was an \namount less than one-half in one manufacturer's case.\n  That has been the problem, Mr. President, in the sense that the great \nnumber of punitive damages are industries suing industries. An example \nagain was down in the Pennzoil case, in Pennzoil against the Texaco Co. \nin the State of Texas some years ago. Again there was another $3 \nbillion finding. So I can just cite two manufacturer's cases where all \nthe punitive damage findings in product liability cases amounts to one-\nsixth of the amounts of those two cases.\n  But look at the magnificent good that the tort system has done over \nmany, many years. I think, for example, Mr. President, of the 4 million \nminivan recalls by Chrysler Corp. here in the last several weeks. Quite \nto the point. You do not find Chrysler Corp. recalling minivans to \ncorrect that faulty latch on the back door because they think it is \njust good business. They know good and well that they are going to get \nsocked for actual and punitive damages if they willfully allow that \nparticular defect to continue, to knowingly, willfully, heedlessly--\nrecklessly is the language used in punitive damage awards--allow that \nto continue.\n  And as a result we will give the body before long over at the \nDepartment of Transportation information about the millions and \nmillions of car recalls by the various automobile companies over the \npast several years, which means what? Which means exactly what we are \ntrying to say. If you want to talk about Medicare, limit the damages, \nlimit the recovery of the injured parties as a result of the neglect of \nthese manufacturers as this bill does, and what will happen is that you \nand I will pick them up in Medicare and Medicaid costs.\n  In all my years of trial work, I have never really seen an injured \nparty make money. And I can tell you less and less of those in the \ntrial bar are joining that particular trial bar because the other is \nmuch more luxurious. If you can represent the industry, the business, \nthe manufacturer, if you can represent, as some 60,000 lawyers here in \nthe District of Columbia represent, lobbyist consultant causes, hardly \never entering the courtroom, you are into the game of billable hours. \nIn my 20 years of active practice and over 40 years at the bar--almost \n50 years now at the bar--I have never had a billable hour case. We are \nalways practicing law from the standpoint of the success of the trial \nand the representation of that particular client.\n  But be that as it may, let me emphasize going right to the different \nstudies made by the Rand Corp. and others, large manufacturers have \nresponded to product liability suits by establishing corporate level \nproduct safety officers. In the 1987 Conference Board report, 232 risk \nmanagers reported that over two-thirds of the companies in this survey \nhad responded to product liability by making their products safer.\n  I can go down the list of the various trials and findings that led to \na change of practice, whether it is in the Dalkon shield case, or the \nDrano case. The evidence showed in the Drano case that, subsequent to \nthe plaintiff's injury, the screw top on the can was changed because it \ncaused it to explode. That particular design was changed on account of \nthe plaintiff being awarded $900,000 in compensatory damages and \n$10,000 in punitive damages. With regard to firefighter respirators, \nthree firefighters in Lubbock, TX, were killed as a result of a defect \nin their respirators, a hole in the diaphragm. A lawsuit revealed that \nthe company knew that the respirator was unsafe. The manufacturer later \ncorrected the mask as a result of the lawsuit.\n  I have a whole documentary of product after product after product \nbeing made more safe than ever before on account of product liability. \nWe are all talking like product liability is a burden on society. It is \nan advantage to the American body politic because it brings out this \nsafe conduct.\n  Specifically, Mr. President, just a few years ago, originally some 15 \nto 20 years ago, I went into Bosch, a manufacturer of fuel injectors in \nmy backyard, which now has graduated up to making antilock brakes. I \nwould think that any investor on the New York Stock Exchange would say \nwait a minute, before I invest in the antilock brake manufacturer, I \ncan see that after a year one might go awry, after 10 years a car with \nan antilock brake might go and cause the one wheel to lock and the rest \nspill them over and cause, without even running into somebody else, a \nserious accident. I better not invest in an antilock brake \nmanufacturer.\n  The truth of the matter is that I was introduced into the \nmanufacturing plant itself, and I put coverings over my shoes, a smock \naround my clothing, a head cover over my hair and my head and \neverything else as if we were producing pharmaceuticals or film. We \nhave the film making plants of Fuji that is doubling their size right \nnow in Greenwood, SC. I have Hoffmann-La Roche actually building the \nmost modern pharmaceutical plant in the world in Florence, SC, right \nthis minute. And we have brought in Parke-Davis and Baxter and Norwich \nand the other medical pharmaceutical manufacturers. So we know about \nthem.\n  I thought I was already into one of those film making plants where \nyou could not stand the slightest speck of dust. I asked the manager at \nthe Bosch plant, I said, ``Let me ask you about this plant. How many \nproduct liability claims have you had?'' He said, ``What's that?'' I \nsaid, ``Product liability claims. Defective antilock brakes, some of \nthem going bad.'' He said, ``Oh, Senator, we have never had a product \nliability claim. If we had''--and he quickly ran over on the line there \nand picked up one--he said, ``See that little number. Every antilock \nbrake that goes out of this particular plant has a serial number and we \ncould immediately identify where and at what stage any kind of defect \noccurred, but we have never had it.''\n  Now, that particular corporation makes the antilock brakes for the \nToyota, for the Mercedes-Benz, and was recently awarded a 10-year \ncontract for all General Motors cars. This is what we have going on as \na result of product liability. It is not the stultification or denial \nof the development of manufactured products or pharmaceuticals or \nwhatever else. What has developed is far more safe to the consuming \npublic.\n  We know that, and we appreciate it. The Consumer Federation of \nAmerica, Consumers Union, every consumer organization of any \ncredibility whatsoever in the United States of America, is absolutely \nopposed to this so-called reasonable bill. They know it, and I know it. \nIt is not reasonable.\n  [[Page S5640]] The bill in the last three Congresses never had caps. \nThey have caps on punitive damages now in this bill. We never had in \nthe last three Congresses the matter of misuse. Now they have a misuse \nprovision. It allows them to get out from under the particular claims \nexemption. They have the exclusion for rental car exemptions, the \nmatter of component parts. We can go right on down the different things \nthat have been sneaked into this particular bill.\n  To talk in terms that I have heard recently about how you cannot pass \nproduct liability reform at the State level absolutely begs the \nquestion. The distinguished Presiding Officer knows that. He has it in \nhis own State.\n  In 1988, in South Carolina, under a Republican administration, a \nRepublican Governor, we had a get-together of the chamber of commerce, \nthe textile manufacturers, the pharmaceutical groups, the trial \nlawyers, the medical bar and all insurance companies, and we got a \nproduct liability reform bill passed and signed by the Governor. Forty-\nsix States have done that.\n  I heard just recently that, to do that at the State level would take \n4 or 5 years because those trial lawyers would come in and delay it, \nbecause they like delay. Totally false. The sponsors of this bill do \nnot understand that.\n  I am a trial lawyer. That is the last thing I want is delay. I know \nthe game. The insurance company is going to ultimately pay, if at all, \nif there is going to be any recovery. The insurance company and the \nmanufacturers' attorneys win every time if they can delay the case. \nWitnesses get lost, they ``malaccuse,'' and everything else of that \nparticular kind, and all along that trial lawyer is having to pay for \nwhat? For the investigative costs, the medical experts, the \ndepositions, interrogatories, the court costs, his own time and \neverything else on a contingent-fee basis.\n  You get 5 to 10 fairly substantial cases in your practice and you are \ncarrying those for 2 to 3 years now. Do not tell me it will take 4 to 5 \nyears, I will go broke. So I as a trial lawyer am trying my best to \nbring those cases to a conclusion. Yes, the trial lawyer does have a \nself-interest in bringing that case to a conclusion and as quickly as \nhe can. The delay is on the other side. I know, because I represented \nthe electric and gas company and the bus operator in my own hometown in \ndefending injury claims against that bus company. Any time I got the \ninvestigators--and we can sit up there with the mahogany desk and nice \nKarastan rug, answer the phone and act dignified and do not have to \nworry about looking for any witnesses or talking to any doctors or \nanything else, just tell the investigatory team of the large \ncorporation--and it was the largest corporation we had in the State of \nSouth Carolina at the time I represented them--``Go ahead and get all \nof those statements. Don't worry about it.'' ``Miss so and so, fill out \ninterrogatories No. 52 and send that to the lawyers and I'll send them \nanother bill.''\n  Oh, man, that is luxury practice. That is what you have downtown \nhere. That is what you have with this crowd that is sponsoring this \nparticular bill. They wrote it. The game plan now is quite obvious. The \ngame plan is ooze and cruise. How reasonable and how fair and they call \nit the fairness act and all that nonsense, like somebody is fast \nasleep, and then go over there and get with the Gingrich contract.\n  Republicans are rolling over on this side with the Gingrich contract. \nHe writes it over there. He tells them, ``You do this or you're out of \nit. You're not going to have your funds raised by us, you're not going \nto have our support in the next year's election and if you want to be \non the team, you have to come out for practice and vote as we say \nvote.''\n  Right now they have in the morning news how they are trying to get \nthem to sign a pledge about a budget. Can you imagine that? Like \njoining some organization or fraternity. I never was in a fraternity. \nThey were against the rules at the campus of the college I attended. \nBut you take an oath. So they have an oath of loyalty to whatever \nelse--not to the people they represent or their conscience but what Mr. \nGingrich and the contract finds.\n  So we are in a dangerous strait here in this particular body. We will \nbe asking for time to debate every one of these particular measures. \nYou have not only the matter of the punitive damages provision in here, \nyou have the exemption for the manufacturer. You would think that the \nconscience would get them, if you please, and they say, ``Well, it \nmakes no difference.'' If it does not make any difference, I want them \nto go along with the amendment when we put it up that the manufacturer \nwill also be under the provisions of this particular measure.\n  They have it for everybody but who? The manufacturer. The \nmanufacturer is not subject to the provisions of this bill. It is a \nmanufacturer's scapegoat if there ever was one. In good conscience, I \njust could not put up a bill like that and try to defend it amongst my \ncolleagues. I would lose all my credibility. But that is what they \nhave. They say it is not restrictive. Yet, certain evidence is not \nadmissible. They say it is simplicity, eliminating duplication, the \nmultiplicity of suits. They asked for a bifurcated system on the one \nhand for action and on the other hand for punitive damages and say you \ncannot on the willfulness part submit that kind of evidence in the \nactual damage claim over here for compensatory damages.\n  The Conference of State Supreme Court Justices came up, the National \nConference of State Legislatures came up and said this is really going \nto bog us down taking the guidelines from Washington and trying to \nadminister with new words of art and provisions at the State level. If \nthere is ever one unfunded mandate, this is it. This is an unfunded \nmandate back at the States to cost more money, more legal costs and \neverything else of that kind, and they have the audacity to come forth \nwith a straight face and say they are interested in the consumers \ngetting the money because the lawyers are getting too much. That is out \nof the whole cloth.\n  Of all tort claims in the United States of America, rather of all \ncivil claims filed in the United States of America, tort represents 9 \npercent of all civil claims filed. Of the 9 percent of tort claims \nfiled, product liability represents 4 percent of the 9 percent, or \nthirty-six one-hundredths. We are not talking about medical \nmalpractice. We are not talking about businesses suing businesses. We \nare not talking about Securities and Exchange Commission suits and \nclass actions. We are not talking about automobile wreck cases. We are \nnot talking about any of those kinds of injury cases. We are talking \nsolely about product liability. It is not a national problem.\n  President Ford took this up starting back in 1976 with a special \nstudy commission, and after 4 years of findings, they found that the \nStates were doing it. Sure enough, over the past 15 years, as I pointed \nout, 46 of the 50 States have just done that, they have upgraded, in a \nsense, their product liability laws.\n  Now cometh the theme, so to speak, of the revolution of the Contract \nWith America. I never heard so many Republican friends of mine quote \nJefferson, but all of a sudden Thomas Jefferson has gotten very popular \naround here in Washington these days. ``That Government closest to the \npeople is the best Government.'' So when it comes to welfare reform, \nblock grant it back, give it to the States. When it comes to housing, \ngive them the money. When it comes to the crime bill, eliminate the \ncops on the beat, give them block grants back there. The people back \nhome know how to better spend the money.\n They have the better judgment at the local level. You would think that \n12 jurors having sworn under oath to listen to the particular evidence \nwould better be able to make a judgment in a case. But, no, no, not \nwith this manufacturers' bill. Corporate America has come to the scam \nhere and they come and say: ``No, wait a minute, we have to reverse \nfields and we have to bring this to Washington, and do not worry about \nit, Washington, we are really not going to get uniformity because we \nare not going to give you a Federal cause of action,'' which I have \nbeen debating for 15 years. If you believe it is a Federal problem, \ngive us a Federal cause of action. They said: ``No, what we are going \nto do is give you Federal regulatory guidelines.'' That is what this \nwhole body is up against--regulatory measures at the State level. Here \nwith this bill we are going to heap it upon them.\n  [[Page S5641]] The body is up against the Washington bureaucracy to \ngive it back to the local level. This whole body is all wound up about \nunfunded mandates here now. Come the end of April, we are going against \nthe contract, and we are going to give them an unfunded mandate, and \nthey know it. The whole body is saying that in welfare we have to make \nthe recipient more responsible. Here we say that the manufacturer is \nnot going to be responsible. We have all kinds of bars in here to \nprotect the manufacturer. If you have any doubt about it, we will show \nyou the section where the manufacturer itself is exempt from the bill. \nThat is what we have going here with respect to product liability.\n  We have serious problems in this country of ours. But torts, \nhistorically, under the English system for 200 some years, has been a \nmatter of the jurisdiction of the States. They are trying to give \nmeaning to the 10th amendment. When I go home and turn on C-SPAN, I see \nthe speakers about the contract say we are going to give meaning to the \n10th amendment. Those responsibilities, not delegated specifically \nunder the Constitution to the Federal Government, shall be reserved to \nthe States. Oh, no, they say, on this one, if we can put over this \none--how do you put it over? When you get in a campaign, Mr. President, \nyou know how they have been putting it over because I get it from the \nother side. They come to me, the National Association of Manufacturers, \nin my campaign over the last 15 years, elected three times. They say, \n``Why do you not go along with this thing? We have product liability \nproblems''.\n  The chamber of commerce comes to you and the Business Roundtable \nmembers come to you, responsible civic leaders and all think there is a \nreal problem. Why? Because Victor Schwartz, and the hired hands up \nhere, a bunch of 60,000 lawyers, have been paid off. They say, ``Get \nahold of that Senator and get a commitment from him because he has not \ncommitted.'' We tried to tell the business leaders, ``Look, wherein do \nyou ever think that the National Congress in Washington, DC, is more \nconservative than your own legislature back in the State capital?'' I \nknow from 40 years in government that temporarily, yes, you might have \na more conservative government and group over in the House of \nRepresentatives. But give it a few more years and I can tell you from \nmy experience up here, I would much rather have the State legislature \nfind on this particular score. You might think you get temporary relief \nbut in a few years, you will trip up on this rug and go up to the \nwindow and get your money. Business does not have a problem. The 232 \nrisk managers under the Conference Board study showed that it was less \nthan 1 percent of the cost of doing business.\n  When they get to talking about competitiveness, competitiveness, \ncompetitiveness, I have to smile, because I have been in the game for \nyears and I wish they would point out--and they cannot--that we have \nover 100 German industries--recently BMW, recently Hoffmann-La Roche, \nand over 50 Japanese industries, and I got the blue chip corporations \nof America that came to my home State. Not once have they said: ``What \nabout this product liability? We need some kind of solution to it.''\n  The fine businesses that like and respect safety are willing to put \nit into the cost of the product and into the practices, with safety \noffices and everything else in these particular entities all over the \nUnited States.\n  If you want safe manufacturing, you come to the United States of \nAmerica. We take it for granted and we are about to strip it today and \ntomorrow and the next day, whenever we vote, trying our best to put in \na fixed situation which is, frankly, an embarrassment to me having been \non both sides of this particular problem in the courtroom representing \nbusinesses as well as representing injured parties. It is difficult, \ndifficult, difficult in this day and age. You do not get runaway \njuries. They all know about insurance. They are very sophisticated. \nThey have all good businesses. They know there is no free lunch. You \nhave to prove by the greater weight of the evidence to all 12 jurors--\nall 12. If you miss one, your case is over with; you get a mistrial and \nyou have a hard time getting back into the courtroom and all that time \nyour costs and all are going up.\n  So in these civil claims of tort, if we want to get to the problem, \nlet us go to the businesses suing businesses that have billions and \nbillions of dollars, where these fellows sit around in the boardroom \nand say, ``I do not care, let us go to trial and let us show what we \ncan do.'' I put in the Record here yesterday the most spurious of \nclaims by different businesses for millions and billions of dollars, \nreally, which says to me perhaps there is a problem. The most objective \ngroup--and if you had to characterize it, it could be characterized \n``corporate''--is the American Bar Association. They have various \ndivisions. The American Bar started really with the utilities and the \nrailroad and other lawyers. They are the ones who had the money to go \nall the way to Chicago, all the way to New York or Los Angeles to a \nmeeting. Working lawyers for individual clients never had that kind of \nmoney. They found out they were not represented. As a result, that is \nwhy you have ATLA, the American Trial Lawyers Association. I was in on \nthe early days when it was organized. Now we have almost as many \ndefense lawyers attend our ATLA conferences as plaintiff's lawyers. The \ndefense lawyers come and learn and understand the various issues, the \nvarious demonstrative evidence that was started out years ago on the \nwest coast by Lou Ashe and Mel Belli, and others, to keep a record, \nrather than an operation by ambush. Give everybody everything you have \nand say here is what I am going to prove. As a result, we have the \nRestatement of Torts and otherwise, and wonderful progress has been \nmade in the field of law in the trial of cases over many, many years.\n  That has been done at the State level. What happened as a result is \nthat the American Bar Association, once again, for the sixth time, has \nopposed this bill. They have prepared testimony and testified against \nthe bill. You have the American Bar Association; you have the \nAssociation of Law School Deans and Professors--over 121--opposing this \nas bad law. You have the National Conference of State Legislatures and \nthe Conference of State Supreme Court Justices. We have the credibility \nand the concern of the responsible consumer groups and other wise \nindividuals--the AFL-CIO and everyone else who really understands the \nplight of injured parties. They all oppose this as a bad, bad, bad, \nprejudicial kind of measure that should not be in the National \nCongress. If there is a problem, the States are handling it well. This \nis part of the contract. I hope that in this context these folks will \nkeep their contract with the American people.\n  Mr. BREAUX. If the Senator will yield, I would like to ask the \nSenator a question. One of the arguments I have heard on the side of \nthe proponents of the legislation is that we have to do this in \nCongress, in Washington, because we have to have what they call \nuniformity among all of the States, and all of the States have to have \nthe same laws when it deals with personal injuries that are derived \nfrom defective products that hurt people, that we have to have the same \nlaws in all of the States.\n  It is my understanding that this legislation says you have to have \nuniformity, unless the State wants to make it even more difficult for \nan injured person to recover, and then we can have 50 States having 50 \nsets of different rules, if the rules make it more difficult for an \ninjured person to recover.\n That is not uniformity.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, that is not uniformity; the Senator is \nquite correct. More restricted measures are permitted.\n  The fact of the matter is that it is not uniform with respect to one \nof the big issues of concern, the matter of punitive damages.\n  In the distinguished State of Washington, home of the manager of this \nbill and the principal author, they do not have punitive damages. Where \nthey have punitive damages, they are limited to $250,000, but they are \nnot required by this bill in those States that do not have punitive \ndamages.\n  There is no uniformity here. If they really wanted uniformity, we \nwould have had ipso facto a Federal cause of action. Then we would have \nthe rules, the simplicity, and the uniformity.\n  There is no attempt to produce true uniformity, even though we have \nhad \n[[Page S5642]] this measure up time and time again, everyone has \nwondered about this particular measure and requirement of the States in \ntheir jurisdiction. There is a constitutional question involved, but \nthey have said: ``Wait a minute; if we really want uniformity, please \ngive a Federal cause of action and we will go from there.''\n  If we want a finding under the interstate clause, Congress has that \nauthority and responsibility to make the finding and get a Federal \ncause of action. Then we have uniformity. But they use every gimmick to \nmake sure it is not.\n  Mr. BREAUX. It is my understanding, does the Senator agree, that this \nuniformity argument really does not apply; if each State wants to make \nit more difficult for an injured person to recover, they have the right \nto do that?\n  Under this proposal, we could have 50 different States with 50 \ndifferent sets of rules with regard to an injured person's ability to \nrecover damages, if it is more restrictive than this bill.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is right. Take every page of the bill--every page \nof the bill has certain legislative, congressional language. That is to \nbe interpreted, the intent of that particular language is to be \ninterpreted by the 50 several supreme courts of the 50 several, \nseparate States. Then, in certain instances, it could go all the way to \nthe U.S. Supreme Court. So they know that.\n  We would not have that if we had a Federal cause of action. We would \nhave one jurisdiction and we would move with that and the lawyers and \nthe parties would know where they are. They do not want them to know \nwhere they are.\n  There are certain roadblocks, restrictions, as indicated in your \nquestion. This bill says that, if we want to get more restrictive or \nwant to put a greater burden to the injured party, fine. We do not mind \nat the national level.\n  If we approve this bill, we are saying as a Government up here, if \npeople want to do that, the Government in Washington, the great white \nfather, we approve that. If a State wants to be more considerate of the \ninjured party; no, no. We, the Federal Government, the end-all, be-all \nof wisdom up here, the Washington bureaucrats, we say no.\n  Mr. BREAUX. If the Senator will yield, I think he has very clearly \nmade the point we are talking about--fairness. This legislation does \nnot represent fairness at all. I think the Senator from South Carolina \nhas made that point very well. I thank him.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Senator from Louisiana. He \nhas been a leader on this measure.\n  I can say manufacturers are not all that steamed up. They would have \nlong since gotten rid of me. They have tried, and they have come pretty \nclose the last time, so I am not bragging.\n  I can say right now, the manufacturers understand it. I met time and \nagain with manufacturers, business leaders, bankers, and everyone else \nof that kind, and they begin to realize that.\n  I have asked, I challenged them, get a judge in the State of South \nCarolina that has just been put up to the circuit court of appeals, as \nhas Billy Wilkins. Remember Judge Wilkins, who headed up a sentencing \ncommission for President Reagan and was considered for the head of the \nFBI? Go back to Billy and say, ``Is product liability a problem here, \nreally?'' He would say, ``Not in South Carolina, not in the State. They \nhandle it well.''\n  This has not come from the judiciary or the American bar. This has \nnot come from the consumers, whose interest it is supposed to--with \nthat title, Fairness Act--supposed to represent. On the contrary, it is \na manufacturers scam.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, in the nature of attempting to correct a \nfew, I think, inadvertent misstatements during the course of the last \n24 hours, and also in the interest of speaking philosophically on at \nleast one of the points made by my friend and colleague from South \nCarolina, I would like to speak briefly on three or four subjects.\n  Yesterday in his opening statement, the distinguished junior Senator \nfrom Louisiana [Mr. Breaux] commented that although Louisiana State law \ndoes not allow punitive damages, S. 565 would preempt this refusal to \nallow such damages. It is quite important for me to correct that \nmisapprehension, as my own State of Washington, like Louisiana, is one \nof roughly five in this country that does not permit punitive damages \nin most civil litigation at all.\n  As I said in my opening statement, if I had my way, I would abolish \npunitive damages in civil litigation. It amounts to an unlimited form \nof punishment, the risk of unlimited punishment in civil litigation at \nthe absolute discretion or whim of the jury. My view of civil \nlitigation is that it should be designed to redress grievances, to \ncompensate fully individuals for actual damages that they have \nsuffered, but should not be used for punishment.\n  So I would be extremely disturbed if we were dealing with a bill that \nincluded the preemption to which the Senator from Louisiana referred.\n  S. 565, which, in essence, is what we are dealing with in my \nsubstitute amendment, does not preempt the ability of a State to \nrestrict punitive damages to a greater extent than are restricted in S. \n565 itself.\n  Section 107, subsection (A) reads:\n\n       General ruling. Punitive damages may, to the extent \n     permitted by applicable State law, be awarded against the \n     defendant in a product liability action that is subject to \n     this title.\n\n  And then it goes on to limit punitive damages in such actions. That \nis to say, that it does put certain limitations on punitive damages, \nbut it does not mandate that a State must permit even up to that \nlimitation in product liability litigation in those States.\n  While we are on the subject of preemption, there are two other \nsimilar areas in which there is no preemption in the sense, at least, \nthat there is no preemption of a State prohibition against punitive \ndamages. We have in this bill a statute of repose for certain \nmanufactured items of 20 years. But if a State has a statute of repose \nas broad or broader than the one in this bill with a limit of fewer \nthan 20 years, that statute of repose is not preempted.\n  Section 108, subsection (B)(2) reads:\n\n       Notwithstanding paragraph 1--\n\n  Which establishes a 20-year statute of repose--\n\n       If pursuant to applicable State law an action described in \n     such paragraph is required to be filed during a period that \n     is shorter than the 20-year period specified in such \n     paragraph, the State law shall apply with respect to such a \n     period.\n\n  And, finally, if a State law does not allow joint liability at all, \nS. 565, which bans joint liability for noneconomic damages, does not \nrequire a State to ban joint liability for economic damages.\n  All of this is relevant because in a conversation an hour or so ago \non this floor between the distinguished Senators from Louisiana and \nSouth Carolina, the criticism was raised that if we are going to go for \nuniformity, we should require absolute uniformity; that there is \nsomething perverse or something wrong about a preemption in one \ndirection without a preemption which is all encompassing in nature.\n  In fact, I believe the Senator from South Carolina went beyond that \npoint to say that if we desired uniformity in product liability \nlitigation, we should transform what is now a State cause of action to \nexclusively a Federal cause of action and have identical rules \napplicable in every State in the country.\n  I find it curious that we should so frequently in this body be faced \nwith an argument that because we seek to reach a certain goal, we have \nto do it absolutely and without exception.\n  I believe that it is the essence of our system that we are constantly \nadjusting our rules to meet the present needs of the society. I do not \nbelieve that we must act mechanistically and, of course, we do not act \nmechanistically. Usually, this kind of argument is brought up simply \nbecause the entire concept is opposed by whoever presents it.\n  I began my remarks on this bill yesterday by saying that obviously \nthere \n[[Page S5643]] are two purposes of society on which sometimes the \nmargins come into conflict. Clearly, in connection with this \nlitigation, one is the regressive grievances, is the proposition that \ncourts should be open to citizens of the United States and of the \nrespective States to sue when they feel that they have been wronged. \nThe other is economic efficiency, is the encouragement of the creation \nof jobs, of research, of development resulting from that research, the \nmarketing of new and improved goods and pharmaceutical drugs, and the \nprevention of the irrational and unreasonable withdrawal from the \nmarket of goods and services which are of great use to most of society \nbut which occasionally are accompanied by adverse reactions on the part \nof a few consumers.\n  So what we are trying to do here is to deal with the proposition that \nthe proponents of this bill--and I think the clear majority of the \nMembers of this body--feel that the pendulum has swung too far in favor \nof litigation. This should not be a surprise. We read about this \nconstantly, we hear about it constantly, and we know that we are the \nmost litigious society, literally, in the history of the world. It \nseems quite evident to most citizens that the operations of our society \nand of our economy are often inhibited by the amount and the nature of \nmuch of the litigation with which the people of America are faced.\n  And so here we seek, in a modest way, in one field of litigation, to \nput some limits on that litigation. We do not do so by depriving \nanybody of a cause of action. Every cause of action that exists at the \npresent time will exist if this bill becomes law. But we do put some \ninhibitions in the way of the pursuit of punitive damages, damages \nwhich do not, by their very nature, compensate for an injury. We put \nlimitations on the ability of plaintiffs to recover from defendants \nbeyond the responsibility of those defendants with a particular harm. \nAnd, yes--I must correct myself--we do under some circumstances deprive \npeople of causes of action with respect to equipment and manufactured \nitems which are more than 20 years in age.\n  That does not mean that we feel we have done everything that might \nappropriately be done. We feel that these limitations are reasonable \nand should be universal in nature. But that does not automatically \ncarry with it the philosophy that no one else, no other State, can feel \nthat other limitations, greater limitations, are also appropriate. We \nneed the experimentation of a federal system in that connection. Nor do \nwe feel that because we desire somewhat greater uniformity in the law, \nwe have to have absolute uniformity. Now, with 50 States and the \nDistrict of Columbia, each with a different legal code, there is a \ntotal lack of imposed uniformity in the law relating to product \nliability, in spite of the fact that the production and marketing of \nproducts is national in nature. Of course, I suppose we can say we \nshould go from no mandatory uniformity at all to 100 percent mandated \nuniformity. Personally, I think that would be absurd. I think most \nMembers of this body think it would be absurd. There is not the \nslightest chance that this body, in its wisdom, would federalize the \nentire product liability system. But that does not mean that a greater \ndegree of uniformity that we have at the present time is not socially \ndesirable. We--and even more important than we--the market thinks that \na greater degree of uniformity is essential. So we go toward the \ncenter. We attempt to get that pendulum back into a centerpiece. We are \nseeking balance. So we do not intend to go to the extremes with respect \nto product liability, and we do not in this bill.\n  We do not intend to go to the extremes with respect to joint \nliability, and we do not in the course of this bill. We do not adopt \nthe shortest possible statute of repose in this bill, and we do not \ndemand absolute uniformity in this bill.\n  In the four most important elements of this bill, we seek not some \nkind of pure ideology, but an appropriate balance, a greater degree of \nencouragement for the economy to create jobs, competitiveness, new and \nimproved products, certain limitations on the kind of litigation \nproblems which plague our society, and we feel it is this middle ground \nthat is the appropriate ground. That is the rationale that, I think, is \noverwhelmingly appropriate for the way in which we treat preemption in \neach of these areas.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HEFLIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this bill. It is \nentitled the Product Liability Fairness Act. In my judgment, that is \nthe biggest misnaming of any bill that I have seen come \nbefore this body. It is a misnomer because, in my judgment, it is very \nunfair and one-sided. It is sort of like you have seen in the fine \nprint--you know, everybody's choice--they say it is a contract you \nentered into. It is one of those take-it-or-leave-it sort of things, in \nthat here we have a very unfair bill. I will be going into that as we \ndiscuss this over the next several days.\n  I want to discuss several things. First, my friend from the State of \nWashington says that he would like to do away with all punitive \ndamages, and I wonder if he has thought that when a company hires \nemployees--chemists, engineers, and so forth--who have had a record of \nalcoholism or drug abuse and nevertheless the manufacturer exposes the \npublic to those types of people and a person is injured, should not \nthat company be punished?\n  Let us consider a case--this is not in product liability situation--\nwhere a person is driving where an automobile accident occurs, and the \ndriver of one car has 10 beers, crosses the center line, causes an \naccident, and man loses his leg, as compared to an accident in which a \nbare distraction causes damage to someone.\n  I think both the people who lose legs regardless should be entitled \nto recover compensation, but the man who was under the influence of 10 \nbeers, and who got behind the wheel and injured someone, ought to be \npunished.\n  The concept of tort liability is that there is a wrongdoer and \nsomeone is injured as a result thereof. The whole basis of our law that \nhas developed over the common law over the years is being that the \nwrongdoer must pay.\n  So are we talking about a situation in which we want to put all \nwrongdoers on the same level? Human beings differ. In regard to \ninjuries, the loss of one, two, three fingers--if I were to be injured \nby a machine that did not have a proper guard on it--those three \nfingers that I lose may be different from the three fingers that a \nviolinist loses.\n  So we make distinctions in regard to individuals. There are a lot of \naspects of noneconomic damage that we fail to give appropriate \nattention to. A young woman who loses the capacity to have a child, a \nyoung woman whose face is scarred in a fire--all of those are \nnoneconomic pain and suffering.\n  In Russia, when Chernobyl, the nuclear plant, experienced a meltdown, \nthe people who suffered radiation and who suffered in many ways, many \nof those suffered noneconomic damages, but they ought not to be limited \nin their compensation.\n  Now, I realize that in some aspects there have been changes in the \nbill before the Senate. Changes that have been made, designed to be \nable to get it passed in the Senate. I do not think anybody here fails \nto realize that the House of Representatives passed a bill that was \nwritten with one purpose in mind--to see that awards are substantially \nreduced and that the injured party does not receive what they really \nare entitled to.\n  Whatever the Senate were to pass, if cloture is obtained, will go to \nconference. What will come out of conference will be the bill that will \ngo to the President.\n  Looking at who the players are, the cast of characters, who will be \nin conference, I do not think there is much question as to who will \nprevail. I think the Speaker of the House will prevail, relative to the \nbill that comes out of conference.\n  There is no question that he has shown superb leadership in getting \nlegislation passed in the House and in being able to bring about party \ndiscipline and to attract others. I do not sell him short on what the \nconference version of this bill will be like.\n  Now, I want to go over a few things in this bill and in the House-\npassed bill, and list what in my judgment I think the final version \nwill be.\n  [[Page S5644]] Both bills exclude commercial loss. Commercial loss by \nbusiness--which includes loss of profits, destruction to facilities, \neverything else--does not come under this bill or the House bill.\n  Why, then, if the provisions of this bill are so great and so needed \nthat corporate America is excluded from it? There are a lot of \nexamples. We have a machine that blows up in a factory because of \ndefective manufacturing. That machine blows up and people on the \nsidewalk and other places are injured. They come under the provisions \nof this bill. However, the company itself can sue the manufacturer of \nthe machine for lost profits, for the destruction done to the physical \nproperty, for numerous elements of damage. They do it outside the \npurview of this particular bill.\n  If something is good for the goose, it ought to be good for the \ngander. But businesses do not want to come under this bill.\n  Where have the large damage verdicts occurred? The biggest one that \nwe know about was Pennzoil versus Texaco, for $11 billion. It was not a \nproduct liability case, but a commercial case.\n  Go down the list and we will see most of the largest verdicts that \nhave occurred relative to civil litigation are where businesses suing \nbusinesses. They do not attempt to take care of that in this bill. They \ndo not want to be put under this bill.\n  The fact that they do not want to be put under this bill indicates \nthat there are provisions that they do not want that could affect their \nlawsuits, when they suffer a loss, and when they sue a wrongdoer, to \nhave to live with and to have to comply with.\n  When we stop and think, there are other aspects we should consider. \nThe bill does exclude airlines for hire, but there are other aircraft \nthat we ought to look at. Two planes crash in the air. Persons that are \ninjured in those planes come under this proposed bill as to their \ndamages. The airplane does not. One of the planes drops parts of its \nbody down on Yankee Stadium and Yankee Stadium suffers a financial \nloss. The spectators are injured. They come under this bill;\n the owner of the Yankees for the loss of business profits, destruction \nto grandstands or to bleachers or what else might be, they do not come \nunder it. What is good for the goose is good for the gander.\n\n  The bill talks about an ongoing business. I even got to thinking \nabout it, and this may apply or may not apply, but if part of that \nairplane falls on a house of ill repute, if it is legitimate in a \ntown--and there are States and towns where they are--then the ongoing \nbusiness can recover for the loss of profits. That may be an extreme \nexample, but it shows you how they have crafted this bill to take care \nof situations pertaining to commercial use, to business losses, yet the \nhuman elements of loss of limbs and of pain and suffering are \nrestricted under this bill.\n  In the product liability bill during the 103d Congress, there was a \nprovision for a defense against punitive damages where the FDA had \ngiven premarket approval to a drug or medical device. Last time there \nwere several Senators who were very concerned about this provision, so \nthis time the proponents left it out with the idea of picking up some \nvotes. The House, on the other hand, left it in. They left in the FDA \nprovision whereas statistics have shown, over a 10-year period 51.6 \npercent of all products that have been approved for the market by FDA \nhave been recalled. But when this gets to conference, you can rest \npretty well assured that the House provisions on that will control and \nbe maintained.\n  This bill has a 20-year statute of repose. A statute of repose says \nthat regardless of what happens, after 20 years of it being built--and \nwhere it says ``construct''--that thereafter, regardless of what was \nthe reason, you cannot bring a lawsuit. You have a complete defense. \nThis language of the bill is broad enough, in my judgment, with the use \nof the word ``construct'' to include a bridge, which if it collapses, \nwill be subject to a statute of repose of 20 years. Yet the House bill \nhas a statute of repose of only 15 years, and I think it will end up \nbeing 15 years.\n  You had the general aviation awhile back, where a bill was passed, \nagreement was worked out by most of the people involved here. They put \nin an 18-year statute of repose, which I think was a serious mistake \nsince the figures show that 60 percent of the small planes in use were \n20 years old or older. But, anyway, the House would even reduce that \ndown further--20 years or 15 years. I mentioned a nuclear power plant, \nChernobyl, and the pain and suffering that had incurred. Practically \nevery nuclear powerplant in the United States today is at least 15 \nyears of age. Most of them are older than 20 years.\n  Maybe it might not cover it. It uses the word ``construct'' and as I \nread the various language, I think it does. But regardless whether it \ndoes as a unit object as a whole, component parts in a nuclear \npowerplant which have been there for 20 years or longer, or 15 if the \nHouse prevails and I think they will. I am not sure, but it seems to me \nI read awhile back the last nuclear power plant that was started in \nconstruction was more than 20 years ago.\n  I think we do not realize the breadth of this bill and its effort to \ntry to encompass all situations and what it will do.\n  I think there was testimony before the Commerce Committee on machine \ntools. The indications were that over 50 percent were at least 30 years \nold or older. Design conflicts, metal stress on airplanes and metal \nstress on airplanes that cause damages frequently, in the decision of \nthe national safety investigation board--I do not remember the exact \nname--would indicate that metal stress on airplanes does not occur \nuntil after 15 or 20 years.\n  On the House side there are caps on noneconomic damages on drug \ncompanies, on pharmaceuticals. That cap is $250,000 on noneconomic \ndamages, and there are provisions throughout on pharmaceuticals and \ndrugs. This new section that was added, this biomaterials section, you \nfirst read it and it looks like raw materials. I was told that is like \na fluid such as silicone that is in a breast implant, or the tissue \nthat is sewed together in regards to making it, that gives them some \nimmunity and protection against these suits.\n  But then you read further in that and it says ``component parts.'' I \nhave a pacemaker. I do not know all the component parts. But, as I \nunderstand it, it has batteries and some computers and other component \nparts. There are wires that go down from that pacemaker, and its \nbattery, into my ventricle--into the chambers of my heart. There are \nseveral component parts.\n  If it is defective, it would mean that for implants--and this \nbiomaterial provision deals with implants--that an individual would \npractically have no way of recovering for defective products.\n  In pharmaceuticals, manufacturers are just almost given complete \nimmunity in any suits. Drugs, and those implants I was mentioning a \nwhile ago, the silicone breast implant, the Copper IUD, and the Dalkon \nshield, as I understand it, are implants. So some people were worried \nabout those as it would affect women for punitive damages. We ought to \nbe concerned about this new section that they put in the bill on \nbiomaterials.\n  The House bill abolishes joint and several liability for noneconomic \ndamages as to all civil lawsuits. The House-passed bill, which again I \nthink will prevail in conference, does not limit it to products but it \nsays to all civil suits. I do not know who is responsible for the \nOklahoma City bombing, but someone could bring a civil suit. I know in \nmy home State that civil action was brought against the Ku Klux Klan \nand really did a great deal to stop the Ku Klux Klan through that civil \nlawsuit because the Klan had some land and other assets that were \ncollectible. In the Oklahoma City situation, in the Alfred Murrah \nBuilding, if there were four people that were involved in it and a \ncourt would have to determine the part that each played relative to a \nconspiracy. But what if one of the conspirators happens to inherit \n5,000 acres of land or has other assets, and it is determined that he \nis the one with the most knowledge, it may be that a plaintiff could \nnot collect damages.\n  The present law is let the parties themselves determine among \nthemselves the apportionment of the damage rather than having the \nplaintiff responsible relative to the apportionment of damages and the \ndetermination on each and every individual case. I think they have \nworked it out over the years.\n  [[Page S5645]] There are some States that have contributions from \njoint tort feasors. There are others that do not. But as a general \nrule, it has been worked out in a manner where it is not a difficult \nsituation that has caused any tremendous injustice among the defendants \nto apportion that responsibility.\n  We mention caps on punitive damages, and the House has caps on \nnoneconomic damages on drug companies, pharmaceuticals. The language is \nthat it is a cap of $250,000, or three times the economic loss. How \ndoes that apply? Let us take an example. We have a 55-year-old CEO of a \ncompany. He has 10 years of work expectancy say, and at 65 he would \nretire. He makes $5 million a year. So you take $5 million, multiply it \nby the annuity tables, which would we will say 10 years is what he \nwould have. You have $50 million that would be then a part of his cap. \nYou then multiply it by three. He would have a $150 million cap on \npunitive damage, or on the matter of the cap on noneconomic damages \nthat the House has on drugs.\n  Then we compare the $150 million, which takes care of the wealthy, to \nthe housewife. She has no economic loss because she does not work \noutside the home. So the housewife has a cap of $250,000, as opposed to \n$150 million for the CEO. The 65- or 70-year-old retired person has no \neconomic loss, and he is not working. Mr. President, $250,000 is the \ncap. The CEO 55 years of age is capped at $150 million. And you can go \non down the list of the inequities. The provisions as it would apply on \nfactual situations shock your conscience.\n  There is a provision that allows you to collect workers compensation. \nPerhaps you collect under the workman's compensation, $40,000 or \n$30,000. You get your medical bills paid and other expenses. They are \nsubrogated. That means, if a claimant recovers against a third-party \nwrongdoer, the insurer is entitled to get its workman's compensation \ninsurance back. But this bill has the language that a claimant cannot \nsettle his lawsuit without that workman's compensation insurer's \npermission. You have to have the permission of the insurer to settle, \nunless that workman's compensation insurer is paid in full. You come to \nthe point that, well, I do not want to gamble. The case is probably \nworth $500,000. Maybe if somebody does not want to go through a lawsuit \nso they say, ``Well, I will settle my damages for basically about two-\nthirds on the dollar. But the workman's compensation company says, \n``No. I want 100 percent on the dollar,'' and this is shocking to one's \nconscience.\n  I also remind you that we have an exemption under antitrust laws for \ninsurance companies, and they can get together and in effect reach some \nsort of an agreement. There is also the situation that it could well be \nthat they are the same insurance company for the employer as well as \nthe manufacturer. Therefore, they are bargaining for a cheaper figure, \nputting a claimant in a disadvantageous situation.\n  There are all sorts of factual situations that can arise which show \nthis question is which really shocks your mind to consider from a \nviewpoint of what is right and wrong and gives them a hammer over a \nclaimant's head.\n  Shocking your conscience further, there is a provision in this bill \nthat says that if you sue for punitive damages, then either party, the \nplaintiff or defendant or any of the defendants, has a right to have a \nseparate trial on the issue of punitive damages as opposed to the trial \nin chief in which compensatory damages are sought. This bill provides \nfor bifurcated, separate trial.\n  Then the language of this bill provides that you cannot prove the \nelements of culpability, the fault, the evidence of punitive damages in \nthe compensatory damage lawsuit.\n  So you have evidence of a drunk chemist that was involved with a \ncompany making a drug. That evidence would go to punitive damages, but \nit could not be introduced in the compensatory damage lawsuit. I think \nthat shocks your conscience.\n  Consider the example of where a person is intoxicated. The bill has a \nprovision which gives a complete bar to recover if the intoxication of \nthe plaintiff amounted to 50 percent of the causation and the damages. \nOn the other hand, if a punitive damage case was brought under this \nbill, the drunkenness or the alcoholic activity of the chemist or \nwhoever the actor might be that was involved in the production of the \nproduct could not be shown in the compensatory damage lawsuit. You \nwould have to show it only in the punitive damage part of the lawsuit.\n  Now, this bill does not have the loser pay in regard to the \nattorney's fee. But when it comes out of conference, I think you better \nbe extremely watchful as to whether the conference report will contain \nsuch a provision.\n  I think it is important that we look at this bill carefully. I \npointed out some of the provisions, and every time I read the bill I \nsee more and more fine print, methods by which there is an advantage \nthat is sought for manufacturers. I have not had the time to review \nthis yet, but in the punitive damage aspect of it, they have changed \nthe language where it was generally accepted throughout as either \nwillful or wanton or gross negligence depending on the State standards. \nIt uses the words ``conscious, flagrant indifference to the safety of \nothers,'' and so on. I am interested in seeing where that language came \nfrom and the reason.\n  I do not in my recollection remember the use of conscious, but I \nremember that under certain circumstances--and I am hazy on this, and I \nhave asked staff to do some research, to contact a tort professor at a \nuniversity pertaining to this--there seems to me to be a body of law \nthat for a corporation to be conscious, it requires activity on the \npart of the board of directors. I am vague on that, and I do not want \nto make a statement because I am not sure as to that. But that is \nsomething that is troubling and something that I wish to look at \nfurther and perhaps say something else at a later time. But these words \nare new words. And, of course, they would be interpreted by the courts \nas they come along, and there may be basic case law in regards to it at \nthe present time that has given some type of interpretation which means \nthat there is an existing precedent. It may not have to be followed \nfrom one State to another.\n  But that brings up the interpretation which to me is just entirely \ninconsistent by the original motivation that brought forth the idea of \nsome federalized tort law. That was the concept that we live in a world \nin which interstate commerce goes from one State to the other and \nproducts are sold and everything else. Therefore, we need a uniform \nFederal products liability.\n  Well, this is far from being uniform. First, it only preempts the \nState laws in the specific matters that are listed within the bill. The \ninterpretation that is given is placed upon the State court system and \nin diversity cases on the circuit court of appeals. Under the original \nbill that they proposed, they had the State courts reviewing this as \nwell as the territories. You could have had 55 different \ninterpretations of law and of with little uniformity in that regard.\n  The proponents made a change somewhat in that whereby it says that \nthe 11 Federal circuit courts will be involved in interpretations. So \nyou have got all of at least 11 circuits that could have different \ninterpretations, and you could have conflicts of law. They made a \nchange which says basically does away with the concept of the old line \nof cases of Erie which say that the Federal courts shall follow the \nState law and they say now the State laws pertaining to interpretation \nof this shall follow each circuit, but instead of uniformity you can \nstill have at least--well, it would take, in my judgment, 20 to 25 \nyears before you would finally get the matter to the Supreme Court, and \nyou would have uniform interpretation of a particular language or \nparticular provision. It is devoid of uniformity. There is no \nuniformity except for the few instances in which they preempt in this, \nand the ones they preempt are in effect the guts of a civil lawsuit. \nBut you have a situation where you do not have uniformity relative to \nthe motivation that many businesses argued for relative to that. So \nthere is no uniformity that is involved here.\n  There has been this lawsuit about McDonald's and the woman with the \ncup of coffee, and there is an article by Roger Simon in the Baltimore \nSun on February 22, 1995. He says:\n\n       Forget about the millions won by sue-happy lawyers.\n       Just about everybody knows about the woman who spilled a \n     cup of coffee on herself and sued McDonald's because it was \n     too hot.\n       [[Page S5646]] Just about everybody knows the jury awarded \n     her millions of dollars and this is what is wrong with \n     America.\n       It is so wrong, in fact, that the Republican ``Contract \n     With America'' has promised to fix it and hearings are now \n     under way before Congress to make it much harder for \n     consumers to sue for large amounts of money.\n       But the real story of what happened to that much-maligned \n     woman tells us something else about America.\n       Stella Liebeck was 79 years old in 1992 and sitting in her \n     grandson's car when she bought a 49-cent cup of coffee at a \n     McDonald's drive-through window in Albuquerque, N.M.\n       The car was stationary when she lifted the lid to put in \n     cream and sugar, but she spilled the coffee on her lap.\n       She received third-degree burns on her groin, thighs, and \n     buttocks. She was hospitalized for 8 days and underwent skin \n     grafts. According to her lawyer, she was disabled for more \n     than 2 years. Her hospital bills were in excess of $10,000.\n\n  McDonald's offered the woman $800 to settle, and she had a $10,000 \nhospital bill.\n\n       She sued.\n       At trial, Liebeck's attorney, S. Reed Morgan of Houston, \n     told the jury that McDonald's serves its coffee between 180 \n     and 190 degrees, which, he argued, is 40 degrees hotter than \n     most food establishments. McDonald's says coffee tastes \n     better at the higher temperature.\n       Morgan presented an array of expert witnesses who testified \n     that serving coffee at such a high temperature presents an \n     unacceptable risk to consumers.\n       The jurors also learned that between 1982 and 1992, more \n     than 700 claims had been filed against McDonald's for coffee \n     burns and that McDonald's had settled claims for more than \n     $500,000.\n       After a 6-day trial, the jury awarded Mrs. Liebeck $200,000 \n     in compensatory damages for her injuries, but reduced that by \n     20 percent because the jury felt the spill was 20 percent her \n     fault.\n       Then the jury awarded her $2.7 million in punitive damages, \n     a figure it did not pick out of a hat.\n       Having been told during the trial that McDonald's sold \n     $1.35 million worth of coffee per day, the jurors assessed \n     McDonald's a fine equal to 2 days of gross coffee sales.\n       The trial judge, however, reduced the amount of punitive \n     damages to $480,000 or triple Mrs. Liebeck's actual damages.\n       Both sides could have appealed, but it was now 1994. Mrs. \n     Liebeck was 81, and her lawyer felt McDonald's was hoping she \n     would die before the case was concluded.\n       So he negotiated a settlement with McDonald's. He is not \n     allowed to say for how much, but let's say it was roughly \n     $500,000.\n       Mrs. Liebeck's attorney would get one-third of that amount \n     and the expert witnesses, who can cost tens of thousands of \n     dollars, would be paid out of Mrs. Liebeck's share.\n       So Mrs. Liebeck did not become a millionaire or anything \n     close to it. Which is typical of such cases.\n       ``I have been an attorney for 20 years and I have received \n     two awards for punitive damages in all that time''--\n\n  The lawyer Morgan told Roger Simon.\n\n     in a telephone interview * * *. ``And you know how many times \n     I have gotten full punitive damages as the jury intended? \n     Never.''\n       An American Bar Association study of over 25,000 jury \n     awards between 1981 and 1985 found that the median punitive \n     damage award was only $30,000. According to a U.S. News & \n     World Report, the current average award in personal injury \n     cases is $48,000.\n       And, contrary to claims that there has been an explosion of \n     personal injury lawsuits, the number of such suits have been \n     dropping since 1990.\n       It is important to keep in mind, however, that punitive \n     damages are supposed to serve a purpose.\n       ``It's all economics,'' Mr. Morgan said. ``If some \n     companies can make more money injuring you with a bad product \n     than keeping you safe with a good one, they will injure you. \n     I am not saying all companies; I am saying some companies.''\n       In other words, the fear of being socked with large \n     punitive damages is all that keeps some companies from doing \n     us harm.\n       So why should we ``reform'' away our ability to hit them \n     where it hurts?\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, there are many other aspects, and I will \nspeak further in regard to it but, at this time, I yield the floor.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n           Forget About the Millions Won By Sue-Happy Lawyers\n\n                            (By Roger Simon)\n\n       Just about everybody knows about the woman who spilled a \n     cup of coffee on herself and sued McDonald's because it was \n     too hot.\n       Just about everybody knows a jury awarded her millions of \n     dollars and this is what is wrong with America.\n       It is so wrong, in fact, that the Republican ``Contract \n     with America'' has promised to fix it and hearings are now \n     under way before Congress to make it much harder for \n     consumers to sue for large amounts of money.\n       But the real story of what happened to that much-maligned \n     woman tells us something else about America:\n       Stella Liebeck was 79 years old in 1992 and sitting in her \n     grandson's car when she bought a 49-cent cup of coffee at as \n     McDonald's drive-through window in Albuquerque, N.M.\n       The car was stationary when she lifted the lid to put in \n     cream and sugar, but she spilled the coffee on her lap.\n       She received third-degree burns on her groin, thighs and \n     buttocks.

(McDonald's \n     declined to be interviewed for this column.)\n       Morgan presented an array of expert witness who testified \n     that serving coffee at such a high temperature presents an \n     unacceptable risk to consumers.\n       The jurors also learned that between 1982 and 1992 more \n     than 700 claims had been filed against McDonald's for coffee \n     burns and that McDonald's had settled claims for more than \n     $500,000.\n       After a six-day trial, the jury awarded Mrs. Liebeck \n     $200,000 in compensatory damages for her injuries, but \n     reduced that by 20 percent because the jury felt the spill \n     was 20 percent her fault.\n       Then the jury awarded her $2.7 million in punitive damages, \n     a figure it did not pick out of a hat.\n       Having been told during the trial that McDonald's sold \n     $1.35 million worth of coffee per day, the jurors assessed \n     McDonald's fine equal to two days of gross coffee sales.\n       The trial judge, however, reduced the amount of punitive \n     damages to $480,000 or triple Mrs. Liebeck's actual damages.\n       Both sides could have appealed. But it was now 1994, Mrs. \n     Liebeck was 81, and her lawyer felt McDonald's was hoping she \n     would die before the case was concluded.\n       So he negotiated a settlement with McDonald's. He is not \n     allowed to say for how much, but let's say it was roughly \n     $500,000.\n       Mrs. Liebeck's attorney would get one-third of that amount \n     and the expert witnesses, who can cost tens of thousands of \n     dollars, would be paid out of Mrs. Liebeck's share.\n       So Mrs. Liebeck did not become a millionaire or anything \n     close to it. Which is typical of such cases.\n       ``I have been an attorney for 20 years and I have received \n     two awards for punitive damages in all that time.'' Morgan \n     told me in a telephone interview yesterday. ``And you know \n     how many times I have gotten full punitive damages as the \n     jury intended? Never.''\n       An American Bar Association study of over 25,000 jury \n     awards between 1981 and 1985 found that the median punitive \n     damage award was only $30,000. According to a U.S. News & \n     World report, the current average award in personal injury \n     cases if $48,000.\n       And, contrary to claims that there has been an explosion of \n     personal injury lawsuits, the number of such suits has been \n     dropping since 1990.\n       It is important to keep in mind, however, that punitive \n     damages are supposed to serve a purpose.\n       ``It's all economics,'' Morgan said. ``If some companies \n     can make more money injuring you with a bad product than \n     keeping you safe with a good one, they will injure you. I am \n     not saying all companies; I am saying some companies.''\n       In other words, the fear of being socked with large \n     punitive damages is all that keeps some companies from doing \n     us harm.\n       So why should we ``reform'' away our ability to hit them \n     where it hurts?\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I have been waiting my turn to comment \non the observations of my distinguished colleague from Washington. I \nhave been waiting with anticipation.\n  The distinguished author and manager of the bill, the Senator from \nWashington, said, as best I can remember that here in the Senate, if we \nseek to accomplish a certain goal, we should do it absolutely. It is \nvery, very curious to me, if we seek to accomplish a certain goal, we \nshould do it absolutely.\n  [[Page S5647]] Now if what is attempted is uniformity, then why not \nrequire uniformity? It is not about whether it is an absolute or a \nbalanced measured, or any forensic approach. It is a matter of law and \nwhat is provided. We go right to the idea of uniformity and its \ninconsistency with respect to the States.\n  Very interestingly, Mr. President, this bill--which I have a copy \nof--starts off, if we look at the front page of S. 565, as ``A bill to \nregulate interstate commerce by providing for a uniform product \nliability law.''\n  Well, they got into that pollster nonsense that I was talking about \nearlier. They do not want to call it a uniform law, rather they now \nwant to focus on fairness. The buzzword now is everything has to be \n``fair.'' I do not know who it is going to be fair to. They say here \nthat ``This act may be cited as the Product Liability Fairness Act.'' \nHowever, what they ought to call it is the ``Product Liability \nGenerosity Act to Manufacturers of 1995.'' Very, very generous to the \nmanufacturers.\n  Now let us go to the matter of punitive damages. Let us look at S. \n687, the 1993 bill, at page 22. S. 687, page 22, says in the proof of \npunitive damages:\n\n       In determining the amount of punitive damages, the trier of \n     fact shall consider all relevant evidence, one, the financial \n     condition of the manufacturer of product seller; two, the \n     severity of the harm caused by the manufacture of product \n     seller;\n      three, the duration of the conduct or any concealment of it \n     by the manufacturer or product seller; four, the \n     profitability of the conduct to the manufacturer or \n     product seller; five, the number of products sold by the \n     manufacturer or product seller of the kind causing the \n     harm complained of by the claimant.\n\n  These are the elements that you have, generally, at the State court \nlevel on the proof of punitive damages, so it is not just a runaway \njury. Many times I have heard--and the distinguished Presiding Officer \nhas tried these cases--a judge turn and say there is going to be a fine \nto make sure they do not engage in this reckless course of conduct \nagain. And in determining whether there is going to be punitive \ndamages, it's important to look at the worth of the organization and \nwhether or not it is a customary violation, the duration of the conduct \nor concealment of it and all of these elements.\n  Now look at the matter with respect to this particular bill, S. 565, \non punitive damages. They do not list those things at all. It says here \nat the bottom of page 47: ``Proceeding with respect to punitive \ndamages.'' Line 24: ``Evidence that is admissible in the separate \nproceeding under paragraph 1--(i) may include evidence of the profits \nof the defendant, if any, from the alleged wrongdoing; and (ii) shall \nnot include evidence of the overall assets of the defendant.''\n  That is all. They don't spell out what you can look at in this bill, \nMr. President. You can consider evidence of the profits from the \nwrongdoing, but not any evidence whatsoever of the overall assets, or \nthe nature or the duration of the conduct, or concealment of the \nmanufacturer, or the number of products sold, or the financial \ncondition of the manufacturer. In fact, they say: ``Shall not include \nevidence of the overall assets of the defendant.''\n  In the Exxon Valdez case, how do you think Exxon Corp. profited from \nrunning into the ground? There would not be any profit there. I could \ngo through the list of different manufacturers' cases. I refer to the \nmatter of the illusory part position on the Ford automobile, whereby \nthe users of Ford cars between 1970 and 1979 thought that when they had \na car in the park position, it was giving the operator the impression \nthat the car was secured. Of course, it was the slamming of the car \ndoor or vibration caused the car to move in reverse. We have one case \nhere, and several others, about a car that backed up into a particular \nindividual that was walking by the rear of the automobile and was run \ndown, and they gave $4 million in punitive damages.\n  Under this particular test against Ford, if you put this into law, I \ndo not see where Ford gained an advantage or made profits--if they \ncould call it profits--from the misconduct that caused the injury to \nthe pedestrian that the car all of a sudden backed into. Of course, \nFord Motor Co. could change the thing. When they got the punitive \ndamages, they understood and changed the park position in the gear of \nthe Ford automobile.\n  But to come now, and rather than list commonsense provisions that \nthey had in the 1993 and 1991 bills and everything else, they put these \nkinds of restrictive provisions in, and then claim it is a fairer bill. \nI go right to the punitive caps there on page 47. They have in the bill \nwhat purports to be uniform standards for punitive damages. But when \nget beneath the cover, Mr. President, you discover the real deal. That \nis, if you have punitive damages in your State, it's preempted. But if \nin a State that does not provide for punitive damages, you are not \ngiven the benefit of uniformity. The Senator from Washington does not \nwant uniformity for the State of Washington since they do not have \npunitive damages, but, yet, he is talking about uniformity. Of course, \nit is all uniformity so long as it is advantages, so to speak, for the \nmanufacturer, but not the injured party. So this does not provide for \npunitive damages in all States and for all citizens, even though the \nso-called goal of the bill is uniformity. In this particular bill, he \nsaid, even though we want uniformity, if you do not have punitive \ndamages, no way, you still do not get them. On the other hand, even if \nyou were injured, you cannot exceed $250,000 or three times the \neconomic loss which, in many instances, is a lot less than the $250,000 \ncap. So you do not teach the lesson there.\n  With respect to a more reasonable bill, again, you have the matter of \nmisuse on page 44. Regarding the previous bills, they are talking about \nhow reasonable they have gotten now. ``Reduction for misuse for \nalteration of the product.'' This provision was not in the three \nprevious bills. The statute of repose, as has already been pointed out, \nfor no good reason, has been reduced now to 20 years. So pass this, \nwith the House at 15 years, it is going to be reconciled downward.\n  The liability shield for component parts manufacturers was not in the \nthree previous bills. As the distinguished Senator from Alabama, having \na heart beeper in his own body, which is obviously comprised of \ncomponent parts, said wait a minute, if this thing is defective, do not \ngive me this particular bill or I am a definite loser. There will be no \nrecovery there.\n  On the morning of the markup, they added this rental car provision to \nexempt rental car companies from liability. If you get a rental car and \nyou run into somebody, the rental car owner is not responsible. But if \nyou borrow my car, and run into somebody, I am still responsible. They \nhave many more severe provisions, if you read down, as we have in \ncovering this particular measure. The fact of the matter is that this \nbill is not intended to be more reasonable but rather more restrictive \non those seeking recovery for their particular injury.\n  And I want to go here to the uniformity part where it does not apply \nto the manufacturer, and they talk now about the Uniform Commercial \nCode.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent at this particular point--it \nis not that long--to have printed in the Record an overview of the \nUniform Commercial Code.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              The Uniform Commercial Code--An Introduction\n\n\n                         1. nature and origins\n\n       As of 1988, one of three different Official Texts of the \n     Uniform Commercial Code was in force in each of the American \n     states except Louisiana, as well as the District of Columbia \n     and the Virgin Islands. The 1962 Official Text (or a \n     predecessor with minor variations) was in force in 3 states. \n     The 1972 Official Text was in force in 14 states. The 1978 \n     Official Text was in force in 32 states. Unless otherwise \n     indicated, all references in this book are to the 1978 \n     Official Text of the Code. The Code is law in these \n     jurisdictions by virtue of ``local,'' state by state, \n     enactment. The United States Congress did not enact the Code \n     as general federal statutory law, although it did enact the \n     Code for the District of Columbia. The 1978 Code is divided \n     into eleven articles as follows:\n       Article 1. General Provisions.\n       Article 2. Sales.\n       Article 3. Commercial Paper.\n       Article 4. Bank Deposits and Collections.\n       Article 5. Letters of Credit.\n       Article 6. Bulk Transfers.\n       Article 7. Warehouse Receipts, Bills of Lading and Other \n     Documents of Title.\n       Article 8. Investment Securities.\n       Article 9. Secured Transactions; Sales of Accounts and \n     Chattel Paper.\n       Article 10. Effective Date and Repealer.\n       [[Page S5648]] Article 11. Effective Date and Transition \n     Provisions.\n\n     In all but Articles Ten and Eleven, the Articles are \n     subdivided into ``Parts.'' Thus, in Article One there are two \n     ``Parts'' while in Article Two there are seven. Each Part is \n     in turn subdivided into ``sections.'' Sections are numbered \n     in a manner that indicates both Article and Part. Thus, \n     section 2-206 on ``Offer and Acceptance in Formation of \n     Contract'' is in Article Two, Part Two. The first number of a \n     section always indicates the Article and the second number \n     the Part within that Article in which the section appears. \n     The Official Text of The Code includes ``Official Comments'' \n     on each section. The enacting jurisdictions did not enact \n     these comments, although they did enact both the section \n     headings and the sections (except insofar as they amended the \n     Official Text, a topic which will be considered below.) The \n     various jurisdictions, on enacting the Code, generally \n     followed the arrangement and sequence of the Official Text. \n     In almost all instances, they also preserved the Code's \n     numbering system. For example, in the great State of Oregon, \n     a seven appears before the first digit in the Code's \n     numbering system and a zero after the last digit. Otherwise, \n     the Code's numbering system is left intact. Thus, in Oregon, \n     1-101 is 71-1010.\n       The National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State \n     Laws was the originating sponsor of the Code. This was hardly \n     the first venture of the Conference into the field of \n     commercial law reform. The Conference had earlier sponsored a \n     number of ``uniform acts'' in\n      this field. Those acts that were adopted in one or more \n     jurisdictions are listed below, with dates of \n     promulgation.\n       Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law, 1896.\n       Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act, 1906.\n       Uniform Sales Act, 1906.\n       Uniform Bills of Lading Act, 1909.\n       Uniform Stock Transfer Act, 1909.\n       Uniform Conditional Sales Act, 1918.\n       Uniform Trust Receipts Act, 1933.\n       All states adopted the Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law \n     and the Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act. Roughly two-thirds of \n     the states adopted the Uniform Sales Act and the Uniform \n     Trust Receipts Act. The other acts were less well received.\n       By the late 1930's, the foregoing uniform acts had become \n     outdated. Changes had occurred in the patterns of commercial \n     activity prevalent when the acts were promulgated. Also, \n     wholly new patterns had emerged which gave rise to new kinds \n     of legal needs. Moreover, a major objective of the uniform \n     acts had been to promote uniformity. But not all states \n     enacted the acts, and the courts of the states rendered \n     countless nonuniform ``judicial amendments.'' By 1940, there \n     was growing interest in large scale commercial law reform. \n     The Conference was already at work revising the old Uniform \n     Sales Act and was giving consideration to a revision of the \n     Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law.\n       In 1940, Mr. William A. Schnader conceived the idea of a \n     comprehensive commercial code that would modernize and \n     displace the old uniform acts. That same year, with the \n     support and advice of Professor Karl N. Llewellyn, Mr. \n     Schnader, as President of the National Conference of \n     Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, persuaded the Conference \n     to adopt a proposal to prepare a comprehensive code. Shortly \n     thereafter, Schnader and others sought the co-sponsorship of \n     the American Law Institute. Initially, the Institute agreed \n     only to co-sponsor a revision of the old Uniform Sales Act, \n     but on December 1, 1944 the two organizations formally agreed \n     to co-sponsor a Uniform Commercial Code project, with \n     Professor Karl N. Llewellyn of the Columbia Law School as its \n     ``Chief Reporter'' and Soia Mentschikoff as Associate Chief \n     Reporter. The co-sponsors also set up a supervisory Editorial \n     Board of five members which was later enlarged. Professor \n     Llewellyn then chose various individuals to serve as \n     principal drafters of the main Code Articles:\n       Article 1. Karl N. Llewellyn.\n       Article 2. Karl N. Llewellyn.\n       Article 3. William L. Prosser.\n       Article 4. Fairfax Leary, Jr.\n       Article 5. Friedrich Kessler.\n       Article 6. Charles Bunn.\n       Article 7. Louis B. Schwartz.\n       Article 8. Soia Mentschikoff.\n       Article 9. Allison Dunham and Grant Gilmore.\n       Between 1944 and 1950, the foregoing team formulated (not \n     without extensive consultation) the first complete draft of \n     the Code. The co-sponsors then circulated this draft widely \n     for comment. After revision, the co-sponsors promulgated the \n     first Official Text of the Code in September 1951 and \n     published it as the ``1952 Official Text.'' In 1953, \n     Pennsylvania became the first state to enact the Code, \n     effective July 1, 1954. In February of 1953, the New York \n     State Legislature and Governor Thomas E. Dewey referred the \n     Code to the New York State Law Revision Commission (located \n     at the Cornell Law School) for study and recommendations. \n     Between 1953 and 1955, the Commission dropped all other work \n     to study the Code. In the end, the Commission concluded that \n     the Code idea was a good one but that New York should not \n     enact the Code without extensive revision. Meanwhile, the \n     Code's Editorial Board had been studying the Commission's \n     work (as well as proposals for revision from other sources) \n     and in 1956 the Board recommended many changes in the 1952 \n     Official Text. In 1957, the co-sponsors promulgated a 1957 \n     Official Text that embodied numerous changes, many of which \n     were based on the Commission's study. Another Official Text \n     was promulgated in 1958, and still another in 1962. The \n     latter two made relatively minor changes in the 1957 Official \n     Text.\n       Meanwhile, Massachusetts became the second state to enact \n     some version of the Code in September 1957. By 1960, \n     Kentucky, Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island had \n     followed suit. In 1961, eight more states joined the fold. In \n     1962, there were four more, including New York. In 1963, \n     there were eleven more enacting states,\n      in 1964 one, in 1965 thirteen, and in 1966 five more. By \n     1968, the Code was effective in forty-nine states, the \n     District of Columbia, and the Virgin Islands. Louisiana is \n     the only state not to have adopted the entire Code. In \n     1974, however, that state did enact Articles 1, 3, 4, 5, 7 \n     and 8 of the 1972 Official Text, with amendments.\n       In 1961, the Code sponsors set up a Permanent Editorial \n     Board for the Code which continues in operation to this day. \n     After its first written report on October 31, 1962, the Board \n     made three further reports. During the 1960's and early \n     1970's, the Board was concerned mainly with two tasks: (1) \n     promoting uniformity in state by state enactment and \n     interpretation of the Code and (2) evaluating and preparing \n     proposals for revision of the 1962 Official Text. For \n     example, the Board devoted great energy to revision of \n     Article Nine on personal property security. Eventually, the \n     American Law Institute and the National Conference of \n     Commissioners on Uniform State Laws approved a revised \n     Article Nine which West Publishing Co. published in 1972 as \n     part of a new 1972 Official Text of the entire Code \n     (incorporating all officially approved amendments thereto).\n       In the mid and late 1970's the Code sponsors and others \n     studied possible revisions of Article Eight on investment \n     securities. A committee called the 348 Committee of the \n     Permanent Editorial Board reviewed proposals and made \n     recommendations to the Board. Eventually, the Code sponsors \n     adopted a revised Article Eight and in 1978 promulgated a new \n     Official Text embodying these revisions. As of January 1, \n     1988, thirty-two states had adopted most of this Official \n     Text.\\22\\\n       No one has published an authentic ``inside'' story of the \n     evolution of the Code. Judged by its reception in the \n     enacting legislatures, the code is the most spectacular \n     success story in the history of American law. We know that \n     the design and text of the Code bears the inimitable imprint \n     of its chief draftsman, Karl N. Llewellyn, and that his \n     spouse, Soia Mentschikoff, had a major hand in the entire \n     project. We know, too, that many individuals whose names have \n     not appeared so prominently as draftsmen or as reporters had \n     great influence on aspects of the final product. One example \n     is Professor Rudolf B. Schlesinger of the Cornell Law School \n     who was not only responsible for the idea of a Permanent \n     Editorial Board,\\24\\ but also provided most of the ideas for \n     the radical revision of Article Five on letters of credit \n     that appeared in the 1957 Official Text. Another example is \n     the extensive work of the late Professor Robert Braucher of \n     the Harvard Law School (subsequently Mr. Justice Braucher of \n     the Massachusetts Judicial Court). His efforts began in the \n     1940's and continued until his death in 1981. We know, too, \n     that politically and in other ways, William A. Schnader of \n     the Philadelphia Bar was the Code's prime mover. It seems \n     safe to say that without his efforts, the Code would not have \n     come into being. Llewellyn and Schnader are now dead \n     (deceased 1962 and 1969 respectively), a fact that imposes a \n     real handicap on anyone who seeks to prepare an authentic \n     history of the Code project. A British scholar, Professor \n     William Twining, has catalogued Llewellyn's papers at the \n     University of Chicago Law School, and any future history of \n     the Code project must take account of these papers.\n\n\n           2. commercial law not covered; freedom of contract\n\n       The Uniform Commercial Code does not apply to the sale of \n     realty nor to security interests in realty (except fixtures), \n     yet these are undeniably commercial matters. The Code does \n     not apply to the formation, performance, and enforcement of \n     insurance contracts. It does not apply to suretyship \n     transactions (except where the surety is a party to a \n     negotiable instrument). It does not govern bankruptcy. It \n     does not define legal tender. It is not a comprehensive \n     codification of commercial law.\n       The Code does not even cover all aspects of transactions to \n     which its provision do apply. For example, it includes \n     several innovative provisions on the formation of sales \n     contracts, but it still leaves most issues of contract \n     formation to general contract law. To cite one more example, \n     the code includes provisions on the purchaser's title to \n     goods, but one of these provisions turns on the distinction \n     between void and voidable title, a distinction that requires \n     courts to invoke non-Code law. Section 1-103 is probably the \n     most important single provision in the Code, and will be \n     discussed in section five of this Introduction. The provision \n     reads:\n       ``Unless displaced by the particular provisions of this \n     Act, the principles of law and equity, including the law \n     merchant and the law relative to capacity to contract, \n     principal and agent, estoppel, fraud, misrepresentation, \n     duress, coercion, mistake, bankruptcy, or other validating or \n     invalidating cause shall supplement its provisions.''\n       As Professor Grant Gilmore once put it, the Code ``derives \n     from the common law \n     [[Page S5649]] [and] assumes the continuing existence of a \n     large body of\n      pre-Code and non-Code law on which it rests for support, \n     [without which the Code] could not survive.'' Much of the \n     pre-Code and non-Code law to which Professor Gilmore \n     refers is case law from such fields as contracts, agency, \n     and property, which comes into play via 1-103.\n       Of course, federal commercial law overrides the Code. The \n     Federal Bills of Lading Act is illustrative. So, too, is the \n     Carmack Amendment to the Interstate Commerce Act. Federal \n     regulatory law overrides the Code, too. Today there are \n     federal statutes such as the National Consumer Credit \n     Protection Act, and the Magnuson-Moss-Warranty-Federal Trade \n     Commission Improvement Act regulating aspects of consumer \n     warranty practices. Similarly, state regulatory statutes also \n     override the Code. Thus, there are state retail installment \n     sales acts, state usury laws, state laws on consumer credit, \n     and so on. The Code itself includes a few regulatory \n     provisions.\n       Finally, most of the Code's provisions are not mandatory. \n     The parties may vary their effect or displace them \n     altogether: freedom of contract is the rule rather than the \n     exception. Most commercial law is therefore not in the Code \n     at all but in private agreements, including course of \n     dealing, usage of trade, and course of performance.\n\n\n  3. variations in enactment and in interpretation; conflict of laws \n                                 rules\n\n       The Uniform Commercial Code is not uniform. As early as \n     1967, the various jurisdictions enacting the Code had made \n     approximately 775 separate amendments to it. Article Nine on \n     security interests in personal property was the chief victim \n     of the nonuniform amendments. As of December 15, 1966, 47 of \n     the 54 sections in the Article had been amended; California, \n     in particular, liberally rewrote or deleted segments of it. \n     The new Article Nine, embodied in the 1972 and 1978 Official \n     Texts, had become law in forty-six states (including \n     California) by January 1, 1987. Article Six on bulk transfers \n     was also the subject of many nonuniform amendments. New York \n     amended Article Five in a way that renders it inapplicable to \n     many letter of credit transactions, and yet New York does \n     more letter of credit business than any other state.\n       Another source of nonuniformity lies in the various \n     ``optional'' provisions in the Official Texts of the Code. \n     Thus, for example, Section 9-401 offers enacting states three \n     alternatives with respect to the place of filing of financial \n     statements. Section 7-403(1)(b) offers two versions of the \n     burden of proving the bailee's negligence. Section 6-106 \n     imposes a duty on the bulk transferee to see that the \n     transferor's creditors are paid off, but it is wholly \n     optional. Section 2-318 includes three options on third party \n     beneficiaries of warranties. And the Code includes still \n     other optional provisions. In almost every instance, some \n     states have adopted one version while other states have \n     adopted another.\n       So-called ``open-ended' drafting is another source of \n     nonuniformity. In Articles Two and Nine, the draftsmen used \n     such phrases as ``commercial reasonableness'' and ``good \n     faith.'' That different courts will give such phrases \n     different meanings should surprise no one. And, after any \n     uniform law has been on the books for very long, disparate \n     judicial interpretation and construction of even quite \n     detailed provisions become another source of nonuniformity. \n     Today, many Code sections have been the subject of judicial \n     interpretation and construction in more than one jurisdiction \n     and the courts disagree over the meaning of many sections.\n       The foregoing sources of nonuniformity signify that the \n     Code's conflict of laws rules are becoming especially \n     important. Section 1-105 sets forth the basic Code \n     provisions.\n       (1) Except as provided hereafter in this section, when a \n     transaction bears a reasonable relation to this state and \n     also to another state or nation the parties may agree that \n     the law either of this state or of such other state shall \n     govern their rights and duties. Failing such agreement this \n     Act applies to transactions bearing an appropriate relation \n     to this state.\n       (2) Where one of the following provisions of this Act \n     specifies the applicable law, that provision governs and a \n     contrary agreement is effective only to the extent permitted \n     by the law (including conflict of laws rules) so specified:\n       Rights of creditors against sold goods. Section 2-402.\n       Applicability of the Article on Bank Deposits and \n     Collections. Section 4-102.\n       Bulk transfers subject to the Article on Bulk Transfers. \n     Section 6-102.\n       Applicability of the Article on Investment Securities. \n     Section 8-106.\n       Perfection Provisions of the Article on Secured \n     Transactions. Section 9-103.\n       Various scholars of conflict of laws have offered their \n     thoughts on 1-105, and we have collected some of their \n     writings in the footnote. Later in this book we also address \n     ourselves to specify conflicts problems in the context in \n     which they arise.\n\n\n               4. aids to interpretation and construction\n\n       The principal aids to interpretation and construction of \n     the Code are these:\n       Case law.\n       Prior drafts and prior official texts.\n       Other legislative history--New York Law Revision Commission \n     Reports--State legislative hearings and committee reports.\n       Official Comments to each section.\n       Periodic Reports of the Permanent Editorial Board.\n       Treatises and other secondary sources.\n       Rules of interpretation and construction.\n       Standard interpretation technique.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I will read the very first line:\n\n       As of 1988, one of the three different Official Texts of \n     the Uniform Commercial Code was in force in each of the \n     American States except Louisiana. . . . The United States \n     Congress did not enact the code as general Federal statutory \n     law.\n\n  It is talking of the nature and origins. Then it goes on to point out \nthat what we have under the code is a selective process. It says here \nin the section two, titled ``Commercial Law Not Covered; Freedom of \nContract'':\n\n       Finally, most of the Code's provisions are not mandatory. . \n     . . Most commercial law is therefore not in the Code at all \n     but in private agreements, including course of dealing, usage \n     of trade, and course of performance.\n\n  The Uniform Commercial Code is not uniform. Now that is the \nmanufacturers.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a particular \nlaw review article on the conflict of laws under the Uniform Commercial \nCode at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From the Arkansas Law Review]\n\n                   Conflict of Laws Under the U.C.C.\n\n                         (By Robert A. Leflar)\n\n       When do conflict of laws problems arise under the Uniform \n     Commercial Code, now that it is law in all the states and \n     other subdivisions of the United States except Louisiana?\n       Conflicts do still occur. Obviously they can occur when \n     part of a commercial transaction takes place in Louisiana or \n     in a foreign nation whose law differs from the Code. But they \n     occur more frequently between the laws of states that have \n     adopted the Code. Why? Because (1) several states have \n     enacted variant amendments to some sections of the Code, and \n     (2) the courts of a number of states, careless of the \n     function of uniformity in a uniform act, have given \n     nonuniform interpretations to some sections of the Code. \n     Conflicts are not now as inevitable as in the 1950's and \n     early 1960's, when only a few states had enacted the Code, \n     but they can be even more frustrating than they were then. \n     The answers to the conflicts problems, however, are \n     reasonably definite.\n       The history of choice-of-law provisions in the Code is, in \n     a very real sense, a pre-outline of the more recent history \n     of American conflicts law generally. It is a history of \n     increased emphasis upon substance over form and of deliberate \n     preference for an approach that would result in application \n     of better, sounder rules of commercial law as distinguished \n     from mechanical choice-of-law rules applied for their own \n     sake. The approach is primarily designed by commercial law \n     specialists whose concern was with what they conceived to be \n     good commercial law, rather than by conflicts scholars. Most \n     conflicts scholars, however, ultimately agreed with the \n     approach.\n       Joe C. Barrett of Arkansas was one of the practical lawyer-\n     Commissioners whose interests lay in the substantive law \n     areas, not in choice-of-law theory. His voice was an \n     influential one almost from the beginning of work on the \n     Code, and he agreed with the pragmatic approach to conflicts \n     issues. Though he left it to others, for the most part, to \n     frame the conflicts language, he supported their ideas, \n     particularly as the sections were reviewed by the Permanent \n     Editorial Board of which he was a longtime member. He had \n     much to do with the thinking and rethinking that is reflected \n     in the successive drafts as they are presented in the next \n     few pages. Above all, he was satisfied by section I-105 as it \n     finally emerged, first in the 1958 Official Text, then with \n     one further change in 1972. The section as it now stands is \n     as follows:\n Section 1-105. Territorial Application of the Act; Parties' Power to \n                         Choose Applicable Law\n\n       (1) Except as provided hereafter in this section, when a \n     transaction bears a reasonable relation to this state and \n     also to another state or nation the parties may agree that \n     the law either of this state or of such other state or nation \n     shall govern their rights and duties. Failing such agreement \n     this Act applies to transactions bearing an appropriate \n     relation to this state.\n       (2) Where one of the following provisions of the Act \n     specifies the applicable law, that provision governs and a \n     contrary agreement is effective only to the extent permitted \n     by the law (including the conflict of laws rules) so \n     specified:\n       Rights of creditors against sold goods. Section 2-402.\n       Applicability of the Article on Bank Deposits and \n     Collections. Section 4-102.\n       Bulk transfers subject to the Article on Bulk Transfers. \n     Section 6-102.\n       [[Page S5650]] Applicability of the Article Investment \n     Securities. Section       * * *.\n       Perfection provisions of the Article on Secured \n     Transactions. Section 9-103.\n\n                           The first 25 years\n\n       From the beginning the effort was to make the new Code \n     applicable to as many transactions as could constitutionally \n     be brought under it. The due process clause of the federal \n     Constitution, and possibly the full faith and credit clause, \n     set the outer limits. The leading case was (and is) Home \n     Insurance Co. v. Dick, which held that due process was \n     violated by a state's holding a transaction to be governed by \n     the substantive law of a state which had no substantial \n     connection with the transaction.\n       The October, 1949 draft of section 1-105 attempted to \n     achieve the desired maximum application of the new Code by \n     providing that this Act shall apply to any contract or \n     transaction within its terms if:\n       (a) the contract is completed, or the offer made or \n     accepted, or the transaction occurs within this state; or\n       (b) the contract is to be performed or the transaction is \n     to be completed within this state; or\n       (c) the contract or transaction relates to or involves \n     goods which are to be or are in fact located, delivered, \n     shipped or received within this state; or\n       (d) the contract or transaction involves a bill of lading, \n     warehouse receipt or other document of title which is to be \n     or is in fact issued, delivered, sent or received within this \n     state; or\n       (e) the contract or transaction involves commercial paper \n     which is made, drawn, transferred or payable within this \n     state; or\n       (f) the contract or transaction involves a commercial \n     credit made, sent or received within this state; or involves \n     a commercial credit issued in this state or confirmation or \n     advice of which is sent or received within this state, or \n     involves any negotiation within this state of a draft drawn \n     under a credit; or\n       (g) the contract or transaction involves a foreign \n     remittance drawn, transferred or payable within this state; \n     or\n       (h) the contract or transaction involves an investment \n     security issued or transferred within this state; or\n       (i) the contract or transaction involves a security \n     interest created within this state or relating to tangible \n     personal property which is or is to be actually within this \n     state or to intangible personal property which has or is to \n     have its situs within this state; or involves a bulk transfer \n     of property to the extent that such property is within this \n     state; or if the borrower's principal place of business is \n     within this state; or\n       (j) whenever the contract, instrument or document states in \n     terms or in substance that it is subject to the Uniform \n     Commercial Code.\n       (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of the foregoing \n     subsection, the parties to a contract or transaction \n     involving foreign trade may agree in writing that the law of \n     a specified jurisdiction shall apply.\n       The objective had been to list all the factual connections \n     that were substantial enough to permit forum law (the Code) \n     to be constitutionally applicable.\n       At the same time an alternative section 1-105 was drafted, \n     for inclusion in a proposed enactment of the Code by the \n     federal Congress, on the supposed authority of the commerce \n     clause. This draft generally tracked the language of the \n     state section.\n       The reaction to this section came near to being violent. A \n     part of the reaction was automatic resistance to change: ``If \n     it's different from what I learned in law school it must be \n     wrong.'' A number of conflicts scholars joined in unanimous \n     adoption of a resolution introduced by the respected \n     Professor Elliott E. Cheatham of Columbia University Law \n     School:\n       ``Resolved, that the undersigned, participants in the 1949 \n     Institute of International and Comparative Law, Ann Arbor, \n     Michigan, are of the opinion that Section 1-105 (in both \n     forms) of the May, 1949, draft of the Uniform Commercial \n     Code, dealing with conflict of laws, is unwise and should be \n     omitted from the Code; and the Executive Secretary of the \n     Institute of International and Comparative Law is requested \n     to transmit a copy of this resolution to the President of the \n     American Law Institute and the Chairman of the Commissioners \n     on Uniform Laws.''\n       This reaction induced the Institute and the Commissioners \n     to revise the section by lengthening it considerably, \n     deleting the alternative proposed for federal enactment, but \n     retaining the same objective that the Act, as a state \n     statute, apply to as many transactions as the Constitution \n     would permit. The 1952 draft of the section, instead of \n     providing that ``this Act'' shall apply to all the enumerated \n     situations, called for application of particular parts \n     (articles) of the Act to the fact situations:\n\n\n   section 1-105. applicability of the act; parties' right to choose \n                            applicable law.\n\n       (1) Article 1 applies to any contract or transaction to \n     which any other Article of this Act applies.\n       (2) The Articles on Sales (Article 2), Documentary Letters \n     of Credit (Article 5) and Documents of Title (Article 7) \n     apply whenever any contract or transaction within the terms \n     of any one of the Articles is made or occurs after the \n     effective date of this Act and the contract\n       (a) is made, offered or accepted or the transaction occurs \n     within this state; or\n       (b) is to be performed or completed wholly or in part \n     within this state; or\n       (c) relates to or involves goods which are to be or are in \n     fact delivered, shipped or received within this state; or\n       (d) involves a bill of lading, warehouse receipt or other \n     document of title which is to be or in fact issued, \n     delivered, sent or received within this state; or\n       (e) is an application or agreement for a credit made, sent \n     or received within this state, or involves a credit issued in \n     this state or under which drafts are to be presented in this \n     state or confirmation or advice of which is sent or received \n     within this state, or involves any negotiation within this \n     state of a draft drawn under a credit.\n       (3) The Articles on Commercial Paper (Article 3) and Bank \n     Deposits and Collections (Article 4) apply whenever any \n     contract or transaction within the terms of either of the \n     Articles is made or occurs after the effective date of this \n     Act and the contract\n       (a) is made, offered or accepted or the transaction occurs \n     within this state; or\n       (b) is to be performed or completed wholly or in part \n     within this state; or\n       (c) involves commercial paper which is made, drawn or \n     transferred within the state.\n       (4) The Article on Investment Securities (Article 8) \n     applies whenever any contract or transaction within its terms \n     is made or occurs after the effective date of this Act and \n     the contract\n       (a) is made, offered or accepted or occurs within this \n     state; or\n       (b) is to be performed or completed wholly or in part \n     within this state; or\n       (c) involves an investment security issued or transferred \n     within this state.\n       But the validity of a corporate security shall be governed \n     by the law of the jurisdiction of incorporation.\n       (5) The Articles on Bulk Transfers (Article 6) and Secured \n     Transactions (Article 9) apply whenever any contract or \n     transaction within their terms is made or occurs after the \n     effective date of this Act and falls within the provisions of \n     section 6-102 or sections 9-102 and 9-103.\n       (6) Whenever a contract, instrument, document, security or \n     transaction bears a reasonable relationship to one or more \n     states or nations in addition to this state the parties may \n     agree that the law of any such other state or nation shall \n     govern their rights and duties. In the absence of an \n     agreement which meets the requirements of this subsection, \n     this Act governs.\n       This, too, produced negative reactions. These were largely \n     based on the assumption, actually not justified, that section \n     1-105 followed the mechanical choice-of-laws theories of \n     Professor Joseph H. Beale of Harvard, as those theories were \n     embodied in the American Law Institute's Restatement I of \n     Conflicts of Laws, for which Professor Beale was the \n     Reporter. Two facts tended to support the assumption. One was \n     the designation of specific fact situations as being \n     determinative of the stated choices of law. That was the way \n     Beale had set forth his hard and fast jurisdiction-selecting \n     rules, and the critics tended to overlook the fact that the \n     Code's choices would be different from Beale's. The other was \n     that Judge Herbert F. Goodrich, Director of the American Law \n     Institute and Chairman of the Code's Editorial Board, was a \n     former student and long-time disciple of Beale and was at \n     least to some extent responsible for the successive drafts of \n     section 1-105. On this point, the tendency was to overlook \n     the fact that Judge Goodrich, in his\n      support of these early drafts of section 1-105, had moved \n     far away from Beale's still earlier rules. These reactions \n     were, nevertheless, part of the reason for the slow \n     acceptance of the Code by state legislatures in the next \n     few years. Reconsideration of the language was called for, \n     but there was no serious thought of abandoning the \n     objective of having the Code apply to all the fact \n     situations to which the due process clause would permit \n     its application. It was sincerely believed to be a better \n     body of commercial law than any other anywhere, and the \n     best basis for choice of law was deliberate application of \n     this ``better law.''\n       Simplification was the principal result of the \n     reconsideration. The 1958 official draft of the Code, \n     substantially completed in 1957, put section 1-105 in very \n     nearly its present form. It became apparent that, apart from \n     permitting parties to agree on what law should govern their \n     transactions, the effect of the detailed listing in the 1952 \n     Code of the fact situations to which the various portions of \n     the Code were to apply was nearly the same as a simple \n     statement that all the transactions listed were to be \n     governed by the relevant parts of the Code. The listed fact \n     situations, it was believed, all bore a constitutionally \n     ``appropriate relation'' to the forum state in which the Code \n     was the law. But if any of them did not, the new phrasing, \n     ``this Act applies to transactions bearing an appropriate \n     relation to this state,'' evaded possible \n     unconstitutionality. At the same time it avoided hard-and-\n     fast rules of the Bealian kind and left the choice-of-law \n     limits open-ended so that they would fit in with whatever new \n     developments the future might bring to that small branch of \n     constitutional law.\n       The next conflicts change came in 1972. It was not a \n     modification of section 1-105 as such, but rather a deletion \n     of all choice-of-law provisions from section 9-102 and a \n     revision of the choice-of-law provisions in section 9-103, \n     both dealing with secured transactions. This increased \n     somewhat the scope \n     [[Page S5651]] of the first paragraph of section 1-105, but \n     left as before the separate applicability of choice-of-law \n     rules laid down for the five separate areas identified in the \n     second paragraph of section 1-105, including the revised \n     section 9-103. Section 8-106, on the law governing certain \n     investment securities transactions, was revised in 1977, and \n     another minor change was at the same time made in section 9-\n     103, correlating it with the revised section 8-106. That is \n     where the Code's conflicts sections stand today. There are \n     still a number of doubts and unresolved questions not only \n     under section 1-105 but under the other listed sections as \n     well.\n\n                  Party autonomy--reasonable relation\n\n       With specified exceptions, ``when a transaction bears a \n     reasonable relation to this state and also to another state \n     or nation the parties may agree that the law either of this \n     state or of such other state or nation shall govern their \n     rights and duties.'' What constitutes a ``reasonable \n     relation''? How far afield may the parties go in deciding for \n     themselves what law is to govern their transactions?\n       The theory of party autonomy in choice of law has not \n     always been accepted by American jurists, though it has for a \n     century been a factor affecting choice of governing law in \n     contracts cases. Acceptance of the parties' stated intention, \n     or even their implied intention, as to what law should govern \n     their contract is a part of the common law of conflict of \n     laws today. To that extent the Code merely follows the common \n     law. The unanswered question is only as to where the outer \n     limit lies. The term ``reasonable relation'' sets an outer \n     limit, and suggests that common sense defines it, but still \n     does not locate it, geographically or otherwise.\n       The Official Comment on section 1-105 is not very \n     conclusive. The Comment's principal reliance is on Seeman v. \n     Philadelphia Warehouse Co., a case in which, actually, no \n     choice-of-law clause was involved. The holding was that a \n     contract calling for a rate of interest usurious by New York \n     law but valid by Pennsylvania law should be governed by \n     Pennsylvania's law, and the contract sustained. There were \n     substantial elements of both making and performance in each \n     state. The court did rely upon an inference that parties \n     contracting in good faith would have intended their contract \n     to be governed by the law of the one of the only two related \n     states that would validate it. This was not so much party \n     autonomy in choice of law as it was a preference for the law \n     that would validate a contract made in good faith--a ``basic \n     rule of validation'' approach.\n       The Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws is somewhat \n     more in point. It specifies an outer geographic limit on the \n     contracting parties' freedom to name the governing law by \n     providing that their choice will not control if ``the chosen \n     state has no substantial relationship to the parties or the \n     transaction and there is no other reasonable basis for the \n     parties' choice.'' This of course is only a negative, not an \n     affirmative, statement as to how far afield the choice may \n     go. Yet the implication that the parties are free to choose \n     the law of a state unrelated to the transaction or to \n     themselves is significant. The significance is increased by \n     the implication that a ``reasonable basis'' for such an \n     extraneous choice may exist. And the Official Comment on \n     section 1-105 does say:\n       ``an agreement as to choice of law may sometimes take \n     effect as a shorthand expression of the intent of the parties \n     as to matters governed by their agreement, even though the \n     transaction has no significant contact with the jurisdiction \n     chosen.''\n       The argument that follows is that agreements by contracting \n     parties as to what law shall govern their transaction are not \n     essentially different from other parts of their contract upon \n     which they are completely free to agree. The only limitation \n     should be that they cannot lawfully do something that would \n     be violative of the strong public policy of a concerned \n     state. Reasonableness should have to do with good reasons for \n     wishing a particular system of law to govern their \n     transaction, not necessarily limited to states having \n     physical contacts with them or it. That is the view taken by \n     most academic interpreters of the Section.\n       A set of facts suggested by the most recent commentator \n     illustrates the argument. Suppose a contract completed in \n     Florida for sale of goods to be delivered to a Canadian buyer \n     in Montreal by a seller incorporated in Delaware but \n     operating factories in Arkansas, Louisiana and Wisconsin. The \n     contract stipulates that New York law shall govern its \n     validity, construction and enforcement. ``The stipulation \n     could be upheld based upon the parties' familiarity with New \n     York law, its fuller development in dealing with issues of \n     the type presented by the particular contract or perhaps the \n     parties' preference for a particular substantive doctrine \n     established under New York law. Unless the selection offends \n     a fundamental public policy of the forum state or constitutes \n     a wilful evasion that smacks of bad faith or overreaching, \n     the court would have no cause to interfere with the choice of \n     the parties.'' The same author, however, cites two cases both \n     holding that similar contract stipulations were ineffectual \n     because New York had no physical connection with the \n     transaction sued on. Despite such cases, it is not unlikely \n     that the ``reasonable relation'' required by section 1-105 \n     will some day, in some courts, be held to be satisfied simply \n     by the parties' deliberate designation of a relevant law that \n     in their opinion best serves the purposes of their voluntary \n     transaction.\n       It must not be thought that every choice-of-law clause in \n     every commercial contract that any parties execute is \n     deserving of enforcement. Such clauses can be hidden in the \n     fine print of take-it-or-leave-it form contracts which casual \n     customers have little or no opportunity to study. Adhesion \n     contracts are always suspect. Something turns upon the \n     meaning of the Code word ``agree.'' The take-it-or-leave-it \n     party may not have ``agreed'' to a strange and unread choice-\n     of-law clause in the fine print that was never called to his \n     attention. At least there can be as much justification for \n     avoiding these clauses as there is for avoiding any other \n     harsh and unanticipated provision in any kind of adhesion \n     contract. Other Code provisions also afford means for \n     avoidance of unfair choice-of-law clauses. Section 1-103 \n     preserves defenses based on ``estoppel, fraud, \n     misrepresentation, duress, coercion, mistake, * * *''; \n     section 1-203 ``imposes an obligation of good faith'' in all \n     contracts; and section 2-302 permits refusal of enforcement \n     as to any unconscionable clause in a sales contract. The \n     enforceability of choice-of-law clauses is no more required \n     than for any other sort of contract clause.\n       It must be admitted, also, that choice-of-law contract \n     clauses have been avoided by simply neglecting to notice \n     section 1-105 as a controlling statute.\n       One of the worries that was discussed when the party-\n     autonomy part of section 105 was first drafted was whether \n     third persons, not parties to the contract but affected by it \n     might be prejudiced by the parties' selection of a state law \n     unfavorable to the third persons' interests. Such third \n     persons may include creditors of a seller who retained \n     possession of the sold goods, other creditors of either party \n     or nonbuyers in whose favor a warranty might or might not \n     run.\n       The drafters' quick answer to this worry is in the wording \n     of section 1-105 itself. It says that the parties may agree \n     on what law is to ``govern their rights and duties.'' This \n     does not refer to the rights and duties of third persons. \n     That may not be conclusive in all situations. More in point \n     is subparagraph (2) of the section, which in its five \n     specific exceptions identifies the situations in which the \n     interests of third persons are most likely to be involved, \n     and takes them out of the party-autonomy category. There may \n     be other situations, but at least the problem is minimized.\n\n            ``This act applies . . . appropriate relation''\n\n       ``Except as provided hereafter in this section . . . [and] \n     failing such agreement this Act applies to transactions \n     bearing an appropriate relation to this state.'' One purpose \n     behind section 1-105 from its beginning was that the Code \n     (``this Act''), believed to be the most nearly perfect system \n     of commercial law yet devised by man, should be as widely \n     applicable as possible. Within the United States, the only \n     limitations upon territorial applicability of an otherwise \n     valid state statute (which was what was contemplated for the \n     Code), are to be found in the Federal Constitution. What are \n     they?\n       The due process clause in the fourteenth amendment is the \n     traditional one, and probably still the principal one. Home \n     Insurance Co. v. Dick is the leading case. In it, the United \n     States Supreme Court held that for Texas to apply Texas law \n     to invalidate a time-for-suit clause in a Mexican insurance \n     contract, valid by Mexican law, was a violation of due \n     process. The constitutional requirement, broadly stated, is \n     that no state's substantive law may be applied to govern a \n     transaction unless the transaction had some fairly \n     substantial connection with that state. In Dick, the only \n     Texas connection was that the plaintiff, assignee of claims \n     under the Mexican contract, was a Texas domiciliary. That was \n     not enough. There are many contacts that will suffice, but \n     they must be significant ones.\n       The 1949 and 1952 drafts of section 1-105 listed a \n     considerable number of specific contacts which the drafters \n     believed, or at least hoped, would be accepted by the Supreme \n     Court as sufficiently substantial to permit application of \n     ``this Act'' or the designated one of the Act's articles. One \n     of the frequently-voiced objections to these early drafts was \n     that several of the listed contacts were so casual, so \n     insignificant as elements in the total transaction, that they \n     would not satisfy the constitutional standard. Some of them \n     probably would not have. That was one reason why the \n     specificity of the early drafts was abandoned in the present \n     (1958) revision. Yet the basic thought that the Code was a \n     superior body of commercial law that ought to be widely \n     applied was not abandoned. Making it applicable whenever the \n     facts bore an ``appropriate relation'' to the forum state \n     having the Act preserved the potential for maximum \n     applicability, without risking specific unconstitutional \n     possibilities.\n       Another concern also was involved. This one arose partly \n     from the fact that probable wide adoption of the Code, plus \n     variant interpretations of it and local amendments to it, \n     made it less urgent that ``this Act'' as it was operative in \n     any given state be there applied to essentially extrastate \n     transactions. Assurance that the Code as amended and \n     interpreted in any given state was clearly the ``better law'' \n     could not be maintained. Forum shopping by plaintiffs not \n     interested in ``better law'' but only in law most favorable \n     to their private interests would be encouraged by a choice-\n     of-law rule always requiring application of the forum's \n     version of the Code. The original purpose of the earlier \n     [[Page S5652]] section 1-105, to compel application of ``this \n     Act,'' in every state that adopted the Code, to every \n     commercial lawsuit filed in the state, was no longer the \n     worthy purpose that it had at first appeared to be.\n       Also important was the modernization of American choice-of-\n     law law was occurring at about the same time, breaking away \n     from the old hard-and-fast mechanical rules that had been \n     accepted during most of the century. The infusion of Brainerd \n     Currie's concepts of ``governmental interest,'' of \n     Ehrenzweig's idea of a ``basic rule of validation, of Cavers' \n     ``principles of preference,'' and of the fundamental \n     ``choice-influencing considerations'' into the mainstream of \n     conflicts law has made that body of law far more reasonable \n     than it used to be, and far more acceptable as an intelligent \n     basis for choosing between competing laws.\n       Choice-of-law problems in commercial litigation do not \n     arise as often today as they did before the Code or in the \n     Code's early days. Many of them are resolved beforehand by \n     agreement of the parties. Others are covered by the specific \n     rules set out in the second paragraph of section 1-105. For \n     the rest, the governing words ``appropriate relation'' can \n     well be taken to refer to what appears to be appropriate \n     under sensible modern choice-of-law principles. There is good \n     reason to believe that this is the approach which the \n     majority of courts are taking to the problem.\n       There may be infrequent cases not covered by either of the \n     two sentences in the first paragraph in section 1-105, nor by \n     any of the five possibilities specified in the second \n     paragraph. These will involve transactions in which the \n     parties have not agreed to as to what state's law shall \n     govern and in which the transaction does not bear ``an \n     appropriate relation to this [the forum] state.'' The \n     situation will arise when the plaintiff has for reasons of \n     his own filed his lawsuit in what has been called a \n     ``disinterested third state.'' It might be resolved by a \n     forum non conveniens dismissal. But if jurisdiction is \n     retained, since the Code simply prescribes no choice-of-law \n     rule for the case, the court must of necessity fall back on \n     its preexistent statutory or common law of conflicts law, \n     whatever that may be.\n                      Paragraph (2) of the section\n\n       The second paragraph of the 1958 draft of section I-105 \n     named five areas, identified by numbered Code sections, that \n     were not to be governed by the rather loose provisions of the \n     first paragraph. These areas, for the sake of maximum \n     predictability of results in the transactions covered by \n     them, were to be subject to hard-and-fast choice-of-law \n     rules, explicitly laid down. The governing law was to be that \n     of a designated place, so that the parties could know \n     beforehand, by knowing that law, what the legal consequences \n     of their transaction would be.\n       Maximum assurance of this predictability was provided by \n     requiring, for each of the five areas, that the whole \n     relevant law ``including the conflict of laws rules'' of the \n     designated place be applied. Reliance upon this renvoi \n     technique was designed to make certain that the forum court \n     trying the case would handle the issue in exactly the same \n     way that a court at the designated place would handle it, by \n     applying the same choice-of-law rules that court would apply \n     and thus reaching exactly the same decision that would be \n     reached by a court at that place. Accidents might interfere \n     with this absolute predictability, but that came as close to \n     it as could be planned.\n       The section as thus drafted in 1958 remains unchanged \n     except for the scope of the last (fifth) area. That was \n     modified in 1972, and the modification has now been accepted \n     in a majority of the states. Each of the five excepted areas \n     will now be noted.\n       Section 2-402. This section in part of the Article on sales \n     of goods. It deals with the rights that a creditor of the \n     seller may have against the sold goods by reason of the \n     seller's misleading retention of possession or other \n     allegedly fraudulent conduct with reference to the goods. The \n     Code itself provides that certain types of conduct are either \n     fraudulent or not fraudulent. Apart from those provisions, \n     section 2-402 prescribes a specific choice-of-law rule, that \n     the law governing the creditor's rights, if any, in the sold \n     goods (as against both buyer and seller) is that of the state \n     where the goods are situated. This is the sort of case in \n     which one related state's law is likely to be as good as \n     another's, and about as relevant. The goods' situs is an \n     ascertainable extrinsic fact on the basis of which a firm \n     determination of governing law and resultant rights can most \n     readily be made not only by a court but by the parties \n     themselves.\n       Section 4-102. Article 4 of the Code deals with bank \n     deposits and collections. Section 4-102 provides:\n       ``The liability of a bank for action or non-action with \n     respect to any item handled by it for purposes of \n     presentment, payment or collection is governed by the law of \n     the place where the bank is located. In the case of action or \n     non-action by or at a branch or separate office of a bank, \n     its liability is governed by the law of the place where the \n     branch or separate office is located.''\n       Here again the purpose was to lay down a clear and simple \n     choice-of-law rule that would prescribe the law of an obvious \n     and readily ascertainable place to govern the literally \n     millions of elementary transactions that occur on every \n     banking day in the United States. The Official Comment makes \n     it clear that the rule is to ``apply from the inception of \n     the collection process of an item through all phases of \n     deposit, forwarding, presentment, payment and remittance, or \n     credit of proceeds.'' Unity of governing law is part of the \n     objective. At the same time, however, section 4-103 permits \n     the parties, ``by agreement,'' to vary the choice-of-law rule \n     laid down by section 4-102. Thus the party autonomy which is \n     a central feature of section I-105 is available for this area \n     also.\n       Section 6-102. The law governing bulk transfers of tangible \n     goods is covered by Article 6 of the Code. The paragraph \n     numbered (4) of section 6-102 provides:\n       ``Except as limited by the following section all bulk \n     transfers of goods located within this State are subject to \n     this article.''\n       The following section (6-103) does not deal with choice of \n     law, but rather lists eight kinds of transfers that are not \n     governed by Article 6 at all, therefore not by section 6-102.\n       Again, situs of the affected goods is made the controlling \n     choice-of-law fact. There has been criticism of sections 6-\n     102 and 6-103 of the Code, but the criticism has apparently \n     not been directed at the choice of law provision in paragraph \n     (4) of section 6-102.\n       Section 8-106. Investment securities (stocks, bonds, and \n     the like) constitute the subject matter of Article 8. Section \n     8-106 does not lay down conflicts rules for all matters \n     covered by the article, but only for a specified part of it. \n     The first paragraph of section 1-105 governs as to the rest. \n     The 1972 version of section 8-106 was as follows:\n       ``The validity of a security and the rights and duties of \n     the issuer with respect to registration of transfer are \n     governed by the law (including the conflict of laws rules) of \n     the jurisdiction of organization of the issuer.''\n       That version is still the law in most states. In 1977, \n     however, the section was changed to read:\n       ``The law (including the conflict of laws rules) of the \n     jurisdiction of organization of the issuer governs the \n     validity of a security, the effectiveness of registration by \n     the issuer, and the rights and duties of the issuer with \n     respect to:\n       ``(a) registration of transfer of a certificated security;\n       ``(b) registration of transfer, pledge, or release of an \n     uncertificated security; and\n       ``(c) sending of statements of uncertificated securities.''\n       It is interesting that both versions of the section repeal, \n     presumably for the sake of emphasis, the renvoi provision \n     which is in any event applicable to it, as well as to all the \n     others of the five specified exceptions listed in the second \n     paragraph of section 1-105.\n       The modification of the section does not change the rule as \n     to what law governs the validity of a security as issued, nor \n     as to the transfer of certificated securities. What it does \n     is clarify the aspects and effects of registration, \n     particularly of uncertificated securities, that are to be \n     governed by the designated law. As under the earlier version, \n     the first paragraph of section 1-105 relates the rest. \n     Application of the law of the issuer's ``jurisdiction of \n     organization'' to registrations and closely related matters \n     present no real difficulties and is in keeping with normal \n     expectancies.\n       Section 9-103. Secured transactions, the subject covered by \n     Article 9 of the Code, includes some of the most difficult \n     areas of commercial law, and the choice-of-law sections of \n     the article have been among its most controversial. In the \n     1958-1962 version of the Code, section 9-102 applied most of \n     the article's provisions to ``any personal property and \n     fixtures within the jurisdiction of this state.'' The 1972 \n     revision deleted this choice-of-law clause completely. The \n     1958-1962 version, in section 9-103, dealt with choice-of-law \n     issues as to validity, perfection and the effects of default \n     in security transactions. The 1972 revision eliminated the \n     conflicts parts dealing with validity and defaults, leaving \n     only as hard-and-fast choice-of-law rules those parts dealing \n     with perfection and the consequences of non-perfection of \n     security interests. These obviously are substantial legal \n     areas. But the deleted areas, from both sections, were also \n     substantial. The choice-of-law rules applicable to them are \n     now\n      those set out in the first paragraph of section 1-105.\n       There are many ways in which movable goods can be pledged \n     as security for discharge of obligations owed to creditors or \n     other obligees, and many ways in which third persons may \n     acquire conflicting claims. Removal of the goods from one \n     state to another may be contemplated or not contemplated by \n     the secured party (obligee), and removal may occur even \n     though it was not contemplated. Removal increases the risk \n     that third persons may, possibly in good faith, acquire \n     conflicting claims to the goods. Official recordation of the \n     security transaction (``perfection'' of the security \n     interest) is the accepted method for validating the security \n     holder's interest as against most of such conflicting third-\n     person claims. But recordation where?\n       That is the principal question which section 9-103 \n     undertakes to answer, along with companion questions as to \n     the effects of non-perfection. Potential fact situations and \n     the variant rules prescribed for them by section 9-103 are \n     too elaborate for detailed explanation in this short article. \n     They are much clearer, however, under the 1972 revision than \n     they were before, also more fair and more efficient. They are \n     sufficiently specific that not a great deal of litigation on \n     choice-of-law questions has developed in states, now \n     [[Page S5653]] a substantial majority, that have enacted the \n     1972 revision, and commentators on the section have envinced \n     general agreement as to its scope and applicability. By 9-\n     103(1)(b) perfection of security interests is governed by the \n     law of the state where the chattel was located at the time of \n     the transaction, except that under 9-103(1)(c) if at the time \n     a purchase money security interest is created the parties \n     contemplate removal of the chattel to another state then the \n     law of the other state governs, subject to a 30-day \n     recordation requirement. A certificate of title thus issued \n     will in most situations protect the holder of security \n     interests noted on it for four months after the chattel is \n     removed to a different state, after which time an innocent \n     purchaser, under 9-103(2)(b), will take free of a locally \n     unrecorded security interest.\n       There are still problems, especially with reference to \n     inherently movable chattels such as motor vehicles. Most of \n     the states have motor vehicle title certificate laws, under \n     which motor vehicle titles are integrated in properly issued \n     certificates, but not in improperly issued ones. In the ten \n     states which have enacted the Uniform Motor Vehicle \n     Certificate of Title and Anti-Theft Act, there is \n     coordination with the corresponding provisions of the Code, \n     but in some other states there may not be. Perfection of \n     security interests in chattels the title to which is supposed \n     to be integrated in a title certificate is referred by the \n     Code to the relevant title certificate law. Under the Code, \n     however, if a title certificate though improperly issued in a \n     second state (fraudulently procured, as after a theft or by \n     an absconding buyer after a conditional sale) is fair on its \n     face, a buyer of the chattel who purchases it in good faith \n     and for value in reliance on the bad certificate, and ``who \n     is not in the business of selling goods of that kind,'' gets \n     good title even against the owner of a prior properly \n     ``protected'' security interest. A used car dealer who relies \n     on such a bad certificate, on the other hand, would not \n     prevail over the prior security interest.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I will read this little example to show \nexactly what we are getting at:\n  Suppose a contract is completed in Florida for the sale of goods to \nbe delivered to a Canadian buyer in Montreal by a seller incorporated \nin Delaware, but operating factories in Arkansas, Louisiana, and \nWisconsin; the contract stipulates that New York law shall govern its \nvalidity, construction, and enforcement.\n  Now, there we are. Talking about foreign shopping, New York lawyers \nsitting up there on the top floor of the World Trade Center Building, \nhaving their martinis at lunch, they say, ``We do not care what State \nthis is in, we have the Universal Commercial Code and for us we will \nselect where we are, where it is convenient for us to try cases, or any \nother forum that is available to us.'' But not the injured party.\n  They claim all they want is uniformity, but have the unmitigated gall \nto include an exclusion for manufacturers--for manufacturers. They \nboldface put it in there as an exemption for manufacturers for this \nparticular law that they say is such a national necessity.\n  I have seen a lot of activity in my service here as the junior \nSenator over the years, but I have never seen a provision where they \ncome in, absolutely representing the manufacturers and saying they are \ntrying to get money to the injured parties. They really say that. I \nwill go back to the Congressional Record and show it.\n  Where all the representative organizations of injured parties, \nwhether it is the lawyers themselves or otherwise the consumer groups \nof Americans say ``No, no, no, do not give us this,'' yet they put in \nall the favorable provisions for the manufacturers. With respect to the \njoint and several, we know there are some 10 States that do not include \njoint and several but rather, several only for the proof of \ncompensatory damages.\n  Do we think they make that uniform? Just as they do not extend \npunitive damages to those States that do not have it, they do not \nextend the joint and several provision to those States that only have \nseveral.\n  If it was the intent to get uniformity, we would have it there, but \nthey do not provide it there.\n  So, we can go right on down the list in all regards to this \nparticular bill with respect to uniformity on the one hand, or how far \nthey have come over the past several years and made it more reasonable, \nwhen the truth of the matter is they have included a lot of things here \nin this particular measure that were included in the House bill, so \nthat when it passes the Senate, of course, it will not be \nconferenceable at all. It will not be subject to the conference because \nit will be a provision not in dispute but contained in both measures.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 597 to Amendment No. 596\n\n (Purpose: To provide for equity in legal fees, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM.

Mr. President, my esteemed colleague from Kentucky and I \nare proposing here an amendment which would establish a consumer of \nlegal services' right to know how much he or she is paying and for what \nservices. This is a right we recognize in most other markets for goods \nand services, and one which is no doubt recognized and respected by \nmost reputable attorneys.\n  Nonetheless, Mr. President, there are too many cases in this country \nin which tort victims and other consumers of legal services have real \ndifficulty determining whether they are getting a fair shake from their \nattorney.\n  As a result, victims receive less of their rewards than they should, \nthe legal system costs everyone too much, and ever-higher fees are \nencouraged by a lack of competition.\n  Mr. President, this amendment will give consumers of legal services \nthe means with which to make informed decisions concerning their legal \nrepresentation. By establishing a consumer's right to know in the legal \nservices market it will encourage competition and fair dealing. It will \nhelp make our system more fair to litigants and reduce the total cost \nof our legal system.\n  The unfairness of our current system is shown by the fact that tort \nvictims receive only 43 cents of every $1 awarded from damages--the \nother 57 cents going to pay lawyers and court fees and to cover the \nlitigants' lost time.\n  A significant portion of the 57 cents taken by the legal system goes \ndirectly to attorneys. Plaintiff's attorneys, in particular, collected \nfrom 33 to 40 percent of the average award in a contingency fee case--\nthat, plus fees for all costs related to the litigation.\n  Now, I am not begrudging the hard-working attorney for his or her \nhard-won fee. Nor am I proposing that we establish any set fee. But it \nseems clear to me that something is wrong with a system in which, as \nwas noted by Professor Lester Brickman of the Cardozo School of Law, 25 \nto 30 percent of all contingency fee cases have no real contingency.\n  In particular, in cases such as those involving airline crashes, \nfault often is not in doubt as a practical matter. This means that \nplaintiff's lawyers, who still collect their full 33-to-40 percent fee, \nmay receive the equivalent of $10,000 or even $30,000 per hour.\n  I was struck in particular by a 1989 case Professor Brickman noted \nout of Alton, TX, in which a school bus was hit by a delivery truck. In \nthis tragic incident 21 children were killed and 60 were injured. \nObviously and rightfully there was a large judgment in favor of the \nplaintiff/children.\n  While there was no doubt about who was at fault, the lawyers still \ncharged their full fees. As a result, according to Professor Brickman, \nthe attorneys received as much as $30,000 an hour for their services--\nmoney for which they did little and which could have done much more to \nhelp the victims and their families.\n  Mr. President, victims are losing out, and so are the rest of us, \nbecause legal costs are too high. Professor Brickman estimates that \ncontingency fees now run $13 to $15 billion annually. This represents a \nsubstantial portion, more than 10 percent, of the $132 billion which \nTillinghast research estimates we spend as a nation on our legal system \neach year. This $132 billion acts as a huge, business-stifling \nliability tax on consumer goods and services.\n  Now, again, most attorneys recognize their duty to inform clients of \nhow much they will be paying and for what services. Indeed, this is a \nstandard for professions in general.\n  Doctors provide fee schedules to insurers. Architects and even \nfurniture movers provide written, binding estimates upon request. \nConsumers of legal services, I believe, deserve the same treatment.\n  This is what our reforms would provide: At the initial meeting with \nthe prospective client the attorney would be obligated to inform the \nclient of his or her right to obtain a written fee statement within 30 \ndays. This statement would contain, first, the estimated hours of the \nattorney's services that will be spent settling or attempting to settle \nthe claim and handling the claim through trial; second, the basis on \nwhich the attorney proposes to charge the client--hourly, contingent, \nor flat fee; and third, the hourly rate, contingent fee, or flat fee \nthe attorney proposes to charge.\n  The attorney would be obligated to give this statement to the client \nwithin 30 days unless the client in writing waives the right to receive \nit or extend the attorney's time within which to provide.\n  Similarly, within 30 days after completion of the litigation either \nby settlement or trial, the attorney would be obliged to furnish the \nclient a written statement describing, first, the number of hours the \nattorney expended in connection with the claim; second, the total \namount of the fee; and third, the actual fee per hour charged, \nregardless of how the fee was structured. Again, the client could waive \nthe right to the statement or extend the 30-day deadline.\n  A claimant who does not receive the requisite disclosures has the \nright to withhold up to 10 percent of the fee charged and to file a \ncivil action for any damages the client incurred as a result of the \nfailure to disclose.\n  Mr. President, we need these reforms to help potential clients make \ninformed decisions concerning legal representation.\n  The legal services market is in particular need of open information \nbecause clients may never have dealt with the legal system before. This \nlack of client experience establishes a significant information and \nexpertise imbalance, one that can lead to a client's receiving less \nfavorable treatment than he or she might obtain with better \ninformation.\n  Moreover, this problem is made worse when an attorney is hired to \nprovide services for a single piece of litigation. That lawyer does not \nhave the same incentives to keep the clients happy at the conclusion of \nthe lawsuit as an attorney providing services to a longstanding firm or \nclient on an ongoing basis.\n  The right to know established by this amendment will facilitate an \nexchange of information concerning the quality of legal services \nprovided, and even single-issue relationships.\n  Thus we can empower clients in their dealings with attorneys while \nactually increasing the ability of market forces to work in the legal \nservices markets. The result will be increased competition, better \nservice, lower fees, and savings for everyone.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the amendment proposed by my friend, the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan, is the first amendment that has \nbeen proposed to this bill in something over 24 hours of debate. It is \na most interesting amendment. I hope that any Member who feels that he \nor she can contribute to the debate on the amendment will appear on the \nfloor and share with Members of the Senate that Senator's views.\n  The amendment is relatively modest in one respect, and in another \nsense is expansive. It is not directly connected with the other \nprovisions of this bill in that it is not limited to product liability \nlitigation. It is, on the other hand, limited, as I understand it, to \nactions in Federal court--basically in the U.S. district courts--and \napplies to all such litigation in those courts.\n  The concept that there should be disclosure, both in the initial \nstages of an attorney-client relationship and at the end of that \nrelationship, over a particular case is, of course, an appropriate one. \nOn its surface, the amendment seems to be constructive. I hope we will \nvery promptly get the views of other Senators on the subject.\n  I would like to conclude the debate on this relatively narrow \namendment before we adjourn this evening.\n  [[Page S5655]] Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. While I am trying to obtain a copy of the amendment, I \nhave in hand from the distinguished Senator from Michigan a copy of a \nletter dated April 24, I take it, outlining the amendment itself. It \nsays here:\n\n       Under our proposal, at the initial meeting the attorney \n     would be obligated to inform the client of his or her right \n     to obtain, within thirty days, a written statement containing \n     (1) the estimated hours of the attorney's services that will \n     be spent (a) settling or attempting to settle the claim and \n     (b) handling the claim through trial; (2) the basis on which \n     the attorney proposes to charge the client (hourly, \n     contingent or flat fee); and (3) the hourly rate, contingent \n     fee, or flat fee the attorney proposes to charge. The \n     attorney would then be obligated to provide that statement to \n     the client within thirty days unless the client in writing \n     waives the right to receive it, or extends the time.\n\n  Mr. President, on the matter of fees, I was in the practice actively \nfor 20 years and I never had outlined this. I have always had an \nunderstanding, and a written one. I wish I had one of the forms here, \nbecause it was the minimum fee schedule, approved by the Charleston \nbar, my hometown, where we had a minimum fee schedule--at a formal \nmeeting that was agreed upon--and that was a contingency contract. And \nwherein I was retained, I had that contingency contract signed not only \nby, of course, the client, but by myself.\n  In 20 years I have never found this problem. You can get this \nprofessor. I doubt he has tried a case, because I find that is the case \nwith most professors and that is why they are professors.\n  But right to the point, this so-called estimated hours. Let me go to \none of the cases that was taken all the way to the Fourth Circuit Court \nof Appeals and then finally abandoned before the Supreme Court. It was \na case of the C Bank as the trustee for Harold Tummestone versus the \nMorgan Construction Co. The reason I got the bank as a trustee is \nbecause the particular individual had been severely damaged, brain \ndamaged, which I will be glad to go into because, unless others want to \nspeak to this particular amendment, until I can get a copy of it I want \nto say a few words.\n  But we wanted to get comity or the trustee to bring that particular \ncase. I knew the bank had credibility. I wanted to bring credibility to \nthis so-called damage suit. Of course I got the bank to go over there \nand handle it and have them review all of my activities.\n  With respect to that, I can tell you the bank would not have \nrequired, and the bank would not have had any idea, nor would I have \nhad any idea about the estimated hours of the attorney's services that \nwill be spent (a) settling or attempting to settle the claim.\n  Excuse me, let me rescind that particular statement by saying, yes, I \ncould have put on there an estimation of (a) the hours spent settling \nor attempting to settle the claim. But, I can tell you here and now, \nthey never offered any settlement. We tried that case. It was not until \nthe jury came in that they wanted to try to even talk about settlement. \nI will never forget it. The trial judge in court recommended that we \nsettle the case. The truth of the matter is I had proven a very, very \nstrong case. I felt very confident. In spite of the admonition of the \ntrial judge, I told him to go ahead and write his order, whatever it \nwas, but I was not going to yield 1 red cent on that particular verdict \nbecause I knew what we had done. And I was not offered any settlement.\n  I never had billable hours. That is annoying to this particular \nSenator and lawyer. I have no idea how you can really make it. You \nmight sit in an office and talk about so many hours you are going to \ntry to settle. But it depends on how you reach the case on the docket \nand what the pressure is that you can bring on the defendant, if they \ncan get a continuance and everything else of that kind, and there is \nsuch a tremendous variable it does not help the client and it does not \nhelp the lawyer. It is a sort of spurious thing.\n  We believe in the client being informed. The information that I have \nalways had with respect to the contract and agreement with my clients \nis just exactly as I have pointed out. It is a contingent basis of one-\nthird, whereby we assume, as the attorney for that particular case, all \ncosts and all court costs, all medical fees to get examined by doctors \nand specialists' fees.\n  I remember in this particular case I had to get a neurosurgeon to \ncome down and spend several days and later on testify. So not only were \nhis fees billed to me--you have to pay the doctor's fee if you do not \nwant a witness who feels like he has not been paid. You want him to be \na happy witness, so you pay his medical fees. You pay the investigative \nfees. You pay all the interrogatory fees, discovery fees, all the time. \nYou pay for the appeals and the brief and the court, the transcript of \nrecord and everything else, the printing of that on appeal.\n  And of course all your hours and time--I did not sit down and start \ncomputing hours and time. But for the poor, indigent client, ``Look. \nDon't worry. We will do our level best to get you any recoveries made, \nand any offers made we are obviously going to tell you what the offer \nis and make sure you know about it. And you have the approval or \ndisapproval of any kind of settlement offer.'' Because, of course, we \nhave malpractice in law as well as malpractice in medicine. So you have \nto protect yourself and deal open and on top of the table with the \nparticular client.\n  But I can tell you now. Being at the bar, this particular thing here \nis the first I ever heard of it. I started in 1947; 1997 would be 50 \nyears. So in almost 47 years of practice, I never heard this as a \nproblem. Let me go further. I can tell you what I find as a problem. \nBut the basis on which the attorney proposes to charge the client an \nhourly contingent or flat fee, I think I can answer that and just say \nwhat I have said here.\n  Three, the hourly rate contingent fee or flat fee the attorney \nproposes to charge.\n  So mine again would be just the contingent fee. I could comply with \ntwo and three. But I have no idea about the estimated hours of settling \nor attempting to settle the claim and estimated hours of handling the \nclaim through trial. Of course, it says nothing here about the appeal.\n  It says similarly, within 30 days after completion of the litigation, \neither by settlement or trial, the attorney would be obliged to furnish \nthe client a written statement describing, first, the number of hours \nthe attorney expended in connection with the claim; second, the total \namount of the fee; and, third, the actual fee per hour charged \nregardless of how the fee was structured. That brings us back.\n  I really object to bringing it back to billable hours because we have \nto work and represent clients. I am not in Michigan in one of these \nlarge law firms. We are in a relatively small town. I guess speaking \nwith respect to large law firms in any event, and I have to spend, not \nbureaucracy and regulatory. Here we have regulatory reform. Now they \nhave regulations here about actual fee per hour charged. We will have \nto hire someone to keep track of this thing because I have work to do, \nstudy the law, interview the witnesses, and talk about not only the \npleadings and everything else of that kind but the chances of \nprevailing. All of that is tied up as we have been hearing about 2 to 3 \nyears. I would rather just put it on a contingent basis trying my best \nto get it to trial and get it to a conclusion, and not be into the \nproposition of the actual fee per hour charged and trying to compute \nit.\n  There is nothing wrong with disclosure. Like I say, I disclose. I \nwant a clear understanding. I cannot represent a client fully and \nfairly unless there is absolute trust. You build that up. You do not \nwrite that into law up here in Washington. I practice law. You get a \nreputation. You get a reputation for trust and for accomplishment, and \nby that reputation of being able to be successful at the bar and \ntotally trustworthy, the word spreads. You get a client and you get a \nsuccessful law practice. Incidentally, I had it. I had at least three \ntimes what I made when I got here in 1966.\n  But one of the things I really did not like was charging clients. I \nnever did charge enough. A client told me that \n[[Page S5656]] later on, as did several lawyers. I would rather come up \nhere where I do not have to worry about charging the clients. I can \ntalk to the jury and then go in with the jury and vote. I like this \nmuch better. I get a variety of cases, too. I do not get a reputation \njust by bringing one set of cases on the claimant side. You get any and \nevery case whether it is a terrorism case, whether it is a product \nliability case, or whether it is going to be telecommunications or \nwhatever it is. So it is the enrichment of the learning experience up \nhere that attracted me and not the fees.\n  But having said that, what really disturbs me is this trying to \nbureaucratize the law practice which I have resisted. But if we are \ngoing to go ahead and bureaucratize the law practice, what really is \noutrageous in my opinion is this billable hours whereby this crowd \ndowntown here is charging $300, $400, $500 an hour.\n  I will never forget when I was first up here and I put in on the case \nstatute the textile amendment. I got help from the distinguished \nSenator from New Hampshire on the other side of the aisle, Norris \nCotton.\n  After we succeeded in passing that textile bill over 25 years ago, \nSenator Cotton said, ``You know what so and so downtown was paid to \npass that bill?''\n  I said, ``I did not know he had anything to do with the bill.''\n  He said, ``No. But he was retained by the industry and given $1 \nmillion to get that bill through.''\n  I said, ``Did you ever talk to him?''\n  He said, ``No. I never did talk to him. But I just found that out.'' \nI never talked to him.\n  But these lawyers in this town get these enormous fees. I found since \nthat time regarding drugs--that is a terrible menace to our society--\nthat these lawyers that are successful in the drug cases immediately \ndemand and receive a $50,000 retainer, $100,000 retainer, large, \nexorbitant fees of that kind. I think that is really the thing that \ndiscourages society against the lawyers. I think what we ought to do \nreally is limit the attorneys' fees. I think what we ought to do is \nlimit the billable hours, the attorneys' fees in all cases, the \nbillable hours to $50 an hour.\n  Mr. President, at $50 an hour, at a 40-hour workweek, and a 52-week \nyear, you would exceed over $100,000. That is just $50. Of course, if \nyou work on weekends and overtime like any trial lawyer would work \novertime. Everybody was off to the football game and Sunday afternoon \ndriving with the family, and I was working in the office and Sunday \nnight getting ready to go to court on Monday morning. You could easily \nat $50 an hour, if you work as a lawyer, make $150,000 to $175,000 a \nyear. I think that is a good salary for a working lawyer. Senators get \nless, of course, and work harder. We start out early in the morning \naround here, and then when you supposedly get time off like Easter \nbreak, that is constituent service.\n  What I want to do is send an amendment to the desk to limit \nattorneys' fees in all civil actions to $50 per hour. And at the end of \nthe matter proposed to be inserted, I want to add section 302, \nlimitation on fees. If an attorney at law brings a civil action, or is \nengaged to defend against any civil action, the word ``action'' should \nbe inserted there because I was not familiar with this particular \namendment and never had heard of it until the distinguished Senator \nfrom Michigan submitted it. But if any attorney at law brings a civil \naction or is engaged to defend against any civil action, the attorneys \nmay not be compensated for legal services provided in connection with \nthat action at a rate in excess of $50 an hour.\n  I expect to get reelected on this amendment. I can tell you here and \nnow, if we can bring that down to $50 an hour. I remember my poor \ncolleagues on ethics charges having to go back on this particular \nrecord.\n  You have my colleagues here right now who would elect me President of \nthe Senate if they could get a fair vote because they were charged $400 \nan hour, and they all owe their lawyers downtown. You come to this \nplace and in the legal game of bringing ethics charges and everything \nelse of that kind and then having to go through all the records and \nwhat have you and pay the lawyer downtown, you have got $400, $500 an \nhour. I have heard of all kinds of charges of that nature. And I think \nthat what we ought to do is get to the real problem in these civil \nactions, not just in product liability, if we are going to have an \namendment that goes into all of this disclosure like there is some kind \nof secret hocus pocus.\n  Now, let me agree with the distinguished Senator from Michigan. I \nnoted in that letter as I was reading, and I quote, ``This concern is \nnot merely hypothetical.'' So says the Senator from Michigan.\n  To give just one example: According to the Washington Post, last \nmonth, attorneys collected $16 million in a settlement of antitrust \nclaims against several airlines. Their clients received coupons worth \n$10 to $25 redeemable toward the purchase of airline tickets, under \nlimited and restricted conditions. According to Prof. Lester Brickman \nof the Cardozo School of Law, in many tort cases lawyers are charging \nstandard contingent fees even though the contingency is in name only. \nSimilarly, professionals who audit law firm fees find significant \novercharging in many of the cases they examine.\n  If you got the contract that this lawyer has had, you cannot find any \novercharging. If you get the one-third, you have to pay all the costs \nand you have been paying for doctors; you have been paying for printing \ncosts; you are paying for interview costs; you are paying all kind of \ncosts over the 2- to 3-year period, and that comes out of your fee. \nThat does not come out of the claimant's award or verdict, I can tell \nyou here and now.\n  I do not know the background of this particular case, but it is \nobvious to me this antitrust claim--and that is what these lawyers get \nin so much billable hours. I noticed in one they had on another \nbankruptcy, and so forth, if someday we can retire and get to be a \nreferee in bankruptcy and sit around on golf courses, learning how to \nfinally settle the bankrupt nature of the entity, we can pay really \nthousands and thousands of dollars in fees, which to me is a disgrace. \nI have seen that happen in my own backyard, and I have complained about \nit in our hearings on bankruptcy cases.\n  But this $16 million in the antitrust claim no doubt was approved by \nthe Court itself. Now, they had a claim and they had all of these \nbillable hours. I know how to get that $16 million down to about $2 or \n$3 million by coming down to my amendment with $50 an hour maximum at \nthat particular time. I think that is one way to rectify what the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan finds is an abuse.\n  It is not really lack of disclosure because when you get an antitrust \ncase of this kind, you bring a class action, which apparently this was, \nyou really produce a case that was not in existence. You go around and \nfetch people who do not have any idea that they are being recharged and \nyou tell them I wish to get and bring a class action; I happen from \nresearch to believe that you have a case here; you are not obligated to \npay anything to me unless we succeed.\n  So the clients, while the distinguished Senator from Michigan may \ncomplain and I may complain at an inordinately high $16 million fee, \nyou can bet your boots that the people themselves had nothing to \ncomplain about because they did not have anything in the first place. \nThey did not even know they had a claim. They did not even know they \ncould get involved and help bring this abusive practice of overcharging \nby the airlines to a halt.\n  So they have performed a public service. Whether the lawyers in that \nparticular case deserved $16 million, at least the Court thought so. \nAnd the clients could well have appealed, and it could have been \nadjusted, and it could be subject now to adjustment and that kind of \nthing. I just really do not know. I agree that I am, as the Senator \nfrom Michigan, disturbed not about disclosure because clients can find \nout. And I can tell you now, if you have a client and you come around \nand all of a sudden win a case and you do not have an understanding, \nthat client can go to another lawyer and you have malpractice on your \nhands. You can be hit with a malpractice suit, whether they win or \nlose. What happens is that hurts your reputation. So irrespective of \nthe merit of the particular case, you \n[[Page S5657]] are supercautious in this day and age to not engage in \nany kind of misunderstanding with clients. So, yes, write it down, \nwrite down the contingent fee.\n  But I would have to oppose the amendment with respect to the billable \nhours. But if there is to be billable hours in product liability \nclaimants attorneys' restrictions, then I think maybe, if that is the \nwill of the body, they want to consider limiting attorneys' fees in all \ncivil actions to $50 per hour.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 598 to Amendment No. 597\n\n  (Purpose: To limit attorneys' fees in all civil actions to $50 per \n                                 hour)\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk to the \namendment of the Senator from Michigan and ask that the clerk report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 598 to amendment numbered 597.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the matter proposed to be inserted, add the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 302. LIMITATION ON FEES.\n\n       If an attorney of law brings a civil action or is engaged \n     to defend against any civil action, the attorney may not be \n     compensated for the legal services provided in connection \n     with that action at a rate in excess of $50 an hour.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I have explained the amendment and about read it to my \ncolleagues.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the \namendment by the distinguished Senator from Michigan [Mr. Abraham] \nrequiring lawyers to disclose to their clients information about fee \narrangements.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Michigan is a very simple consumer \nprotection amendment. Too often, those in need of legal services are \ninexperienced in evaluating whether they are getting good value for the \nmoney they pay. After all, choosing a lawyer is not exactly like \nchoosing a lawn mower. No objective specifications, to my knowledge, \nexist. It is virtually impossible to compare prices. The only thing a \nprospective client may know in selecting the lawyer is what law school \nhe or she attended, and that he or she passed the State bar \nexamination. The client may not even know if it took the lawyer more \nthan one try to pass the bar exam. And unfortunately, some lawyers take \nadvantage of unsuspecting clients. In contingent fee cases, lawyers \ncharge standard rates, regardless of how much effort or how much risk \nis involved in the particular case, typically, to take one-third of any \nsettlement, 40 percent of any award resulting from trial, and \nfrequently 50 percent if the case gets appealed. Many jury verdicts are \neventually reduced on appeal, so often an injured person will recover \nless money the further the case is litigated.\n  A few weeks ago, the Washington Post reported on the settlement of an \nantitrust case against several airlines. The clients got $10 to $25 \ncoupons redeemable under restricted and limited conditions. The lawyers \nshared $16 million in fees.\n  Lawyers who bill their clients on an hourly basis create problems of \na different sort. Consider the case of the Denver law firm that claimed \nit did not bill its clients for the first class airfare. A legal \nauditor hired by a client discovered that the firm bought business \nclass tickets but individual lawyers were upgrading to first class at \nthe airports and then billing the clients. In another firm, a lawyer \nwas discovered to have billed for 62 hours in a single day--quite an \naccomplishment, I might say.\n  Still, another lawyer drafted a motion for a client that could be \nused in thousands of asbestos cases that the lawyer was defending. The \nlawyer billed his clients 3,000 separate times for the same motion--\n3,000 separate times, I repeat, Mr. President, for the same motion.\n  These anecdotes are related in a recent U.S. News & World Report \nstory entitled ``Lawyers Who Abuse the Law.'' Add on to a few lawyers \nwho take advantage of their clients the reality that the legal system \ndoes not fairly compensate those who seek redress. Someone injured \nbecause of another's negligence has as much chance of winning in a \nlawsuit as he or she does by taking a turn at the gaming tables of Las \nVegas. Sometimes, as at the casinos, it is possible to win big. But we \nknow that in gambling, the house is usually the big winner. The same is \ntrue in the legal system, only the house is the system itself--lawyers \nand court costs.\n  After all, more than half of every dollar spent in the liability \nsystem, 57 cents goes to the lawyers and to the courts. The injured get \nonly 43 cents of that dollar.\n  These experiences are causing the American people to lose confidence \nin our legal system. The same U.S. News & World Report article found \nthat 69 percent of the American people believe lawyers are only \nsometimes or not usually honest.\n  Restoring integrity to our legal system is a fundamental goal of this \nreform effort. This amendment is designed to give clients some \nreasonable information about the financial aspects of the relationship \nwith a lawyer.\n  Under the amendment of the Senator from Michigan, the lawyer would be \nrequired to provide the client with two statements, one at the outset \nof the representation and another when the case is concluded.\n  The attorney must provide the client with the following information \nat the beginning: How many hours will be spent trying to settle the \ncase; how many hours it will take to bring the case to trial; how the \nattorney will charge the client--hourly, contingent, or flat fee; and, \nthe precise rate.\n  A final statement at the end of the case must include the following: \nThe number of hours the lawyer spent on the case, the total amount of \nthe fee and the effective hourly rate, regardless of the rate actually \ncharged.\n  This basic information will go a long way toward restoring America's \nfaith in our legal system, and it will enable those who need legal \ncounsel to be better informed in selecting counsel. The scope of the \namendment is limited. It applies only to those cases filed in Federal \ncourts. So the Senator from Michigan has narrowed the scope of this \nconsiderably.\n  While there is no reason for these disclosure requirements not to \napply to State courts, we are trying to be mindful of imposing too many \nrequirements upon the States in this particular instance. So we have \nleft the scope of this effort quite narrow, and the States are free to \nadopt these disclosure requirements on their own, obviously.\n  Let me close by stating what the amendment does not do. First of all, \nit does not prohibit or restrict contingent or hourly fees. It does not \nmandate the use of contingent or hourly fees.\n  We recognize the importance of contingent fees. In some situations, a \ncontingent fee may be the only way a person can afford to hire a lawyer \nto pursue a case. But the Abraham amendment affords consumers important \ninformation. It will help those choosing lawyers to be good consumers, \nand it will put consumers on a more level playing field with the \nlawyers whose services they need.\n  So I want to commend the distinguished Senator from Michigan for his \namendment. I think it is an excellent amendment. I hope it will be \nadopted by the Senate at the appropriate time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair.\n  [[Page S5658]] Mr. President, of course, you can see now what is \nentering into this particular issue, and that is what I would call \ncandor. The reason this issue has survived over 15 years but never \npassed the Senate, the reason it hasn't gotten anywhere is the \nantipathy to lawyers. And here in the middle of the treatment of \nproduct liability, a very restricted part of civil actions--you take \nall the civil actions in the United States filed, 9 percent of all \ncivil actions filed comprise tort claims. And if you take all the tort \nclaims filed, only 4 percent of the 9 percent comprise product \nliability.\n  What you have is thirty-six one-hundredths of the civil actions being \ntreated in product liability. But superimposed on top of that comes the \nfirst amendment, and the first amendment is: ``Kill all the lawyers,'' \nthey said in King Henry VI, Shakespeare. We will kill all the lawyers \nhere. We have the disclosure of attorneys fees and information.\n  They take an anecdotal measure that they refer to in the newspaper \nrelative to antitrust, having nothing to do with product liability, and \nthey put in an antitrust charge which is no doubt a class action--not \nclass action on product liability--and a class action that has been \nconducted over the many years. I have to go back and find out what it \nwas.\n  Quite to the point, the $16 million, with the inference here, they do \nnot tell you how many millions went to the claimants. Obviously, \nmillions went to the claimants, but when you had thousands and \nthousands of claimants, maybe millions of claimants, then it did reduce \nit to a $10 to $25 redeemable toward the purchase of an airline ticket.\n  Those things come out when you get the full facts. But this anecdotal \napproach, and taken with all civil cases in Federal court and putting \ndown lawyers' disclosure amounts gets to the candor that really is \nbehind the movement here at hand.\n  Product liability has been handled at the State level and in a very \njudicious and forceful fashion. We know it is not a national problem. \nAll the little things that they tried to bring up over the years--\nincidentally, Mr. President, by way of amusement to this Senator, I \nremember when they brought up the Little League, and the Little League \nhad the right and said, no, no, we are not a part of this case. Then \nthey had an anecdotal amount of Girl Scout cookies and they had the \nright and said, no, we are not into this at all. Then our former \ncolleague who, incidentally, sat right here in the Senate, the Senator \nfrom South Dakota, George McGovern, was on a little TV expose, how he \nwent out of business on account of product liability, and then he \nreversed field and said, no, no, they had cut that particular little \n30-second bite that they had him and former Congressman and then \nSecretary Jack Kemp on, which they were trying to build up.\n  They tried every amusing thing in the world to give some force and \ncredence to our product liability problem. There is none. There is no \nnational problem in product liability. Now if we cannot get the votes \nfor that, then what we ought to do is get lawyers fees here and call it \ndisclosure, like the lawyers are running around cheating their clients. \nCome on. If the lawyers do that, they are not going to last long. I do \nnot know what town they practice in, but reputation means everything in \nthe profession. Oh, yes, we object to doctors and doctors' fees and \neverything else, until we get sick, and then we want the best and we \nlove our doctors. In a similar fashion, yes, they all complain about \nthe lawyers, until they get in trouble and then they get a lawyer of \ntheir choice and have complete trust.\n  Like I say, at the bar we require a minimum fee kind of schedule and \ncontract, and the lawyers of the local bar associations police their \ngroups. And, yes, there are many cases being brought up now before our \nState supreme court for malpractice, disbarment, and everything else of \nthat kind, where they have taken the client's money. But that was not \nbecause they did not disclose. You are going to find those kinds of \nlawyers and those kind of individuals in every practice, profession, \ntrade, or business.\n  It is unfortunate, but you certainly do not need here at the Federal \nlevel to try and burden product liability with a lawyer fee act. But if \nwe are going to do it, let us get to the real heart of the matter, \nbecause there is a cleavage of division. When, Mr. President, I work \nfor you as my client, I do not get paid until I succeed and you \nunderstand the percentage or the contingent basis. If I go to you under \nbillable hours, in addition to trying to win your case, I am trying to \nwin myself more fees, and on a billable hour basis, the more I can say \nthat I worked on Saturday and I spent some hours reading here and I \nlooked there and everything else--in other words, I am trying my case \nand not the client's case.\n  I think that is unethical. I think it is basically unethical. There \nare a lot of things that I think are unethical. Perhaps our conference \nthat we have around here every Tuesday trying to ambush each other is. \nWe never had that before. We had policy committees. As the \ndistinguished Parliamentarian who has been here for years knows, the \npolicy committee set the seriatim of the treatment of measures. But we \nnever had parties meeting, the Republican conference and the Democratic \nconference, to meet in ambush of the other side and come around here \nand talk about ethics.\n  When you get these billable hours, you begin to work for your \nbillable hours, you begin to work for your case rather than the \nclient's case. I never did like it. I never charged billable hours. I \nresent it and reject it. But if we are going to have it, let us limit \nit because it is unforgivable what they are trying to charge. If that \nis what the market forces are, I never heard of all the hours charged. \nLook at the O.J. Simpson case, what they say those high-powered lawyers \nare charging. Maybe we can have a hearing before the Judiciary \nCommittee and find out. I know we have not had any hearings on this.\n  The product liability measure was referred to the Commerce Committee \nand there was not one word of testimony on this matter. That made me \nwithhold the matter of lawyers fees. I was waiting for somebody to \nraise the subject of let us get the lawyers. Now that it has been \nraised in the Abraham-McConnell amendment, I have to amend that \namendment with my particular one of a limitation of $50, at the most, \non any billable hours.\n  As I pointed out, I am confident that the anecdotal antitrust case--\nnot a product liability case--would reduce the $16 million. Oh, that \nwould reduce it down to $2 or $3 million.\n  So we are moving in the right direction in the Hollings amendment. \nBut more than that, I would challenge those who sponsored this \namendment to bring me the product liability case wherein the claimant \nrepresented by an attorney was misled, misinformed, or not disclosed \nfully what the fee basis was. I do not know of any. I never have heard \nof any. I cannot understand it. Maybe it happened here in this \nantitrust case. But if that is what they are disturbed about, do not \njust reach around in a magazine article having nothing to do with \nproduct liability or reach around in a newspaper article in the \nWashington Post having to do with antitrust and a class action brought \nover a series of years and court approved that we do not have the facts \nfor, having nothing to do with product liability. I want to ask them to \nplease bring--if that is their intent now on disclosure--evidence of \nwhere it is a national problem.\n  Heavens above, we have enough work to do around here. But if we are \ngoing to start debating lawyer's fees at the national level, and \ndisclosures, and how many hours, and what do you expect, and how many \nhours on settlement, and how many hours on trial, and then the actual \nfee per hour charge, regardless of how the fee was structured, and all \nof these things of that kind, this is a solution looking for a problem. \nWhat the real problem is, is lawyers. So they say we can enhance this \nproduct liability initiative by going at lawyers. And we will find out \nwho is for lawyers and against lawyers.\n  Well, I happen to be for lawyers. We will have to get that saying of \n``kill all the lawyers.'' But that was really a laudatory comment, \nwhereby lawyers stand between tyranny and freedom. In Shakespeare, you \nwill find that reference with respect to lawyers not being against all \nthe lawyers, but the \n[[Page S5659]] tyrant was saying the only way we can prevail and \ncontinue this tyranny is to get the lawyers because they are the only \nones that understand and know and stand in our way of freedom, and we \ncan continue this tyranny. So it was not a pejorative saying of ``kill \nall the lawyers.''\n  We can go through to the Founding Fathers who were all lawyers and \ndrew the Constitution and worked at it overnight. We can come right on \ndown the line with respect to the lawyers in the history of this land, \nwhether it be President Lincoln in the days during the Civil War, or \nmost recently here, in civil rights cases, Thurgood Marshall and \nothers. If they had not had those lawyers, I can tell you now, having \nbeen at the local level over the many years, had Thurgood Marshall not \nsucceeded in Brown versus Board of Education, you would not have found \nthe advancements made.\n  Advancements were not made as a result of the Civil Rights Act of \n1964 so much as the advancement made in the 1954 Brown versus Board of \nEducation decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, brought by the trial \nlawyer for the NAACP, Thurgood Marshall.\n  I will bring the cases, when we have time, to the attention of my \ncolleagues. The hour is late and I want to yield to others to be heard \non this.\n  Since it has just come up, I have represented to the distinguished \nmanager of the bill, it is not our intent to delay. We will survey \ncolleagues on this side of the aisle and see what amendments they want \nto present. I want to see if there are those who want to talk on this \nparticular measure before we vote. And pending that, Mr. President, I \nyield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, my staff brought to my attention--I wish \nwe had billable hours for Senators. We could make a living up here. \nMaybe that is the next amendment we will have if they insist on this \namendment, Mr. President.\n  Pending that, we have the Model Rules of Professional Conduct and the \nCode of Judicial Conduct by the American Bar Association.\n  I look at rule 1.4, ``Communication'' and I read:\n\n       A lawyer shall keep a client reasonably informed about the \n     status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable \n     requests for information.\n       A lawyer shall explain a matter to the extent reasonably \n     necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions \n     regarding the representation.\n\n  That is the American Bar Association Model Rule that we all are \ngoverned by.\n  With respect to the fees themselves, rule 1.5:\n\n       (A) A lawyer's fee shall be reasonable. The factors to be \n     considered in determining the reasonableness of a file \n     include the following:\n       (1) the time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty \n     of the questions involved, the skill requisite to perform the \n     legal service properly;\n       (2) the likelihood, if apparent to a client, that the \n     acceptance of the particular employment will preclude other \n     employment by the lawyer;\n\n  I take that, Mr. President, to be no conflict of interest.\n\n       (3) the fee customarily charged in the locality with \n     similar legal services;\n       (4) the amount involved and the results obtained;\n       (5) the time limitations imposed by the client or by the \n     circumstances;\n       (6) the nature and length of the professional relationship \n     with the client;\n       (7) the experience, repetition, and the ability of the \n     lawyer or lawyers performing the services;\n       (8) where the fee is fixed, whether the fee is fixed or \n     contingent.\n\n  It goes on in detail on the basis of the rate of fee, the terms of \npayment, and all the necessary things--the divisions of fee, how to \nsettle if there is a dispute about the fee, all are matters of \ndisclosure.\n  What they are really coming with on product liability is an assault \nagainst the bar. I know the former distinguished Vice President of the \nUnited States thought it was good politics, and he brought up about \nlawyers at the American Bar Association.\n  If a person practices law, they are under the rule and guidelines. It \nis still a profession. Just like I have resisted actually the TV \ncoverage of the proceedings here of the U.S. Senate because we could \nget a lot more work done and we did a lot more work and we got things \ndone.\n  I also have resisted the so-called advertisement by attorneys with \nthe neon sign ``Divorces, divorces,'' or ``If you think you are hurt,'' \nor, ``We get more money in our claims than anybody else.'' I think that \nis unethical. I hate to see that coming about with the particular \nprofession.\n  If we take the television out of the O.J. Simpson courtroom, that \ncase could be handled in the next 3 weeks. But it will take the next 3 \nmonths at least with TV there. The idea is to get justice and not to \namuse the public generally.\n  I hope we get the television out of this body, the television out of \nthe courtroom, and get back to some economic sense, go to work for the \npeople of America, and certainly not take what never has been \nrecognized as a national problem, except with respect to the American \nBar Association and its code of conduct which it has over the many, \nmany years. It has never made a national problem to be legislated upon.\n  I know what they have in mind, and I think that my amendment will \nhelp them get at the 60,000 billable hour lawyers, and not the trial \nlawyers. They really go after the trial lawyers and product liability.\n  I want to talk about the corporate lawyers and that billable hour \ncrowd that extends out. I have heard my colleague from West Virginia. \nHe does not have any understanding of the law practice. He says, why, \nat the State level it is very difficult to get product liability \nreform. False. We have it in 46 of the 50 States in the last 15 years.\n  He says one of the reasons we cannot get it are these trial lawyers \nholding things up because they like to extend their cases and get more \nmoney. Extend more cases, I get more expenses.\n  I am paid on a contingency basis. I am not paid by a billable hour. \nThe fellow who gets more money is the insurance company lawyer, the \ncorporate lawyer. They love it. They try to stretch it out, get \ncontinuances, make more motions and everything else. I got 10 or 15 \ngood cases in the office that I have taken for seriously injured \nclients. I have hundreds of thousands of dollars in time and costs \nwrapped up. I am really having to carry and finance, which we do. I \nhave done it in my private practice.\n  We know how it is in corporate law. They have the mahogany desks and \nthe Persian rugs, and they sit down there with the paneled walls and \njust answer the phone and everything. Answer the phone and say, by the \nway, charge him that I talked to him on the phone. I never heard of a \ncontingency fee lawyer say I talked to somebody and charged so much. \nThey charge so much per telephone call, so much per letter, so much per \nhour, so much per this. There is more per fees in the practice than we \ncould ever contemplate.\n  Heavens, let us not write this bureaucracy into the law.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be permitted to \nspeak as in morning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/25/senate-section/article/S5638-3", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5659-S5660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  IN MEMORY OF SENATOR JOHN C. STENNIS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to \ndiscuss the life and career of Senator John C. Stennis, who passed away \nearlier this week.\n  Senator Stennis served in this Chamber for 41 years. His work here \nincluded \n[[Page S5660]] serving as chairman of the Senate Armed Services and the \nSenate Appropriations Committees and as President pro tempore of this \nbody.\n  Among his legislative achievements was his ability to bend and flow \nwith the times. Once a staunch segregationist, Senator Stennis cast his \nvote for the Voting Rights Act of 1982.\n  One area in which he never changed, however, was in upholding the \nsafety and security of this great country. Senator Stennis warned \nagainst overextending our military capacity. He also warned against \nwasteful defense spending. But he never wavered in his support of the \ncountry's national defense and ensuring that it maintained the military \ncapacity to guarantee our freedoms and our liberties.\n  During his four decades in the U.S. Senate, Senator Stennis was \nalways an abiding example of integrity and fortitude. His respect for \nthe institution of the Senate and the law of the United States made him \nan early opponent of the excesses and abuses of Senator Joe McCarthy. \nAs a result, he and Senator Sam Ervin were named as the two Democratic \nmembers on the Watkins committee that investigated the recklessness of \nSenator McCarthy and led to his censorship.\n  In July 1965, the Senate created the Select Committee on Standards \nand Conduct, the forerunner of our current Select Committee on Ethics. \nThis was a controversial creation, and everyone knew that whoever \nchaired it would be in a difficult position. The Senate had \ntraditionally relied upon the voters of a State to discipline a Senator \nfor improper behavior, and institutional discipline is a painful \nproblem in an institution that depends on the collegiality of its \nMembers. The only logical choice for this important and difficult \nleadership position was Senator Stennis. The Mississippi Senator became \nso successful\n and so respected in this position that the committee quickly became \nknown as the ``Stennis Committee.''\n\n  Mr. President, the career of Senator John C. Stennis was marked, not \nonly with legislative triumphs, but with numerous personal triumphs \nover personal adversity.\n  In 1973, he was shot by robbers in front of his house and left for \ndead.\n  In 1983, his beloved wife of 52 years, Coy Hines Stennis passed away.\n  In 1984, a battle with cancer resulted in the loss of one of his legs \nand confined him to a wheelchair. While in the hospital recuperating \nfrom the surgery, he was visited by the President of the United States, \nRonald Reagan. President Reagan later said that he had dreaded going to \nthe hospital that day, for he feared the impact such a life-altering \noperation would have on a fiercely independent man like Senator \nStennis. But the President explained, ``when I left, it was I who had \nbeen strengthened.''\n  He had been strengthened by the Senator's confidence, his faith, and \nhis optimism.\n  Those qualities defined Senator Stennis' outlook on life. On his \nSenate desk he kept a plaque that simply read: ``Look Ahead.''\n  ``That's my philosophy,'' he explained. Don't waste time lamenting \nthe past. ``You have got to look ahead. I realize that life's not \naltogether what you make it. But that's part of it, what you make it \nyourself.''\n  Senator Stennis made for himself a wonderful life, and the Senate and \nthe country can be grateful for it.\n  When he retired from the Senate in January 1989, Senate Majority \nLeader Robert Byrd called it ``the end of an era.'' And indeed it was.\n  Perhaps a greater compliment came from a Republican Member of \nCongress from Mississippi, who said, ``We'll miss him. Even if he's a \nDemocrat, he's a great man.''\n  As the Senate Democratic leader, I say that is a great statement, \neven from a Republican.\n  In 1988, Congress established the John C. Stennis Center for Public \nService Training at Mississippi State University. The center covers a \nrange of historical projects, including an excellent oral history \nprogram. When a congressional historian approached him about an oral \nhistory of his own life and career, Senator Stennis initially opposed \nthe idea, saying it would be too self-aggrandizing. The historian \nproceeded to explain that it was not only an honor, it was his duty to \nrecord for posterity his personal account of the historic events and \ndecisions in which he had been involved.\n  ``Well, sir,'' responded Senator Stennis, ``If you say its my duty, \nthen I must do it, because I've always done my duty.''\n  Indeed he did.\n  It was not only his legislative accomplishments--and they were many--\nfor which we so loved and remember him, it was also his commitment to \nGod and country.\n  No person who has ever served in the U.S. Senate was ever quicker to \ntell you what was wrong with this country. But no person was ever \nquicker to tell you what was right about it, either.\n  Mr. President, Linda and I extend our most heartfelt condolences to \nthe family of John C. Stennis: we share their grief and their loss.

STENNIS\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I first want to commend the distinguished \nDemocratic leader for his comments about our departed colleague and my \ngood friend, Senator John C. Stennis. Today, there was a very \nappropriate editorial published in the Clarion-Ledger, in Jackson, MS, \ndescribing the effect that Senator Stennis had, by virtue of his \nservice in the Senate, on the State of Mississippi.\n  I commend the editor for such a fine article and I ask unanimous \nconsent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Clarion-Ledger, Apr. 25, 1995]\n\n          John C. Stennis: Integrity Set Standard for Congress\n\n       The accomplishments of former U.S. Sen. John C. Stennis \n     could fill pages.\n       Stennis' long and full life ended Sunday at age 93, and \n     during the next few days, Mississippians, will hear many of \n     the senator's accomplishments recounted.\n       His long and distinguished career in government left his \n     mark on many of the policies of the United States, especially \n     in military matters. There are many institutions that bear \n     his name, even an aircraft carrier.\n       Mississippi is a much different place, and a much better \n     place, because of the policies and economic development \n     projects he brought to the state.\n       But, all of the political achievements, the things that \n     most politicians are measured by, fall short when it comes to \n     Sen. Stennis.\n       Stennis was, above all else, a man of integrity, a true \n     statesman, whose adherence to honor and code of conduct made \n     him legendary in the U.S. Senate, which he loved so dearly.\n       That is indeed a rare quality, especially in the mean-\n     spirited politics of today.\n       Sen. Stennis' reputation for fairness made him a trusted \n     colleague and confidant of presidents of both parties. He was \n     known as the ``conscience of the Senate'' because of his high \n     ethical standards and respect for the institution.\n       Throughout his long career, integrity and service were \n     watchwords. It is appropriate that, of the institutions that \n     bear his name, the Stennis Center for Public Service at \n     Mississippi State University seeks to encourage young people \n     to public service careers.\n       In his 1947 campaign, Stennis stated a simple creed: ``I \n     want to plow a straight furrow right down to the end of my \n     row.''\n       Sen. John C. Stennis succeeded with that pledge.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I want to invite the attention of the \nSenate to a couple of points that are made in this fine tribute. After \ntalking about many of the things that Senator Stennis did for the State \nthe editorial writer then says:\n\n       But, all of the political achievements, the things that \n     most politicians are measured by, fall short when it comes to \n     Senator Stennis.\n       Stennis was, above all else, a man of integrity, a true \n     statesman, whose adherence to honor and code of conduct made \n     him legendary in the U.S. Senate, which he loved so dearly.\n\n  Mr. President, as I was beginning to think about putting this in the \nRecord for the information of Senators, I realized that I sit at the \ndesk that was occupied by Senator Stennis during the time he served in \nthe Senate.\n  As you know, there is a tradition here to put your name in the desk \ndrawer like schoolboys used to. Senator Stennis' name is in this desk \ndrawer which he wrote in there and put the date that he began service, \n1947, and a dash, and never did, of course, \n[[Page S5661]] put the date on which his service ended, which the \ndistinguished Democratic leader pointed out was in 1989.\n  One other aspect of this desk is that not only has it been occupied \nby many Mississippians over the years, Jefferson Davis, to name one, \nJohn Sharp Williams, a very distinguished Senator who had served as \nDemocratic leader in the House before he was elected to the Senate, and \nthen served three terms in the Senate and probably was one of the most \nrespected national figures of his day serving in the Congress. And \nserving from Mississippi it made our State very proud. But Senator \nStennis occupied this desk from 1947--well over 41 years, as the \nSenators know.\n  But toward the end of his career he lost a leg to cancer, and this \ndesk was located in the rear of the Chamber. So his wheelchair could \nmove right up to the desk. But he never failed to rise and address the \nSenate even though he was confined to the wheelchair and had only one \nleg. He had the carpenters put a special place here where a bar could \nbe fitted. There are two holes carved for wooden inserts in this desk \nto hold that bar. And the bar would rest inside the desk. Most Senators \nput the rule books of the Senate and a couple of other reference books \nin the top of their desk. But that had simply a bar there. He would put \nit there and pull himself up, and with that one leg stand erect to \naddress the Senate because he respected the institution so much, its \ntraditions, and its customs, always pointing out to other Senators that \nwe should be in order; and having a tremendous influence because of his \npresence in this body.\n  The Senate is much better off because of his service here. The State \nof Mississippi is truly blessed to have been the State represented in \nthe U.S. Senate by John C. Stennis.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/25/senate-section/article/S5660-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5661-S5663]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 IN MEMORY OF THE LATE JOHN C. STENNIS\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I would like to speak for a few minutes this \nevening on a subject close to my heart, and that is the memory of our \nformer colleague, John C. Stennis, who passed away on Sunday, April 23, \nat the age of 93. Senator Stennis served in this body for over 41 \nyears, from 1947 to 1989.\n  For a long number of years, as I was growing up and following the \nactivities of the Congress of the United States, Senator Stennis was \none of my heroes, and that was long before I came to U.S. Senate. John \nStennis personified for me the image of what a Senator should be, and \nthat image inspired me as I considered whether to seek a seat in the \nU.S. Senate in the 1972 election. From my first days in the Senate, \nJohn Stennis was a patient mentor, a strong and valuable colleague, and \na cherished friend.\n  It has been said that ``Great men are like eagles, they do not flock \ntogether. You find them one at a time, soaring alone, using their \nskills and strengths to reach new heights and to seek new horizons.'' \nSuch an eagle was John Stennis.\n  John Stennis was a Senator's Senator. He was gentle and courteous in \nconduct, but tough and strong in conviction and in character. He was a \nman of singular purpose and broad vision--yet he was sensitive, very \nsensitive, to the needs and the wishes of others.\n  John Stennis personified the highest ideals of honor and integrity \nwithin the U.S. Senate. Members of the Senate from both parties and \nfrom widely divergent philosophical points of view treasured his \nsteadfast leadership, his fearless courage, his kindness toward others, \nhis unselfish devotion to public service, his love and respect for the \nU.S. Senate, the Congress, his reverence for the U.S. Constitution, and \nhis unshakable faith in God.\n  Senator Stennis was an outstanding lawyer and judge before he came to \nthe Senate, and his judicial temperament marked every aspect of his \nSenate service. Time after time, the Senate turned to him to address \nthe most difficult and divisive issues, such as the conduct of Senator \nJoseph McCarthy.\n  When the Senate established the first Select Committee on Standards \nand Conduct, which was the predecessor of the Ethics Committee, it was \nonly natural that Senator Stennis was selected as the first chairman. \nFrom 1961 to 1981, he served as chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee. As chairman, he set a standard that all of his successors \nstrive to meet. He was a man of conviction, strong, moral character, \nand absolute and total courage. Despite much adversity--a life-\nthreatening gunshot wound in 1973, right after I came to the Senate \nthat tragedy happened, also the loss in 1983 of his beloved wife, Miss \nCoy, and the challenges of serious operations in later years, through \nall of that he served the people of Mississippi and the people of this \nNation with courage and with strength.\n  Chairman Stennis was the Senate's preeminent authority on military \naffairs. His career spanned the period of the cold war. He came to the \nSenate in 1947, the year the Marshall plan was announced. He left in \n1989, the year the Berlin Wall came down. He played a very large role \nin those events and all the events in between. He had guided this body \nthrough the difficult years of the post-Vietnam era and through the \nsubsequent revitalization of America's Armed Forces.\n  Senator Stennis consistently supported a strong national defense even \nin times when it was not popular to do so. I recall clearly the first \nfew years after I came to the Senate in the early 1970's, when \nvirtually all defense programs were being challenged one after another \non the Senate floor. Senator Stennis remained in the Chamber steadfast \nfor hours and weeks and sometimes even months while the bill was \npending in the Senate, making the case for maintaining a strong defense \nfor our Nation.\n  At the same time, Senator Stennis was downright intolerant of wasted \nand misspent dollars, and he consistently opposed those who simply \nwanted to write a Pentagon blank check.\n  Senator Stennis remembered well the lessons of pre-World War II \nisolationism and he constantly opposed the recurring isolationist \nimpulse, especially during the difficult post-Vietnam years. He was a \nrock of support for NATO at a time when there was strong opposition in \nthe country to foreign military alliances. One of the first assignments \nhe gave me when I got to the Senate was going to NATO and coming back \nand reporting to him on what I found there.\n  Yet he remained skeptical of excessive military involvement overseas \nand he expressed great concern about the plans for intervention in \nVietnam before that intervention occurred. Once the Nation was \ncommitted to war, however, he always believed that American forces \nshould be provided with the means necessary and the backing to \naccomplish the objectives assigned to them.\n  It was my privilege to serve with him since coming to the Senate in \n1973 until he left in 1989. He was my friend. He was my mentor. He \nremained my hero. I will miss him, and I will miss his sound advice and \nwise judgment. During my first campaign for the Senate in 1972, I came \nto Washington to meet with Senator Stennis. This was before I was \nelected in November but after I had won the Democratic primary. I told \nhim of my strong interest in military affairs, and I asked for his \nsupport in obtaining a seat on the Armed Services Committee if I should \nbe elected.\n  I will always be grateful for his assurances of support and his \nassistance once I arrived, and certainly all of that played a very \nimportant part in my Senate career. With his support, I obtained a seat \non the Committee on Armed Services, and I promptly sought his advice on \nhow I should fulfill my duties. He told me, and I recall it well, that \nthe best way to learn about the Defense Department and the military \nservices was to deal directly and extensively with the men and women in \nuniform as well as the civilian employees of the Department of Defense. \nHe encouraged me to listen to their advice and understand their point \nof view, to remain open and objective but always to at least listen.\n  He appointed me to be the chairman of the newly created Manpower and \n[[Page S5662]] Personnel Subcommittee which gave me the opportunity to \nfollow his advice in a great number of details and with considerable \namount of time.\n  Over the years, I listened to and learned from Senator Stennis as we \ndebated the great issues of national security and other national \naffairs that faced our country in the 1970's and 1980's, and the \nlessons learned then still apply almost every day in the Senate in the \n1990's. It was a marvelous education in the ways of the Senate, the \nconduct of national security affairs and the Constitution of the United \nStates.\n  In 1987, Senator Stennis became chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, and I became chairman of the Armed Services Committee. It \nwas my good fortune to have him continue to sit on that committee, to \nbe able to begin my chairmanship with Senator Stennis at my side, \nbecause I frequently consulted with him and benefited from his advice \non the problems and issues that arose under the jurisdiction of the \nArmed Services Committee as well as many other matters that came to the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  When Senator Stennis first came to this body, he said in his classic \ndirect style, ``I wish to plow a straight furrow right down to the end \nof my row.'' There is no doubt he did exactly that. Senator Stennis \ngrew up on a farm and he knew how difficult it was to plow a straight \nfurrow with a mule. You cannot plow a straight line to your immediate \ngoal or mark a stake in the field unless you keep your eye on the \ndistant point that establishes your sight line. That is the way John \nStennis lived. He staked out his immediate goals, but he always kept \nhis eye on the distant goal, the values and principles that enabled him \nto plow a straight furrow right to the end of the row.\n  Mr. President, I also remember well his advice to me when I came to \nthe Senate. I hope I never will forget this. He said, ``Sam, some new \nSenators grow and some simply swell. Make sure you continue to grow.''\n  Mr. President, no higher honor has come my way than serving in the \nSenate with John Stennis. When he retired a few years back, I said then \nit was hard for me to imagine the Senate without John Stennis at his \ndesk. It is now hard for me to imagine the Nation without the benefit \nof his talent, counsel, and his sterling example. We will miss him. We \nwill all miss him. But his legacy of integrity and devoted service to \nthe country will inspire the Senate and the Nation and young people \nparticularly for generations to come.\n  Mr. President, Colleen, my wife, and I extend our sympathies to his \nson, John Hampton Stennis, his daughter, Mrs. Margaret Stennis Womble, \nand to all of his grandchildren and great grandchildren, indeed, to all \nof his family and his friends, and we thank the people of Mississippi \nfor sending this giant to the Senate for the number of years that he \nserved. The people of Mississippi and the people of this Nation can be \nvery proud of Senator Stennis. He will be remembered in history as one \nof the giants of the Senate. As long as there is a Senate, John Stennis \nwill be remembered for his service, for his integrity, and for his \ncharacter.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n                  john stennis--a lifetime of service\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I wish to pay honor today to one of the \ngreat Senators of this century, John Cornelius Stennis. His roots began \nat the turn of the century as a young farmboy, in the fertile soil of \nKemper County, MS. And while his subsequent career was to take him to \nfar away places, and to positions of great honor in our Nation's \nGovernment, his beloved home country was never far from his mind. \nSecond only to service to his Nation, his dedication to the State of \nMississippi was legendary.\n  He had amassed a distinguished record a public service, even before \ncoming to the Senate in 1947. A Phi Betta Kappa law school graduate, he \nserved as a State Representative, district attorney, and State circuit \ncourt judge. But it was here in the Senate where we shall best remember \nhim. For more than 42 years, this Nation had the benefit of his wisdom \nand his guidance. He was the epitome of a Southern gentleman, and \nfairness and integrity were constants in his conduct. It was no mere \nhappenstance that he was our first chairman of the Select Committee on \nStandards and Conduct. He was for decades the foremost guardian of our \nNation's defense, forcefully and relentlessly pursuing strong defense \nprograms throughout the Cold War years. His credentials as ``Mr. \nDefense'' made even more remarkable his misgivings and warnings to the \nNation on involvement in combat in Vietnam, and he was a major author \nof our first war powers legislation. Chairman of Armed Services, \nchairman of Appropriations, President Pro Tem--his achievements here on \nthis floor and in this body have been equaled by few.\n  And who among us who knew him will ever forget his quiet courage? He \nquietly brushed aside the impacts of being shot and robbed while \nwalking home. Years later, after loosing a leg to cancer, he refused to \nyield to adversity--always rising to address this body, exuding dignity \nand determination with every action.\n  John Stennis was a patriot--a statesman--a Senator in the finest \ntraditions of the word. He was one of the great lions of our assembly, \nand we will miss him. I read today where he once responded to a \nquestion about how he would like to be remembered. He said he hoped \nthat one could say of him that ``He did his best.'' Well, that he did. \nAnd his best will serve as a reminder and a standard to all of us, for \ngenerations to come.\n  Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Georgia has touched on \nit when he said I wish to hoe a straight furrow right down the field, \nthat was John Stennis. I can hear him now. He had those sayings about \nnot swelling but growing in experience. The reverence and respect at \nthat particular time was for Senators listening and learning and \nprofiting from experience. Now the pledge is when you come to town you \nare not going to listen to anybody; you have a contract. You are going \nto vote for it. And by the way, do not give me any of your experience \nbecause in 6 years I am gone. It is an entirely different atmosphere.\n  And when you see, as the Senator from Georgia has said in such \neloquent terms, one of the finest, I am just deeply moved.\n  John Stennis and I became very close amid serving on committees \ntogether, particularly the Appropriations Committee later on.\n  But his family--the Peden clan--was from Fountain Inn, SC, where Mr. \nQuillen was born and other persons of eminence.\n  Invariably he would come back to South Carolina for the annual Peden \nclan reunion.\n  I figured, like the Senator from Georgia, that he was my sort of \npatron and leader. I listened to him many a time. I can tell you this. \nJohn Stennis was a man of this institution. We have Senator Byrd, who \nreally reveres the Senate as an institution. John Stennis revered the \nU.S. Senate as an institution.\n  And as much as we liked each other and as close friends as we were, \nwhen I was chairman of the Budget Committee, he followed it very, very \nclosely. When I was chairman back in 1980, he would say, ``Fritz, \nyou're right. We have to somehow pay our bills. We are eating our seed \ncorn.'' He would make a little talk on the floor, not only with respect \nto military affairs, with tremendous authority, but with respect to \nfiscal matters.\n  And later on, when I was not the chairman of the committee, but I \ntalked to him and tried to get a vote with respect to that budget, he \nwould say, ``I'm sticking with the chairman. I know how you feel about \nthis, but we have got to stay with the chairman.''\n  I can hear him now. He was an institution man. And that says a lot \nfor the stability of the body and the courtesy here and the ethics that \nwe have. He set the highest standard of anybody I have ever known.\n  I will never forget the afternoon he was shot. Invariably, we would \nget together down at the gym there at this time, 6:30 going on 7 \no'clock, and get a workout. He said, ``You've got to try to keep up \nwith Strom.'' That is my senior Senator. He said, ``You will find if \nyou stay in good physical shape, you will be able to keep up with \nStrom.''\n  We would work out. They had this wheel that you get down on your \nknees and you go forward and pull it backward and forward, and \neverything else. \n[[Page S5663]] He was on that wheel the afternoon he was shot. He left, \nif I remember correctly, about 6:15 and he was shot about 6:30 or 6:45.\n  He later related, when I went to see him, he said:\n\n       You know, I'm lucky. These fellows told me they wanted \n     money and I did not have any money. And I said, ``Take my \n     watch, anything else, my ring.''\n\n  And they cursed him and just fired five shots into his middle, his \nstomach, pancreas, and lungs--his insides.\n  He walked up to his house and talked to Miss Coy, Mrs. Stennis, his \nwife. He said, ``Call an ambulance and call Walter Reed.''\n  The ambulance came. And as they lifted him up, he remembered well \nhearing the chief of police, who had reached the home at that time, \nsaying, ``All right, take him over to George Washington Hospital.'' He \nraised up on that stretcher--the last he ever remembered, he said, \nprior to coming to some 9 hours later--and said, ``Take me to Walter \nReed. They are waiting for me there.''\n  He said that was the real fortunate part, because when he got to \nWalter Reed, they had two Army surgeons who had finished a 2-week \nlecture course to the Army surgeons around the country on bullet wounds \nand shrapnel wounds and battlefield surgery and that kind of thing, \nparticularly with respect to the loss of blood.\n  His operation took 9 hours. I will never forget him saying that. He \nsaid, ``Had they not had that hard experience of when to stop and \nreplenish and when to move forward * * *'' They had to sew up all his \ninnards or he would have been long since gone.\n  He came back and, as Senator Nunn points out, he did not slow down at \nall. Later, when the cancer got his legs, he did not.\n  As Senator Cochran pointed out--who sits at the Stennis desk--he \nbelieved in this institution. He attended regularly all the sessions. \nHe attended these debates.\n  I think television has ruined us all. Perhaps some would listen back \nin their offices. But you do not have the open exchange in the most \ndeliberative body. You are here and get quips that staff gives you. \nThey have prepared remarks and they run out and the Record is full and \nit appears it is a deliberative effort. Not at all.\n  Senator Stennis did not like that, and he said so. He attended the \ndebates. He attended all the votes and he kept going until the very, \nvery end.\n  Unfortunately, he was not as conscious and alert as he could have \nbeen the last few years. I wanted to go to see him, but my staff who \nworked intimately with him on the Armed Services Committee and later on \non the Appropriations Committee, said that, ``Poor John would not \nrecognize you right now.''\n  So he has gone to his just reward after the most distinguished career \nin the U.S. Senate of over 41 years.\n  He was a Senator's Senator if there ever was one in this body. He was \nnot only, as pointed out, an outstanding authority on military affairs, \nbut he had that fundamental feel of paying the bills and being \nstraightforward in his treatment here with all the Senators and setting \nthe highest standard of ethical conduct that you could possibly \nimagine.\n  We need that inspiration today that, unfortunately, we do not have. \nWe are all going to miss him very, very badly.\n  I am sorry tomorrow I cannot be at the session relative to the \ncontinued debate on product liability. I want to attend those services. \nBut we will be back here at 4:45.\n  But it is good that we have those who have served with him and \nremember him so well that will be there and be with his family. His \ndaughter retired first in Charleston, where her husband was the dean at \nthe College of Charleston and later up in Greenville, SC. So I am \nlooking forward to seeing that family.\n  But I will never forget the inspiration he has given for all of us \nwho have served with him to continue to serve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/25/senate-section/article/S5661-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5663]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. GORTON.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nrestructure and replace the income tax system of the United States to \nmeet national priorities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                              usa tax act\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.\n   Mr. President, today for Senator Nunn and myself, this is a very \nexciting day because--after more than 2 years of study, research, and \ntremendous help from a lot of people and a lot of experts--we are today \ngoing to introduce a totally new income tax law for this land, both as \nto individuals and corporations.\n\n  Today we are going to introduce a totally new Tax Code. We will \nexplain it to the Senate and the American people for the next 40 or 50 \nminutes. And it is our hope, since we have gone to extreme lengths to \ndevelop a totally new tax code in all respects --and indeed we will \ntoday introduce that totally new tax code--which will replace and get \nrid of the current income tax system in its totality both as to \ncorporations, businesses and individuals in the United States.\n  We are hopeful that this document will begin a serious debate and \nthat this approach, which we will explain today, will find its rightful \nplace very high on anyone's list as they look at the needs of the \nUnited States for the future.\n  Before I go to my prepared remarks, let me suggest that for the \nSenator from New Mexico these are very exciting times because I believe \nthe vision that most of us have is for a better America, for a better \nAmerica for our children, a more competitive America with more good \nsolid high-paying jobs for which we can train and educate our people \nand provide them with an opportunity for a satisfactory and happy life \nfrom the standpoint of material well-being.\n  The two things that haunt us in our efforts as leaders who say we are \ngoing to do our best to provide that for America are the enormous \namount of debt that we incur in our Federal budget processes because we \nrefuse to find a way to pay for the programs and actions of the Federal \nGovernment rather than to borrow for them. Thus we gobble up huge \namounts of savings of U.S. citizens and corporate savings just to pay \nthat debt, thus minimizing our future growth potential and increasing \ninterest rates dramatically, and in a very real way diminish the \nproductivity of our country.\n  The second thing is that we have a U.S. Tax Code that instead of \npromoting and prompting savings and investment is actually a \ndisincentive to both. Instead of saying to the American people and \nAmerican corporations we want you to invest more, we want you to save \nmore, we have a Tax Code that says just the opposite. If you do either \nof those things, you are penalized under the American Tax Code; that \nis, the savings or investment. If you spend your money, in a sense you \nonly pay taxes on that money which you spend once.\n  We very much hope in our new bill to create a level playing field \nfrom the date that it is adopted by the U.S. Congress forward, a level \nfield in that people have a real choice as between investing and saving \nsome of their disposable income and spending it. And as to American \ncorporations, we hope we will greatly simplify the process by which \nthey pay taxes to their country and at the same time dramatically \nencourage capital investment as compared with a Tax Code today which \npenalizes that.\n  So in order to get where we want to go, you have to know how to get \nthere. This is common sense. The advice for a traveler seeking a \ndestination and for a nation that is in quest of its destiny, and when \nleaders talk about their vision for the future, they invariably speak \nof creating a higher standard of living, better-paying jobs, and \nstronger economic growth. We do not do that or say that just because \nthose are nice sounding words, but because they are indeed at the heart \nand soul of what America ought to offer to its people when we say this \nis a land of opportunity. We know where we want to go. But how do we \nget there?\n  The challenge facing the American economy, and those who work, those \nwho invest, those who start companies, and those who continue companies \nin a prosperous way, the challenge facing them and the best way to \nimprove the Nation's prosperity, in almost everyone's opinion, is to \nincrease savings and investment.\n  When Americans save, they are really investing in America, and our \nTax Code should reflect that national priority. Our major trading \npartners encourage in their tax codes savings, and so should we. There \nare many causes of inadequate private savings and investment, and I \nhave already indicated that our inability to develop a budget year by \nyear and over decades, whereby we pay for what we give our citizens \ninstead of borrowing to give to them, is one very serious way that we \ndo not save, or use our savings to pay for our profligacy.\n  The other very serious problem and perhaps most important is the \ndisincentive in our Nation's tax policies. The Federal Income Tax Code \nis un-American in spirit and wrong in principle because it levies a \ndouble tax on dividends and taxes savings. It discourages risk taking, \nentrepreneurship, and \n[[Page S5665]] the creation of jobs. It is hostile to savings and \ninvestment and tilted toward consumption. It adds one-third to the cost \nof capital. It favors debt over equity financing. It encourages \ncorporate management to neglect long-term investment in favor of \nfocusing on short-term profits.\n  The way a country taxes its people deeply influences its potential \nfor economic growth and thus for prosperity.\n  Our current code penalizes savings by taxing income when it is earned \nand then taxing interest and dividends that are generated by the \ninitial investment. When an activity is penalized in the Tax Code, it \nstands to reason that it influences behavior. Taxpayers do less of \nthose disfavored activities, and the current code is doing a good job \nof discouraging savings. Americans are only saving 2.8 percent of GDP.\n  This lack of savings leads to a shortage of investment which in turn \nleads to insufficient growth, stagnating incomes, and the loss of high-\nwage jobs.\n  The Congressional Budget Director, Robert Reischauer, testified \nbefore the Senate Budget Committee earlier this year. The report \naccompanying his testimony cautioned, and I quote:\n\n       . . . the best way for the nation to prepare for [the] \n     future is to save and invest more now. Greater investment, \n     the main engine of growth, would enlarge the future economic \n     pie. . . Investment in turn, fundamentally depends upon the \n     available pool of saving, whether private (personal and \n     corporate) or Government (federal, state and local).\n\n  Our current Tax Code taxes capital gains far higher than our \ncompetitors. We have created a ``backdoor'' capital gains differential \nby raising the top personal income tax rate to 39.6 percent but keeping \nthe top rate on capital gains at 28. Thus, if we have any capital gains \ndifferential, it is that, and it is quite by accident and sort of a \nbackdoor.\n  The differential is subpar when compared to our competitors, be it \nMalaysia, South Korea, Taiwan, or Belgium. They do not tax capital \ngains at all. Germany does not tax capital gains on assets held longer \nthan 6 months. Canada, France, and Japan tax capital gains at rates \nfrom 16 to 20 percent.\n  Our current Tax Code is far too complex. The tax industry absorbs \nmore resources than the gross domestic product of a country like \nIreland. Companies complain about the IRS agents being permanently \nhoused in their corporate headquarters, and the IRS is years behind in \ntheir auditing. Others perversely brag about needing supercomputers to \ncalculate certain foreign tax computations.\n  As our Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart noted: ``Our economy is \n`tax relevant' in almost every detail.'' Taxes have become an \nincreasingly important factor in investment decisions as other barriers \nto international capital flows have disappeared.\n  The philosophy of the USA tax Senator Nunn and I introduce today is \nto tax income that is not saved or invested rather than to tax all \nincome that is earned.\n  The best way to achieve a prosperous destiny for our country is to \nimprove the Nation's productivity through sustained investment by the \nprivate sector. Job creation is especially dependent on new products \nentering new markets, and we all know this. This does not happen \nautomatically. It requires hard work and competition, and to a great \nextent investments that must be financed with equity capital.\n  Our tax proposal is a quest for the best tax system we can develop, \none that should vastly expand the pool of savings and achieve \nsignificant simplicity in the bargain. We estimate that of the 700 \nInternal Revenue Code sections, over 75 percent would disappear and be \neliminated with the adoption of our proposed code.\n  The USA tax base is total gross domestic product. The business tax \nand the individual tax are two parts of a single tax on a single tax \nbase. The business tax is intended to be the first in a two-step tax \ncollection process. The business tax would begin with gross domestic \nproduct--the sum of all goods and services produced and sold by all \nbusinesses together, minus, in order to avoid double taxation, those \nthings that they have bought from one another.\n  The first taxable event would take place when businesses create \nincome by producing and selling goods and services; the second taxable \nevent, when individuals receive income, net of the business tax, in the \nform of wages, salaries, interest, dividends, and similar distributions \nto the owners of business.\n  This is a new Tax Code. This is a totally new approach to taxing \nevents in our economic life. It is not a concept. It is a totally new \nTax Code built on two concepts and greatly simplifies what we have.\n  Now, at this point, while I have more to say, Senator Nunn and I have \nample time and I am going to yield to my friend from Georgia and first \nsay thanks to him for all the work he has done and for the people he \nhas brought into this fold who have helped us put this together.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Nunn], is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I think my friend from New Mexico has \nexplained very well the current Tax Code and all of its problems and \nwhat it is doing to Americans' competitive position in the world and, \nmost importantly, what it is doing to the real income of the American \npeople.\n  This bill that we are introducing today had its origin several years \nago when the two of us, on a bipartisan basis, one Democrat and one \nRepublican, had the privilege of chairing the CSIS Strengthening of \nAmerica Commission. The plan that our Commission released a little over \n2 years ago, and that Senator Domenici and I cochaired with a number of \nother people from around the country as key members of that panel, was \njust that. It was a plan to strengthen our Nation, to strengthen our \ncountry, to strengthen our people, to strengthen our economy, and to \nstrengthen our competitive position in the world.\n  That plan had three key elements. The first element was to get our \nfiscal house in order by embarking on a long-term plan to balance the \nbudget. And we proposed that plan without using the Social Security \nsurplus as we do today, without relying on any kind of dynamic scoring, \nwithout a constitutional amendment, and without a line-item veto. We \nproposed a plan that would lock in spending restraints first, before \nraising new revenues.\n  We have a long way to go to implement that plan. The Senator from New \nMexico and I have struggled in this Chamber for several years trying to \nget caps on entitlement programs, and I suspect he will be leading the \ncharge again this year as chairman of the Budget Committee.\n  The key to this part of our plan is controlling the growth of \nentitlement programs, as most of us who have studied it understand, but \nwhich neither Congress nor any administration, Democratic or \nRepublican, has been prepared to do.\n  The second element, which my friend from New Mexico and I are here to \ntalk about today, and a very important part of this overall plan, was \nto completely replace the individual and corporate income Tax Code of \nthis country and create in its place a tax code that promotes savings \nand investment, rather than discouraging savings and investment, as \ndoes our current Tax Code.\n  The third element of our plan was an investment strategy that called \nfor improved job training and apprenticeship programs to strengthen the \nworkplace; national service; selected investments in infrastructure, \nincluding the so-called information highway; adequate funding for \nprograms to help young children start school ready to learn, such as \nimmunizations and Head Start; and a system of national educational \nstandards. Some progress has already been made on many aspects of this \nthird element of the Strengthening of America plan, thanks to the \nleadership of President Clinton, who has worked very hard on these \nareas, both before and since he became President.\n  The Commission was not saying that Government alone can solve our \nNation's problems. In the final analysis, only the American people--\nworking through their Government, but more importantly working in their \nown communities--can strengthen America. These three elements, \nhowever--balancing the budget, reforming the Federal Tax Code, and \nmaking the needed investments in our future--represent the action items \nfor the federal government. Government cannot do it alone, but if \nGovernment does not do its part, we will never get our economic house \nin order.\n  [[Page S5666]] Even though the proposed constitutional balanced \nbudget amendment did not pass the Congress this year, I believe the \nCongress will still undertake a serious statutory effort this year to \nbegin to balance at least the unified Federal budget. I expect my \ncolleague from New Mexico will be one of the real leaders in that \neffort. While that is a laudable goal, and I have supported the \nconstitutional balanced budget amendment every time the Senate has \nvoted on it, I still believe, and our Commission concluded, that we \nneed to do more than that. We need to balance the budget excluding the \nSocial Security surplus.\n  The constitutional amendment we voted on earlier this year would have \ncontinued to use the Social Security surplus as an offset to the \noperating deficit in the rest of the budget, which means that this \nsurplus would continue to be used to pay current bills rather than to \nprepare to pay for the retirement of the baby boom generation. As my \ncolleague from Nebraska, Senator Kerrey, has made abundantly clear, we \nare facing--or rather, we are failing to face up to--a real crisis when \nthe Social Security trust fund begins to run annual deficits instead of \nsurpluses.\n  The two most difficult tasks the Commission identified as the keys to \nputting our Nation's fiscal house in order--balancing the budget and \nreforming the Federal Tax Code--are still awaiting action. Today my \ncolleague from New Mexico and I are introducing legislation that has \nbeen in the works for quite awhile. It has taken a good bit of time, \nmore than we originally anticipated, because this legislation would \nimplement the most revolutionary part of the Commission's plan, and \nthat is the complete replacement of the current individual and \ncorporate Federal income tax.\n\n\n                The Time Has Come for Fundamental Reform\n\n  The House of Representatives, as part of their Contract With America, \nhas already passed and sent to the Senate a bill that proposes to \nchange several components of the current Tax Code--additional child \ncare tax credits; expanded IRA proposals; increased depreciation of \ninvestments; and a lower tax rate on capital gains--without attempting \nfundamental reform of the Tax Code. This is an incremental, business-\nas-usual approach.\n  Senator Domenici and I, along with other people on the Strengthening \nCommission, concluded that tinkering with our Tax Code will not get the \njob done. Our fear is that incremental changes, however well \nintentioned, will complicate an already Byzantine Tax Code without \nyielding the increased savings and investment we all seek. Helping \nworking families is a worthy goal, but without steady economic growth \nthere is little that child care tax credits can do to help the middle \nclass permanently raise its standard of living. Unlocking old capital \nis important, but it is crucial that we also create new savings and \ninvestment.\n  My colleague from New Mexico and I believe there is a better way. \nToday, Senator Domenici and I are introducing, along with Senators \nKerrey and Bennett, the USA Tax Act of 1995, a comprehensive tax reform \nproposal that we believe represents the best way to accomplish \neverything the other reform proposals--both the incremental approach \nthe House has passed, as well as the other proposals to replace the \ncurrent income tax--are trying to accomplish, and much more. We welcome \ndebate, comments, suggestions, and constructive criticism on this \nlegislation.\n  Our tax system, Mr. President, needs more than a Band-Aid. It needs a \ntransplant. If we are serious about our Nation's future, we have to \nscrap the current tax system and put in its place a system that will \nwork for our people and for our country.\n  Over the past 2 years, Senator Domenici and I and others have been \nworking on the details of such a system, the USA Tax System that we are \nintroducing today. We call it the USA Tax System because USA stands for \nunlimited savings allowance, which is the key, fundamental part of this \nproposal. We believe it represents a fundamental change in the way \nAmerica taxes itself, the way America saves, and the way America \ninvests.\n  What do we mean by a tax system that works? We mean a system that \nencourages savings and investment. We mean a system that is perceived \nto be fair and is fair. We mean a system that is understandable. We \nmean a system that reduces the complexity of paying taxes for ordinary \nAmericans by taking less time, fewer forms, and fewer dollars to comply \nwith. We mean a system that is attuned to the international competitive \nrealities and gives U.S. companies and their employees a chance to \ncompete fairly in the global marketplace, which we do not have today.\n  We mean a tax system that is fiscally responsible. There is no point \nin creating a system that increases the private sector component of the \nnational savings with one hand, while further reducing the public \nsector component of national savings, by increasing the deficit, with \nthe other hand. We do not intend to increase the deficit under this \nproposal.\n  Our plan is intended to be revenue neutral. And I would say from the \noutset, if the official estimates indicate that this is not revenue \nneutral, one way or another that there will be adjustments made so that \nit will indeed be revenue neutral.\n  When Senator Domenici and I began advocating our concept of a \ncomplete overhaul of the Tax Code 3 years ago, the prospect of \nfundamental reform appeared to be several years off at best. Today, \nhowever, the clock has moved up. It is clear that, while we are just \nbeginning the process of debating how to change the Tax Code, there is \nalready a broad consensus in this country and in this Congress that \nfundamental reform is necessary.\n  In addition to our USA proposal, there are already two other \nproposals to completely replace the current income tax code being \ndiscussed--a flat tax and a national sales tax. In the coming months, \nall these proposals, and perhaps others as well, are likely to be \ndiscussed and examined. I am hopeful that as early as next year, \nCongress will attempt to enact one of these proposals. We welcome this \ndebate, and we are introducing this legislation today to make sure that \nour proposal is fully included in this important national debate.\n\n\n                        The Importance of Saving\n\n  Mr. President, we believe the central goal of any reform of our tax \nsystem should be to raise the level of national savings. We are \nproposing a tax system that we believe is smarter, and better for all \ntaxpayers, because it removes the current bias in our Tax Code against \nthe saving and investment that is the key to higher living standards. \nHigher savings, Mr. President, lead to more investment. More investment \nmeans that we have more productivity from American workers. The more \nproductivity we have from our workers, the more competitive we are in \nthe international arena. The more competitive we are in the \ninternational arena, the better jobs we have. The better jobs we have, \nthe higher income we have as Americans.\n  That is a very important chain. That is the bottom line. The bottom \nline, in other words, is what happens to the real income of the \nAmerican people in the future. There is a direct connection between how \nmuch we save and the real income of American people. That is the direct \nconnection that we have to make sure our country understands. If we \ncannot make that connection in the American mind, there is no point in \ntalking about a fundamental reform of the tax system. If they do agree \nthat this proposition is true, then I think there is a tremendous \nopportunity here to make the fundamental changes we are proposing.\n  There is a direct connection between savings and higher real income \nfor our people. That is the essence of our proposed USA Tax System.\n  The national savings rate in the United States is lower than that of \nany of our major competitors. In the 1980's, our savings rate dropped \nto an average of 3.6 percent, half the level of the 1960's and 1970's, \nand far below the comparable figures of 10 percent in Germany and 18 \npercent in Japan. In the first 5 years of this decade, 1990 to 1994, \nthe U.S. savings rate has fallen almost 50 percent from the already low \nlevels of the 1980's, to just 2.1 percent.\n  Without increased savings and investment, we cannot raise our long-\nterm standard of living, meet our financial obligations, and build a \nbetter \n[[Page S5667]] society for today and for the generations that follow. \nThe United States cannot continue to be the major competitive force in \nthe world if other countries continue outsaving us and outinvesting us. \nIt simply cannot happen over a long period of time. That is \nfundamental.\n  It is often said that the best way to increase national saving is to \nreduce the Federal budget deficit. I agree with that proposition. The \nStrengthening of America Commission concluded we needed to do just \nthat, but that we needed to do more. We not only need to reduce the \nshare of our national savings being soaked up by the Federal budget \ndeficit--we also need more savings. And we believe our proposal can \nturn the Tax Code from a major roadblock to higher savings into an \nimportant tool to promote higher savings.\n  I do not believe anybody could argue that the Tax Code is not used to \nencourage socially desirable behavior. Would anybody argue that the \ndeductions for home mortgage interest and charitable contributions that \nhave been in the Tax Code for decades do not encourage home ownership \nand donations to charities? Yet the current Tax Code not only fails to \nencourage private saving, which is vital to our future, it actually \ndiscourages it. Yet there is no doubt that future generations will not \nhave the same level of entitlement benefits from the Government that we \nhave today. Our present entitlement programs are not sustainable at \ntheir current growth rates. That means that Americans are going to have \nto save more, to take more personal responsibility for their own \nfutures.\n  That is why our Strengthening of America report contained a plan to \nboth balance the budget by reforming entitlement programs and to reform \nthe Tax Code to promote greater personal savings. We need to get the \nTax Code working for us, not against us, to get people to once again \nadopt the mentality of savers who think about tomorrow as well as \ntoday. We need to start an education process in this country to make \nsaving a national issue--not just a tax issue. People need to \nunderstand the fundamental importance of saving, both for their own \nfuture and for America's future. We literally and figuratively must \nsave America.\n  The heart of our proposal, Mr. President, is the unlimited savings \nallowance, or USA. That is why we call it the USA Tax System. In \nessence, it allows individuals a deduction for the portion of income \nthey save, and allows businesses to expense their new investments when \nthey make them rather than depreciating them over a long period of \ntime. If Americans want to consume more, both now and in the future, \nthen America must save more and invest more. These new deductions for \nsavings and investment will provide the impetus for higher economic \ngrowth, higher productivity, higher paying jobs, and a higher living \nstandard for all of us. I think a higher living standard for all \nAmericans is the ultimate test of fairness.\n\n\n            The USA Tax System is a Single Tax in Two Parts\n\n  The USA proposal consists of a single, integrated tax in two parts: a \nprogressive tax on individual incomes, and a low, flat rate tax on all \nbusinesses. These two parts are meant to work together. It is important \nthat people not try to consider the two parts separately, because if \nthey do they will not grasp the significance of the whole concept. It \nis a single tax levied in two places: at the business level where \nwealth is created and at the individual level where wealth is received.\n  This proposal allows an unlimited deduction at the business level for \ncapital investment and, more important, it permits all citizens an \nunlimited deduction for the amount of their annual income they save and \ninvest. The USA Tax System directly and systematically addresses our \nsaving and investment problem.\n  To the individual, our system says, ``If you choose to defer some of \nyour consumption in favor of saving income for your future and the \nfuture of your children, the Tax Code will not penalize you for doing \nso.''\n  And to the business enterprise, whether very small or very large, \nmanufacturing, service, or agricultural, the USA Tax System says, ``If \nyou choose to invest your profits in a new machine or a new process \nthat will help you grow and put more people to work, the Tax Code will \nhelp you.'' The USA Tax System, by its very nature, would align the way \nwe tax with our common desire to provide our children with a better \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I will not go into detail on the individual and \nbusiness component.\n  But there are other parts of the proposal that I think need some \nemphasis this morning.\n\n\n                           The Individual Tax\n\n  Let me describe the key features of the individual part of our \nproposal first. The individual tax would function in a manner similar \nto that of the current income tax. From your gross income, you would \nmake subtractions before you figure your tax, just as you do now. You \nwould subtract personal exemptions, a new family living allowance, a \nnew savings allowance, and a limited number of itemized deductions. \nGross income would include wages, salaries, interest, dividends, \nearnings withdrawn from unincorporated businesses, proceeds from asset \nsales--basically the same concept of income we have today.\n  First, the USA proposal contains a family living allowance that is \nsimilar to the current standard deduction except that it is in addition \nto any itemized deductions, not an alternative to itemized deductions. \nThis family living allowance exempts the first dollars spent on \nconsumption from taxation, because we know that people in low income \nbrackets spend a higher proportion of their incomes on necessities than \npeople in high income brackets.\n  In addition to the family living allowance, you would have personal \nexemptions just as you do under current law. A family of four filing a \njoint return would have its first $17,600 of income exempt from \ntaxation by adding this family living allowance to its four personal \nexemptions.\n\n\n                    The Unlimited Savings Allowance\n\n  In addition to these deductions, there would be a new deduction for \nthe amount of income that is saved called the unlimited savings \nallowance. We define savings in this proposal as net new savings. That \nis key. If you add to the national savings pool, you would deduct that \nmoney before you pay taxes. In other words, to make it simple, if \nsomeone makes $40,000 a year and saves $5,000, they would pay taxes on \n$35,000, instead of today paying taxes before the savings on the entire \n$40,000. That is fundamental. We encourage people to save.\n  The unlimited savings allowance is similar to the IRA concept, but it \nis unlimited. It is not limited to $2,000 or any other dollar amount. \nIt is not limited to saving for retirement. But it is for net new \nsavings. We do not give a deduction for merely shifting savings around. \nThat has always been one of the problems with the IRA.\n  The unlimited savings allowance is fundamentally different from the \ncurrent Tax Code, which penalizes savings. Under the present Tax Code, \nsavings are taxed twice, once when you earn the income that you save, \nand again when you receive a return on those savings; consumption is \ntaxed only once.\n  The USA Tax System also reflects a fundamentally different philosophy \nin that we do not focus on where your income came from. We do not have \ndifferent rates for wage income or dividends or capital gains. Under \nthe USA Tax System, the point is not where the income comes from, it is \nwhat you do with it. The portion of your income you save, whether you \nare rich or poor, you do not pay tax on. The portion you spend, above \nthe level for basic necessities, is subject to tax at progressive \nrates.\n  The deduction for individual saving also permits a new perspective \ntoward designing a business tax. Because our proposal defers taxes on \nindividual saving until they are spent, we can eliminate enormous \ncomplexities in today's Tax Code. There is no reason to be concerned \nabout people sheltering their savings in corporations, which creates a \nhuge portion of the complexity in today's Tax Code. We do not need \nelaborate rules to force businesses to distribute sheltered saving.\n  I am sure some people say that there is no proof that savings will \nrespond to changes in the Tax Code, so how do we know your proposal \nwill work? In response to that, I would say that first, you could just \nas easily argue is no \n[[Page S5668]] proof regarding any proposition of economics. Economics \nhappens in the real world, with complex interactions that will never be \nexactly repeated, not in a lab.\n  Second, it misses the point to compare the USA proposal to the \nexperience we had with individual retirement accounts in the early \n1980's. With the IRA, you did not have to save more to get a deduction, \nyou merely had to move your savings into an IRA. Since the Government \nwas handing out tax deductions for moving savings from your right \npocket to your left pocket, is it not surprising that those IRA \nprovisions did not increase national savings.\n  But there is a crucial difference between the unlimited savings \nallowance that Senator Domenici and I are proposing and the IRA's of \nthe 1980's. Our proposal rewards true increases in savings and does not \nreward shifting assets from one type of account to another.\n  Finally, I would say that a perfect world Tax Code would not affect \npeople's economic decisions at all. But we all know we do not live in \nsuch a perfect world, and it is unlikely we ever will. We all know \npeople do things sometimes that do not make a lot of sense, just to \nlower their taxes. To say that people do not respond to economic \nincentives simply flies in the face of everything we know about \neconomics and human nature. What the Senator from New Mexico and I are \nsaying is, recognizing that it is human nature to respond to incentives \nlike tax deductions, let us give people an incentive to do the right \nthing, for our country and our economy, not the wrong thing.\n\n\n                    Other Deductions for Individuals\n\n  In addition to the family living allowance, the personal exemptions \nand the savings allowance, we propose a limited number of additional \nitemized deductions. The higher the number of deductions, as we all \nknow, the higher the marginal tax rates would have to be. So, there is \na trade-off. We are proposing to retain a deduction for home mortgage \ninterest and charitable deductions. We could have more deductions, of \ncourse, and certainly we welcome debate on which deductions people \nthink should be added to, or subtracted from, our proposal--with one \nword of caution. The higher the number of deductions, the higher the \nrates will have to be to avoid increasing the deficit. There is a \ndirect tradeoff between the number of deductions and the tax rate.\n  Our proposal does have one such additional deduction which I feel \nvery strongly about, and that is a deduction for tuition expenses for \npost-secondary education, whether it is college, trade or vocational \nschool, or remedial education. We feel it is important that the tax \nsystem provide a deduction for investment in human capital that \nparallels the deductions on the business side for investments in \nphysical capital, since both investments raise the productivity and \nreal incomes of workers.\n\n\n                   The USA Tax System is Progressive\n\n  The USA Tax System is a progressive tax. Our system will have three \ngraduated rates. We are proposing a progressive system, not a flat tax. \nWe do not believe it is necessary to abandon the principles of fairness \nand progressive taxation in order to get a simpler, more efficient, \ngrowth-oriented tax code. It is important to keep in mind that the \ngraduated rates in the USA Tax System will not create the same \ndisincentives on saving and growth as today's tax system, since taxes \nwill be deferred on income that is saved and invested.\n  There are four main elements that make the USA tax on individuals \nprogressive. First, we have progressive rates. Second, we have a family \nliving allowance that does not tax the first several thousand dollars \nof consumption for basic necessities. Third, we retain some progressive \nelements of the current code, such as an earned income tax credit--\nwhich we increase--and the tax exempt status of food stamps and other \nsafety-net benefits. Finally, we have a new payroll tax credit which I \nwill discuss in a moment.\n  We would apply progressive tax rates to the amount of income that is \nconsumed, after subtracting the family living allowance, personal \nexemptions, and deductions for mortgage interest, charitable \ncontributions, and education expenses.\n  The tax rates in the USA system are not directly comparable to the \nrates in the current income Tax Code, however. I know people are going \nto find that a little hard to understand at first, but the reason why \nthey are not comparable is very important, and that is our payroll tax \ncredit.\n\n\n                         The Payroll Tax Credit\n\n  Under the USA system, after you determine the amount of tax resulting \nfrom applying graduated rates to your taxable income, as I have just \ndescribed, you would subtract from that income tax the amount withheld \nfrom your salary for the employee share of your Social Security \npayroll, or FICA, tax. We think that is a very important feature of the \nUSA system that would reduce the regressive nature of the present \npayroll tax. The payroll tax, which is absolutely essential to fund \nSocial Security, to fund Medicare, also has become the most regressive \npart of our Tax Code--the most regressive part of our Tax Code. It does \nnot apply except to the first $60,000 of earnings. Higher income people \ndo not pay it above that except a limited portion on Medicare. But low-\nincome people, medium-income people, are paying a very large percentage \nof their overall taxes on FICA tax.\n  In fact, there are literally millions of Americans today that pay \nmore FICA tax than they do income tax.\n  Our payroll tax credit would be refundable so that if you had more \nwithheld in payroll taxes than you owed in taxes, as is the case for \nmany people, the difference would be refunded to you. Therefore, people \nwith earned income can, in effect, subtract 7.65 percent, the amount of \npay withheld for the employee's share of the Social Security and \nMedicare payroll taxes, from our tax rates.\n  It is very important for people to understand this. When you see a 20 \npercent tax rate or 19 percent or 27 percent tax rate under the USA \nproposal, the 7.65 percent credit has to be subtracted to get the real \ntax rate--a 20 percent rate under the USA system is, in effect, equal \nto a marginal rate of 12.35 percent under today's system after you take \nthe payroll tax credit.\n  The payroll tax is a perfect example of why fundamental tax reform is \nneeded. As my colleague from New York, the ranking member of the \nFinance Committee, Senator Moynihan, has so frequently and eloquently \npointed out, the payroll tax is a very regressive tax. It discourages \nhiring additional workers, especially lower wage workers. Nobody \ndesigned the system that way, of course.\n  The payroll tax started out at a low rate, but that rate has grown \nconsiderably over the years. In the late 1960's and early 1970's, the \npayroll tax working people paid grew considerably to finance large cost \nof living increases for retirees that were enacted in years of high \ninflation. It was increased again in the 1980's, ostensibly to build up \na surplus for the retirement of the baby boomers. Unfortunately, as \nSenator Moynihan has also pointed out, that is not what the surpluses \nare actually being used for.\n  So we now find ourselves with a combined employer-employee payroll \ntax rate of 15.3 percent a very high rate that adds significantly to \nthe cost of labor. The system was set up for one purpose--to provide \nincome security in retirement--but it is actually hurting working \npeople in ways that I am sure were never intended by the authors.\n  Mr. President, our proposal does not abolish the payroll tax. It does \nnot affect the operation of the Social Security system in any way. What \nit does do is to offset the unintended negative effects of the payroll \ntax by crediting the payroll tax against an individual's or business's \ntax liability under the USA tax. The employer would also get the 7.65 \npercent credit against their taxes --not a deduction, but a tax credit. \nEmployees get a credit for the FICA taxes against the individual income \ntax, and employers get a credit for the employer share against the \nbusiness tax.\n  So the same amount of revenue will continue to be deposited in the \nSocial Security trust fund. We do not affect that, but the payroll tax \nwill be integrated into the income tax in a way that offsets its \nregressive nature. This is important for fairness purposes. It is also \nimportant so that we eliminate one of the major impediments to people \nwith low skills being hired. Now \n[[Page S5669]] people with low skills, minimum-wage-type jobs, the \nemployer has to look very, very carefully before they hire because they \nare not only paying for the minimum wage, or whatever the wage is, they \nare also paying another, in effect, 15.3 percent because of these very \nhigh payroll taxes that continue to go up.\n\n\n                            The Business Tax\n\n  Mr. President, I will take just a moment on the business side of the \nTax Code because I know that Senator Kerrey from Nebraska, who has been \nvery involved in this concept for a long time and has been a major help \nto us, is on the floor and would like to speak. Let me make a few \ncomments about the business tax.\n  The second component of our new tax code is the business tax. The \nbusiness tax would work like this: Under the USA Tax System the \nbusiness would add up its sales receipts during the year, then add up \nthe cost of the goods and services it purchased for use in its \nbusiness. The cost of these business purchases would be subtracted from \nthe sales receipts. The difference would be subject to a business tax \nat a flat rate of 11 percent.\n  I am sure many people will ask, ``Why is the business rate so much \nlower than current law?'' The answer is that the two rates are really \nnot comparable, because our tax would not be applied to corporate \nincome as currently defined, but rather to a company's gross profits. \nIt is a fundamentally different concept from what we have today, and it \napplies to all businesses, not just those that are incorporated. I \nthink everyone who studies this business tax needs to understand we \nhave a fundamentally broader base for the business tax so we are \ndramatically lowering the rate but we are producing the same amount of \nrevenue. We are not lowering the overall proportion that businesses are \npaying. They are paying the same proportion. But we are able to lower \nthe rate because we are greatly broadening the base, and that needs to \nbe understood.\n  It is important also to understand that under the USA Tax System, the \ncost of investment in plant and equipment and inventory would be fully \ndeductible when spent. There would be no need for depreciation \nschedules. Investment would be deducted up front. Investment creates \njobs. New plant and equipment creates productivity opportunities and \nthat increases the income of our people. So that is the behavior we \nshould be encouraging rather than discouraging.\n  Investment in plant and equipment is what we need in this country, \nand yet the amortization of these investments over a long period of \ntime under current law discourages businesses from investing as much as \nthey would otherwise.\n\n\n               The USA Tax Promotes U.S. Competitiveness\n\n  Another very important feature is that our USA Tax System puts U.S. \ncompanies on the same footing with our competitors. The USA business \ntax is territorial--meaning it applies to all sales on U.S. soil no \nmatter where the business is headquartered--and it is border \nadjustable.\n  We want to encourage exports, and we do in this proposal. We exclude \nthe proceeds from export sales from taxation by rebating the tax on \ngoods exported for sale abroad. And when a company, foreign or U.S. \nowned, manufactures abroad and sells to the United States market, the \ncompany is, through the operations of a new import tax, taxed \nessentially the same as if the factory were located in the United \nStates. That is border adjustability, the tax is rebated on exports and \nadded to imports, which is exactly the situation American exporters to \nEurope and Japan face today. We believe our business tax will place \nAmerican companies and workers on an equal and level playing field.\n  This is no small matter, Mr. President. The share of our economic \noutput that is exported, and the share of our national income that we \nspend on imports, have both doubled over the past 25 years. Yet the \ncurrent U.S. Tax Code has not kept pace with the rapidly changing face \nof international competition. While our economy has shifted \ndramatically since this Tax Code was put into effect, our we have not \nmade a comparable shift in our Tax Code. We have simply tinkered with \nit year in and year out.\n  Our tax system is a holdover from another era, when international \ntrade was a small component of our economy, when having a tax rule that \napplied to all American corporations equally was enough. But today \nAmerican companies do not just compete with each other, they compete \nglobally. And the U.S. Tax Code puts our companies at a disadvantage.\n  Under the rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or \nGATT, certain types of taxes can be levied on imports and rebated on \nexports--border adjustability--while other types of taxes cannot. Our \ncompetitors in Europe and Japan have business taxes that can be rebated \nunder GATT, while we do not. We believe the USA business tax is legal \nunder the GATT, since it would work essentially the same way as \nEuropean and Japanese value-added taxes, which are GATT-legal.\n  Let me give a simple example of how our business tax applies to \nexports and imports. If a company has $2.5 million in sales, of which \n$500,000 are export sales, for purposes of the business tax its \nreceipts would be only the $2 million it had in domestic sales, not \n$2.5 million. But it will not have to go through a lot of complicated \ncalculations to allocate its production costs between its domestic and \nforeign sales. All domestic input costs will be deductible regardless \nof whether the sales are domestic or export sales. Under our proposal \nthere will no longer be a tax incentive to move production overseas.\n  Conversely, if the facilities used for the production of the $2 \nmillion in domestic sales are moved overseas and the $2 million of \ngoods are imported into the United States, an 11 percent import tax of \n$220,000 will be collected on those goods.\n  In order to comply with the requirements of the GATT, businesses \nwould not deduct wages. This is a key point, and I know there will be \nconcern about this. But there are two important things to remember. \nFirst, our rates are much lower--11 percent --than the rates currently \nimposed on corporate profits.\n  The second thing that we need to remember is that under our proposal, \nthe deduction for wages would be replaced by the credit for the \nemployer's share of the Social Security payroll tax--which is 7.65 \npercent of its payroll--which is the other half of the credit that \nemployees get under the individual tax that I have already described. \nBusinesses would get a credit back on that tax up to the maximum Social \nSecurity wage.\n\n\n        The USA Tax Is Designed to Be Deficit-Neutral\n\n  Under our proposal, the individual and the corporate shares of our \ntotal revenue would remain the same. We are not trying to shift the tax \nburden from businesses to individuals, or vice versa. We are not trying \nto shift the burden from the rich to the poor, or from the poor to the \nrich. We are not looking for the fellow behind the tree to tax. We are \ndesigning this system to produce the same amount of revenue as the \ncurrent Tax Code. It is not a proposal to cut taxes or raise taxes.\n  Because of the comprehensive nature of our proposal, and the enormous \nworkload the Joint Committee on Taxation has had this year, they were \nnot able to perform an official revenue analysis or a distributional \nanalysis of this proposal before we introduced it. It is our intention \nthat this system retain the progressivity of the current system, and \nthat it be revenue neutral compared to the current system. Should the \nofficial estimates indicate that the bill we have introduced fails to \ncompletely meet either of those goals, we intend to work with the Joint \nCommittee to refine this proposal so that we meet both, because we \nthink they are very important.\n\n\n               The USA Tax Is Simpler and More Efficient\n\n  The USA Tax System also makes great strides in making our Tax Code \nsimpler and more economically efficient. The USA tax eliminates the \nneed to calculate depreciation year after year, because investments are \nexpensed immediately. We also eliminate the complicated, and in many \ncases counterproductive, alternative minimum tax, or AMT.\n  The USA business tax puts debt and equity financing on an equal \nfooting. We treat all forms of businesses the same--corporations, \npartnerships, and proprietorships.\n  [[Page S5670]] One of the greatest contributions the USA system will \nmake to simplification is that no longer will people have any reason to \nseek out unproductive, economically wasteful tax shelters in order to \ncut their taxes. If you want to lower your taxes, put your money in \nsavings where it can work for all of us--buy a CD, invest in a mutual \nfund. It might take a few minutes to do your net savings calculation \nonce a year, but the net savings calculation should result more \nefficient use of our national income, as well as higher economic growth \nas saving and investment increase.\n  In an economy with a gross domestic product of over $6 trillion, \ntaxation will never be a completely simple affair. But because the USA \nTax System eliminates the need for rules against sheltering income in \ncorporations, and because it is based on cash rather than accrual \naccounting, it promises major advances in simplicity and clarity.\n  Under the USA system, we believe whole volumes of Tax Code \ncomplications would fall away into welcome oblivion. The tax shelter \nindustry would shrink and compliance costs would plummet. All income \nwould be treated alike. The key is what they would do with their \nincome. If it is reinvested, then the taxation on it would be deferred. \nIt is not reinvested, if it is consumed, then ordinary tax rates would \napply. Those rules would be the same for everyone; for the factory \nworker and for the investor.\n  There would be no more need for fights over capital gains, investment \ntax credits, individual retirement accounts, and other targeted \nincentives for saving. The USA Tax System eliminates these issues \nbecause it offers a blanket deduction for personal saving and business \ninvestment.\n  And under the USA system, taxpayers will not have to keep track of \nthe basis of their newly purchased savings assets such as stocks and \nmutual funds, the way they do now, and most taxpayers will not have to \nworry about the basis of savings assets they already hold. Finally, the \nUSA tax system will not take a whole new bureaucracy to administer.\n\n\n             The USA Tax System is a Revolutionary Concept\n\n  In a way, the USA Tax System could be described as simply taking the \ncurrent tax system and adding a deduction for savings. That may be the \nmajor change most people would notice. But the USA Tax System \nrepresents a much more profound change in its effects than in its form.\n  For any given level of income, those who save and invest more will \npay lower taxes. The taxpayers in the top bracket would pay roughly the \nsame total amount of taxes they do now. But within that bracket, there \nwill be those who pay less and those who pay more. The same will hold \ntrue whether you are in a higher or a lower tax bracket. That is the \nessence of our proposal. Those who help our economy, help create jobs, \nand boost productivity by saving and investing, will pay less than \ntheir neighbors with similar incomes who do not.\n  We are basically going to tax people on what they take out of the \neconomy--above a tax free level for necessities--rather than what they \nput into the economy by working and saving. Our proposal represents a \nrevolution in the philosophy of the income tax system. But we do not \nhave to make major changes to the system already in place to administer \nthe tax system to make our proposal work.\n  By contrast, a consumption or expenditure tax, such as a value-added \ntax, would impose enormous administrative expenses on American \nbusinesses, without the progressivity, and without creating the same \nincentive to save and invest, that the USA Tax System has.\n  The distinguished economist and former chairman of the Council of \nEconomic Advisers, Murray Weidenbaum, very clearly summarized the \nbenefits of moving to a tax system that, in his words ``puts the fiscal \nburden on what people take from society--the goods and services they \nconsume--rather than on what they contribute by working and saving.''\n  Professor Weidenbaum argues that we need a Tax Code that promotes \nsaving because saving is the seed corn for economic expansion. The \nmoney you save does not just sit there, it works for all of us by being \ninvested. Increased savings and investment generates more production of \ngoods and services, more employment, and a higher living standard for \nall of us.\n   A tax system that exempts saving raises the same amount of revenue \nas the existing tax system, with far less damage to the economy. We get \na faster growing economy with more people working, fewer people needing \npublic assistance, and the increased revenues that come from a growing \ntax base instead of from raising tax rates.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  Mr. President, this is a revolutionary concept. The advantages are, I \nthink, very, very important to our country.\n  The first advantage: This proposal will increase national savings by \neliminating the bias in the current Tax Code against savings, without \nincreasing the budget deficit. Increasing the pool of private savings \nwill in turn allow increased investment at lower cost, which will \nincrease the productivity of our workers.\n  Second, it will level the international playing field for U.S. \ncompanies, and promote U.S. exports of domestically produced goods, by \nrebating the business tax on goods sold for export, and it will \nequalize the tax treatment of American-made and imported goods by \nhaving foreign companies pay their fair share of taxes, just as \nAmerican exports are taxed when they are sold in foreign markets.\n  Third, it will make our Tax Code more understandable and more \nefficient which will save, I believe, both millions of dollars and \nmillions of hours preparing individual and business tax returns, and it \nwill do so without sacrificing the principle of fairness in allocating \nthe tax burden.\n  Fourth, the USA tax credit for the employer share of payroll taxes \nwill help create jobs for workers who might not otherwise be hired by \nreducing the current disincentive to hire low-skill workers that \nresults from the regressive payroll tax which applies to the entire \nwage of lower paid workers but to only part of the wage of higher paid \nworkers.\n  Finally, we believe it will foster greater personal responsibility by \nclearly showing the costs and benefits of saving versus consuming.\n  Today, Mr. President, every family in America, if they are saving \nmoney for a washing machine, an automobile, or a college education, has \nto pay taxes before they save. We would give the people in the lower \nand middle-income brackets who need to save, but who think they cannot \nafford to save--and who do not have any incentive to save under the \ncurrent Tax Code, because any money they do save out of their after-tax \nincome is taxed again when it earns interest or dividends--we would \ngive them a way to save. I believe our proposal will help all American \nfamilies save, and that as a result, all of us will be better off.\n  The current tax system is broken and, in my opinion, it cannot be \nfixed. In a very real way, it has aided and abetted our irresponsible \ntendency to live beyond our means. Our current Tax Code must be \nabolished and replaced.\n  We must being anew. The USA Tax System provides a way to eliminate \nthe cynical complexities, the special subsidies, the crippling biases \npresent in the current Code. By enacting real reform of the tax system, \nthis Congress can take a giant step toward securing our future.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico. Without his \nleadership there would have been no Strengthening America Commission, \nthere would have been no tax proposal today. He has been a key player \nin this from the very beginning. He is a pleasure to work with. I look \nforward to working with him on this proposal, as well as on his \nimportant responsibilities on the other side of our national economic \nchallenge, and that is getting our deficit under control, which also \ndirectly drains our savings.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, it is awfully difficult to estimate the \neconomic impact of tax law. I must say, it is a lot easier for us to \nestimate the political impact of tax laws because we hear from a whole \nrange of interest groups constantly that are concerned about preserving \nsome deduction or perhaps expanding some deduction. So it is genuinely \ndifficult to estimate what the economic impact is going to be, \n[[Page S5671]] though it is easy to estimate what the political impact \nis going to be, of various changes in the law.\n  What is not difficult with this particular piece of legislation is to \nestimate what the impact is going to be upon American families who \ndesire to save and on American businesses who are willing to make job-\ncreating investments.\n  Mr. President, this piece of legislation, though I am quite certain \nthere will be critics who will point out defects in it--indeed, there \nmay be plenty of room for improvement of this legislation--there is no \nquestion that this tax law change is allowed, in my judgment, by the \nrather dramatic change in the political situation last November, which \nhas permitted us, the Congress, to begin to consider things that had \npreviously been off limits. There is no question, in my judgment, that \nthis piece of legislation would have the impact of simultaneously \nallowing American families to save more by providing a powerful \nincentive for them to save, and it would enable American businesses to \nmake job-creating investments by enabling them to expense off the cost \nof those investments.\n  Let me say, Mr. President, as a part of this debate, that I am \ncontinuing to be one of the diminishing numbers of the Senate that is a \nMember of the Democratic Party and should assert that as a Member of \nthe Democratic Party, I do believe that labor is superior to capital. \nBy that, I mean you must have people who are willing to work before the \ncapital is worth anything; capital without labor is worthless. So I \nbelieve in the superiority of labor, and I believe in the training of \nlabor, and I believe in universal education and the preparation of \npeople so that they have the skills needed to compete, so they have the \nskills needed to earn the living that they desire.\n  But I do not believe in declaring war on capital, nor do I believe in \ndeclaring war on the wealthy. Indeed, it seems to me that the heart of \nthe Democratic message ought to be that equal opportunity means \nproviding every single American, regardless of their status in life, an \nopportunity to become wealthy in this country.\n  Unfortunately and regrettably, Mr. President, there is no shortcut to \nbecoming wealthy. There is no easy way, no free lunch to do it. In \norder to become wealthy, one must acquire wealth. And in order to do \nthat, one must save. Occasionally, there are people who hit the lottery \nor some bonanza of some sort. But, generally speaking, the acquisition \nof wealth occurs as a consequence of people being willing to defer \ngratification to set aside something they would like to purchase today \nin favor of the desire to purchase something later.\n  I remember, Mr. President, in 1988, during my first campaign for the \nU.S. Senate--I will not tell the gentlemen's name--standing at a farm \nsite at an event thrown in my behalf, standing next to a farmer \napproximately a generation older than I, along with a friend of mine \nwho is a salesman. He was talking to this farmer and he said, ``It is \nwell known that you are one of the wealthiest men in the country. How \ndid you get so wealthy?'' He said, ``It is real simple. I do not spend \nmy money.'' And in making an observation about this gentleman who was a \nsalesman, he said ``You are wearing very nice clothes that cost you a \nlot of money.'' The salesman said, ``I have to in order to do my \nwork.'' The farmer said, ``You will notice that I am wearing a very \nattractive shirt that I bought for a dollar at your garage sale last \nfall.''\n  Mr. President, in order to acquire wealth, individuals must be \nwilling to save. There is no short cut to it. Senator Simpson and I \nwill, in the next few days, I hope, if we can get the bill language put \ntogether, present legislation that will reform a program that is \nsupposed to be a savings program but it is not, and that is our Social \nSecurity system. One of the things I will do in the process of \ndescribing the legislation is describe the magic of compounding \ninterest rates.\n  Mr. President, there are three variables that will determine the \nimpact of your savings and your acquisition of wealth.\n  Variable number one is the length of time that you contribute to that \nsavings account.\n  Variable number two is the amount of money you contribute.\n  Variable number three is the rate of return.\n  The most important variable is number one, the length of time that \nyou contribute. An individual that contributes $75 a year starting at \nage 20, over a 50-year period, will have more at the end of that 50-\nyear period than somebody who contributes $1,500 a year if they wait \nuntil they are age 50 to start. I am 51 and, generally, it occurs to \nyou when you are about 50 that, Oh, my gosh, I am going to retire in 15 \nyears, I have to start saving money. The dilemma is that if you wait \nuntil you are 50, you are giving up the significant impact of \ncompounding rates.\n  Let me give a little mathematics for the listening audience. Mr. \nPresident, if you got a 10-percent real rate of return by investing in \nequities, which is not that difficult to do, that would mean that you \nwould have a compound every 7.2 years. Thus, if your parents took \n$1,000 and opened a savings account for you when you were born, you \nwould get 10 compounds on that thousand dollars that would be worth a \nmillion dollars by the time you reach age 70. This piece of \nlegislation, in my judgment, Mr. President, would change the culture \nand attitude of savings in the United States of America.\n  Mr. President, to be clear, there are not very many situations where \nthe interest of the individual and the interest of the Nation \nintersect, where they are the same. As much as we talk about it being \nthe same, there are very few situations where that is the case. With \nsavings, there is an intersection. It is in the interest of American \nfamilies to acquire and accumulate wealth. It is in the interest of the \nNation to do the same. Unless both the individual has an incentive to \nsave and the Nation has the discipline to save, then the standard of \nliving of the United States of America simply will not rise.\n  Mr. President, I will identify four features that I think \nunquestionably will have a dramatic and powerful and positive impact on \nthe United States of America.\n  First, this piece of legislation permits a full and unlimited \ndeferral of the taxation of savings. A clear signal, unequivocal. There \nwould be no need to consult with an accountant. You would know \nprecisely that if you save money, you can defer taxation on that \nsavings.\n  Second, it allows wage earners an offset for the employee portion of \nthe payroll tax. That is a very powerful incentive. The payroll tax is \nextremely regressive and very often uncalculated when people are \npoliticians and are looking at the overall rates of taxation. It is an \nextremely regressive tax, difficult for individuals, and very often a \nbarrier for businesses to hire new employees.\n  Third, Mr. President, it allows those individuals who are willing to \nroll the dice, to sign their name on the dotted line to put some \nsavings into land, building, equipment, which will hire and employ \nAmericans. It allows them, in the operation of their business--a risky \nventure in the 1990's--to expense every single one of their real \ninvestments.\n  Fourth, Mr. President, it enables the United States of America to \nexclude export sales from taxation imposed, as well a tax on imports. \nEvery single one of our industrial competitors does precisely the same \nthing. They have to be laughing under their breath as they look at the \ntaxation system of the United States of America that puts our workers \nat a competitive disadvantage, and puts our businesses at a competitive \ndisadvantage as well.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to join the distinguished Senator from \nNew Mexico and the distinguished Senator from Georgia as an original \ncosponsor. This is a piece of legislation that has been several years \nin the making. It is a very thoughtful piece of legislation. It has \nbeen well thought through. I attended a number of these meetings long \nbefore the issue was popular. The Senator from New Mexico and the \nSenator from Georgia were leading this effort. I hope that, with the \nnew permission granted in this new Congress, this kind of legislation, \nserious legislation, will not only be considered but will be enacted as \nsoon as possible. Mr. President, it will be good for American families \nand good for American workers, and it will be good for American \nbusinesses and, as a consequence of all three, good for our country.\n  [[Page S5672]] Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes, and Senator \nNunn would like 5 to wrap this up, so I will yield 5 to him.\n  Mr. President, I would like Members of the Senate and those \ninterested in this legislation to know that we set some very difficult \nparameters for those who helped us draft this. We said we want to \nreplace the income tax system with a whole new system, and we want to \nreplace it both in substance and in dollars. We want the exact same \namount of revenue to come in from this new code as before. No more, no \nless. We want it to be neutral. It was a pretty hard mandate imposed on \nthose who are doing the modeling, the rate making, and other things.\n  Second, we said to them that we have a tendency in the United States \nto judge progressivity based on things we understand. So we took \nprogressivity to mean that each 20 percent of the American taxpayers--\nfrequently called quintiles--the low 20 and the high 20 would pay the \nsame proportion of the total tax when we were finished with this as the \ncurrent code--another very difficult and onerous instruction, but we \ndid those two things because we wanted to prove that you could totally \noverhaul the income tax structure and get the same amount of revenue \nfrom corporations and businesses and the same amount from each quintile \n--that is, 20 percent of the American taxpayers in a progressive \nmanner.\n  Now, obviously, we have followed that rule religiously. Thus we have \nsome guidelines, some milestones, and proof that it can be done.\n  On the other hand, we suggest to the tax writers in the various \ncommittees, including our Ways and Means Committee, our Finance \nCommittee, and the Ways and Means Committee in the House, that they \nmight very well, in trying to adopt this major concept changes that are \nincorporated in detail, they might want to look at some variance in \nthose. But we wanted to send it to them and say we have living proof \nthat it can be done and yet tremendously encourage savings and \ninvestment.\n  The second point. All of the modeling and estimating was done on a \nbasis of static economics. That is, we used the conservative--\nacceptable to the CBO and everyone else--approach to the tax yields.\n  Not for a minute do Senator Nunn and I believe that the savings, that \nthe tax yields over time will be precisely the same. As a matter of \nfact, we believe that in the future years--because of the savings and \ninvestment, we might indeed have slightly less tax receipts in early \nyears and very significantly higher ones in future years with better \njobs.\n  We do not take credit for that in the modeling and estimating. We do \nit on this neutral, conservative basis.\n  Having said that, I want to say to my friend, and certainly he is \nSenator Nunn's friend, Senator Kerrey from Nebraska actually hit right \nat the heart of our proposal with his four summary items.\n  There is no question that this is a totally new concept. We think it \nis better. As I view it, when people sit around and decide what they \nare going to do with their earnings, currently there is no real \nincentive to look at savings and investment because we pay double tax \non both--the incentive is against it instead of in favor of it.\n  We only want a neutral arena. We understand Americans must spend \ntheir money. We understand we will be asked, ``Are you sure you will \nnot hurt the economy by causing Americans to spend less?'' We think, \nover time, the pluses are our way.\n  All we want to do is put that on a level playing field. As we sit \naround and talk about disposable income we want people to look at the \nunlimited IRA's that are part of this, or starting your own investment \nmoney and leaving it there.\n  In conclusion, the concept is that the savings and investment pool is \ngood for America. The bigger it is, the better for our working people, \nfor jobs and for our children. So if the money is left there in the \nsavings or investment pool, you do not bring it back into your income \nand spend it, people do not pay taxes. It is deferred.\n  This seems to Washington to be rather revolutionary when coupled with \nthe corporate advantages with our border adjustable. Clearly, American \ncompanies will be given a better opportunity to use more of this \nsavings pool here in America, which many will ask, if we are going to \nhave all these savings and investments, will American companies get a \nfair shot?\n  What we will say, I think, is, ``Absolutely yes.'' We cannot keep all \nof our money at home, but when we create the advantages for American \ncorporations and take away the disadvantages of engaging in world \nmarkets, I believe we will keep much of our money here at home under \nthis proposal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia has 9 minutes 40 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I want to thank a few people, and I \ninadvertently may not name everyone. There have been many people \ninvolved in this effort.\n  On my staff, Mike McCord and Rocky Rief; on Senator Domenici's staff, \nBill Hoagland and Denise Ramonas.\n  I would like to thank David Abshire and his entire team at CSIS--Dick \nFairbanks, Debbie Miller, and John Yochelson--who worked on the \nStrengthening of America report, and the many people who have worked so \nhard to help us develop the concept we endorsed in that report into the \ndetailed proposal we are introducing today.\n  Barry Rogstad and John Endean of the American Business Conference \nhave helped immensely. Barry was on the commission and we asked him to \nwork with us after we came out with this report. Ernest Christian of \nthe Center for Strategic Tax Reform, who has been very, very, \ninstrumental in helping us turn this overall concept in a working tax \nsystem, because he has great expertise in the tax area. I also want to \nthank Rudy Penner, the former Director of the Congressional Budget \nOffice, who has done a great deal in coming up with rate structure and \nconceptual framework of the USA tax, and Lin Smith and Paul Burnham who \nare part of Rudy's team at KPMG Peat Marwick.\n  Barry, Ernie, and Rudy in particular have spent countless hours \nhelping Senator Domenici and I develop this proposal. These key players \ndeserve great credit. I also want to thank Bob Lutz, Paul O'Neill, \nBarbara North and all the members of Alliance USA for their support.\n  While he has not reviewed the legislation we are introducing today, \nand may not necessarily agree with everything in it, this proposal has \nbenefited from the pioneering conceptual work in this area over the \npast 20 years by David Bradford.\n  The cash-flow business tax component of our proposal has also built \non the foundation of several years of work by our two distinguished \nfriends and former colleagues, Senator David Boren and Senator Jack \nDanforth, and their very able staffers, Beth Garrett, and Mark \nWeinberger, who also served as Chief of Staff of the Kerrey-Danforth \nBipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform.\n  I would also like to thank Jim Fransen and Mark Mathiesen of the \nSenate Legislative Counsel's office, and the staffers from the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation, especially Jon Talisman, Joe Mikrut, Tom Bowne, \nand Tom Barthold, who have spent many hours working with us on this \nlegislation. I know that the Legislative Counsel's office and the Joint \nCommittee have both been extremely busy this year, and probably will \ncontinue to be, given the large numbers of both incremental and \nfundamental tax reform proposals being introduced, marked up, and \ndebated this year.\n  I have no doubt that if we and they had the luxury of having all the \ntime needed to produce a bill that contained every detail necessary to \nimplement such a comprehensive reform as the USA Tax System, we would \nbe able to improve it still further. While all these individuals have \nshared their time and talents with Senator Domenici and I and our \nstaffs, and we have spent hours and days and weeks and months working \non this proposal, I would be the first to say that the legislation we \nare introducing today is not complete, it is not perfect, it is not the \nlast word on tax reform that will ever need to be written.\n  [[Page S5673]] But we believe it is important to put our proposal--\nwhich I believe is far more detailed than any of the other reform \nproposals being discussed--before the American people at this time so \nthat the American people can learn more about our proposal, and so that \nwe can learn from them. We believe our proposal can and will be further \nimproved as people study it and debate it. In the end, we believe we \ncan make a compelling case why our USA proposal best serves the needs \nof the American people, and addresses the competitive realities of the \nglobal marketplace, for the next century.\n  Let me see if I can summarize the USA tax proposal in a very brief \ntime. The fundamental premise is that the United States has a serious \nsavings problem. The private savings in this country have continued to \ngo down, down, down, while the Federal deficit has eaten up the savings \nby going up, up, up.\n  We have the lowest savings rate in the industrial world, as Senator \nKerrey from Nebraska and Senator Danforth from Missouri pointed out so \nclearly in their study, as we pointed out in the Strengthening of \nAmerica Report, and as many other commissions, including Warren Rudman, \nPaul Tsongas, and Pete Peterson of the Concord Coalition, who have done \nso much work in that area, have reported in the work they have done on \ntrying to reduce the Federal budget deficit.\n  The fundamental premise is we have much too low a rate of savings, \nand we have to do something about that. The other fundamental premise \nis that higher savings is directly connected with real income, because \nhigher savings produces more investment, higher productivity and \nimproved competitiveness, better jobs, and a higher standard of living \nfor our American workers.\n  The goals of our tax reform effort is to promote savings and \ninvestment; to ensure fairness while we are doing that; to not increase \nthe budget deficit, which is enormously important; to strengthen \nAmerica's competitive position--and I have talked about that at length \nthis morning on the export/import matter--to make our Tax Code as \nsimple and as efficient as possible in a complicated, complex world; to \ngive individual Americans at all income levels a chance to save, to \ninvest for their future, for their children's future, and to raise the \nstandard of living for themselves and their families; and, finally, to \nproduce the revenue required for the U.S. Government with the least \ndetrimental effect on our economic growth.\n  The advantages of the USA tax system are many. I will try to capture \nthose very briefly. No. 1, we eliminate the bias against savings in the \ncurrent Tax Code.\n  No. 2, we do not increase the budget deficit, we break even if there \nis adjustment required. That is the fundamental premise. We will adjust \nto accommodate whatever tax estimates come forward.\n  The third point is increase the national savings and thereby we give \nourselves an opportunity to increase investment and to increase \nproductivity and real income.\n  No. 4, we help level the international playing field for U.S. \nbusiness by not taxing exports and by having the same tax on imports as \non domestically-produced goods.\n  This equalizes the tax treatment with our competitors. Both Japan and \nEurope have a value-added tax where they rebate on exports and they tax \nour imports. So we are doing the same thing that they are doing, \nequally, and leveling the playing field. It gives our American \nproducers a level playing field with workers abroad. That is enormously \nimportant.\n  Finally, it makes our Tax Code more understandable and more \nefficient.\n  The other dimension that I emphasized this morning that I think bears \nrepeating, is that this is a major step toward giving unskilled people \nat the bottom end of the economic ladder a chance to get started, to \nget the foot on the bottom rung of the economic ladder, and to get a \njob, because we basically merge the FICA tax, the Social Security, with \nthe income tax and we give full credit back to employees for the \nportion of that tax they paid, even if it is refundable. Even if their \nFICA tax exceeds the amount they owe on income tax, they will get a \nrefund.\n  So this eliminates the most regressive feature of our current tax \nsystem and removes a very large obstacle to employment.\n  Mr. President, we welcome constructive criticism. We know that we do \nnot have a perfect Tax Code--there is no such thing. We understand that \nthere are going to be changes that need to be made. We understand there \nare things we have overlooked. We welcome suggestions. We welcome \nconstructive criticism. I know we will have a lot of debate and \ndiscussion on this proposal and I am delighted, with my friend from New \nMexico, as partners, to jointly send this proposal to the desk and ask \nit be reported and properly referred.\n  I also ask the cosponsors be listed: Mr. Domenici, introducing the \nbill with myself, Senator Kerrey, and Senator Bennett--so those will be \nthe cosponsors. I believe Senator Lieberman has indicated an interest \nand I believe later he would like to be added as a cosponsor, but we \nhave not yet heard from him. He has been enormously interested in this \nproposal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be received and appropriately \nreferred.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank the Senate for the time it gave \nSenator Nunn and me this morning. Both of us have had opportunities in \nour Senate careers to do some exciting things for our country, but I \nthink we both agree that if we can change the tax laws of the land to \naccomplish the goals and purposes described here and get the Federal \ndeficit down where in a few years it would be zero, I think we would be \nrather satisfied that these would be major accomplishments in our time \nhere in the U.S. Senate.\n  Does my colleague not agree?\n  Mr. NUNN. I certainly agree with my friend from New Mexico.\n  Mr. President, I ask this legislative proposal also be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, we yield the remainder of our time.\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I applaud the efforts of the \nSenator from Georgia and the Senator from New Mexico. They have spent \nnot weeks, not months, but years in developing this USA tax proposal.\n  It should come as no surprise that this proposal was such a long time \nin the making since it replaces our current individual and business \nincome tax system. This was an enormous task. But each year, American \ntaxpayers face an enormous task of their own--trying to make sense of \nthe dazzlingly unwieldy and frighteningly complex U.S. Tax Code.\n  In addition to being complicated, our current Tax Code does little to \nencourage savings and investment and this is in a time when real \nincomes are down, making Americans even less certain about their \neconomic futures.\n  Our current Code discourages the savings that create the savings pool \nfrom which investments can be made. In fact, our Code penalizes savings \nnot once, not twice but three times--first by taxing that money before \nit can be invested, second by taxing it again as corporate profits, and \nthird by taxing that money when it is distributed as dividends to \nshareholders. By any yardstick, the savings rate in this country is at \na near-crisis point. Our falling private savings combined with our \nrising deficits have left our net national saving--the amount available \nfor investment in job-creating activities--at record lows. That net \nnational savings has fallen from about 10 percent of GDP in 1973 to \nless than 2 percent in 1993.\n  As the Senator from Georgia has said, ``by definition what we do as \nindividuals to invest in the collective future of our country comes \nfrom our savings.'' I agree with that observation and I would add to \nthat observation by saying that by definition what we should be doing \nas the creators of the Tax Code is to remove the disincentives in our \nCode that discourage that investment.\n  The proposal that Senators Nunn and Domenici are introducing today \nclearly provides an incentive for that saving that we as individuals, \nand we as a country, so desperately need. This proposal imposes no \ntaxes on savings-- \n[[Page S5674]] until those savings are spent. It also maintains a few \nimportant deductions like the home mortgage deduction and the \ncharitable contribution deduction. In addition the proposal adds a \ncritically important deduction to help families pay for the cost of \nhigher education--as a way to encourage this all-important human \ninvestment. And it is significant to note that the proposal allows a \nfull credit for the 7.65 percent of wages that workers pay into the \nSocial\n Security system.\n\n  This proposal also goes to great pains to ensure fairness and \nprogressivity. It allows for a living allowance as well as the \ndeductions and credits I have outlined--for a family of four, the \nliving allowance would mean that over $17,000 a year in spending would \nbe tax exempt. In addition, the figures that have been run on this \nproposal show that it would actually decrease the tax liability for a \nfamily making less than $50,000 and leave the tax liability for those \nmaking between $50,000 and $100,000 unchanged. In addition, the tax \nliability of those making between $100,000 and $200,000 would increase \nby 3 percent and would increase by 4 percent for those making over \n$200,000. It also ensures that the great majority of people who have \nbeen saving all along will not be penalized when they withdraw those \nsavings in their retirement.\n  On the business side, this proposal encourages capital investment by \nproviding for unlimited expensing and encourages the reinvestment of \ncapital gains by deferring taxes on those gains if those gains are \nreinvested. And while it increases the overall pool of what is subject \nto the business tax, the proposal also lowers the tax rate overall on \nbusinesses.\n  This proposal holds out real promise and I am grateful that my \ncolleagues from Georgia and New Mexico have devoted so much time and \neffort to ironing out the thousands of necessary details and putting \nthis proposal into legislative form. I look forward to discussing the \nproposal in greater detail with them and, from what I have seen, their \nproposal certainly moves us a big step forward toward a tax system that \nis simpler and fairer as well as a system that increases our capacity \nas a country to grow and create new jobs.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself and Mr. Specter):\n  S. 724. A bill to authorize the Administrator of the Office of \nJuvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Programs to make grants to \nStates and units of local government to assist in providing secure \nfacilities for violent and chronic juvenile offenders, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                        juvenile corrections act\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Juvenile \nCorrections Act of 1995, which I am proud to sponsor with my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Specter. The act dedicates approximately 10 percent \nof the 1994 Crime Act's adult prison resources to the construction and \noperation of State and local juvenile corrections facilities.\n  Juvenile violence, as we all know, is at the heart of the crime \nproblem in America. Every 5 minutes a child is arrested for a violent \ncrime in the United States; every 2 hours a child dies of a gunshot \nwound. Unfortunately, there is good reason to believe that this problem \nmay get worse before it gets better. Demographics tell us that between \nnow and the year 2000, the cohort of children between the ages of 14-17 \nwill increase by more than 1 million. The likely result: a serious \nincrease in the number of violent juvenile offenders in the coming \nyears--above already unacceptable levels.\n  Despite this state of affairs, the Federal Government has treated \njuvenile corrections as the poor stepchild of the Federal anticrime \neffort. The 1994 Crime Act contained billions of dollars for policing \nand adult prisons at the State and local level, but no significant \nprogram to help States alleviate the increasing burdens on their \njuvenile corrections systems.\n  These burdens are real and substantial, Mr. President. A recent \nDepartment of Justice survey indicated that the majority of juvenile \ncorrections facilities nationwide are seriously overcrowded and \nunderstaffed--in short, bursting at the seams. Between 1979 and 1991, \njuvenile detention centers faced a 30 percent increase in daily average \npopulation--a gain of about 65,000 youthful offenders. As a result of \nthe demographic trend we highlighted above, we will probably see even \nworse overcrowding in the future.\n  Mr. President, the consequences of overcrowding should trouble us \nall. In part due to the combination of overcrowding and understaffing, \njuvenile offenders attacked detention facility staff 8,000 times in \n1993. In countless U.S. cities, juvenile offenders who require \ndetention are nonetheless released into the community because of a lack \nof space. And finally, it is clear that overcrowding breeds violence \nand ever more violent juvenile offenders who, when eventually released, \nare much more dangerous to society than when they were first \ninstitutionalized.\n  For all these reasons, we introduce today the Juvenile Corrections \nAct. Our legislation provides crucial assitance--$770 million in \nfunding over 5 years--to State and local governments for the \nconstruction, expansion, and operation of juvenile corrections \nfacilities and programs. And, I should note, the act has no impact on \nthe deficit, as it draws its funding from the $8 billion adult \ncorrections component of the 1994 Crime Act.\n  Mr. President, we cannot afford to turn a blind eye to the juvenile \ncorrections problem. So I hope my colleagues will join with me and \nSenator Specter to enact the Juvenile Corrections Act. In light of the \nspiralling juvenile violence problem, we believe it makes good sense to \ndedicate roughly 10 percent of the crime act's adult prison resources \nto State and local juvenile corrections.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Akaka, Mr. \n        Dorgan, and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 725. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to extend \ncertain authorities relating to the provision of community-based health \ncare by the Department of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n                   veterans' community-based care act\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, VA, like other Federal departments, \nis taking a hard look at its programs in order to improve the way it \noperates, and in so doing, improve the services it provides to its \nbeneficiaries--in the case of VA, veterans and their families. I am \ncommitted to providing VA with the legislative authorities and \nmanagement flexibility needed to renew its health care system to meet \nthe current and the future needs of our Nation's veterans.\n  One of the steps VA must take is to revamp its infrastructure to use \nthe most clinically appropriate, most effective, and most efficient \napproaches to health care delivery available in this country. VA plans \nto restructure by shifting from a system which is heavily oriented \ntoward inpatient hospital care, to a system which provides more care in \noutpatient and noninstitutional settings, such as care in the community \nand in veterans' homes.\n  The bill I am introducing today is designed to support VA's \nreengineering efforts by extending existing authorities to provide \nhealth care to eligible veterans in community settings. I am proud that \nSenators Daschle, Akaka, Dorgan, and Wellstone have joined with me as \noriginal cosponsors.\n\n\n                         summary of provisions\n\n  Mr. President, this legislation contains amendments to title 38, \nUnited States Code, and to various public laws that would:\n  First, extend until December 31, 2000, VA's authority to contract \nwith non-VA halfway houses for treatment and rehabilitation services \nfor veterans with substance abuse problems.\n  Second, extend until December 31, 2000, VA's authority to conduct a \npilot program of noninstitutional alternatives to nursing home care.\n  Third, reauthorize until December 31, 2000, VA's Homeless Chronically \nMentally Ill Program, which provides outreach and contract care in non-\nVA facilities for homeless veterans with severe mental illnesses.\n  Fourth, reauthorize until December 31, 2000, the Compensated Work \nTherapy/Transitional Residence Program for certain veterans, including \nthose who suffer from substance abuse problems and homelessness.\n  Fifth, extend until December 31, 2000, VA's authority to enter into \nenhanced-use leases.\n\n[[Page S5675]]\n\n                               background\n\n  Clearly, veterans who are eligible for VA health care services need \naccess to a full range of institutional and noninstitutional services \nto meet their medical and health-related needs. Ideally, every patient \nwould be provided the most appropriate type and level of care needed, \nand that care would be delivered in the most appropriate and least \nrestrictive setting.\n\n\n     treatment for alcohol or drug dependence or abuse disabilities\n\n  This legislation would extend VA's authority to contract with non-VA \nhalfway houses for treatment and rehabilitation services for veterans \nwith substance abuse problems. Current law authorizes VA, through \nDecember 31, 1995, to provide veterans who are suffering from substance \nabuse disabilities with care on a contract basis through community \nhalfway houses. Such community facilities provide a supervised, \nsubstance-free environment, maintain residents' health, and help \nresidents improve their independent living and social skills.\n  This contract program provides an important step in a veteran's \ntransition from inpatient substance abuse treatment and detoxification \nto independent living in a community. The contract program currently \noperates at 106 medical centers; 6,300 veterans were treated through \nthe program in fiscal year 1994. First authorized in 1979, the program \nhas been an integral step in the treatment of substance abuse for \nveterans.\n\n\n           noninstitutional alternatives to nursing home care\n\n  This legislation would extend VA's authority to provide health and \nhealth-related services for veterans needing long-term care. Under \ncurrent law, this program will expire on September 30, 1995.\n  Authorized by Public Law 101-366 and expanded by Public Law 103-452, \nthe program is targeted to those veterans who, but for the receipt of \nthese services, would need to be placed in a nursing home. Homemaker \nand home health aide services furnished under this program provide \nveterans with assistance in performing fundamental activities of daily \nliving, such as eating, bathing, dressing, transferring, and other \npersonal care activities. VA staff provide the case management, and \npublic and private sector agencies deliver the services in veterans' \nown homes. Veterans can continue to live at home and receive, at less \ncost to VA and to the taxpayer, the same type of services that would \notherwise be provided in a hospital or nursing home.\n  With a budget of $10 million in fiscal year 1994, 110 VA medical \ncenters purchased homemaker and home health aide services for more than \n3,000 veterans.\n\n\n               homeless chronically mentally ill program\n\n  This legislation would reauthorize for 5 years the Homeless \nChronically Mentally Ill [HCMI] program. Under current law, the HCMI \nprogram will expire on September 30, 1995.\n  The HCMI program, one of the two major VA homeless programs, \nauthorizes VA outreach workers to contact homeless veterans in the \ncommunity, assess and refer veterans to community services, and place \neligible veterans in contracted community-based residential treatment \nfacilities. The HCMI program was enacted in 1987 as a pilot program \nwith a budget of only $5 million. Since that time, the program has \ngrown significantly. In fiscal year 1994, it had a $24.5 million budget \nand operated out of 57 medical centers in 31 States and the District of \nColumbia. Similar to the contract program for veterans with chronic \nsubstance abuse problems, the HCMI program continues to prove its \nworth.\n\n\n            compensated work therapy/transitional residences\n\n  This legislation would reauthorize through fiscal year 2000 a \ndemonstration program that provides veterans with compensated work \ntherapy and transitional residence [CWT/TR]. The current authority for \nthis program expires on October 1, 1995.\n  Currently, section 7 of Public Law 102-54, enacted in 1991, \nauthorizes VA to conduct a CWT/TR demonstration program with two \ncomponents. Under one component, VA is authorized to purchase and \nrenovate no more than 50 residences as therapeutic transitional houses \nfor chronic substance abusers, many of whom are also homeless, jobless, \nand have mental illnesses. Under the second component, VA is authorized \nto contract with nonprofit corporations which would own and operate the \ntransitional residences in conjunction with existing VA compensated \nwork therapy programs.\n  Under both components, veterans pay rent from money earned by working \nfor private businesses or Federal agencies which have contracts with VA \nto employ the veterans. Once the residence is fully renovated and \noperational, the rent collected from the veterans participating in the \nprogram is intended to pay the operating costs of the residence.\n  Thirty-six transitional residences run by VA were fully operational \nin 1994. Fourteen additional residences are currently in the process of \nbeing purchased or of activating operational beds. A preliminary VA \nevaluation of the existing programs indicates that well over half of \nparticipating veterans complete the program and have enjoyed \nsubstantially better sobriety, employment, and housing status than \nbefore entering the program. The analysis notes that, while these \nprograms need additional study, they seem to have enjoyed some initial \nsuccess.\n  While VA has implemented the first component of the demonstration \nprogram as originally envisioned by the Congress, I note that VA has \nonly implemented the second component of this program, which requires \nVA to enter into agreement with nonprofits to purchase and run the \ntransitional houses, as part of its HCMI program. Of the 29 VA \ncontracts with nonprofits for the HCMI program, VA provides compensated \nwork therapy at 27 of them. I remain concerned that VA has not formally \nimplemented the second component of the demonstration program.\n\n\n                      Enhanced-Use Lease Authority\n\n  This legislation would extend the authority for VA to enter into \nenhanced-use leases for an additional 5 years. This authority will \nexpire on December 31, 1995. Under current law, the Secretary has the \nauthority to enter into enhanced-use leases under which another party \ncan use VA property so long as at least part of the property will \nprovide for an activity which contributes to the mission of the \nDepartment and enhances the use of the property.\n  This program was enacted in 1991 as a test program in an effort to \nfund cost-effective alternatives to the manner in which VA \ntraditionally acquired and managed its facility and capital holdings. \nThe program was based on the concept that by out-leasing underused VA \nproperty on a long-term basis to non-VA users for uses compatible with \nVA programs, the Department would be able to obtain facilities, \nservices, or money for VA requirements that would otherwise be \nunavailable or unaffordable.\n  According to VA, the initial results of this program are promising, \nand have significantly reduced costs to the Department and provided \ncorresponding benefits to the local community. For example, through \nenhanced-use leasing, a Veterans Benefits Administration regional \noffice is scheduled to open at the VA Medical Center in Houston, TX, \nthis spring, at 56 percent of the cost initially appropriated for \ntraditional acquisition, plus an annual income to VA. This summer, the \nDepartment is expected to open a new child care facility at the \nWashington, DC, VA Medical Center operated by a private child care \nprovider; child care will be provided at a discounted cost to VA \nemployees--all at no cost to VA.\n  The Department is pursuing other enhanced-use leasing projects, \nincluding child care projects for nine sites based on the Washington, \nDC, VA Medical Center model; parking garages at VA medical centers in \nSt. Louis (John Cochran), Chicago (West Side), and Pittsburgh; training \non emergency procedures at the West Palm Beach VA Medical Center; a \nManaged Care Clinical Research and Education Center at the Minneapolis \nVA Medical\n Center; new research space, a new outpatient clinic, and added parking \nat the Durham VA Medical Center; a new energy facility at the North \nChicago VAMC; shared energy agreements at various VAMC's; and \npotentially, a continuous care retirement community at the Murfreesboro \nVAMC.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  Mr. President, many veterans who have suffered from chronic illnesses \n\n[[Page S5676]] have, in the past, had little, if no, choice as to where \nthey could live and receive the long-term care they needed. \nFortunately, there are more options today, including receiving care in \none's own home. A long-term illness is no longer synonymous with \ninstitutionalization. If medical, health-related, and social services \nare available, it can make the difference between a veteran being able \nto live his or her last years in the comfort of his own home, or having \nto be placed in an institution. Among other goals, the Veterans \nCommunity-Based Care Act of 1995 will help make this possible for the \nmen and women who have worn the country's uniform.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 725\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The district \ncoordinator, Tommy Dowler, and the State coordinator, Tami Dowler also \ncontributed a significant amount of time and effort to help the team \nreach the national finals.\n  The We the People . . . the Citizen and the Constitution program, \nfunded by Congress, is designated to educate young people about the \nConstitution and the Bill of Rights. The 3-day national competition \nsimulates a congressional hearing in which students' oral presentations \nare judged on the basis of their knowledge of constitutional principles \nand their ability to apply them to historical and contemporary issues. \nMembers of Congress and their staff enhance the program by discussing \ncurrent constitutional issues with both students and teachers.\n  Mr. President, I would like my colleagues to join me in recognizing \nthese students. It is refreshing to see young people wanting to gain an \ninformed perspective about the history and the principles of the United \nStates constitutional government. I wish the members of the Male High \nSchool We the People team the best of luck and look forward to their \nfuture in politics and government.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/25/senate-section/article/S5678-2", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5678-S5681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          JAMES R. SCHLESINGER: PAUL H. NITZE AWARD RECIPIENT\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the Center for Naval Analyses in \nAlexandria, VA, annually presents the Paul H. Nitze Award in \nrecognition of important contributions to national and international \nsecurity affairs. This year's recipient of the Nitze Award is the \nHonorable James R. Schlesinger, who received the award on April 6, \n1995.\n  Dr. James Schlesinger is of course one of the most experienced and \nable public servants of our time. A distinguished economist, he served \nduring the Nixon administration in several prominent capacities in the \nBureau of the Budget, ascending to Assistant Director in 1970, when the \nBureau became the Office of Management and Budget. And, as Senators are \nwell aware, he went on to become Director of Central Intelligence and \nSecretary of Defense in the Nixon and Ford administrations, and \nSecretary of Energy under President Carter. Dr. Schlesinger has also \nserved for many years as senior advisor at Lehman Brothers, and he is \nwidely respected for his scholarship arising out of his long \nassociation with the Center for Strategic and International Studies at \nGeorgetown University.\n  On receiving the Paul H. Nitze Award, Jim Schlesinger delivered an \noutstanding lecture on ``American Leadership, Isolationism, and \nUnilateralism'' in which he points out the need for close attention to \nthe leadership role of the United States in international affairs in \nthe post-cold-war era.\n  Mr. President, when a scholar and public eminence of James \nSchlesinger's wisdom and stature addresses himself to an issue of such \nsignificance to world affairs, I believe it is incumbent on all of us \nto take notice. Every Senator will benefit from a careful reading of \nDr. Schlesinger's speech, and I therefore ask that it be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The speech follows:\n\n[[Page S5679]]\n\n      Some Reflections on American Leadership, Isolationism, and \n                             Unilateralism\n\n       Ladies and Gentlemen: It is a special pleasure as well as \n     an honor to have been chosen to receive the Paul H. Nitze \n     Award. It is a special pleasure because Paul and I have been \n     collaborating directly for almost a quarter of a century--and \n     indirectly for even longer. I started working for Paul in the \n     early 60's, when I was at the RAND Corporation, and he was \n     head of International Security Affairs at the Pentagon. Years \n     later when I was Secretary of Defense, Paul also worked for \n     me. That clearly was the way it read on the organization \n     chart, though, for those of you who may not be aware of this, \n     such charts do not necessarily convey the whole of reality.\n       Of course, it is also a great honor for reasons that must \n     be obvious--Paul's many contributions to this nation, his \n     keenness of intellect (not the most common characteristic \n     among high officials), his abiding role as a senior \n     statesman. But perhaps one of Paul's most remarkable \n     strengths is the cool and detached view that habitually he \n     has taken with regard to national security affairs--rising \n     above the hubbub of controversy. That characteristic has been \n     displayed most prominently in matters such as the Palestine \n     crisis of 1947, the Watergate crisis, and a ``walk in the \n     woods''. Paul has displayed not only staying power, but (to \n     avert to an issue that first brought us together) great \n     throwweight in national security affairs. So it is a distinct \n     honor as well as a personal pleasure to have been selected \n     for this year's Nitze Award.\n       As most of us will recall, Paul Nitze was one of the \n     principal authors of NSC-68, which, in the aftermath of World \n     War II, charted that transformed role for the United States \n     in international affairs--of leadership and continuous \n     engagement. In a sense, the intellectual underpinnings of \n     NSC-68 guided American policy for more than 40 years. But we \n     all realize the era of NSC-68 is now over. It ended, rather \n     abruptly, with the demise of the Soviet Union. Of course, it \n     was Soviet misbehavior in the postwar world that formed the \n     national consensus which gave sustenance to the design that \n     underlay NSC-68. It manifested itself in the Greek-Turkish \n     aid program, the Marshall Plan, the NATO Alliance--and, \n     shortly later, the response to aggression in the Korean \n     peninsula and the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty.\n       Yet, with the fall of the Soviet Union, this nation has \n     been stripped both of guideposts to our foreign policy and of \n     the national consensus that underpins that policy. Both the \n     uncertainties and the challenges are substantial. This nation \n     is deeply enmeshed in world affairs. For better or worse, it \n     is the leading world power. No longer is it free, as it felt \n     itself to be through much of its history, to stand aloof, to \n     isolate itself from political events abroad. Yet, the clear \n     guidelines that marked those past period of engagement are \n     now lacking.\n       For this reason I want to spend some time this evening \n     reflecting on American leadership, on isolationism, and on \n     unilateralism. In his inaugural Nitze Award lecture, Sir \n     Michael Howard looked back in time to review lessons from the \n     Cold War Period. I seek to look forward--to what comes next. \n     Of late, one may have noticed the demands for ``American \n     leadership'' and the charges of ``isolationist'' that have \n     reverberated across the political landscape. That the charge \n     of ``isolationist'' is so widely used as a political epithet \n     reveals that the notion that America can stand aloof has \n     little resonance with the American public. The public fully \n     accepts that its economic ties, its political interests, even \n     its\n      residual vulnerability in an era of nuclear weapons, \n     preclude a wholesale American withdrawal from \n     international affairs. Moreover, even if we could stand \n     aside, the voice of conscience insists that it would not \n     be right for America to be indifferent to political \n     travail, particularly when it affects long-time allies of \n     the United States.\n       By contrast to these rejected charges of isolationism, the \n     image of American leadership has a grand resonance. Unhappy \n     events overseas, whether or not there is any serious American \n     interest, are regularly blamed on the ``failure of American \n     leadership''. Everybody seems to urge American leadership. \n     Americans like to flatter themselves with the notion that \n     this country is the ``sole surviving superpower''--and expect \n     action to make those unhappy events go away--so long as it \n     does not cost us very much. Our European allies--sometimes \n     rightly, sometimes wrongly--have demanded: Where is American \n     leadership? (Of late that cry has diminished in intensity, as \n     European expectations regarding American leadership have \n     faded.) Our Asian associates have resented our continuous \n     preaching, yet all are concerned that an erosion over time of \n     American power in the Pacific will allow an instability from \n     which until now they have been protected. Preachers, \n     teachers, editorial writers, if not little children in the \n     street, seem to presuppose American leadership--but \n     fundamentally treat it as a panacea--as a ready antidote for \n     most, if not all, of the world's problems.\n       Thus, the real issue comes down, not to withdrawal or \n     isolation--those are epithets--but to when, where, and how we \n     choose to intervene. In part the charge of isolation really \n     comes down to a suspicion of unilateral moves by the United \n     States on the international scene. For those who embrace \n     multilateralism and who prefer to work through international \n     bodies, the charge of isolationist comes readily as a riposte \n     to those who do not agree with them. But multilateralism can \n     readily be a cover for inaction. It can also be, and \n     frequently is, a vehicle for ineffective action. Of course, \n     those who\n      instinctively prefer to work through international bodies \n     are frequently right that their opponents are short \n     sighted or even blindly chauvinistic. But their actions \n     are scarcely isolationist. Rightly or wrongly, they are \n     regularly intended to achieve international objectives. \n     But such unilateralist impulses may be equally flawed or \n     ineffective.\n       The Clinton Administration has chided its foes for being \n     isolationists. It is perhaps merely the most recent assertion \n     of ``assertive multilaterialism''. Their critics, in turn, \n     have responded in kind. The Administration may fervently \n     believe in the collaboration among nations, yet it has shown \n     a distinct proclivity to become embroiled in quarrels with \n     individual nations, sometimes including old allies, over \n     issues which are either only remotely our business or over \n     which our influence is modest. Endangering ties with those \n     that have been reliable allies, along with ineffectual, if \n     irritating, advocacy of policies over which our influence is \n     slight runs the risk of weakening the ties between ourselves \n     and other nations--in effect isolating the United States. In \n     terms of its accolades to international engagement, the \n     Administration is clearly beyond criticism. It is only those \n     specific actions that the Administration takes, which \n     properly comes out and which understandably alarms its \n     critics. Irrespective of the good intentions, such actions \n     may weaken the international position of the United States.\n       Thus, the question is not one of isolation or withdrawal. \n     The question is where, when, and on what terms does the \n     United States become engaged. What is our foreign policy to \n     be--now that the conceptually easy task of containment has \n     come to an end. It is perhaps unnecessary to remind this \n     audience that such questions are antecedent to the issue of \n     shaping our military forces. The shaping of those forces \n     depends upon the role that the United States wishes to play \n     in the world--and the circumstances under which those forces \n     may become engaged.\n                                   ii\n\n       Thus, we seek a new paradigm for an effective foreign \n     policy. We seek, in effect, a successor to NSC-68. But it is \n     not easy to come by. Some of the difficulty in finding that \n     new paradigm is inherent. It is probably unavoidable that we \n     flounder to some degree at historic turning points. We did so \n     after World War II. It was not until 1947-1948 that we began \n     to find our bearings--and to do that we had the indispensable \n     help of Joseph Stalin. Now the international scene is vastly \n     more complex and yet there is much less direct danger to the \n     United States. Though there are numerous eruptions on the \n     international scene, there is little to concentrate the mind.\n       In every such eruption, somewhere someone will call on the \n     United States to do something. ``Concentrating the mind'' is \n     indispensable to some degree. It is better that we recognize \n     that simple fact rather than having reality thrust upon us. \n     No nation can do everything; we would be wise not to aspire \n     to do so.\n       I can recall over 40 years ago listening to a debate at \n     Harvard regarding the resolution of one of our seemingly \n     perennial steel strikes--during which John Dunlop, later \n     Secretary of Labor, commented: ``It is important for a \n     democracy not too frequently to demonstrate its own \n     ineffectiveness''. I have never forgotten that injunction. \n     But what is true for domestic policy is even more true for \n     foreign policy. Becoming engaged in numerous disputes, \n     particularly if one lacks public backing, is the high road to \n     ineffectiveness.\n       Perhaps it is obvious to say that the problem is especially \n     difficult for the United States, which, as a world power, \n     might find its attention drawn in any one of many\n      directions--and for which public backing is a sometime thing \n     and must be carefully fostered.\n       In the past and for other great powers, the choice of \n     foreign policy tendered to be far simpler. For most it was \n     geographically determined. There likely would be an historic \n     enemy. For, say, France or Germany, there was little \n     uncertainty as to who one's foe might be and where one must \n     be prepared to fight. To be sure, for Britain, whose imperial \n     interests were more far-flung, the problem was broader: to \n     protect communications with the empire and to prevent any \n     single power from dominating the Continent. Yet for the \n     United States today, our interests are even more diverse, and \n     the challenge of being a world power has grown since the era \n     of European dominance.\n       Moreover, the task was far easier in another respect. Given \n     what was seen as clear national interests, the unquestioned \n     rule for the European powers stressed the priority to be \n     assigned to foreign policy. The phrase from Bismarckian \n     German puts it simply: das Primat der Aussenpolitik--the \n     primacy of foreign policy. Yet, the primacy was far easier to \n     establish in a dynastic regime. Even in the case of England, \n     the problem was not insuperable--in light of its clearly \n     defined foreign policy, the preservation of the balance of \n     power, and a continued willingness of the British public to \n     defer to a strong governing class.\n       But here in the United States we now show signs of turning \n     das Primat der \n     [[Page S5680]] Aussenpolitik on its head and allowing foreign \n     policy to be determined by domestic politics. In any \n     democracy that is a continuing temptation; it is particularly \n     a problem in the United States where the vicissitudes of \n     public opinion can so easily determine public policy. And, \n     particularly is this so in the absence of an overriding fear \n     (as with the Soviet Union) or an overriding anger as with \n     Japan or Spain in an earlier era (Remember Pearl\n      Harbor, Remember the Maine). In sustaining public support, \n     it is frequently helpful if the anger has focused on a \n     weak foe (Mexico, Spain, or Grenada) for then one can \n     count on public exultation in a ``glorious little war''.\n       When, however, there is no clear and formidable foe and \n     when only a few Middle Eastern countries seem to generate \n     public anger, it is difficult to sustain a priority in \n     foreign policy (as George Bush belatedly discovered). It is \n     thus seductively easy to accept the primary of domestic \n     politics.\n       In addition to the absence of a clear focus and the \n     existence of diverse areas of potential responsibility for \n     the United States, which alone is a world power, there is a \n     further problem. There are too many distractions, most of \n     them transitory in nature. It is difficult to concentrate on \n     those issues that might represent ``permanent interests'', \n     given the worldwide domain of television with a power, if not \n     an agenda, that exceeds that of ``yellow journalism'' in the \n     past. Rather than permanent interests, we experience sudden \n     passionate interest in the Bosnians, the Kurds, the Rwandans, \n     the flight of Haitian or Cuban refugees, then the Kurds again \n     that lasts a few weeks or months at most--until the story \n     pales, the public tires of it, and then moves on. Surely that \n     complicates the task of selecting those interests and issues \n     to which we should adhere. It makes the challenge of \n     sustaining support for long term interests, as opposed to \n     momentary distractions, immensely difficult.\n       Need I add that these factors also make immensely difficult \n     the task of force planning. There is uncertainty as to what \n     our foreign policy may be. Consequently, there is an \n     uncertainty as to where we might fight. Choosing two major \n     regional conflicts as ``representative'' is hardly an ideal \n     solution--reminding us of the locale of past conflicts rather \n     than of the likely future conflicts. Moreover, under these \n     circumstances there are\n      genuine conflicts regarding specific foreign objectives. \n     With respect to our Asian policies, for example, the DOD's \n     International Security Affairs opines: ``the United States \n     remains dedicated to strengthening alliances and \n     friendships''. Yet, this scarcely describes the motives \n     that guide the actions of the U.S. Trade Representative, \n     who is predisposed to confrontations with the same Asian \n     states--by implicitly, if not explicitly, threatening to \n     weaken those alliances and friendships. In U.S. policy \n     there is a growing mixture of economic rivalry and \n     alliance reassurance. Perhaps this is unavoidable, yet \n     clearly it undercuts any joint planning with those allies \n     on whom we should be able to count.\n\n\n                                  iii\n\n       I have now devoted some time to explaining why in this \n     postwar world the inherent difficulties for this nation \n     shaping its foreign policy have grown. Now let me turn to \n     analyzing how our own actions have been compounding those \n     difficulties inherent in this altered world--and have seemed \n     to undercut that role of world leader which we ostensibly \n     cherish. But first I must portray the general behavior and \n     the style necessary to sustain the role of world leader. One \n     does not require any special knowledge or erudition to \n     understand these requirements; they should be obvious to any \n     long time observer of politics.\n       First, to be accepted as a leader, a nation must be seen \n     not to be acting primarily for its own account. It must \n     understand and take into account the interests of its \n     followers. It must also be seen to be genuinely interested in \n     international affairs--rather than blindly follow the \n     dictates of its own domestic politics. AND it must focus on \n     matters of real consequence.\n       Second, it must be reasonably consistent. Changes in policy \n     should be few in number--and taken for what are seen as valid \n     reasons. One must be steadfast. A great power does not \n     lightly enter into commitments, but when it does so it must \n     be with the serious intent of carrying them out. In brief \n     those who wish to retain a position of leadership must avoid \n     capriciousness. Otherwise one's credibility rapidly \n     diminishes, and one's influence fades with almost equal \n     rapidity.\n       Of late the United States has failed to observe these \n     obvious rules. While we flatter ourselves as the world's sole \n     remaining superpower, we seem to be amazed that our influence \n     seems to be shrinking. To be sure, some such shrinkage is \n     inherent in the change of circumstances. With the demise of \n     the Soviet threat, other nations, previously dependent upon \n     the United States for protection, are now less dependent and \n     so less inclined to defer to our wishes. But the erosion of \n     our influence proceeds more rapidly than required by the \n     circumstances. If we are to arrest that decline, we must \n     understand the causes.\n       If a nation is to lead, it must seem to be genuinely \n     concerned about international affairs--and not driven \n     primarily by domestic pressures. Nonetheless, in recent years \n     our policies being driven by domestic constituencies appear \n     to be the rule rather than the exception. In Northern \n     Ireland, in Haiti, in respect to Cuba or Haitian refugees, in \n     much of the Middle East, our policies seem to be driven by \n     domestic pressures--and we appear largely indifferent \n     regarding the international repercussions. A hungerstrike and \n     pressures from the Black Caucus brought a shift in our \n     policies toward Haiti. A senior official backgrounds to the \n     press that: ``No one will get to the right of us on Iran''. \n     The President's National Security Advisor reveals that the \n     United States will attempt once again to tighten sanctions on \n     Libya by persuading our European partners to cease buying \n     Libyan oil. This\n      revelation occurs, not in a regular diplomatic forum, but in \n     a meeting with the families of the victims of Pan Am 108.\n       Disappointed as they may have been, Europeans were not \n     really surprised that the United States did not regard Bosnia \n     as primarily our business. (Especially was this so in light \n     of the European Union's having previously told us that Europe \n     would handle Bosnia, and there was no need for our \n     intervention.) They were, however, non-plussed that we would \n     regard the affairs of Northern Ireland as primarily our \n     business. Northern Ireland is, after all, a province of the \n     United Kingdom, part of its sovereign territory. For us to \n     butt in (no other expression seems suitable!) for domestic \n     political reasons appeared both ignorant and bumptious. Such \n     behavior is scarcely consistent with the solidarity of NATO, \n     let alone the ``special relationship''. I cannot overstate \n     the dismay of other Europeans regarding our treatment of the \n     British. The general reaction is: If the Americans will \n     behave this way to their most intimate partner, what can the \n     rest of us expect? The diplomat's word for this episode is: \n     ``disappointment''.\n       This Administration is explicitly vulnerable to the \n     conservative charge that it is soft--most notably soft on \n     Saddam Hussein. For this reason it seeks, with ever lessening \n     support and growing desperation to maintain the sanctions on \n     Iraq that were adopted in 1990. Three of the five permanent \n     members of the Security Council have now introduced a \n     resolution to terminate those sanctions. Even Iraq's \n     neighbors regard our policy as no longer productive, though \n     they are reluctant to say so to our highest officials. If the \n     United States is seen primarily for domestic political \n     reasons to be stretching out sanctions believed to be \n     unproductive, if not unjust, how ready will others again be \n     to follow American leadership in imposing sanctions? The \n     answer is clear. A willingness to put domestic pressures in \n     front of international considerations will undermine the very \n     multilateral mechanisms that the Administration believes \n     ideal for abiding international\n      stability. Indeed, with respect to Libya, Iran, and Iraq, \n     rather than achieving its declared goal isolating those \n     countries, our diplomacy tends to isolate the United \n     States itself.\n       The effect of these altogether too many cases of putting \n     domestic politics first is to obscure those instances in \n     which the Administration has rightly focused our policies on \n     the longer term interests both of this nation and of \n     international stability--most notably our relations with \n     Russia and the spread of nuclear weapons. Other nations doubt \n     that we understand their interests, let alone take them into \n     adequate account. When the United States proclaims that \n     providing (6000 thermal megawatts of) light water reactors to \n     North Korea is the best remedy for curbing North Korea's \n     drive to acquire nuclear weapons, it makes it somewhat \n     difficult, to say the least, to persuade the Russians that \n     providing light water reactors in Iran creates an open road \n     to nuclear spread. To be effective, even with respect to \n     common long-term interests, a leader needs to maintain its \n     credibility.\n       The problem goes well beyond the Administration. One can \n     think of many advantages of divided government--invetting \n     domestic proposals. However, I myself can think of virtually \n     no advantages in divided government with respect to \n     international affairs. It weakens the voice of any \n     Administration--and it undermines the credibility of American \n     diplomacy. This Congress now seems inclined to inflict on the \n     Clinton Administration's policies regarding Bosnia and \n     regarding Russian aid the same kind of cavalier treatment \n     with which its Democratic predecessor treated President \n     Bush's policies toward China after Tiananmen Square. Whatever \n     the merits or defects of our policy on the so-called Mexican \n     bail out or toward Iran, Congressional intervention does not \n     seem likely to improve them.\n       Our policies have been changeable rather than consistent. \n     Our commitments do not appear to be reliable. Our policies \n     appear excessively driven by domestic constituencies.\n      The result is that the call for American leadership is \n     diminishing in strength. Increasingly American leadership \n     appears to be a problem rather than a solution.\n       We are tempting fate. Some years ago Paul Nitze suggested \n     that ``other nations can be expected to coalesce to cut us \n     down to size''. Unless we are prepared to deflect our own \n     domestic pressures, to take international considerations \n     primarily into account, to understand the differing interests \n     of other nations, and to pursue worthy long-term, common \n     interests, we shall regrettably accelerate that process. \n     Writing in 1950 in his splendid work, ``American Diplomacy,'' \n     George Kennan observed: ``history does not forgive us our \n     national mistakes because they are explicable in terms of our \n     domestic politics''. He also states: ``A nation which excuses \n     its own failures by the same sacred untouchableness of \n     [[Page S5681]] its own habits can excuse itself into complete \n     disaster''.\n       With the end of the totalitarian threat, with the \n     remarkably changed international circumstances, the danger to \n     the United States has visibly receded, and there is little \n     likelihood of a ``complete disaster''. Nonetheless, despite \n     the lessened danger, the possibility remains of cumulative \n     small setbacks and the erosion of our position. We may ignore \n     such possibilities--and it is unlikely to be fatal. Still the \n     rules are quite simple. To be a leader, a nation must sustain \n     its credibility.\n       Ladies and Gentlemen, you have been more than patient. I \n     must draw to a close--and must also offer a few conclusions.\n       During the Cold War the stakes were immense: the \n     preservation of the Western democracies and, if I may say so, \n     the substantial preservation of Western Civilization itself \n     of which the United States was the security mainstay. (I say \n     this despite the probable assault of the multiculturalists.) \n     But with the end of the cohesion and menace of the Soviet\n      empire, the stakes have now shrunken. The United States, the \n     world's most powerful nation, is in a sense free to be \n     capricious, to be irresponsible. Yet, it will not soon \n     fall into direct and serious danger. Nonetheless, there \n     are restraints--and there are prospective consequences of \n     our actions. The price of capriciousness will inevitably \n     be a loss of credibility--and of our position of \n     leadership.\n       While the United States is a powerful country, it is not \n     all-powerful. At the close of the Nineteenth Century, \n     Secretary of State Richard Olney could declaim during the \n     Venezuelan dispute with Great Britain that the United States' \n     ``word was fiat on this continent''. Whatever we may wish, it \n     is not fiat around the world. To pretend otherwise will make \n     us look foolish. The focus of our foreign policy concern, as \n     Paul Nitze has said, should be ``what kind of relations among \n     the leading powers''. We must be cautious about involving \n     ourselves in matters of lesser consequences. We should be \n     restrained in word as well as deed. The United States is not \n     obliged to comment on everything. Meddling in issues in which \n     our interests are only tangentially involved, nagging others \n     about their defects, real or imaginary, may make us feel good \n     for the moment. It is not the road to successful or long-term \n     leadership.\n       To provide long-term leadership, other nations must \n     understand that we do not speak casually or loosely. When we \n     do choose to make a commitment, other nations need to know \n     that we can and probably will live up to it. Always remember: \n     leadership is not an inheritance; it must be earned anew, \n     each decade, each year.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/25/senate-section/article/S5678-3", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MARTHA COMER\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nan outstanding Kentuckian who has been selected for induction into the \nKentucky Journalism Hall of Fame. Mrs. Martha Comer of Maysville, KY, \nis devoted to her profession, to the Ledger-Independent, formerly the \nDaily Independent, and to her community.\n  Martha Comer was born in 1906, the same year that her father founded \nthe Daily Independent. It is not surprising that Martha displayed her \njournalistic qualities at a young age. She served as the editor of the \nschool annual at Maysville High School. Upon her graduation from high \nschool she began working on the editorial staff of the Daily \nIndependent. She assumed the duties as editor in 1935, although her \nname did not appear as editor until 1941.\n  In 1968 the Daily Independent was sold to the Maysville Publishing \nCorp. and became the Ledger-Independent. At this time Martha became the \neditor and was responsible for publishing both the morning and \nafternoon editions. Although Mrs. Comer retired on January 7, 1977, she \ncontinued to remain on as an editorial consultant. For many years she \ncontinued to write a daily column and editorials. And to this day, \nMartha Comer still writes editorial commentary two or three times a \nweek for the Labor-Independent.\n  Mrs. Comer's editorial involvement allowed her to become actively \ninvolved with her community. She has campaigned tirelessly for many \norganizations and causes, such as advocating public policy and teaching \nin the literacy program.\n  Mr. President, I would like my colleagues to join me in paying \ntribute to Martha Comer, a new inductee into the Kentucky Journalism \nHall of Fame. I am positive that Mrs. Comer will continue to display \nthe great qualities in which she has in the past.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nDennis Griffin, a resident of Bowling Green, KY, who is being \nrecognized as one of the top local developers in the Nation. Mr. \nGriffin is 1 of 10 economic developers who received a leadership award \nfrom the American Economic Development Council.\n  Mr. Griffin has been president of the Bowling Green-Warren County \nChamber of Commerce since 1986, the same year he moved to Kentucky. \nSince taking over as president of the chamber of commerce the local \neconomy has soared. Mr. Griffin is best described by Bowling Green \nMayor Johnny Webb in a recent article in the Daily News. Mayor Webb \nsaid,\n\n       Things were not going too well in Bowling Green. It had \n     been some time since we had recruited a new industry. It was \n     almost like a lightbulb coming on when (Griffin) came in and \n     got his feet on the ground. He is the catalyst to \n     development.\n\n  Mr. President, during the last 9 years, Mr. Griffin has worked hard \nto develop the region. He is responsible for starting 56 new companies, \nand establishing 6,000 new jobs; an investment of more than $400 \nmillion in the community. But that's not all, Mr. Griffin also worked \nhard to help 72 existing industries expand, which created an additional \n2,500 jobs, investing another $100 million in the community.\n  Mr. Griffin, just like the Energizer Bunny, is still going strong \neven after 9 years of service. In the last year alone, 10 new plants \nhave decided to call Bowling Green their home and 9 companies have \nexpanded.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to \nthis outstanding Kentuckian. I think that all will agree that through \nhis hard work and dedication for his community, Mr. Griffin proves that \nhe truly deserves the honor of being one of the country's top local \ndevelopers.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/25/senate-section/article/S5681-2", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5681-S5682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n             ALASKA NATIVE CLAIMS SETTLEMENT AMENDMENT ACT\n\n                                 ______\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 43, H.R. 421, \nthe Cook Inlet Region bill, that the bill be deemed read a third time, \npassed, that the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that \nany statements relating to the bill be placed at the appropriate place \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the Senate is about to take up H.R. \n421, the Alaska Native Claims Act Amendment Act of 1995. I wish to take \na few moments to describe H.R. 421 and importance of passing the bill \nthis evening.\n  On March 15, 1995, the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources \nunanimously reported nearly identical legislation for consideration by \nthe full Senate.\n  The bill allows the Cook Inlet Region Incorporated Native \ncorporation, called CIRI, to consider creating a system to buy back the \nstock of willing sellers, provided that stockholders vote to set up \nsuch a system. It will serve as a test for an alternate system of stock \ndistribution that could later be expanded for use by any of the State's \nNative regional corporations.\n  The goal of H.R. 421 is simple: to provide a responsible middle \nground so that shareholders will have access to the capital value of \ntheir stock, while preserving the Native control and ownership of the \nANCSA corporations.\n  Originally under the 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, Native \nshareholders were prevented from selling their stock for 20 years. This \nwas to give the corporations time to mature. As part of a series of \n1991 amendments to the corporations, Congress changed the law, at the \nrequest of the Natives, so that stock restrictions on alienability--the \nright of Natives to sell their shares--automatically continued unless \nand until the shareholders of a corporation voted to remove them.\n  H.R. 421 will provide another alternative. Shareholders will be able \nto sell their stock back to the corporation, helping preserve Native \ncontrol if: First the corporation's board votes to participate; second, \nthe majority of the entire membership of the corporation votes to \npermit buybacks; and third, if \n[[Page S5682]] individual shareholders then want to participate. All \nthree conditions must be met before any sale of stock is possible.\n  When the legislation was considered in the House, an issue arose \nregarding that section of the bill that provides protection from \nliability to CIRI, its directors and officers and evaluation advisors \nwhen making an offer to purchase stock. I have reviewed the amendment \nand find it acceptable. It contains the protection needed by CIRI, and \nis consistent with the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. The \nprotections from liability provided in the language are intended to \napply to all causes of action under any provisions of State or Federal \nlaw and are limited to stock re-purchase offerings made pursuant to \nthis legislation.\n  H.R. 421 provides a test case for Native corporation stock \ndistribution. Senator Stevens and myself have proposed this bill at the \nrequest of CIRI and the Alaska Federation of Natives. The other \ncorporations have said they would like to see how this works in CIRI's \ncase before deciding whether they would like the option extended to \nthem.\n  The important thing to remember is that this legislation has several \nsafeguards to ensure that any stock repurchases will be conducted \nfairly--the biggest safeguard is that the program can't happen unless \napproved by a majority vote of shareholders.\n  This bill provides a fair alternate means for distributing \ncorporation stock while preserving Native control of the ANCSA \ncorporations.\n  I have worked with Alaska's Native community for the last 15 years \nand I am sure that the Native people are more than capable of making \ntheir own decisions that affect their own corporate affairs.
