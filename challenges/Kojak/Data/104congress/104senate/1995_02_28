The distinguished Democratic leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad].\n  (Mr. KYL assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair and I thank the minority leader. Mr. \nPresident, today is an important day in the life of our Nation. Today \nwe consider a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution of the \nUnited States. We do not lightly consider amendments to the \nConstitution because that document has served as the framework that has \nmade this the greatest Nation in human history.\n  Mr. President, we are here because this Nation faces a debt threat. I \nhave brought with me several charts to try to illustrate the challenge \nthat we face. This first chart shows what has happened to the gross \ndebt in our country from 1940 to 1999. One can see that back in 1940 \nthe debt of the country exploded during World War II, and then \n     [[Page S3232]] we went into a long period in which the gross \n     debt of the country came down steadily, until 1979. At that \n     time, gross debt, once again, exploded. We saw the gross debt \n     of the country down about 30 percent, and it has gone up 70 \n     percent, not as high as it was during the Second World War, \n     nonetheless a real concern because the growth of the debt \n     puts enormous pressure on the financial markets, puts \n     pressure on interest rates, and has an adverse effect on our \n     total economy.\n  Mr. President, I think this chart tells a very important story. This \nis the work of the entitlements commission that just concluded their \nwork. On this chart, the green line shows the revenue of the United \nStates back from 1970, forecasted up through 2030. One can see that the \nrevenue has consistently run at just under 20 percent of our gross \ndomestic product. We are right in this change today. One can see that \nthe difference between the green line and these bars is the deficit, \nand we have worked the deficit down in this period to about 2.5 percent \nof gross domestic product.\n  Mr. President, look at what happens if we do not change course. Let \nme just say the entitlements commission did not take the worst case \nscenario. They assumed no recessions, no wars, no catastrophes, no \nnatural disasters. Look at how the deficit explodes by the year 2030. \nBy the year 2012 alone, we will use every penny of Federal revenue just \non entitlements and interest on the debt.\n  Mr. President, we must address the debt threat without question. That \ntakes us to the next chart. Some have said, ``Well, Senator Conrad, if \nyou feel so strongly about the need to attack the deficits, why have \nyou not signed up to the constitutional amendment'' that is before us \ntoday? Very simply, Mr. President, I have several concerns. As I \nindicated earlier, we do not amend the Constitution of the United \nStates lightly. That is the organic law of our country. It is the \ndocument that has stood the test of time, and we must take that measure \nagainst any proposed constitutional amendment.\n  Mr. President, there are three items that especially concern me. \nFirst is the possibility of looting the Social Security trust fund in \norder to balance the operating budget. That really raises the question \nthat I have on this chart: What budget is being balanced? I think it is \nvery important to know what budget is being balanced. To answer that \nquestion, we need to go to the language of the amendment itself.\n  In section 7, it says:\n\n       Total receipts shall include all receipts of the U.S. \n     Government except those derived from borrowing. Total outlays \n     shall include all outlays of the U.S. Government except for \n     those for repayment of debt principal.\n\n  Mr. President, what that means, very simply, is that everything is \ngoing in the pot. This is a little teapot that shows the pot of Federal \nspending that we have created. It shows what goes in on the revenue \nside--individual income taxes, social insurance taxes, corporate income \ntaxes, and other taxes. It shows the spending that comes out the spigot \nof Federal spending, the spigot of the pot of Federal spending. You can \nsee Social Security comes out of the spending spigot--interest on the \ndebt, defense, Medicare, and Medicaid. They are the big items. In fact, \nSocial Security, interest, defense, and Medicare make up 78 percent of \nFederal spending.\n  Mr. President, the problem with that part of this constitutional \namendment is that it assumes Social Security is in the pot, and Social \nSecurity is not contributing to the deficit; Social Security is in \nsurplus. Social Security, in fact, is going to run a surplus over the 7 \nyears necessary to balance the budget, under this provision, by $636 \nbillion. So the amendment that is before us today assumes that we will \nbe looting the Social Security trust fund surpluses of the $636 billion \nin order to balance the operating budget.\n  Mr. President, I do not consider that balancing the budget. That is, \nfrankly, Washington talk for balancing a budget. If a head of any \ncompany in this country told the investors that he was balancing the \nbudget and that a central part of balancing was to take the employees' \ntrust funds, that person would be on the way to a Federal facility--and \nit would not be the U.S. Congress; that person would be on their way to \njail. So this is a concern that I think must be addressed.\n  The second concern that I have--and it is a concern shared by \nothers--is the role of the courts, because once you put in the \nConstitution of the United States an amendment, you have \nconstitutionalized the issue. I brought with me a quote from Walter \nDellinger who testified last year at the hearings on the question of a \nbalanced budget, and he said:\n\n       If we have an amendment that for the first time \n     constitutionalizes the taxing and spending process and \n     creates a constitutional mandate which the courts are sworn \n     on oath to uphold, there is simply no way that we can rule \n     out the possibility that tax increases or spending cuts would \n     be ordered by the judiciary. And I think we would all agree \n     that that is a profound change in our constitutional system.\n\n  Mr. President, I hope people focus on this question. Would we really \nwant unelected judges to be able to order tax increases in this \ncountry? I think not. That would be taxation without representation. \nJudges are not elected. Judges are not chosen to make these decisions. \nThat is part of the genius of our Constitution: a separation of powers, \nwith Congress, the elected representatives, making the financial \ndecisions for the people of America.\n  Mr. President, it is not just Mr. Dellinger's view. Former Senator \nDanforth, who was among our most respected colleagues, a Republican \nSenator from Missouri, said last year when he offered an amendment--an \namendment, by the way, which was accepted--to deal with the issue of \nclarifying the role of the courts said:\n\n       The implications of this judicial encroachment are \n     staggering when applied to the proposed balanced budget \n     amendment. As Professor Tribe testified before the Committee \n     on the Budget: ``What remedy could a federal court then \n     decree? [if the budget is not balanced under this amendment] \n     The court in the United States in Missouri vs. Jenkins a \n     couple of years ago held that judges may have the power to \n     mandate higher taxes if needed to force the government to \n     comply with the Constitution.''\n\n  Senator Danforth went on to say:\n\n       I find it troublesome, but it is the law. Talk about \n     taxation without representation, unelected judges mandating \n     higher taxes.\n\n  Mr. President, we ought to listen to the wisdom of former Senator \nDanforth. He was one of the most respected Members of this Chamber. He \nwas dead right on this question.\n  Mr. President, there is a third issue that I want to raise today that \nis of concern and I think must be addressed if we are to pass a \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. President, the third issue that I raise is the question of an \neconomic emergency. Mr. President, we know that today the right policy \nis to cut spending and reduce the deficits and balance the budget. \nSixty years ago that was precisely the wrong policy. In the Depression, \nraising taxes and cutting spending only made the Depression deeper and \nlonger lasting.\n  Mr. President, Robert Solow, of MIT, a Nobel laureate in economics, \nsaid:\n\n       The balanced budget amendment would force perverse actions \n     by Congress, easily turning a small recession into a big one \n     and a big one into a disaster. Monetary policy can solve the \n     small problems, but not the big ones.\n\n  Mr. President, if we are to have a constitutional amendment, I \nbelieve we must have special provision for an economic emergency.\n  I end on this note, a quote from Henry Aaron, the director of \neconomic studies at the Brookings Institution. Dr. Aaron, in testimony \nlast year said:\n\n       One does not need to be a primitive Keynesian to believe \n     that a requirement forcing tax increases or spending cuts \n     during an economic slowdown could be catastrophic.\n\n  Catastrophic, Mr. President--\n\n     Yet the need to mobilize a three-fifths majority, not just in \n     the Senate but in the House of Representatives as well, \n     heightens the possibility that such policies would result \n     because of incapacity to mobilize the necessary supermajority \n     in both Houses.\n\n  Mr. President, some have assured Members ``Don't worry. If we are in \nan economic emergency, you will be able to get 60 votes.'' Mr. \nPresident, I went back to the time leading into World War II when the \neconomy of this country was in deep trouble, when we faced an enormous \nexternal threat. I found an interesting thing. When we needed $1 \nbillion to start to rebuild the Navy of this country, that passed by \nonly 58 votes. When we needed to start to have a draft to prepare for \nwar, that passed by only 56 votes.\n  [[Page S3233]] Mr. President, I think it is very clear that we cannot \ntake the assurance that in an emergency we would be able to muster the \n60 votes.\n  Mr. President, let me just conclude by saying I believe deeply that \nwe must address the debt threat hanging over this country. We must cut \nspending. We must reduce the deficit. We must balance the budget in \npreparation for the time when the baby boom generation starts to \nretire, the Social Security expenses and Medicare and all the rest \nstart to explode.\n  Mr. President, we are talking about amending the Constitution of the \nUnited States. We should only do it if we are absolutely convinced we \nare properly crafting such an amendment. The three concerns that I have \nraised must be addressed if this amendment is to secure my vote.\n  We should not loot the Social Security trust fund because that is not \nbalancing the budget. That is a paper sham. That is wrong. We should \nnot leave the role of the courts vague and ambiguous. No unelected \njudges should be writing the budget for the United States, raising \ntaxes, cutting spending. That would subvert the genius of the \nConstitution. Third, I believe we must have provision for an economic \nemergency so that we do not put our great Nation at risk at a time of \neconomic weakness and vulnerability.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. I look very much \nforward to what the day will bring. I hope that we are able to come \ntogether and craft an amendment that will stand the test of time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, how much time am I allowed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator controls 73 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Chair notify me when I have used 12 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, sir.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, my support of a balanced budget amendment \ngoes back to the 95th Congress.\n  In the last Congress, I did not perceive the willingness of Congress \nto consider all expenditures in order to achieve a balanced budget and \ndid not support this amendment at that time.\n  Now, it is my belief that the changes in Congress and in the attitude \nof the country as a whole have brought a new commitment to consider all \nFederal expenditures, including entitlements. There is no question that \nthe passage of this amendment is important to the Nation as a whole. \nThat is particularly true to small States such as Alaska, and other \nStates in the West.\n  We believe Congress must operate under fiscal restraint, restraint \nthat is missing from the Federal budget process at this time. I am \ninformed that next September the current Federal debt limit of $4.9 \ntrillion will be reached. Congress may have to vote to increase that \nFederal debt limit above $5 trillion or face the prospect of shutting \ndown the Federal Government and defaulting upon our obligations.\n  Default is an unthinkable option for a Nation like the United States. \nBut I do not believe that I could in good conscience vote to increase \nthe debt limit unless this Nation adopts a plan to balance the budget \nand end unnecessary deficit spending.\n  Based upon President Clinton's 1996 budget, 16 percent of the total \nFederal budget for this next fiscal year will be required to pay \ninterest on that $4.9 trillion dollar national debt. The President's \nbudget also requests and projects 16 percent of the total Federal \nbudget to go to support of our national defense, 15 percent to grants \nto States and localities, and 5 percent to go to the operation of \nFederal agencies.\n  In my judgment, interest payments are competing now with the national \ndefense. Our national defense is the second largest expenditure of \nFederal funds, second only to the direct benefit payments to \nindividuals. This national debt is a real threat. Left unchecked, \nincreased interest payments will endanger every Federal program.\n  In the past, and particularly last year, I expressed concern that \nentitlement programs would not be included in any efforts to balance \nthe budget and that the necessary cuts would come from the remaining 36 \npercent of the budget. I was concerned that discretionary spending \nwould bear all of the cuts.\n  It was my expressed fear that small States, like Alaska, would be \nseverely and unfairly impacted by those cuts in discretionary spending. \nCuts of the magnitude required to balance the budget taken solely from \ndiscretionary spending would impose a great burden upon us because of \nthe necessity to have Federal programs--the Coast Guard, the FBI, the \nFAA, and so many other agencies of the Federal Government that provide \nthe safety net for our people--in a State as large and diverse as mine.\n  After giving this issue serious consideration and having discussed \nthe matter seriously with many of my colleagues, I have come to the \nconclusion that it is now the intent of Congress that spending cuts \nwould be fairly applied to all expenditures.\n  Mr. President, we keep track of the calls and letters we receive in \nmy Washington and Alaska offices, and the majority of Alaskans support \na balanced budget amendment. They support it by a margin of 6 to 1, as \nreflected by the calls and letters that have come to my office \nendorsing or opposing the Amendment.\n  The Kerry-Danforth Commission, the Bipartisan Commission on \nEntitlement Reform, identified as one of its five broad principles the \nissue of balancing entitlement commitments with the funds available to \nmeet those promises. If current entitlement policies are left \nunchanged, entitlement spending and interest on the national debt would \nconsume almost all Federal revenues in the year 2010. By the year 2030, \nprojected Federal revenues will not cover entitlement payments.\n  I do not support exempting any specific type of spending in the \nbalanced budget amendment, per se, but I do believe Congress must find \na way to balance the budget without reducing Social Security payments. \nOn February 10, our distinguished majority leader, Senator Dole, \noffered a measure on the Senate floor which calls on the Senate Budget \nCommittee to report to the Senate a plan to protect Social Security \nwhile allowing Congress to balance the budget. I supported that \namendment.\n  According to our Joint Economic Committee, Congress could balance the \nbudget while Government spending increases 2 percent per year without \ntouching Social Security or Medicare and allowing Medicaid to grow at \nthe rate of 5 percent per year. There are some who question that plan, \nbut that is the result of the report by the Joint Economic Committee.\n  It is time for the Federal, State, and local legislative and \nexecutive leaders to work together to find a way or to find ways to cut \nthe fat out of Government without removing its heart. Spending \ndecisions will be more difficult as interest on the national debt \nconsumes a larger portion of Federal revenues.\n  It is my judgment that the Congress and the States must act now to \nratify this balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. There is \nstill time for Federal, State, and local governments to work together, \nas I suggested, to decide how to provide the necessary government \nservices for our people. Our country cannot afford to wait any longer. \nWe must get our fiscal house in order, and we can begin that process \ntoday.\n  I want to urge the Senate, particularly my colleagues who have not \ntaken a position on this amendment, to support it. I shall support this \namendment. I do so in order that, consistent with our Constitution, it \nmay be submitted to the 50 States for ratification and we may begin \nthis process. It will be a long and arduous process, Mr. President, but \nI think the time to commence is now.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask that I be yielded approximately 8 \nminutes from the time reserved for Senator Hatch, the Senator from \nUtah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am pleased to yield to the Senator from Nebraska that \namount of time.\n  [[Page S3234]] Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank my friend from \nAlaska.\n  The constitutional amendment to balance the budget should be viewed \nas an important step in the right direction, but rejected as a certain \ncure-all assuring future sound national fiscal policy. The primary \nbenefit, if passed in Congress and ratified by three-fourths of the \nStates, is the considerable ``discipline''--and I emphasize the word \n``discipline''--that it would provide to correct our current course. We \nveered dangerously off course in the 1980's when we ballooned annual \ndeficits from manageable levels, under $100 billion by increasing it \nthreefold or more. And from 1980 to the present we have skyrocketed the \nnational debt, the culmination of those yearly deficits, fivefold, to \n$5 trillion, and it is going higher.\n  In fiscal year 1996, annual interest on that debt to nontrust fund or \npublic debt costs taxpayers $260 billion, which alarmingly is the \nfastest growing part of our Federal budget. Of that $260 billion in \ninterest costs about a fourth or $65 billion goes to foreign investors. \nTalk about foreign aid give-aways.\n  The $65 billion in interest the taxpayers will pay is shipped \ndirectly overseas, with no strings attached, and it is going up each \nand every year. It is astonishing, Mr. President, when we compare the \n$20 billion that we provide annually for foreign aid, a category that \nwe hear so much about, which is actually going down every year, compare \nthat, if you will, with the $65 billion in taxpayers' money that is \ngoing overseas without any strings attached whatsoever.\n  The facts are that we are giving $45 billion more to foreigners in \ninterest than in aid. If there were no other sound reasons--and there \nare many--the concerns just stated would be reason enough to employ the \ndiscipline that the balanced budget amendment will bring.\n  I salute the many good and reasoned arguments made by opponents in \nopposition to the amendment. Indeed, there are good reasons not to vote \nfor it. I am not satisfied in total with the amendment and I believe it \nshould have been amended in the Senate.\n  The trouble seems to be that the constitutional amendment before us \nhas been Newtonized. Such a description, therefore, makes it infallible \nand unamendable. It is a believe-exactly-as-we-do-or perish philosophy \nthat is dangerous.\n  It is required that Republicans and the Democrats alike simply roll \nover and play dead for the good of the new order.\n  Mr. President, this is a very important day in the history of the \nU.S. Senate. Today, at the Republican caucus, the decision will be made \nas to whether or not a reasonable compromise will be accepted. That is \nthe last real chance for success.\n  Notwithstanding what will be reported Tuesday evening--today--this \namendment will not be approved--I emphasize, will not be approved--\nunless it is on a bipartisan basis. We can garner the minimum 67 votes \nto pass it--and the numbers I have indicate that it should be 52 \nRepublicans and 15 Democrats--if we accept some version of the \nDanforth-Johnston-Nunn, et al., amendment. That concept is to keep the \ncourts out of budgeting and agree to address some of the Social \nSecurity trust fund concerns that have been expressed on the floor most \nrecently by my colleague from North Dakota a few moments ago. If we do \nnot do that, it will not, and, in such an event, the responsibility for \nfailure will rest on our inability to compromise just a little bit.\n  We can still pass this constitutional amendment if there is just a \nlittle give and a little concern. Despite the many seemingly \nunsurmountable hurdles, I am encouraged that, after a series of \ndiscussions of last Friday, yesterday and this morning, we may well be \nclose to resolving enough of the more contentious issues to see success \ntoday. But I am not sure.\n  The key vote, Mr. President, on whether or not we can pass a \nconstitutional amendment will come today on the Nunn amendment \nregarding concerns about court involvement. If that fails, I predict we \nwill not garner the 67 votes for the balanced budget amendment. In that \ncase, the final vote will just be an exercise to establish how many \nvotes short of the required 67 that the constitutional amendment \nrequires.\n  Mr. President, I think we are about some very, very serious business. \nI have previously said on many occasions why I support the \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget, with some reservations.\n  At this time, I appeal for reason and I appeal somehow to give and \ntake a little bit, to compromise on one or two very important issues. \nIf that happens and it is approved in the Republican caucus today, we \ncan go on to success with the balanced budget amendment. If not, we \nwill live to regret it, in the view of this Senator.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and yield back the remainder of any \ntime that I had reserved on my original request.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, with the \ntime divided equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I understand the distinguished Senator from Texas would \nlike some time. How much time would the Senator like, 10 minutes?\n  Mr. GRAMM. What about 15?\n  Mr. HATCH. We are pressed for time. I yield 10 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank our distinguished colleague from \nUtah for yielding me time.\n  Mr. President, today we have an opportunity to change the course of \nAmerican history. I guess each of us in our own way came into public \nlife because we wanted to make historic decisions. I think it is fair \nto say that every Member of the Senate initially ran for office because \nhe or she wanted to make a difference in the lives of the people in \ntheir State and across this country. We have an opportunity today in \none vote to rewrite the history of the United States of America. That \none vote is adopting a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution of \nthe United States of America.\n  I would like to talk today about what happens if we do not pass a \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution, and to also talk about \nwhat happens if we do, not in abstract terms but in concrete terms that \nhave to do with the well-being of the forgotten people in America who \ndo the work, pay the taxes, pull the wagon, and who ought to be the \nfocal point of this debate, but unfortunately are not.\n  Then I wish to touch very briefly on some of the arguments that are \nbeing made against the amendment. First of all, I think we have to \nunderstand that Government spending means Government taxing. In 1950, \nthe average American family with two children sent $1 out of every $50 \nit earned to Washington, DC. Today, that same family is sending $1 out \nof every $4 it earns to Washington, DC, and in 20 years, if we do not \ncreate a single new Federal program, if we simply pay for the \nGovernment that is already on the books, that family is going to be \nsending $1 out of every $3 it earns to Washington, DC.\n  It seems to me we have come to the moment of truth where either we \nare going to stay on this 40-year spending spree and squander the \nfuture of our children or we are going to the spending so as to save \nthe American dream. That is the choice we make today.\n  Since 1950, the Federal Government's budget has grown 2\\1/2\\ times as \nfast as the family budget. Since 1950, the Government has spent money \nat a rate 2\\1/2\\ times as fast as the institution in America which \ncreated the income that the Government spent, the American family.\n  Now, what difference has it made over the last 40 years that \nGovernment spending has grown 2\\1/2\\ times as fast as family spending? \nLet me give you a startling statistic. If the ability of the family to \nspend the money it earned had grown as fast as the ability of \nGovernment to spend the money the family earned, families in America \ntoday \n[[Page S3235]] would be spending not $45,000 per family of four but \nwould be spending $120,000 per family.\n  Conversely, if Government spending had grown only as rapidly as \nspending by the family, the Federal Government would be roughly one-\nthird the size it is today.\n  When you think about the American dream, when you think about the \nkind of America you want for your children and grandchildren, which \npictures fits your view of America's future: Families with incomes \nthree times as large as they are today and the Government a third the \nsize it is today, or the reverse?\n  It seems to me that the priority of the family's budget over the \nFederal budget is the definition of what we are talking about. The \ndebate here is not a debate about how much money is going to be spent \non education and housing and nutrition and all of the other things that \nwe are all for. The debate is about who is going to do the spending. \nFor many of our colleagues on the left, many of the Democratic Members \nof the Senate, the President of the United States, Bill Clinton, their \nvision for America's future is that they want Government to do the \nspending. Our vision for America's future is that we want the family to \ndo the spending. We know the Government; we know the family; we know \nthe difference; and we know something else. We are betting the future \nof America on the decision we make today. We want to bet the future of \nAmerica on the family and not on the Government.\n  Now, in looking at these mind-numbing figures, since they are so big, \nwe tend to forget that they really mean something. Let me give you some \nfigures. If we adopt and enforce the budget proposed by Bill Clinton, \nthat will mean that in 10 years we are going to be spending $412 \nbillion simply paying interest on the public debt. That is more money \nthan Jimmy Carter's budget for the whole Government of the United \nStates in 1977. That was not that long ago.\n  Let me give you another figure that gives you an idea of the \nmagnitude of the choice we make today. If we do nothing, if we stay \nwith the status quo that Bill Clinton would have us adopt, the interest \ncost on the public debt in a decade is going to rise by $177 billion.\n  Now, nobody knows what $1 billion is except Ross Perot, but let me \nconvert that into English. If we stop the deficit spending, if we did \nnot borrow all that money, we could give every family in America a \n$13,000 tax deduction for the money we are going to squander paying \ninterest on debt simply because this Congress has been incapable of \nsaying no to any special interest group with a letterhead that has \nasked for our money.\n  Now, I wish to address very briefly some of the arguments that are \nmade against the amendment. One argument, which many of us heard this \nweekend on television, is that deficit spending is a powerful medicine \nthat can cure recessions, that can cure depressions, and if we lost the \nability to use this medicine we might forever be pushed into a great \nrecession and a great depression.\n  Mr. President, deficit spending is a drug to which we have become \naddicted. We have engaged in deficit expenditures in expansions, in \ncontractions, in recessions, in inflations, and if deficit spending \never had any curative power, that curative power has long ago been \nlost.\n  We debate today whether to end this addiction to deficit spending. We \ndebate today whether or not to force the Government to do what every \nfamily and every business in America has to do, and that is say no.\n  Finally, let me try to set this in perspective. Balancing the Federal \nbudget is not going to be easy. It is going to mean hard choices. It is \ncertainly not going to be easy for Members of Congress. But we cannot \nforget the benefits to be derived for the future of America in terms of \nopportunity and growth, and we must not forget what this means in terms \nof freedom. We should not get so caught up in the dollars and cents of \nthe deficit and the budget debate that we forget that what is being \nsquandered here is not just our money, it is our freedom. Government \nhas grown so big, so powerful, so expensive, so distant, so hostile \nthat this is a process that has to be reversed and we have it within \nour power today to do it. We all stand here on the floor of the Senate \nand wring our hands about the deficit. To balance the Federal budget \nmeans we have to freeze Government spending at its current level for 3 \nyears.\n  How many businesses in America have made tougher choices than that \njust to keep their doors open in the last year? How many families in \nAmerica have had to make tougher choices than that when a job was lost \nor when a parent died? The difference is that families and businesses \nin America live in the real world where you have to say no, where bad \nthings happen, where you have to make adjustments, where you have to \nchange.\n  Change is a fact of life everywhere except in Washington, DC, in \nAmerica. Our Government has not lived in the real world for 40 years. \nWe have it within our power today to change that. We have it within our \npower to pull our Government into the real world with our people, and \nin doing so enrich the lives of millions of Americans who want the kind \nof opportunity that has been routine in the American experience.\n  If we can adopt the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution \ntoday, we will change the course of the history of our Nation. And I am \nprayerfully hopeful that when our colleagues cast this vote they will \nrealize we are shooting with real bullets and we are determining the \nfuture of the greatest country that the world has ever known.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I do want to point out for the record \non the floor of the U.S. Senate, as I listened to my colleague from \nTexas speak about special interests, that I introduced an amendment \nseveral weeks ago, with Senator Feingold from Wisconsin, which said \nthat when we go forward with deficit reduction and continue on this \npath of deficit reduction and reach the goal of balancing the budget, \nwe should consider $425 billion--that is in any given year--of tax \nexpenditures, many of which are loopholes and deductions and sometimes \noutright giveaways to the largest corporations and financial \ninstitutions in America. That amendment was voted down on the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  So it is interesting how children are a special interest, somehow \nwith a negative connotation. Older Americans are a special interest, \nsomehow with a negative connotation. Students who are trying to afford \nhigher education are a special interest, sometimes with a negative \nconnotation. But, on the other hand, subsidies for oil companies, the \nsubsidies for coal companies, subsidies for pharmaceutical companies--\nthey are not special interests at all. I think that has something to do \nwith who are the heavy hitters, who has the representation, who does \nthe lobbying, who has the power, who is well represented and who is \nleft out.\n  I have been very involved in this debate and today there is just time \nfor a few concluding remarks or reflections. At the very beginning of \nthis 104th Congress I came to the floor with an amendment from my State \nof Minnesota. This amendment essentially said, based upon a resolution \npassed by my State legislature and signed by Governor Carlson, which \nurged that before we send a balanced budget amendment to the States, if \nit is passed, we ought to do an analysis for States of the impact on \nour States and of the people back in Minnesota and across the country. \nThat was voted down. Similar amendments were also voted down.\n  There are other amendments that were very important to this effort to \nimprove this constitutional amendment to balance the budget--very \nimportant. There was an amendment to make sure that there would not be \na raid on the Social Security trust funds. That was voted down. There \nwas an amendment, as I mentioned, that Senator Feingold and I \nintroduced, that urged that we at least consider some of the tax \nsubsidies and giveaways to the largest corporations of America, the \nwealthiest people, as part of what we do in deficit reduction. Let us \nnot just cut nutrition programs for children or Medicare. That was \nvoted down. There \n[[Page S3236]] was an amendment introduced on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate that said--and it makes good, rigorous economic sense--let us \nseparate capital budgets from operating budgets. If we are going to \nmake a comparison to family budgets, then let's really look closely at \nthe similarities and differences. Sheila and I have never cash flowed \nthe homes we've bought. We did not cash flow education for our \nchildren, higher education. And we did not cash flow cars. Those were \ninvestments in the future. We certainly have done a good job of \nbalancing our budget every month, if that means keeping up with our \npayments. The same thing is true of most of the State legislatures in \nthis country. So the point was to make some separation.\n  There was an important amendment that said in times of recession let \nus not have those recessions become depressions. This is rigorous \neconomic analysis. I say this as someone with an interest and a \nbackground in political economy. That was voted down. We do have to be \nconcerned about the economics and the economic management of our \nNation.\n  There were other amendments as well. I had a sense of the Senate \namendment that we would not do anything to increase hunger or \nhomelessness among children. That was voted down.\n  I have to say, I am acutely aware of what is politically popular at \nthe moment. This constitutional amendment to balance the budget is \npolitically popular at the moment. It is politically popular in the \nabstract. But people do not yet know what the specifics are. There has \nnot been any truth in budgeting with this. I do not believe people have \nyet had a chance to look at all of the consequences of it.\n  So my position remains the same position. I was sent to the U.S. \nSenate from Minnesota to listen closely to people. I was sent to the \nU.S. Senate from Minnesota to stay close to people. But I also said to \npeople in Minnesota that I would always vote my conscience. I would \nalways vote what I believed was right for my Nation. I would always \nvote what I believed was right for the people I represented--even if it \nwas a difficult political vote, even if it was politically unpopular at \nthe moment, even if I was subject to attack ads and other criticism for \nmy vote.\n  I will not back down from that. I will continue to go by that code. \nAnd it is my honest view, it is my profound sense that this \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget is a very serious \nmistake for a Nation that I love and for a State that I love.\n  And therefore for all the reasons I have outlined during this debate \nover the last month, I will vote no.\n  (Disturbance in the visitors' galleries.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The gallery will please withhold any display.\n  Thank you.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 274\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent my amendment \nbe the pending business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a \nsubstitute amendment to House Joint Resolution 1, the balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment.\n  I support a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, and I \nwould like to see this body pass such an amendment. However, as I have \npreviously stated, I do not believe that the House-passed amendment, \nthe amendment being considered by the Senate, is the right amendment \nfor this country.\n  With Senators Ford, Hollings, McCain, Mikulski, Kohl, Harkin, \nDaschle, Dorgan, Reid, and Graham of Florida, I, therefore, offer my \ncolleagues--both Republican and Democratic--a substitute.\n  The substitute I am offering today is a balanced budget amendment to \nthe Constitution that will permanently exempt Social Security from the \ncalculations. It will protect this fund, holding in trust the money \ndeducted from American workers' paychecks every week until they are \nready to use them in retirement.\n  The amendment does not alter any other aspect of House Joint \nResolution 1--not a single item. It merely exempts Social Security--it \nis an honest balanced budget amendment--a balanced budget amendment \nwhich can pass.\n  Unfortunately, this body has steadfastly refused to make any changes \nto the original balanced budget amendment submitted to the Senate \ndespite hours of good debate--especially on the establishment of \ncapital budgeting procedures, with which I agree, the removal of Social \nSecurity from the budget, and attempts by both Senators Johnston and \nNunn to clarify the areas of legal redress under this amendment. The \nleadership has merely posed the same amendment which the House passed \nand asked that we rubberstamp it here in the Senate. I find this \napproach both unacceptable and puzzling.\n  This Senate has been involved in 1 month of detailed and incisive \ndebate of this subject. Virtually all amendments have been defeated. No \nmatter how salient or cogent points raised have been, they have been \nrejected. Apparently, the only acceptable amendment is the one \npresented. No changes can be made no matter how correct or compelling \nthe criticism.\n  Now, while I believe a balanced budget is the correct policy decision \nfor this country--I do not believe we must pass any amendment just \nbecause a few have ordained this to be the amendment. It is our duty in \nthe Senate to weigh all legislative matters carefully. Amending the \nConstitution is a serious historical task which demands the thought and \nwisdom of all of us here in the Senate. I was elected by the people of \nCalifornia to represent their interests in the Senate. I was not \nelected to genuflect to a measure simply because it was passed by the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  At this point in our history, we should not be altering the \nlegislative process. This body should not be simply a rubberstamp to a \nmeasure ramrodded through the other House. We should be examining all \npieces of legislation independently from the House. This deliberation \nincludes altering and amending legislation to fit the needs of \nAmericans as we see them--I believe that the balanced budget amendment \nbeing offered by Republicans does not best serve as a correct \nmethodology for balancing the budget.\n  Mr. President, I have stated previously my reasons for strongly \nsupporting a constitutional balanced budget amendment. In the year that \nI was born, the Federal debt amounted to less than $25 billion. In the \nyear my daughter was born, the Federal debt was about $225 billion--10 \ntimes greater. My granddaughter Eileen was born 2 years ago. At the \ntime of her birth, the Federal debt was more than 150 times greater \nthan it was when I was born--nearly $4 trillion.\n  In the last 35 years, the Federal Government has balanced its budget \nexactly twice. Once in 1960, a surplus of $300 million and again in \n1969, a surplus of $3.2 billion.\n  Yet, in the last quarter of a century, the Federal Government has run \nup more than $4 trillion in debt without once balancing the budget. \nDuring this time, this Nation has experienced war and peace and \neconomic booms and recessions. Never did this Government balanced the \nFederal budget, let alone run a surplus.\n  One fact is inescapable--spending in this country has grown out of \ncontrol, and we have let the Federal debt grow at a rate that is \nunacceptable. That is why I am a strong supporter of a constitutional \nbalanced budget amendment. We do not have another generation to allow \nthis problem to fester. The time for action is now. But equally \nimportant to the need for a solution is its workability in the future.\n  There are four important arguments for protecting Social Security:\n  First, this amendment would place Social Security off-budget, thereby \nenshrining into the Constitution congressional action and guaranteeing \nthe integrity of the system.\n  Between its creation in 1935 and 1969, Social Security had always \nbeen off-budget. In an attempt to cover the \n[[Page S3237]] costs of the Vietnam war and later to mask growing \ndeficits, Social Security was put on-budget. This was a misuse of the \nSocial Security trust fund. In the 1990 Budget Enforcement Act, \nCongress put an end to this practice by declaring Social Security funds \noff-budget. The amendment in the Senate to exclude Social Security from \nbudget calculations was passed in the 101st Congress by a vote of 98-2. \nEvery Member today who served in the 101st Congress voted to place \nSocial Security off-budget.\n  Second, Social Security is not like other Government programs and \nshould not be treated like other Government programs.\n  Social Security is a publicly administered, compulsory, contributory \nretirement system. Through the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, \nknown as FICA, workers are required to contribute 6.2 percent of their \nsalaries to Social Security. Every worker does this. Employers are \nrequired to match that amount. Every employer does this. This combined \n12.4-percent contribution funds the Social Security system. It is not \nmeant to fund Interior, or Agriculture, or Defense, or HUD, or welfare, \nor anything else. By law these funds are required to be held by the \nFederal Government in trust. They are not the Federal Government's \nfunds, but contributions that workers pay in and expect to get back.\n  Over 58 percent of working Americans pay more in FICA taxes, if you \ninclude the employers' share, than they pay in Federal income taxes. \nThis is not a small amount, and it is not adjusted by salary.\n  Third, Social Security does not contribute to the Federal deficit. In \nfact, the Social Security trust fund surpluses are masking the true \nsize of the deficit today. In 1995, Social Security will take in $69 \nbillion more than it will pay out in benefits. By 2001, Social Security \nwill be running surpluses of more than $100 billion a year. By the time \nthis amendment goes in place, in 2002, the surplus in the Social \nSecurity System will be $705 billion.\n  Fourth, the failure to save Social Security surpluses could undermine \nthe system's viability.\n  In the late 1970's and 1980's, Congress changed the way the Social \nSecurity System was financed. Recognizing the large demand on the \nsystem that would be created by the retirement of the baby boomer \ngeneration early next century, the Social Security System was changed \nfrom a pay-as-you-go system to a system that would accumulate large \nsurpluses now to prepare for the vast increase in the number of \nretirees later.\n  The amendment being offered by the Republicans permits the collected \nfunds to be used to finance the deficit. That means beginning in 2019, \nwhen Social Security is supposed to begin drawing down its accumulated \nsurpluses to pay for the benefits of the vast numbers of retiring baby \nboomers, there will be no money saved to distribute.\n  Congress will be forced to either raise taxes, cut Social Security \nbenefits, or further cut other spending programs to meet the \nobligations workers are paying for now. In short, the American workers \nwill have to pay twice for the retirement of the baby boomers because \nwe will not be saving what they contribute now.\n  The only way to save the Social Security surpluses to pay for future \nretirements is to balance the budget exclusive of these revenues, and \nthat is what this amendment would do.\n  The impact of this, of course, would be that the Federal Government \nwould run a unified budget surplus--a balanced Federal budget and a \nsurplus in the Social Security trust fund. In this way, we would cut \nthe Federal debt and save Social Security funds, not just watch the \ndebt keep growing. The alternative balanced budget amendment being \noffered today will do just that.\n  On February 17, the Times Mirror released its latest public interest \npoll. I think every Senator here should be aware of the results. When \nasked what should be given a higher priority in 1995, cutting taxes or \ntaking steps to reduce the budget deficit, 55 percent want to reduce \nthe deficit while 37 percent want to cut taxes for the middle class. \nNow, this supports the argument which we all are making for the \nbalanced budget amendment. The American public wants to reduce the \ndeficit; balancing the budget is the best way to do just that.\n  But this question is only one part of the story. When asked if it was \nmore important to reduce the budget or keep Social Security and \nMedicare benefits as they are, the respondents favored keeping Social \nSecurity benefits as they are by a 70 to 24 percent margin. Let me say \nthat again, 70 percent of the American public favors protecting Social \nSecurity while only 24 percent want to reduce the deficit at the \nexpense of Social Security. This amendment we are offering will satisfy \nboth of these desires.\n  Just last week, on February 23, I received a letter from the AARP \nsupporting the protection of Social Security. Let me quote some of it:\n\n       The Association believes that a specific exemption for \n     Social Security is required because anything less is \n     inadequate and nonbinding. Without an exemption the program \n     is at risk in several ways. First, benefits could be cut to \n     reach the balanced budget goal even though money from such \n     unwarranted reductions would remain in the Social Security \n     trust funds. This would have the affect of further masking \n     the deficit at the expense of Social Security beneficiaries. \n     Just as important the benefit promise to today's workers will \n     be jeopardized because the annual reserve will continue to be \n     used to hide the extent of the Federal deficit.\n\n  The letter concludes by stating:\n\n       During the most recent election, candidates and the \n     leadership of both political parties pledged to protect \n     Social Security. The American people have grown angry and \n     wary of promises from Washington. To tell the American public \n     that Social Security is protected--and then fail to address \n     the issue directly--will only lead to an increase in the \n     cynicism that is currently prevalent throughout the Nation.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na copy of this letter, along with a letter I received on February 1 \nfrom the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare \nsupporting this amendment to protect the Social Security.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           American Association of\n\n\n                                               Retired Persons\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 23, 1995.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: The American Association of Retired \n     Persons (AARP) appreciates your efforts to protect Social \n     Security from the proposed constitutional amendment to \n     require a balanced budget. Many members of Congress speak \n     about the importance of this program and the need to maintain \n     it for current and future beneficiaries. However, since \n     previous attempts to specifically shield Social Security from \n     the balanced budget amendment have been defeated, your \n     substitute represents the last opportunity to truly protect \n     this vital program before the amendment would be sent to the \n     states.\n       While AARP continues to believe that a requirement for a \n     balanced budget federal budget does not belong in the \n     Constitution, we believe that exempting Social Security is \n     warranted for the following reasons:\n       Social Security is a self sustaining program that is \n     financed by employer and employee contributions that are \n     credited to the Social Security trust funds in order to pay \n     benefits and run the program,\n       Social Security does not contribute one penny to the \n     federal deficit. It currently has over $400 billion in \n     reserve--an amount that is expected to increase by $70 \n     billion this year alone; and\n       Raiding the trust funds would weaken our benefit promise to \n     today's worker, as well as undermine their confidence in our \n     nation's most important protection program.\n       The Association believes that a specific exemption for \n     Social Security is required because anything less is \n     inadequate and nonbinding. Without an exemption the program \n     is at risk in several ways. First, benefits could be cut to \n     reach the balanced budget goal even though the money from \n     such unwarranted reductions would remain in the Social \n     Security trust funds. This would have the affect of further \n     masking the deficit at the expense of Social Security \n     beneficiaries. Just as important, the benefit promise to \n     today's workers will be jeopardized because the annual \n     reserve will continue to be used to hide the extent of the \n     federal deficit. In addition, Section 2 of the proposed \n     amendment treats the Social Security trust funds' government \n     bonds differently than the rest of the debt held by the \n     public. This differentiation could lead to further attempts \n     to use the Social Security trust funds as a cash cow.\n       During the most recent election, candidates and the \n     leadership of both political parties pledged to protect \n     Social Security. The American people have grown angry and \n     wary of promises from Washington. To tell the American public \n     that Social Security is protected--and then fail to address \n     the issue \n     [[Page S3238]] directly--will only lead to an increase in the \n     cynicism that is currently prevalent throughout the nation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Horace B.

Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of the nearly six million \n     members and supporters of the National Committee to Preserve \n     Social Security and Medicare, I offer our strong support for \n     your amendment to remove Social Security trust funds from \n     budget and deficit calculations under the pending balanced \n     budget constitutional amendment, S.J. Res. 1.\n       The National Committee agrees that the future economic \n     growth of this nation will be enhanced if the budget of the \n     United States is brought into balance. However, we strongly \n     disagree that balancing the budget requires putting Social \n     Security at risk by including it in the budget.\n       Balancing the budget requires reasoned decision making and \n     the courage to face up to hard choices. It also requires \n     recognizing the source of the problem. And that, by \n     definition, excludes Social Security. The Social Security \n     program is self-supporting and does not contribute one penny \n     to the deficit. To the contrary, it produces a substantial \n     surplus which Congress has been using to conceal the true \n     size of the deficit. Including Social Security in this \n     balanced budget constitutional amendment makes this budgetary \n     charade much worse by writing it into the Constitution.\n       Amending the Constitution of the United States to \n     legitimize this practice amounts to a breach of trust with \n     the American people. Social Security today is exactly what it \n     was established to be almost sixty years ago--a publicly \n     administered, compulsory, contributory retirement program. \n     Treating Social Security as just one more federal expenditure \n     alters the very character of the program in a way that will \n     ultimately undermine the program's great success.\n       Seniors support a balanced budget, but will strongly object \n     to a Constitutional amendment which includes Social Security \n     trust funds in budget and deficit calculations. On behalf of \n     our members, I offer our sincere thanks for your efforts to \n     protect Social Security.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Martha A. McSteen,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will not rehash the arguments lodged against this \nalternative balanced budget amendment at this point except to restate \ntwo important points:\n  First, the opponents of this amendment have repeatedly stated that we \nshould not place a statute in the Constitution. They fear that Congress \nwill have to amend the Constitution every time they enact enabling \nlegislation.\n  This statement is pure hogwash--history has proven that \nconstitutional amendments are inevitably defined by enabling \nlegislation. During my statement on February 9, I displayed 20 volumes \nof the United States Code Annotated related to the 14th amendment. Are \nthe supporters of this argument saying that they are opposed to all \nthis legislation because it does not belong in the Constitution?--I \nthink not.\n  They also believe that the Social Security trust funds can be \nprotected through this same enabling legislation. At this time, I will \nreintroduce to the Record a letter from the American Law Division of \nthe Congressional Research Service. Just to remind my colleagues, let \nme read the reply I received to an inquiry about the ability to protect \nSocial Security in implementing legislation. The letter reads,\n\n       If the proposed amendment was ratified, then Congress would \n     appear to be without the authority to exclude the Social \n     Security trust funds from the calculation of total receipts \n     and outlays under section 1 of the balanced budget amendment.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                   Congressional Research Service,\n\n\n                                      The Library of Congress,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 6, 1995.\n     To: Senator Diane Feinstein\n     Attention: Mark Kadesh\n     From: American Law Division\n     Subject: Whether the Social Security Trust Funds Can Be \n         Excluded from the Calculations Required by the Proposed \n         Balanced Budget Amendment.\n       This is to respond to your request to evaluate whether \n     Congress could by statute or resolution provide that certain \n     outlays or receipts would not be included within the term \n     ``total outlays and receipts'' as used in the proposed \n     Balance Budget Amendment. Specifically, you requested an \n     analysis as to whether the Federal Old-Age and Survivors \n     Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance \n     Trust Fund could be exempted from the calculation necessary \n     to determine compliance with the constitutional amendment \n     proposed in H.J. Res. 1, which provides that total \n     expenditures will not exceed total outlays.\\1\\\n       Section 1 of H.J. Res. 1, as placed on the Senate Calendar, \n     provides that total outlays for any fiscal year will not \n     exceed total receipts for that fiscal year, unless authorized \n     by three-fifths of the whole number of each House of \n     Congress. The resolution also states that total receipts \n     shall include all receipts of the United States Government \n     except those derived from borrowing, and that total outlays \n     shall include all outlays of the United States Government \n     except for those used for repayment of debt principal. These \n     requirements can be waived during periods of war or serious \n     threats to national security.\n       Under the proposed language, it would appear that the \n     receipts received by the United States which go to the \n     Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the \n     Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund would be included in \n     the calculations of total receipts, and that payments from \n     those funds would similarly be considered in the calculation \n     of total outlays. This is confirmed by the House Report \n     issued with H.J. Res. 1.\\2\\ Thus, if the proposed amendment \n     was ratified, then Congress would appear to be without the \n     authority to exclude the Social Security Trust Funds from the \n     calculations of total receipts and outlays under section 1 of \n     the amendment.\\3\\\n\n                                            Kenneth R.

Res. 16, 104th Congress, 1st Sess. (January 27, 1995) \n     provides the following proposed constitutional amendment--\n     Section 1. Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed \n     total receipts for that fiscal year, unless three-fifths of \n     the whole number of each House of Congress shall provide by \n     law for a specific excess of outlays over receipts by a \n     rollcall vote.\n     Section 2. The limit on the debt of the United States held by \n     the public shall not be increased, unless three-fifths of the \n     whole number of each House shall provide by law for such an \n     increase by a rollcall vote.\n     Section 3. Prior to each fiscal year, the President shall \n     transmit to the Congress a proposed budget for the United \n     States Government for that fiscal year in which total outlays \n     do not exceed total receipts.\n     Section 4. No bill to increase revenue shall become law \n     unless approved by a majority of the whole number of each \n     House by a rollcall vote.\n     Section 5. The Congress may waive the provisions of this \n     article for any fiscal year in which a declaration of war is \n     in effect. The provisions of this article may be waived for \n     any fiscal year in which the United States is engaged in \n     military conflict which causes an imminent and serious \n     military threat to national security and is so declared by a \n     joint resolution, adopted by a majority of the whole number \n     of each House, which becomes law.\n     Section 6. The Congress shall enforce and implement this \n     article by appropriate legislation, which may rely on \n     estimates of outlays and receipts.\n     Section 7. Total receipts shall include all receipts of the \n     United States Government except those derived from borrowing. \n     Total outlays shall include all outlays of the United States \n     Government except for those for repayment of debt principal.\n     Section 8. This article shall take effect beginning with \n     fiscal year 2002 or with the second fiscal year beginning \n     after its ratification, whichever is later.\n     \\2\\House Rept. 104-3, 104th Congress, 1st Session states the \n     following: ``The Committee concluded that exempting Social \n     Security from computations of receipts and outlays would not \n     be helpful to Social Security beneficiaries. Although Social \n     Security accounts are running a surplus at this time, the \n     situation is expected to change in the future with a Social \n     Security related deficit developing. If we exclude Social \n     Security from balanced budget computations, Congress will not \n     have to make adjustments elsewhere in the budget to \n     compensate for this projected deficit. . . .'' (Id. at 11.)\n     it should also be noted that an amendment by Representative \n     Frank to exempt the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance \n     Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund \n     from total receipts and total outlays was defeated in \n     committee by a 16-19 rollcall vote. Id. at 14. A similar \n     amendment by Representative Conyers was defeated in the \n     House, 141 Cong. Rec. H741 (daily ed. January 23, 1995), as \n     was an amendment by Representative Wise. Id. at H731.\n     \\3\\Although the Congress is given the authority to implement \n     this article by appropriate legislation, there is no \n     indication that the Congress would have the authority to pass \n     legislation which conflicts with the provisions of the \n     amendment.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Second, I recognize that the exclusion of Social \nSecurity will make it harder to balance the budget. Taking Social \nSecurity off budget will require about $3 trillion more in spending \ncuts by the year 2017. However, the alternative of leaving Social \nSecurity on budget allows Social Security funds to be stolen to avoid \nspending cuts. When the baby-boomer generation begins to retire, there \nwill not be any funds available for them to collect.\n  In order to address this valid concern, I believe a capital budget \nshould be established to assure continued Federal investments in major \npublic physical assets. Instituting a capital budget would more than \noffset the effects of moving Social Security from the budget. However, \nI was not permitted to offer this alternative. I was hoping that we \nwould have been able to vote on this alternative. However, the Senate \nwas denied that opportunity by an \n[[Page S3239]] objection from the other side of the aisle. It is rather \nironic--we are considering amending our Constitution--the great \nprotector of free speech--and my speech was stifled, squashed, and \ncensored.\n  In conclusion, I do not believe that the working men and women of \nthis country are well served if we take the FICA tax moneys that they \nbelieve will be available for their retirements and use them to balance \nthe budget. That is wrong. It is dishonest. It masks the debt. It \nbetrays people. And it jeopardizes the retirements of future \ngenerations. I will not break the trust of the American people.\n  I urge my fellow Senators to vote for this honest balanced budget \namendment. I want to see a balanced budget amendment pass this Senate.\n  This amendment can pass--there are enough Senators in this body who \nsupport a balanced budget amendment to pass this version.\n  However, if Senators wish to gamble in an attempt to gather enough \nvotes for House Joint Resolution 1, they can.\n  I, for one, do not wish to take that risk.\n  I will vote for this honest balanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, time is short and I have only a few minutes \nto speak on behalf of the Feinstein substitute balanced budget \namendment, so I'll keep my remarks to the point. As I have said before, \nthe public trusts Congress to keep the Nation's finances in order. \nNowhere is that agreement and that trust more evident or more important \nthan in the governing of the Social Security trust fund. For that \nreason, I have had a great deal of concern about voting for the version \nof the balanced budget amendment that is before the Senate and it is \nthat concern which led me to cosponsor with my colleague from \nCalifornia, a substitute amendment exempting Social Security from the \nequation.\n  The fact is that surpluses in trust funds are being used to hide the \ntrue debt of our Nation. As I mentioned on the floor last Friday, the \nhighway and airport improvement trust funds are being used to hide \ndebt. There are billions of dollars in these funds that are expressly \nraised and set aside for the specific purposes of repairing and \nbuilding either highways or airports. What are they being used for? \nI'll tell you, they are being used to hide the actual level of the \nshortfall that we have around here between what comes in and what goes \nout.\n  The biggest example of this trickery is in Social Security. The other \ntrust funds amount to a few billion dollars apiece, an amount that \npales by comparison to the Social Security fund. From 1994 through the \nyear 2002, the date that the amendment would likely take effect, an \nadditional $706 billion in creative accounting and budgetary illusions \nwill be used to mask the true size of our Nation's red ink. Well, I \nwant to believe that all of us in this body know that these budgetary \nmanipulations are not good for the country and should be stopped. Those \nthat support the Feinstein substitute amendment will actually be doing \nsomething about that.\n  Senator Feinstein's amendment respects the contract our Nation made \nwith its people long ago. It reinforces the Social Security pact, makes \nit stronger, safer, and more secure. By exempting Social Security with \nthe substitute amendment, it secures and fortifies its position as a \nseparate trust fund. Social Security did not cause the deficit, and \nunder our amendment, it will not be used to hide the deficit. Our \namendment demands honest budgeting to get us to a balanced budget.\n  I have heard some argue that this amendment would shield any program \nCongress wanted to protect under the guise of Social Security. This \nsimply is not true. We would require the same mechanisms to change the \nstructure of Social Security as we do today, a 60-vote supermajority to \nwaive the Budget Act.\n  Passage of the much-needed balanced budget amendment could be \nguaranteed if we're only willing to tell the American people that we \nwill not misplace their trust. Working Americans pay into the Social \nSecurity system for the purpose of providing a nest egg in their older \nyears. Perhaps it will give them the freedom and dignity to live \nindependent lives so that they will not be a burden to their children. \nIn any case, these taxes are paid to the Federal Government for \nretirement--not for Government operating expenses.\n  Mr. President, I will yield the floor shortly so that other Senators \nmay speak, but I must add one more thought. Why is it that we have two \nseparate and distinct Houses of Congress? As I always remembered from \nmy history lessons, the Senate and the House are co-equal bodies. If \nthat is the case--and I don't think I will find anyone in the Chamber \nwho will disagree with me--if that is the case, then why are we being \nasked to be a rubberstamp for the House? Certainly most things in life \nare not perfect. The Feinstein substitute is not perfect either, but \nsurely my colleagues must agree that it is better than the present \nlanguage of the balanced budget amendment. Each body is supposed to \nreview the others' actions and try to improve upon them. Surely if \ngiven a chance, the other body will pass the Feinstein amendment \nlanguage. Why don't we give them a chance? Are we afraid of improving \nthis measure? If not, there is no excuse for what has been going on \nhere.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this debate is unnecessary. We have already \ndebated and voted on the substance of this amendment. This amendment is \na substitute balanced budget amendment incorporating the Reid Social \nSecurity amendment, which has already been rejected by the Senate.\n  This issue was debated in committee and it was rejected. Then it was \nbrought to the Senate floor, with only a minor alteration in the \nlanguage, where it was debated and rejected again. Now, we are \nencouraging the same amendment for the third time. I also note Mr. \nPresident, that the distinguished Senator from California voted for the \nbalanced budget amendment last year without a similar amendment on \nSocial Security. Why?\n  We have heard complaints from the opponents of the balanced budget \namendment that things are moving too fast, that we need to take more \ntime, even though we have spent a full month of floor time on this \nconstitutional amendment. Well, if all we are going to do is rehash the \nsame arguments--and indeed the same amendments--over and over, it is \ntime to vote.\n  Every minute of every day that we spend debating the balanced budget \namendment, the debt increases more and more. Over $829 million every \nday. It is right here on my debt tracker chart. And people in \nWashington cannot understand why the American people are so upset at \ntheir Government it is because we do things like this--have repeated \ndebates using the same old arguments on the same amendments we have \nalready disposed of, while the country runs up hundreds of millions of \ndollars of debt every day. Business as usual has got to end.\n  Mr. President, there is only one reason that I can think of for this \namendment to be brought to the floor again. The vote\n on this amendment could be used by some Senators who have promised \ntheir constituents that they would vote in favor of a balanced budget \namendment the political cover to vote against the Balanced budget \namendment. In other words, they can claim that they kept their promise \nto vote for a balanced budget amendment by voting for something of that \nname which has no chance of passing, and then not voting for the one \nthat does. We know this alternative has no chance because we have \nalready had a vote on the modification embodied in this alternative it \nwas rejected.\n\n  Mr. President, such a cover vote was offered last year to help defeat \nthe balanced budget amendment. Like last year's cover alternative, this \nsubstitute amendment is simply a sham, a cover vote to allow Members to \nsay to their constituents--the vast majority of whom want a balanced \nbudget amendment--that they supported a balanced budget amendment, but \none which would obviously fail. Remember that last year, proponents of \nthe real balanced budget amendment were not alone in this assessment. \nThe New York Times agreed. As Adam Clymer wrote in the Times last year.\n\n       The substitute version was intended to serve as a political \n     fig leaf that would allow some Senators to vote for the \n     measure and them, after its near-certain defeat, vote against \n     the original version and still tell \n     [[Page S3240]] constituents they had supported a balanced \n     budget amendment.--Option May Doom Budget Amendment (for Now) \n     The New York Times, Friday, February 25, 1994, page A14.\n\n  More interesting, and more damning, is the fact that one of the key \nadministration opponents of the balanced budget amendment suggested \ndays before the introduction of last year's cover amendment that such \ntactics would be necessary to beat the real amendment. On February 18 \nof last year, Leon Panetta, President Clinton's then Director of the \nOffice of\n Management and Budget, now his Chief of Staff, and a longtime foe of a \nbalanced budget amendment, has this to say:\n\n       If you allow people to say, ``Are you for or against a \n     balanced budget,'' you'll lose it.\n\n  He explained that--\n\n       There are going to be some members who are going to have to \n     have an alternative proposal that they can vote for in order \n     to give them cover to come out against the [original] \n     proposal.\n\n  Describing the process of developing sufficient cover for Members, \nMr. Panetta further explained that--\n\n       You're basically counting votes and you're basically saying \n     to members, ``What do you need?'' To the extent that a member \n     says, ``I need a constitutional amendment'' * * * you \n     probably have to design an alternative amendment to the \n     Constitution that would in some way protect them.\n\n  Well, Mr. President, here they go again. Given the fact that this is \nthe only complete substitute alternative balanced budget amendment, and \ngiven that the only change from the real balanced budget amendment is \nthe addition of Social Security language already debated at length and \nrejected, the purpose of this amendment can be no other than a cover \nvote. Well, Mr. President, the American people will not be fooled by \nthis. They want a real balanced budget amendment, and they want it \npassed now.\n  Let me repeat for the record, that I believe this amendment would not \nhelp Social Security recipients. In fact this amendment would create an \nincentive to call as much of the budget Social Security as a clever \nCongress could get away with. This would gut the balanced budget \namendment, destroy Social Security, and keep us on the path to economic \nruin. The real threat to Social Security is our mounting debt. If we \ncan get that under control with the help of a real balanced budget \namendment, only then will Social Security and any other Government \nprogram be safe, and only then will our Nation's economic future be \nbrighter, rather than darker, for all our generations.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to table this alternative to the \nreal balanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. NUNN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 300, as Modified.\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment \nNo. 300 be modified by the amendment I now send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 300), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 3, line 3, after the period insert: ``The judicial \n     power of the United States shall not extend to any case or \n     controversy arising under this Article except as may be \n     specifically authorized by legislation adopted pursuant to \n     this section.''\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from New \nYork.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, at the outset of this very important \nday, I rise to speak not to the particulars of our budget and our \nbudget problems, but to the risk which we take with the entire economy \nby the measure proposed before us; a measure that would place in the \nConstitution a set of propositions that are essentially contrary to \neverything we have learned about the management of a modern industrial \neconomy in this extraordinary half century since the enactment of the \nEmployment Act of 1946.\n  I will take the liberty of reading to the Senate a statement issued \nby the Jerome Levy Economics Institute of Bard College at Annandale-on-\nHudson, NY, written by some of the finest economists gathered together \nin any site in the country today. It was placed as an advertisement in \nthe Washington Post, a rare and unprecedented event for the persons \ninvolved, but a measure of their sense of urgency. It is headed, sir, \n``An Invitation to Disaster.'' It reads:\n\n       The balanced budget amendment would destroy the ability of \n     the United States government to prevent economic depressions, \n     to respond to natural disasters, to protect the savings of \n     tens of millions of working Americans, and, over time, to \n     enable the economy to grow.\n       The ability of the federal government to pump money into an \n     ailing economy has time and again in the postwar era limited \n     the depth and duration of a recession and prevented a \n     depression. During the 1957-58 recession, the Eisenhower \n     administration deliberately increased the deficit.\n\n  And from that moment on, sir--and I can say I came to Washington as \nan Assistant Secretary of Labor, policy planning and research, which \nwas on the periphery but still very much involved, and took a place in \nthe economic response of the Kennedy administration to the recession of \n1961, which followed that of the Eisenhower administration that was \nfollowed on in the next decade by that of the Nixon administration. We \nhave gone, sir, 50 years with only one recession that brought us to a \nsignificant negative economic growth, which was a 2.2-percent drop in \n1982--50 years. It was the great crisis of capitalism which shook the \nworld, shook our country, because we could not manage the business \ncycle, and have yielded to understanding, to discourse, to evidence. It \nwas a bipartisan, immensely successful experience to save everything we \nhold most valuable about a free-enterprise, private-market economy.\n  We put this in jeopardy. It is an invitation to disaster. The New \nYork Newsday, in an editorial this morning, speaks of an ``Unbalanced \nIdea'' and refers to the chart that I have several times shown on the \nfloor of the huge swings, boom and bust, starting from the 1890's, the \npanic of 1893, leading up to the postwar period of almost unbroken--the \nbusiness cycle is moderate and the growth is continuous. That chart, \nsays Newsday, ``tells it all.'' In part, it reads:\n\n       Since World War II, this country has enjoyed 50 years of \n     economic stability unmatched in modern U.S. history. \n     Recessions have been shorter and shallower, periods of growth \n     markedly longer than during the half century before the war.\n       That's largely because government spending has expanded, \n     which works to fill in some of the gaps when recessions hit * \n     * *.\n\n  We have automatic anticyclical measures. It says in this provision \nthat we can anticipate and we can vote with a supermajority to raise \nthe debt ceilings and such like. No. Mr. President, recessions in our \ncountry have not occurred until the dating committee of the National \nBureau of Economic Research announced that they happened. In the \nmeantime, the automatic adjustments have been responding long before \nanybody is aware of an economic decline.\n  Mr. President, we know this. President after President has understood \nit. The time has come to say we understand it as well and reject the \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of \nthese remarks, we have printed in the Record the statement of the \nJerome Levy Economics Institute; the statement of the New York Newsday, \nan ``Unbalanced Idea''; and above all, the lead editorial in today's \nWashington Post, sir, which says it all. It is entitled, ``The Urgency \nof Political Courage.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 27, 1995]\n\n                       An Invitation to Disaster\n\n       The Balanced Budget Amendment would destroy the ability of \n     the United States government to prevent economic depressions, \n     to respond to natural disasters, to protect the savings of \n     tens of millions of working Americans, and, over time, to \n     enable the economy to grow.\n       The ability of the federal government to pump money into an \n     ailing economy has time and again in the postwar era limited \n     the depth and duration of a recession and prevented a \n     depression. During the 1957-58 \n     [[Page S3241]] recession, the Eisenhower administration \n     deliberately increased the deficit. That strategy brought a \n     rapid end to the decline. During every recession thereafter, \n     either by design or through circumstance, a deficit was \n     crucial in containing and ending the decline. For example, \n     tax reductions adopted in 1981 were not planned as a counter-\n     recession tactic, but the enacted cut that took effect in \n     1982 was the key to the recovery that began in that year.\n       Floods in the Midwest, hurricanes in the Southeast, and \n     earthquakes in California during recent years prompted the \n     federal government to spend hundreds of millions to relieve \n     suffering and limit damage. Scientists who study natural \n     phenomena warn against worse disasters. The balanced budget \n     amendment would keep the federal government from dealing with \n     such calamities.\n       Occasional man made disasters have occurred throughout the \n     history of capitalism--for example, the savings and loan \n     debacle of the 1980s. Had the federal government not been \n     able to provide the money to validate the deposits of \n     millions of ordinary citizens, their losses and runs on \n     saving and commercial banking institutions would have \n     recreated 1932. To assume that financial crises will never \n     recur is unrealistic.\n       The balanced budget amendment ignores the nature of our \n     monetary system. The Federal Reserve and the commercial banks \n     issue money against their holdings of federal debt. Under a \n     balanced budget amendment, the debt will not increase. \n     Eventually the system will not be able to create the money \n     the economy needs in order to grow.--The Jerome Levy \n     Economics Institute.\n                                                                    ____\n\n               [From the New York Newsday, Feb. 28, 1995]\n\n               Unbalanced Idea--A Risky Budget Amendment\n\n       The chart that New York's Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan \n     showed the Senate a couple of weeks ago tells it all: Since \n     World War II, this country has enjoyed 50 years of economic \n     stability unmatched in modern U.S. history. Recessions have \n     been shorter and shallower, periods of growth markedly longer \n     than during the half-century before the war.\n       That's largely because government spending has expanded, \n     which works to fill in some of the gaps when recessions hit \n     and private spending contracts. That counterbalance effect \n     will be far harder to achieve if the nation adopts the \n     balanced-budget amendment the U.S. Senate is scheduled to \n     vote on today.\n       So the senators should turn it down. That's too bad, in a \n     way. The federal government has run up its debt to \n     frightening levels during the last 20 years because of its \n     now-routine reliance on deficits--spending more than it takes \n     in--in the bountiful years as well as the bad ones. That \n     should be stopped. But despite President Bill Clinton's \n     effort to change that in his first budget, annual deficits \n     will start growing again in a couple of years.\n       Some formal discipline, such as a constitutional amendment, \n     might give presidents and legislators the cover they need to \n     cut popular spending programs and raise unpopular taxes. ``We \n     have to; it's in the Constitution,'' they could say. But the \n     trouble is that the amendment the Senate votes on today, \n     essentially unchanged from the version passed by the House \n     last month, goes too far the other way. It includes no \n     mechanism to allow deficit spending during recessions--when \n     deficits help to keep economic downturns from getting worse.\n       There is only an allowance for Congress to waive the \n     balance requirement by a supermajority vote. Winning such a \n     waiver would be far from a certainty, and a minority of \n     lawmakers in either house could block it.\n       A realistic mechanism to counter recessions probably could \n     be devised. It's regrettable the Republican leadership took \n     the easier path--the ``just say no to deficits'' approach--\n     instead of a responsible one. As a result, it's the Senate \n     that should just say no, today, to an ill-conceived balanced-\n     budget amendment.\n                                                                    ____\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 28, 1995]\n\n                    The Urgency of Political Courage\n\n       It is hard to decide which would be worse: if the balanced \n     budget amendment that the Senate is voting on today \n     functioned as its sponsors intend, thereby locking the \n     country into what would often be an ill-advised economic \n     policy; or if Congress found a way to duck the command, \n     thereby trivializing the Constitution and creating a \n     permanent monument to political timidity.\n       Take the second possibility. The Constitution of the United \n     States is remarkable because no country in the world has \n     taken its written Constitution so seriously. It is a concise \n     Constitution, and it has not been amended lightly. Other \n     countries have acted as if their constitutions were merely \n     pieces of legislation to be changed at will, but not the \n     United States.\n       The balanced budget amendment marks the intrusion of the \n     worst kind of legislative politics onto our constitutional \n     tradition. For about a decade and a half, for mostly \n     political reasons, Congress has not found the fortitude to \n     come even close to balancing the budget. Instead of doing \n     what it should and voting the spending cuts and taxes to \n     narrow the deficit, Congress wants to dodge the hard choices \n     by changing the Constitution. But as Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan \n     argued on ``Meet the Press'' this Sunday: ``My proposition is \n     that you avoid trying to pretend a machine will do this for \n     you. ... You have to do it yourself.'' With or without the \n     amendment, only Congress will get the budget balanced. And \n     who is to say that the amendment, which becomes effective \n     only in 2002, won't delay Congress from making the hard \n     decisions until it is against the wall of its mandate, give \n     it yet another excuse? ``Gosh, we passed the balanced budget \n     amendment,'' the unfailingly inventive members will be \n     inclined to say, ``and it goes into effect in just a few \n     years. Isn't that enough? What do you want us to do? Balance \n     the budget?''\n       Sen. Sam Nunn, whose vote could prove decisive, has argued \n     forcefully that this amendment could lead to the judiciary's \n     making decisions on spending cuts and tax increases that \n     ought only be made by the legislative branch. Last night, \n     Sen. Byron Dorgan, another whose vote had been in doubt, \n     voiced a similar reservation. Supporters of the amendment are \n     now trying to win their votes by arguing that legislation \n     could be passed to protect against judicial supremacy. But \n     surely\n      Mr. Nunn's first instinct was right: No legislation can \n     supersede the Constitution. If the amendment itself does \n     not protect against judicial interference, there is no \n     guarantee as to how a court will act. And if, on the other \n     hand, there is no enforcement mechanism for the amendment, \n     then why pass it in the first place? It becomes an utterly \n     empty symbol, which is exactly what the United States \n     Constitution has never been and never should be.\n       As bad as this prospect is, and effective balanced budget \n     amendment might be even worse. By requiring three-fifths \n     votes to pass unbalanced budgets, it would enshrine minority \n     rule. And while deficits in periods of prosperity make little \n     sense, modest deficits during economic downturns have been \n     powerful engines for bringing the economy back to prosperity. \n     This amendment, if it worked as planned, would shackle \n     government to economic policies that are plainly foolish. \n     Since government revenues drop during recessions and since \n     payments for benefits such as food stamps and unemployment \n     compension increase, the amendment would require Congress by \n     constitutional mandate to pursue exactly the policies that \n     would only further economic distress; to raise taxes, to cut \n     spending, or do both.\n       Moreover, as Mr. Moynihan and others have pointed out, the \n     amendment could one day lead to the devastation of the \n     banking system. This might happen because a balanced budget \n     amendment could stall or stop the government from meeting its \n     obligations to protect the depositors of banks that failed \n     during an economic downturn. Mr. Moynihan is not exaggerating \n     when he says that ``everything we have learned about managing \n     our economy since the Great Depression is at risk.''\n       Voting against this amendment should be easy. It has been \n     said that were today's vote secret, the amendment would \n     certainly fail. But the political pressures on the undecided \n     senators--Mr. Nunn, Mr. Dorgan, John Breaux, Kent Conrad and \n     Wendell Ford--are immense and largely in the amendment's \n     favor. These senators have an opportunity only rarely given \n     public figures; to display genuine courage on an issue of \n     enormous historical significance. They should seize their \n     moment and vote this amendment down.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes of the \ndemocratic leader's time. I request that the Chair notify me when I \nhave used 8 of the 10 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I have just been looking at the modification that \napparently the majority party has agreed to in order to accommodate \nSenator Nunn's concerns about the court's role in enforcing this \namendment.\n  I do not want the courts involved, but I do not want to tinker with \nour sacred organic law, either. Because when you take the courts out, \nwhat you have are the same people charged with the responsibility of \nenforcing this amendment that are now in charge. The only difference is \nyou have the requirements of a supermajority of 60 votes.\n  The Nunn proposal apparently says that the courts may not involve \nthemselves in this matter unless we grant them that authority in the \nfuture. I can tell you now, I am not ever going to grant them the \nauthority to meddle in this. That makes another portion of the \nConstitution, of which James Madison was proudest, a eunuch, because \nthen you torpedo the separate branches of Government.\n  My amendment, which we are going to vote on this afternoon, is more \npowerful in getting the budget balanced than is this constitutional \namendment. If you take the courts out, the only thing you have left is \na 60-vote majority required to unbalance the budget. My amendment does \nthat by amending the Budget Act and saying you may not change--you may \nnot change--the \n[[Page S3242]]  requirement that every budget resolution, starting this \nyear--not in the year 2002, this year--must provide for a deficit \nsmaller than the preceding year and a balanced budget in the year 2002.\n  This constitutional amendment does not require this body to do one \nblessed thing until the year 2002. We may do it, but there is not \nanything in this thing that requires it. My amendment would require it \nnow, not in 2002, not after the Republicans have spent another $471 \nbillion. That is what the contract calls for between now and 2002, $471 \nbillion in additional tax cuts and defense spending, and then--and \nthen--we will start talking about balancing the budget. It is the \nbiggest scam ever perpetrated on an unsuspecting nation.\n  There has to be some ambivalence on the other side among some people \nabout whether they really want this or not. If they do not get it, it \nwill be the No. 1 issue in the 1996 election. ``He voted against a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget.'' And to the ordinary \nAmerican citizen that is tantamount to voting against a balanced \nbudget. Is that not a tragedy, that we have not been able to separate \nthe two during this debate?\n  I yield to nobody in this body in my efforts to get spending under \ncontrol for 20 years, but I am not willing to tinker with, literally \ntrivialize, the sacred organic law of this Nation that makes us the \noldest living democracy, living under the oldest living document, for \npolitical purposes.\n  So if they lose, they have it all going their way in 1996. ``He voted \nagainst a budget resolution.'' And the reason I think they are \nambivalent is because, if they win, then they have to say to the \nAmerican people sometime between now and the year 2002, ``We \noverpromised. It cannot be done.''\n  Do you think $1.5 trillion can be cut from the budget between now and \n2002? Why, of course, it is ridiculous. The question answers itself.\n  My amendment is tougher than the constitutional amendment, as I say, \nbecause it puts us on a glidepath now. It starts balancing the budget \nnow, not in the year 2002.\n  Let me ask my colleagues who are still perhaps undecided: If you vote \nto take the courts out, what do you have? You have a constitutional \namendment that nobody but the U.S. Congress can enforce. It is wholly \nunenforceable unless we have the spine to do it.\n  That is what this amendment is all about. It is an admission to the \nAmerican people that we cannot be trusted to trust them with the truth. \nAnd it is an admission that we cannot bring the budget into balance. \nAnd if you take the courts out of this, that is what you have.\n  One Senator told me the reason he was voting for it was because he \nwanted the courts to enforce it. And I am wondering now how that \nSenator is going to vote, now that there is going to be a provision in \nthe amendment saying they cannot enforce it.\n  And if you put the courts in or if you do nothing, there is a chance \nthat the courts would take jurisdiction, and then you have unmitigated \nchaos.\n  Do you know what the litmus test is going to be in 1996 and 1998 and \nthe year 2000? It will not be, ``If you elect me, I will vote for a \nbalanced budget amendment. I will vote for a line-item veto. I will \nvote for term limits. I will vote for prayer in school. You tell me \nwhatever has a majority of popular opinion. Count me in, I will vote \nfor it.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator he has used 8 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I thank the Chair.\n  Everybody will be campaigning with one additional provision-- ``I \nwill never vote and be one of the 60 votes to unbalance the budget.''\n  So what do you have? You have a depression, you have a hurricane, you \nhave an earthquake, you have floods, you have an S bailout, the banks \nfail, and we sit here trying to muster 60 votes and everybody says, \n``No, I promised my people in the last campaign that I would never be \none of the people who would vote to unbalance the budget.'' A \ndepression, so be it. Precisely what Herbert Hoover said, precisely the \nreason we had 25 percent unemployment in 1933.\n  I talked to one of my law school classmates yesterday who is a couple \nyears older than I. We both remember the Depression. He said to me, \n``Do you know what this country needs? A good depression.''\n  They have forgotten why all these laws are in effect--FDIC, FSLIC, \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission. They are there because we put \nthem in during the Depression to protect people.\n  Mr. President, the distinguished floor manager from Utah was quoted \nin the press this morning as saying, ``I pity''--I pity--``anybody in \nthis body who votes no.''\n  Mr. President, I pity an unsuspecting nation if we vote yes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I share the anger, frustration, and \nimpatience of those who want to reduce our deficit. But a \nconstitutional amendment simply is not the way to achieve that goal.\n  The Senate debate on this constitutional amendment and the amendments \noffered to improve it, which were all tabled by the majority, have \nreinforced my conclusion that the balanced budget amendment is a bad \nidea whose time has not come.\n  I have 10 reasons why I believe adoption of this proposed 28th \namendment to the U.S. Constitution would be a grave mistake.\n\n\n               it does not reduce the debt or the deficit\n\n  First, the proposed constitutional amendment will not cut a single \npenny from the Federal budget or deficit this year, next year, or any \nyear. It is a copout.\n  There are only two responsible ways to reduce our budget deficit: cut \nspending or raise taxes. Focusing our attention on this proposed \namendment only delays us from making progress on those choices.\n\n\n                     proponents' debt tracker chart\n\n  I have noted the daily ritual of proponents of this amendment using \ntheir debt tracker chart. That practice is as deceptive as the \nconstitutional amendment that we are debating: It misleads the American \npeople by suggesting that this debate is responsible for billions of \ndollars of increased national debt.\n  But if this resolution had been passed on the first day of debate, \nthe national debt would have risen just as fast and just as high. The \ndebt tracker has nothing to do with the debate on this resolution. But \nit is symbolic of the lack of substance of the arguments of the \nproponents of this so-called balanced budget amendment.\n  Further, the debt tracker is indicative, not of delay by opponents of \nthis constitutional amendment, but delay in starting the difficult \nprocess of cutting the deficit. It is the proponents of the amendment \nthat are fiddling while the debt is growing.\n  It makes more sense to cast votes that will cut the deficit now and \nnot wait until the next century. Of course, this year there is \nadditional irony in that the Republican Party has assumed majority \nstatus in both the House and Senate. As such, it can pass any budget it \nwants. That only requires a majority vote.\n  If they want to balance the budget, eliminate the deficit, pay off \nthe debt. They can do all that by a simple majority vote in both \nHouses. They do not need a constitutional amendment to do any of this; \nthey can do it right now.\n  Our Republican colleagues have been preparing for their leadership \nrole since November 9. In over 3 months, they have proposed no budget \nresolution, proposed no balanced budget, proposed no budget moving \ntoward balance, indeed, proposed no budget at all. Instead, they choose \nto distract and delay through the use of this proposed constitutional \namendment.\n  It is only with resolve and hard work that we make progress. Neither \nis evident in this effort. This is politics pure and simple and no one \nshould play politics with the Constitution.\n\n\n          it will shift burdens to state and local governments\n\n  Second, the proposed amendment contains no protection against the \nFederal Government seeking to balance its budget by shifting burdens to \nthe States. This is the ultimate budget gimmick--pass the buck to the \nStates.\n  That is not the way to cut the Federal deficit--shifting burdens to \nState and local government and requiring them to raise the revenues \nnecessary to take up the slack. Working people cannot afford tax \nincreases any more easily because they are imposed by State and local \nauthorities.\n   [[Page S3243]] Unless we carefully balance the budget, this \namendment could pass the buck to the States. Studies make dire \npredictions if we resort to across-the-board spending cuts--the easiest \nway to avoid the painful choices needed to balance the budget.\n  In response to a request from Governor Dean of Vermont, the Treasury \nDepartment recently studied what could happen to State and local taxes \nunder the balanced budget amendment.\n  Assuming that Social Security and Defense cuts were off the table, as \nthe Republican leadership has promised, the Treasury analysis predicts \ncuts in Federal grants of over $200 million to Vermont in 2002.\n  Treasury predicts Vermont would lose $89 million per year in Medicaid \nfunding. Treasury predicts Vermont would lose $37 million per year in \nhighway trust fund grants. Treasury predicts Vermont would lose $13 \nmillion per year in welfare funding. And Treasury predicts Vermont \nwould lose $68 million in other Federal funding.\n  To try to offset these losses, Vermont would have to raise State \ntaxes by 17.4 percent.\n  The Treasury Department forecast higher State taxes not only for \nVermont, but for the other 49 States as well. Louisiana would have to \nraise State taxes by 27.8 percent to make up for lost Federal funds. \nRhode Island would have to raise State taxes by 21.4 percent to make up \nfor lost Federal funds. South Dakota would have to raise State taxes by \n24.7 percent to make up for lost Federal funds. West Virginia would \nhave to raise State taxes by 20.6 percent to make up for lost Federal \nfunds. Mississippi would have to raise State taxes by 20.8 percent to \nmake up for lost Federal funds, and so on. If we try to balance the \nFederal budget by scaling back essential services, we will just as \nsurely be shifting these costs and burdens on State and local \ngovernments. I know that the people of Vermont are not going to let \ntheir neighbors go hungry or without medical care.\n  And I expect people elsewhere will not either. As much as our \nchurches, synagogues, charities, communities, and volunteers will \ncontribute, a large share of the costs will fall to State and local \ngovernments.\n  I believe that before we are called upon to consider this \nconstitutional amendment, we need to know what its impact is likely to \nbe. Certainly before any State is called upon to consider ratification \nof such a constitutional amendment, it should be advised of the likely \neffects on its budget.\n  In spite of the majority leader's assurance more than 2 weeks ago \nthat Republicans would provide as much detail as possible in the course \nof this debate about how they intend to balance the budget, we have \nheard none. Their secret plan remains secret. Let us get some answers \nand know where we are headed.\n                    it will hurt children's programs\n\n  Third, simple arithmetic indicates that sharp cuts will be proposed \nin programs for our Nation's children. Supporters of this amendment \nhave promised not to cut Social Security and not to cut defense, \nalthough they do propose that we cut taxes. What is left?\n  Programs like school lunches, education, childhood immunization. \nUnder the proposed amendment, programs like these will face likely cuts \nof 30 percent or more.\n  The Children's Defense Fund has predicted that across-the-board \nspending cuts from the balanced budget amendment would unfairly balance \nthe budget on the backs of children.\n  Under the balanced budget amendment in 2002, the Children's Defense \nFund fears that in Vermont alone: 4,850 babies, preschoolers, and \npregnant women would lose infant formula under the WIC Program; 7,600 \nchildren would lose food stamps; 13,900 children would lose subsidized \nschool lunches; 13,750 children would lose Medicaid health coverage, \nand 2,500 children in child care and Head Start would lose Child and \nAdult Care Food Program meals.\n  More than 7 million children nationwide may be thrown out of these \nFederal programs.\n  Let us remember that these programs for children are investments in \nour future. Study after study shows that healthy, educated children \ngrow up to become productive citizens.\n  Take for example the WIC Program, which provides nutrition and health \ncare for pregnant women, infants, and children. The GAO indicates that \nin the long haul, a dollar spent on WIC saves $3.50 in health care \ncosts. Let us not be pennywise in our deliberations. There will be a \nbill to pay later for unwise, shortsighted cuts, and that bill will be \nleft to the next generation.\n  I do not want to saddle our children and grandchildren with Federal \ndebt, but neither do I want to leave them a legacy of malnutrition, \npoor education, and inadequate health care. Children are our most \nvulnerable population and our most valuable resources for the future.\n\n\n                   it will encourage budget gimmickry\n\n  Fourth, this proposed constitutional amendment would invite the worst \nkind of cynical evasion and budget gimmickry. The experience of States \nwith balanced budget requirements only bears this out.\n  Many States with a balanced budget requirement achieve compliance \nonly with what the former controller of New York State calls ``dubious \npractices and financial gimmicks.''\n  These gimmicks include shifting expenditure to off-budget accounts, \npostponing payments to localities and school district suppliers, \ndelaying refunds to taxpayers, deferring contributions to pension \nfunds, and selling State assets. The proposed balanced budget amendment \ndoes not prohibit the Federal Government from using these same and \nother ``dubious practices and gimmicks.''\n  With Congress facing a constitutional mandate, the overwhelming \ntemptation will be to exaggerate estimates of economic growth and tax \nreceipts, underestimate spending and engage in all kinds of accounting \ntricks, as was done before the honest budgeting effort of 1993.\n  Passing a constitutional directive that will inevitably encourage \nevasion, will invite public cynicism and scorn not only toward \nCongress, but toward the Constitution itself.\n  Let us not debase our national charter in a misguided, political \nattempt to curry favor with the American people by this declaration \nagainst budget deficits. Let us not make the mistake of other countries \nand turn our Constitution into a series of hollow promises.\n\n\n                      it is loaded with loopholes\n\n  Fifth, the loopholes in House Joint Resolution 1 already abound. One \nneed only consult the language of the proposed amendment and the \nmajority report for the first sets of exceptions and creative \ninterpretations that will allow Congress to reduce the deficit only so \nfar as Members choose to cast responsible votes. The distinguished \nsenior Sentor from West Virginia and others have pointed out additional \nproblems, as well.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee report says that Congress will have \n``flexibility'' in deciding what is off-budget for purposes of the \nconstitutional amendment.\n  Proponents expressly exempt in that report the Tennessee Valley \nAuthority as ``[a]mong the Federal programs that would not be \ncovered.'' What other exemptions are contemplated or will be granted?\n  It may mean one thing this year and another the next. It can be \nshifted around the calendar as Congress deems appropriate. Watch out \nfor the shifting of fiscal years in order to juggle accounts when \nelections are approaching.\n  As the senior Senator from West Virginia so ably explained, this \nproposed amendment gives Congress leeway to rely on estimates to \nmeasure the budget and to ignore very small or negligible deficits. But \nwhat is small, what is negligible? With an apology to Everett Dirksen: \n``A billion here, a billion there, after a while it does not add up.''\n  I commend Senator Feingold for offering an amendment to strike the \nexemption for the Tennessee Valley Authority from the Judiciary \nCommittee report. I voted for it. Unfortunately, my colleagues \noverwhelmingly voted to keep this loophole.\n  This proposed constitutional amendment uses the seemingly \nstraightforward term ``fiscal year.'' But, according to the Senate \nreport, this time period can mean whatever a majority in Congress wants \nit to mean.\n  The biggest loophole, of course, is using the Social Security trust \nfund to make the true deficit. I commend Senator Reid and Senator \nFeinstein for \n[[Page S3244]] their amendment to exclude Social Security from the \nbalanced budget amendment. Unfortunately, it was tabled by the \nmajority.\n  Social Security is the true contract with America. And we owe it to \nour senior citizens to make sure we do not balance the budget with \ntheir lifetime contributions.\n  Social Security does not add a penny to our deficit. In fact, the \nSocial Security trust fund runs annual surpluses that are now used to \noffset the deficit. In 1995, the Social Security trust fund is \nestimated to run a $69 billion surplus, and by 2002 the Social Security \ntrust fund will run annual surpluses totaling $636 billion.\n  We should not raid the annual surpluses in the Social Security trust \nfund to balance the budget.\n\n\n                        it may harm the economy\n\n  Sixth, this proposed constitutional amendment could be economically \nruinous. During recessions, deficits rise because tax receipts go down \nand various Government payments, like unemployment insurance go up. By \ncontrast, the amendment would demand that taxes be raised and spending \nbe cut during a recession or depression.\n  Last week, the Treasury Department issued a report that concluded the \nbalanced budget amendment would have worsened the recession of 1990-92. \nThe Treasury Department found that:\n\n       A balanced budget amendment would force the Government to \n     raise taxes and cut spending in recessions--at just the \n     moment that raising taxes and cutting spending will do the \n     most harm to the economy, and aggravate the recession.\n\n  In Vermont, had this amendment been in effect, Treasury predicted \nthat between 1,300 to 3,800 more Vermonters would have lost their jobs \nduring the 1990-92 recession.\n  A study completed last year by the Wharton Econometrics Forecasting \nAssociates concluded that a balanced budget amendment would devastate \nthe economies of our States. The study found that such a constitutional \namendment would cause severe job losses and drastic cuts in personal \nincome in 2003.\n  For Vermont, the study predicted a loss of personal income of $1.2 \nbillion, an average of 5.4 percent for each Vermonter, and 3,900 lost \njobs, resulting in a 0.5 percent rise in Vermont's unemployment rate. \nThe study predicted dire job loss and devastating economic consequences \nfor every other State.\n  Economic policy must be flexible enough to deal with a changing and \nincreasingly global economy. Yet, the requirements of this proposal \nwill tie Congress' hands to address national problems that may \nnecessitate deficit spending.\n  Senator Boxer and I offered an amendment that would have permitted \nCongress to waive the balanced budget supermajority requirement to \nprovide Federal aid in response to a natural disaster as declared by \nthe President.\n  The Boxer-Leahy amendment would have given future Congresses needed \nflexibility to respond to the needs of natural disaster victims under a \nbalanced budget amendment. But once again, the majority voted in lock \nstep to table this amendment.\n  We should not hamstring the legislative power expressly authorized in \narticle I, section 8, of the Constitution. Let us not undo that which \nour Founders wisely provided--flexibility.\n  Let us not limit choices and accountability. Instead, let us exercise \nour constitutional responsibilities in the best interests of the \nAmerican people.\n\n\n                   it invites constitutional clashes\n\n  Seventh, this proposed constitutional amendment risks seriously \nundercutting the protection of our constitutional separation of powers.\n  No one has yet convincingly explained how the proposed amendment will \nwork and what roles the President and the courts are to play in its \nimplementation and enforcement. Constitutionalizing economic policy \nwould inevitably throw the Nation's fiscal policy into the courts, the \nlast place issues of taxing and spending should be decided.\n  The effect of the proposed amendment could be to toss important \nissues of spending priorities and funding levels to the President or to \nthousands of lawyers, hundreds of lawsuits and dozens of Federal and \nState courts. If approved, the amendment could let Congress off the \nhook by kicking massive responsibility for how tax dollars are spent to \nunelected judges and the President.\n  Indeed, the Nunn amendment, as modified this morning, arguably makes \nthings worse. It seeks to strip the Federal courts, including the U.S. \nSupreme Court of judicial power in connection with cases arising under \nthis constitutional provision. The result of the Nunn amendment is that \nState courts are left to interpret and apply the constitutional \nprovision and that any conflicts that arise in that interpretation and \nimplementation by the courts of the 50 States cannot be considered or \nresolved by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I do not believe that this is what Senator Nunn  intended, but that \nis the result of the language he has offered. This shows the difficulty \nand danger of seeking to draft constitutional language overnight with \ncareful consideration and the input of constitutional experts.\n  I applaud Senator Johnston for his foresight in offering an amendment \nto preclude judicial review of this amendment unless Congress \nspecifically provides for such review in the implementing legislation. \nThe Johnston amendment would have dried up one of the many murky swamps \nsurrounding this constitutional amendment. But in their zest to keep \nthe Senate version of this constitutional amendment identical to the \nHouse version, the majority tabled the Johnston amendment.\n  Instead of creating future constitutional crises, let us do the job \nwe were elected to do. Let us make the tough choices, cast the \ndifficult votes and make progress toward a balanced budget.\n\n\n          it erodes the fundamental principle of majority rule\n\n  Eighth, this proposed constitutional amendment undermines the \nfundamental principle of majority rule by imposing a three-fifths \nsupermajority vote to adopt certain budgets.\n  Our Founders rejected such supermajority voting requirements on \nmatters within Congress' purview. Alexander Hamilton described \nsupermajority requirements as a ``poison.''\n  As one of my home state newspapers, the Rutland Herald, recently \nnoted, James Madison condemned supermajority requirements in Federalist \nPaper No. 58.\n  Madison warned that:\n\n       In all cases where justice or the general good might \n     require new laws to be passed, or active measures to be \n     pursued, the fundamental principle of free government would \n     be reversed. It would be no longer the majority that would \n     rule: The power would be transferred to the minority.\n\n  Such supermajority requirements reflect a basic distrust not just of \nCongress, but of the electorate itself. I reject that notion.\n  I am prepared to keep faith with and in the American people.\n\n\n                it will result in distressing surprises\n\n  Ninth, there is much truth to the axiom that the devil is in the \ndetails.\n  The proposed constitutional amendment uses such general terms that \neven its sponsors and proponents concede that implementing legislation \nwill be necessary to clarify how it will work.\n  What will this implementing legislation say?\n  We will not find out until we see this implementing legislation what \nprograms will be off-budget, what role the courts and the President \nwill have in enforcing the amendment, and how much of a deficit may be \nfinanced and carried over to the next year. And who knows what other \ncore matters will be added to implementing legislation.\n  I do not think that Congress should be asked to amend the \nConstitution by signing what amounts to a blank check. Nor should any \nState be asked to ratify a pig in a poke.\n  That is why I voted for Senator Daschle's amendment that would have \nrequired Congress to tell the American people the details of how we \nintend to balance the budget by 2002. The distinguished minority \nleader's right-to-know amendment was the right thing to do. \nUnfortunately, this amendment was just the first of many to be tabled \nby the majority.\n  In the interests of fair disclosure, Congress should first determine \nthe substance of any implementing legislation, as it did in connection \nwith the 18th amendment, the other attempt to \n[[Page S3245]]  draft a substantive behavioral policy in to the \nConstitution.\n\n\n                  it is not constitutionally necessary\n\n  Tenth, this amendment does not meet the requirements of article V of \nthe Constitution for proposal to the States--it is not constitutionally \nnecessary.\n  Instead of a sloganeering amendment, what we need is the wisdom to \nask what programs we must cut and how much we need to raise revenues, \nand the courage to explain to the American people that there is no \nprocedural gimmick that can cut the deficit or the debt.\n  Let us not proceed with a view to short-run popularity, but with \nvision of our responsibilities to our constituents and the Nation in \naccordance with our cherished Constitution.\n  We should quit playing politics with the Constitution. This is folly. \nThere is nothing wrong with the Constitution.\n  Let us get on with the real business of reducing the deficit and \nbalancing the budget.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, today's vote on the balanced budget \namendment is not a vote on how we should reduce our Nation's crippling \ndeficit. It's not a vote about the substance of serious deficit \nreduction. After this vote, not a single program will have been cut and \nnot a single dollar will have been saved. Instead, this is simply a \nvote on a procedure that will enshrine in our Nation's most sacred \ndocument both bad constitutional policy and bad economic policy that \nwill make it more difficult to counter recessions. It is more likely \nthat banks will fail and more certain that disasters will go unabated.\n  We all agree on the need to cut the deficit. However, the debate over \nthe balanced budget amendment is not about which programs to cut, how \nto stop the unchecked growth of entitlement spending, or what our tax \npolicy should be. Instead, this debate is about procedural fixes. It is \nabout finding ways to continue ducking the tough choices that need to \nbe made, all the while appearing to be concerned about the deficit. If \na decade of procedural fixes to the deficit has shown us anything, it \nhas shown us that such fixes are no substitute for leadership.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, the amendment we will vote on today is \nsimply a substitute for solid, courageous leadership. Before taking \nthis route, we would do well to remind ourselves why we were elected. \nUnder our Constitution, it is the Congress that is vested with the \npower to make all laws, and it is our obligations as Senators to make \ndecisions about these laws and live with the implications of these \ndecisions. No one. No President. No Senator has placed the cuts \nnecessary for a balanced budget before the American people. We vote on \nthe amendment without knowing what it means for citizens who work every \nday.\n  The irony of this proposed amendment is that nothing in the \nConstitution stands in the way of a balanced budget. The plain truth is \nthat the Senate already has the power to reduce the deficit. Cutting \nthe deficit requires leadership now and no amendment to the \nConstitution will cut the deficit if we lack such leadership. In fact, \nwe can have a balanced budget whenever enough Members of Congress are \nready to vote for one. If we agree that deficits should be reduced, \nthen we should take the responsibility for making the necessary \ndecisions and live with the consequences.\n  Mr. President, this amendment does nothing to reduce the deficit. It \nsimply allows Congress to postpone action until at least 2002, and even \nthen it will not require Congress to balance the budget. Instead, it \nwill lead to more gimmicks such as off-balance-sheet budgeting, \ninflated revenue estimates, redefining such terms as CPI, and raids on \nthe Government trust funds to mask the size of the deficit. Throughout \nthis debate, I have supported efforts to protect Social Security and \nprevent Congress from relying on budgetary gimmicks. Each of these \nefforts has been defeated by the supporters of this balanced budget \namendment.\n  No one disputes that we need to reduce the deficit substantially. The \nmassive Federal deficit continues to sap our economic strength by \nraising interest rates and passing an enormous tax burden onto our \nchildren and grandchildren. Throughout my tenure in the Senate, I have \nintroduced legislation to cut wasteful Government spending. I have \noffered proposals to cut wasteful spending in appropriations bills for \ndefense spending, for agricultural spending, for Interior Department \nspending, and for HUD spending, among others. I have also offered \nlegislation to close many of the tax loopholes that increase the \nFederal deficit by billions of dollars each year. In addition, in 1993, \nI voted for the largest deficit reduction act in our Nation's history. \nThat act, which cut the deficit by over $500 billion, passed without a \nsingle Republican vote in its favor.\n  I am also concerned that the balanced budget amendment will serve to \nexacerbate recessions. Currently, Federal spending helps to reduce the \nharm caused by recessions. As the economy slows down, more people \nqualify for unemployment compensation and other Federal assistance \nprograms. In addition, as people earn less as a result of the \nrecession, they pay less in taxes. While these changes in spending and \ntaxes temporarily increase the deficit, they also serve to reduce the \ndamage done by recessions to the American economy and families. The \nbalanced budget amendment would require the Federal Government to raise \ntaxes and cut spending at precisely the same time that such policies \nwill cause the most harm. Have we learned nothing from economic lessons \nof the 20th century?\n  According to a recent report by the Treasury Department, if this \namendment had been in place during the 1990-92 recession, an additional \n1.5 million Americans would have lost their jobs as the unemployment \nrate rose to 9.4 percent, the highest level since the enactment of the \nEmployment Act of 1946. In New Jersey, we would have seen the \nunemployment rate reach 11.8 percent, as an additional 34,000 to \n103,000 New Jerseyans lost their jobs. Without the support provided by \nFederal assistance programs, many of these families might have found \nthemselves destitute.\n  Mr. President, not only would the balanced budget amendment that we \nare voting on today aggravate recessions and harm American families, it \nmakes no distinction between current operating expenses and long-term \ncapital investments. Every family understands the difference between \ncredit card debt and mortgage debt. While we need to balance our \nbudget, we should not do so in a way that would prevent us from making \nthose investments that will be necessary for our children to compete in \nthe world economy.\n  Despite a balanced budget requirement, New Jersey, along with almost \nall other States, allows the State government to borrow to finance \nlong-term capital projects, such as highways, schools, and water \ntreatment facilities. Although families are required to balance\n their budgets, they also borrow to buy homes. The balanced budget \namendment would prevent the Federal Government from borrowing to \nfinance long-term projects over their useful lives. As a result, we \nwill be far less likely to make these necessary investments in our \nNation's infrastructure, especially when confronted with the day-to-day \ndemands of competing interests. In order to address this risk, Senator \nBiden and I offered an amendment to the balanced budget amendment that \nwould have allowed the Federal Government to borrow to invest in long-\nterm capital projects just as families, businesses, and States do.\n\n  Mr. President, in addition to the damage that this balanced budget \namendment will cause our economy, I am concerned that the amendment \nwill significantly damage our democratic form of government. The \nConstitution is primarily a charter of basic rights, not a prescription \nfor economic policy. Unfortunately, while enshrining economic policy in \nthe Constitution, this amendment would allow minority rule and \npotentially shift tremendous power to unelected judges--both violations \nof the basic tenets of a representative democracy.\n  Of the 26 amendments to the Constitution, all but 2 have been drafted \nto protect the fundamental rights of American citizens or correct flaws \nin the original structure of the Constitution. The only two exceptions \nare the amendments which were passed to establish prohibition and then \nto repeal it.\n  Prohibition--established by the 18th amendment and repealed by the \n21st \n[[Page S3246]] amendment--was a scar on the face of our Constitution. \nIts proponents screamed, ``Keep us from drinking'' only to find there \nwas not the will equal to the words.\n  Mr. President, I find a parallel between the prohibition amendment \nand the balanced budget amendment. Proponents of this amendment scream, \n``Keep us from spending.'' Here also, there must be the will to equate \nthe words.\n  Without that will, the amendment will make little difference. If our \nexperience with Gramm-Rudman and the budget agreement has shown \nanything, it has shown the ability of Congress to get around rules \nmeant to limit deficits. If we are unwilling to make unpopular votes, \nthe amendment will result in placing more programs off-budget, \nmandating more expenditures by the States, and playing more tricks with \nrevenue and expenditure estimates. We have seen these types of gimmicks \nbefore.\n  In 1981, in their official estimates, the Republicans promised the \nNation that they could cut taxes, increase defense spending, and \nbalance the budget--all by 1984. By relying on false estimates to pass \ntheir legislative programs, the Republicans unleashed a tidal wave of \nred ink. In the almost 200 years leading up to 1980, our Nation amassed \na Federal debt of roughly $750 billion. Over the next 12 years, this \ndebt quintupled to approximately $4.5 trillion.\n  Ironically, it is these same empty promises that have led to our \ncurrent budgetary problems. In 1994, total Federal revenue exceeded all \nprogrammatic spending combined.\n The deficits that we suffer from today are due solely to the cost of \npaying interest on the debt that was run up during the 1980's. If we \ndid not have to pay these interest charges, we would have a balanced \nbudget today.\n\n  In addition, Mr. President, even with the proposed changes suggested \nby Senator Nunn, this amendment holds the potential to significantly \nexpand the rule of the courts. Over 200 years ago, the Framers were \nwise enough to exclude judges from making economic policy decisions. \nDepending on unspecified enabling legislation, this amendment would \nallow judges to make unilateral tax and spending decisions. In fact, \nlegal scholars as diverse as Judge Robert Bork and Harvard Prof. \nLawrence Tribe have opposed the amendment because of the danger posed \nby the expansion of the role of the courts. The change proposed by \nSenator Nunn does not eliminate this danger.\n  Furthermore, this amendment will enshrine in the Constitution not a \nbalanced budget amendment, but rather the principle of minority rule. \nWith this amendment, just more than 40 percent of either House will be \nable to hold the entire Government hostage to their demands. Over 200 \nyears ago, in The Federalist Papers No. 22, Alexander Hamilton warned \nagainst the danger of granting a congressional minority a veto power \nover government activities. We would be wise to heed this warning.\n  Mr. President, I am painfully aware of the effects which the Federal \nGovernment's uncontrolled spending is having on this generation and on \nfuture generations. The longer we wait to address the issue, the more \nenormous the problem is going to be. Balancing the budget will be \nbitter medicine for the entire country. I believe the time has come for \nthis bitter medicine. But, Mr. President, I also believe that it is \nfundamentally unfair to ask the American people to take this medicine \nwithout their full knowledge and consent. Every citizen has a right to \nknow what the likely effects of the budget cuts will be before their \nelected representatives are asked to vote on it.\n  The bottom line is that we have to decide just what it is that we owe \nto our children. By running deficits, we have been acting as if we owe \nno obligation at all to the future. Traditionally, Americans have \nthought otherwise. We have seen ourselves as part of a progression of \nAmericans, linked to each other across time. We have agreed with Edmund \nBurke, who saw society as a ``partnership not only between those who \nare living, but between those who are dead, and those who are to be \nborn.'' Otherwise, ``The whole chain and continuity of the commonwealth \nwould be broken. No one generation could link with the other.''\n  Instead of postponing action with gimmicks such as the balanced \nbudget amendment and Contract With America, let's get onto the job of \nfashioning real deficit reduction. One of the great tasks for this \nCongress should be to define--in terms of specific policies and \nspending priorities--what such a partnership across time should mean. \nThe first step should be to stop arguing about process and start \ndebating substance.\n  Mr. President, in the coming weeks, I will propose a package of \nspending cuts that will substantially reduce the Federal deficit and \nplace us on a path toward a balanced budget. If the American people are \nto be prepared for the sacrifices necessary to put us back on a track \ntoward long-term growth, their elected leaders must be candid in their \ndescription of the problem and forthcoming in their discussion of \npossible solutions. We must also begin this debate now--not at some \npoint in the distant future. Unfortunately, the balanced budget \namendment before us today simply postpones this debate, while doing \nnothing to actually reduce the deficit. We should defeat it and lead \nwith serious action.\n             amendment no. 300, nunn amendment, as modified\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, a few hours ago, our distinguished \ncolleague from Georgia came to the floor and modified his amendment \nseeking to prohibit judicial review of matters that may arise under the \nso-called balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. In the brief \nopportunity I have to examine the language of his modification, I \ndiscern a number of serious problems with this amendment.\n  The first and most obvious point is that this amendment and the \nlanguage it would add to our fundamental charter, the U.S. \nConstitution, is being considered without adequate study or debate. The \nlanguage has not been the subject of hearings, testimony, examination, \ncomment by constitutional experts, or comment by the Department of \nJustice. Nor is there any opportunity provided to obtain adequate \nstudy. This language was sprung on the Senate this morning without any \nopportunity for Senate debate before the scheduled votes on this \namendment or the other pending amendments or the constitutional \namendment, itself. This is not the way to go about considering \nconstitutional language. The value of the month of debate in which we \ndid engage is likely to be lost in this last-minute maneuvering. That, \ntoo, is a shame.\n  Second, the language of the amendment does not do that which its \nsponsor apparently intends. It does not remove the likelihood of \njudicial review of matters arising under this constitutional language. \nTo the contrary, it is expressly limited to denying our Federal courts \nauthority to decide cases. Thus, it leaves the courts of the 50 States \nfree to determine what this constitutional amendment means and whether \nit is properly implemented.\n  It was a proponent of the constitutional amendment, the former \nRepublican Attorney General, William P. Barr, who emphasized at the \nJudiciary Committee hearing back on January 5, 1995, a problem with the \ndrafting of the constitutional amendment that ``holds some potential \nfor mischief.'' That problem, according to Mr. Barr was the possibility \nthat ``a State court could entertain a challenge to a Federal statute \nunder the balanced budget amendment * * * [T]he State court in such a \ncircumstance would have the authority to render a binding legal \njudgment.''\n  Mr. Barr went on to suggest that:\n\n       To avoid the possibility that a Federal statute or the \n     Federal budgetary process itself might be entangled in such a \n     State court challenge . . . Congress include a provision for \n     exclusive federal jurisdiction in any implementing \n     legislation enacted pursuant to section 6 of the amendment. \n     Such a provision should be carefully worded so as not to \n     create inadvertently any implied right of judicial review in \n     federal court and so as not to affect any of the otherwise \n     applicable limitations on justiciability.. . .\n\n  The Nunn amendment, as just modified this morning, would do the \nopposite of that which former Attorney General Barr recommended. \nInstead of restricting judicial review to the Federal courts, the Nunn \namendment prohibits Federal court involvement by the prohibition \nagainst the extension of the ``judicial power of the United \n[[Page S3247]] States'' to cases and controversies arising under the \nconstitutional amendment.\n  That serves to funnel court challenges to the myriad State courts. \nIronically, Mr. Barr was worried that the State courts are not bound by \nthe same justiciability doctrines, like standing and the political \nquestion doctrine, that act to restrain Federal courts from intervening \nin matters in which they are not competent and in which judicial \ndetermination is inappropriate. Through the Nunn amendment we will, in \nfact, be left with an even less perfect world in which the various \nState courts may choose to intervene in budgetary matters and in which \nthe U.S. Supreme Court is literally powerless to stop them or even to \nresolve the conflict among their rulings and competing injunctions of \nspending and taxation.\n  Senator Nunn has been quite right to argue, as he has forcefully and \nrepeatedly, that we should not leave these important matters to the \nvagaries of implementing legislation. Unfortunately, that is the \ncircumstance in which we are left by the Nunn amendment as modified. I \nhave little doubt that Congress will reinstate the authority of the \nU.S. Supreme Court in the wake of the implicit authorization of State \ncourts left by the Nunn amendment. It is inconceivable that Congress \nwould tolerate a situation where supreme courts of different States \ncould interpret important provisions of the U.S. Constitution \ndifferently or in conflict.\n  My main point here is that those who believe that by adopting the \nNunn amendment they have cut off judicial review are mistaken.\n  There are other problems with the language of the amendment that we \nare not able to explore before being required to vote on it or the \nconstitutional amendment to which it is being attached. Whether once \nthe Nunn language is adopted in the Constitution, it is even possible \nin mere implementing legislation to curtail the sole avenue to judicial \nreview that we retain through the State courts by way of this amendment \nis a complex constitutional problem. Whether we can effectively strip \nthe Supreme Court of authority to construe the Constitution of the \nUnited States is a much mooted legal question. Whether this amendment \nlanguage can be interpreted to be consistent with the absolute language \nof article III and our 200-year history of respecting the Supreme Court \nand judicial power is another question that will require serious \nreflection that our circumstances in the Senate Chamber today do not \nallow.\n  Finally, I cannot support the Nunn amendment for additional reasons. \nOne of the enduring guarantees of our Constitution is that its \nprovision will be respected and will be enforced. To strip the Federal \ncourts of the power to enforce a constitutional right is wrong in my \nview. Too many other countries around the world have embarked on such a \npath with too little result for us to follow. Rather our Constitution \nis one of positive rights that can and should be enforceable. If we \nstart by seeking to limit Federal judicial power to protect rights \nunder this amendment to the Constitution, what will it mean? What \nrights will we next ask the American people to cede? When will we be \nasked to sacrifice court protection of our first amendment guarantees \nor of the rights to equal protection or due process? This is not the \nway. We need only ask the people of Eastern Europe and elsewhere whose \nconstitutions were filled with empty promises. I will not vote to \ndegrade and deface our Constitution in this way.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, Webster's dictionary defines the term \n``red herring'' as ``something that distracts attention from the real \nissue. [From the practice of drawing a red herring across a trail to \nconfuse hunting dogs].''\n  The reason I share this definition is because most all of the \narguments we have heard over the past 4 weeks in objection to the \nbalanced budget amendment amounts to little more than red herrings. The \nobjections are simply distractions from the real issue.\n  The real issue is that Federal spending is out of control and unless \nwe pass a constitutional amendment to control spending, our children \nand grandchildren will never know the America we take for granted. The \nUnited States has a current national debt of over $4.75 trillion and \naccording to President Clinton's new budget, will be $6.7 trillion in \nthe year 2000. I have said it before and I will say it again Mr. \nPresident, debtors are never free, they are only subject to dominion of \ntheir creditors. That is the real issue.\n  Over the past couple of weeks, we have heard no less then six red \nherrings that are repeated time and again. I would like to take a \nmoment to go through them one at a time and explain why they are just \ndistractions from the real issue.\n  Red herring No. 1: The balanced budget amendment would raid Social \nSecurity and put the burden of balancing the budget on the elderly.\n  The fact is that there is no Social Security trust fund. The surplus \nto which many speak is actually in the form of IOU.'s. The purpose of \nthe balanced budget amendment is to ensure the solvency of the United \nStates so we can protect the living standards of Americans and pay our \ncreditors. If we experience a currency problem like Mexico, we will not \nbe able to pay our creditors much less Social Security recipients. If \nyou truly care about the elderly and clearly understand the issue at \nhand, I see no other option but to support the balanced budget \namendment.\n  Why do the opponents view the Reid and Feinstein amendments as litmus \ntests to whether we support Social Security? They contest the only \nreason one would not support these amendments is because one wants to \nraid the trust fund. Some of the opponents even say we should be more \nhonest with the American people and what we have in mind for Social \nSecurity. Besides the fact there is no trust fund, this charge is \ncompletely false and an effort to demagog the issue at hand. To imply \nproponents of the balanced budget amendment favor cutting Social \nSecurity is incorrect, wrong, and at odds with the consistent \ndemonstrated record of advocacy Congress has toward seniors. We should \nnot balance the budget on the backs of Social Security recipients. In \nfact, I believe we should help seniors by repealing the earnings limits \nfor Social Security recipients. However, proponents of the balanced \nbudget amendment believe the solvency of the whole country will do far \nmore to protect the standard of living of every American than making an \nineffective attempt to ensure one particular interest group is \nprotected. Which, by the way, those amendments would not do.\n  Primarily, these amendments would not protect anyone because Congress \ncould, and in my opinion would, reclassify programs such as \nsupplemental security income and Medicaid as Social Security. This \nwould allow Congress to avoid balancing the budget by using FICA taxes \nto pay these benefits. In addition, Congress could redefine terms in \nthe Social Security Act such as the term ``recipient.'' We define who \nthe recipients of Social Security are and as such could change the \ndefinition to include any special interest group.\n  Red herring No. 2: The balanced budget amendment is not enforceable. \nThe amendment would curtail the authority of and respect for the \nConstitution.\n  Section 2 of the amendment requires a three-fifths vote to increase \nthe debt ceiling. If you consider that insignificant, I ask why do we \nvote every year to increase the debt limit? Why does the President \nsubmit his budget by the first Monday in February every year? Neither \nof these procedures are identified in the Constitution. Indeed, these \nbudget procedures are based on statute. As U.S. Senators, we are \nobligated to abide by the law. If one suggests that Members will \narbitrarily disregard the Constitution, then I content you are \ncompletely off base and your lack of confidence in the institution \nundermines our role as a legislative body in a participatory democracy.\n  Red herring No. 3: The people have the right to know how this is \ngoing to affect them. Proponents of the balanced budget amendment \nshould map out the way they will achieve a balanced budget within 7 \nyears.\n  It is true the people need to know what their legislature is doing \nand how its decisions affect them. For the most part, I think they have \nthe general idea. However, as former Nobel Laureate of Economics James \nBuchanan has so eloquently stated, ``This argument reflects a failure \nto understand what a \n[[Page S3248]] choice of a constitutional constraint is all about and \nconflates within-rule choices and choices of rules themselves.''\n  We have debated year after year and day after day ways to cut \nspending. We have also debated year after year and day and day whether \nor not we should increase taxes. Unfortunately we have been unable to \nachieve significant deficit reduction within the framework we have. The \nchoices we have made as a collective\n body have placed us deeper in debt. As a result, we are sincerely \ntrying to rectify the problem by changing the framework in which we \noperate. The idea that we are trying to pull the wool over someone's \neyes is false and seemingly disingenuous.\n\n  Furthermore, I would like to know where right to know advocates were \nwhen Congress passed the Endangered Species Act and the wetlands \nlegislation? Wouldn't one assume the people would like to have known \nahead of time that a puddle that stands for more then 2 weeks of the \nyear would be considered a wetland and that their property rights \nthereof would be foregone? I think they would. Do you think the \nAmerican people would like to have known the inflationary impact of the \n1993 Tax Act before it was passed? I'm sure they would have. The point \nis that there is no way to tell an individual that the balanced budget \namendment will reduce their Government subsidy by exactly $342.34 or \nthat a particular service will be taken from the States and therefore \nState taxes will be increased by exactly $43.25 You can see how absurd \nthat request really is. The point is the citizens of the United States \nknow all too well the problems of Federal spending. They want to see us \npass a balanced budget amendment to stop the fiscal hemorrhaging from \nthe Nation's Capital. The opponents are correct in that the people have \na right, but the right they have is for the Federal Government to stop \nspending this country into bankruptcy.\n  Red herring No. 4: The balanced budget amendment will have dire \nconsequences on the elderly and the children.\n  On the one hand the opponents claim a balanced budget amendment will \nlead to draconian cuts in very critical programs. According to them \nevery old person, young person, and poor person will be cut off from a \ndignified standard of living.\n  Red herring No. 2 claims that the balanced budget amendment is not \nenforceable. No amendment will be able to force the President and \nCongress to balance the budget. Who is going to sue them they ask. \nWell, which is it? Are we going to experience draconian cuts or aren't \nwe? The arguments against the balanced budget amendment are faulty \naccording to their own logic.\n  Since the logic is inconsistent, opponents will try to paint a \ndreadful picture to the American people, hoping this will elevate \nopposition to the balanced budget amendment. Well, I have a frightening \npicture I would like to share with the American people.\n  Imagine, one day 30 years in the future, your children are now \nretired and living comfortably. They have worked all their lives, spent \nfrugally and saved religiously. One day, they wake up and find the \nvalue of the dollar has crashed in financial markets. The Federal \nReserve cannot stop the falling dollar and in response, the Treasury \nprints money. Suddenly, your children's assets are worth half of what \nthey were a day before. Inflation is rampant and we are reduced to a \nThird World country. Everything your children have worked for has been \ntaken from them because Members of the generations represented in this \nChamber did not think that addressing the debt was important. Instead, \nMembers chose the immediate gratification of consumption.\n  The opposition to the balanced budget amendment provides significant \ninsight as to why many people do not understand the virtues of \ncapitalism. The idea of capitalism means that one chooses to forego \ncurrent consumption and save in order to accumulate capital. In other \nwords, deny consumption now for bigger and better things later. To \ngather capital--which by the way, increases productivity and therefore \nliving standards--we must deny ourselves immediate gratification. In \norder to pass the America we know on to our children, we must deny \nourselves immediate gratification and pay the bills we have incurred.\n  Red hearing No. 5: The balanced budget amendment is just some popular \nidea we are voting for brought about by the Contract With America. We \nneed time to think about a balanced budget amendment.\n  The fact of the matter is that the balanced budget amendment is not a \nnew idea at all. Thomas Jefferson is well known for saying, ``If I \ncould add one amendment to the Constitution, it would be to prohibit \nthe Federal Government from borrowing funds * * * We should consider \nourselves unauthorized to saddle posterity with our debts and morally \nbound to pay them ourselves.''\n  In 1936, Representative Harold Kuntson of Minnesota proposed the \nfirst constitutional amendment to balance the budget. Since then, a \nnumber of balanced budget amendments have been proposed. We have held \nhearings as far back as 1979 and even passed a balanced budget \namendment in 1982. Indeed, the issue has come up several times since \nthen. Several of the Senators opposing the balanced budget amendment \nhave been around for many of those debates.\n  The balanced budget amendment is not a new idea that has not been \njustly considered. We know the issue all too well. The balanced budget \namendment is an idea whose time has come.\n  Red herring No. 6: Federal accounting does not allow for capital \nbudgeting. Federal accounting would throw chills down the spine of any \nbusiness executive.\n  Trying to confront the arguments against the balanced budget \namendment is like following a bouncing ball. When they are defending \nSocial Security, the books are fine, they are in surplus. However, when \nwe discuss the tremendous deficits and debt of the United States, the \nFederal accounting is somehow inept.\n  Once again, there is an inconsistency in the opponents reasoning. If \nyou maintain the argument that Federal accounting is flawed, then one \nmust take another look at the books of the Social Security trust fund. \nThere is no fund. There is no surplus. According to accounting rules \nused by business executives, liabilities exceed assets. By definition, \nthat is not a surplus.\n  In addition, I hear analogies being made to the American family in \nthat they enter into substantial debt when they purchase a house. They \nhave to pay mortgage payments monthly, but they are not worse off. \nIndeed, most would say they are better off. This is true, but lets take \nthat analogy one step further as it applies to our national debt. The \ndifference is that homeowners do not buy a house this year, and another \nhouse the next year and another the year after that. A homeowner pays \ndown the principal. As a Government, we never get to this point because \nwe have to borrow just to pay the interest. It is a perpetual problem \nthat feeds on itself.\n  The arguments I have just mentioned are the objections opponents make \nto the balanced budget amendment. I call them red herrings because I \nbelieve such arguments are just distractions from the real issue. The \nterm again comes from the practice of drawing a red herring across a \ntrail to confuse hunting dogs.\n  Mr. President, the trail of debt now tops $4.75 trillion. The red \nherrings of a balanced budget amendment will not convince anyone on \nWall Street or Main Street. Mr. President, the hunting dogs are not \nconfused. The time has come for a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States of America.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor the \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution.\n  When we began this debate, I spoke on the floor in favor of this \nconstitutional amendment as a means to ensure a strong economy and \nprotect our children from rising interest payments and the debt.\n  There is no doubt that passage of this amendment will raise our \nNation's savings rate and standard of living.\n  Today, I speak in favor of the amendment because I believe the \nAmerican people and the States have the right to make the decision to \neither approve or reject the balanced budget amendment.\n  It's often repeated on this floor that the American people want this \nconstitutional amendment. Most surveys show that about 80 percent of \nAmericans favor it. Likewise, Governors and \n[[Page S3249]] State legislators are calling for its adoption.\n  Realizing that the American people want this, and that a general \nfeeling of frustration and distrust exists among voters, we should hand \nit to States and ask, ``Do you really want a balanced budget or not?''\n  We should bring the debate closer to the people, to the States. \nStates have a profound interest in this legislation because their \nbudgets will be affected. Of the 50 States, 44 rely on the Federal \nGovernment for at least one-fifth of their budgets. Alabama relies on \nFederal funds for 58 percent of its budget, and Mississippi relies on \nFederal funds for 41 percent of its budget.\n  If elected officials in the States are worried that the sky will fall \nunder a balanced budget, as so many have predicted, they can vote \nagainst the Amendment in the State legislatures.\n  On the other hand, if the States think a balanced budget is necessary \nto ensure a strong economy and protect our children from rising \ninterest payments and the debt, they can vote for the amendment in the \nState legislatures.\n  Opponents claim a constitutional amendment is bad policy, and that \nthe voters are not ready for the necessary spending cuts. If that is \ntrue, let the American people and the State legislatures reject it.\n  A recent editorial in the Durango Herald, a newspaper that actually \nopposes the constitutional amendment, yet realizes the need to get our \nfiscal house in order, says, ``Since it's clear this thing is not going \nto just wander off and die, let's get on with it'' and approve it so \nthe States can decide.\n  The point is that this debate will not end until it is won or lost. \nThis debate will not end until the States have the opportunity to \neither approve or reject the balanced budget amendment. In other words, \nto quote the Durango Herald, ``Let's get on with it.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article from the Durango Herald be \nprinted in the Record. Thank you.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Durango Journal, Jan. 15, 1995]\n\n Pass It and Move On: Let the States Kill the Balanced Budget Amendment\n\n       Amending the Constitution of the United States to require a \n     balanced budget is a terrible idea--and one Congress should \n     approve. Since it's clear this thing is not going to just \n     wander off and die, let's get on with it. Give everyone in \n     Congress the opportunity to posture and pose and send the \n     proposed amendment to the states for ratification. Closer to \n     the people, and the problems, cooler heads will drive a stake \n     through its heart.\n       With good reason, the states fear Washington would balance \n     its budget at their expense. And, they have no desire to have \n     federal budgets decided by the courts. Both of those are \n     likely consequences of a balanced budget amendment.\n       Of course there are other reasons to oppose such an \n     amendment. For starters, it would be an abdication of one of \n     Congress' fundamental responsibilities. Moreover, it wouldn't \n     work. It's not even certain it would be good if it did.\n       Writing in The Wall Street Journal, economist Robert Eisner \n     points out one of the fallacies behind a balanced budget \n     amendment is that deficit spending is inherently bad. One \n     common argument compares the deficit with an individual's \n     finances: ``I balance my checkbook. Why can't the government \n     balance its?'' Eisner says that's wrong on a couple of \n     points.\n       Both the government's revenue and its expenditures are tied \n     to the economy in ways that are out of its immediate control. \n     Eisner figures that if unemployment were to go back up to \n     where it was in June of 1992 the deficit would increase by \n     more than $110 billion. What gets cut when that happens? And, \n     if Congress could make that kind of call why do we need a \n     balanced budget amendment?\n       A better point is that the checkbook analogy neglects \n     another side of spending. Deficit spending is borrowing, \n     something responsible individuals and businesses do all the \n     time.\n       So do states. Although they may have balanced budgets \n     mandated by their constitutions, most also have separate \n     capital budgets financed by borrowing. In checkbook terms, \n     they don't consider themselves overdrawn because they have a \n     mortgage.\n       Eisner points out that if the deficit grows at the same \n     rate as national income, the ratio of debt to gross domestic \n     product will stay constant. Like someone who always trades in \n     the car before it's paid off, we'll always be in debt, but \n     never in trouble. Excess debt is crippling, but would our \n     lives be better off if we were compelled to pay for houses, \n     cars and appliances out of pocket?\n       What's needed is not a balanced budget, but some \n     responsibility, some agreement as to what's important and a \n     sense of proportion. No amendment will provide that. By \n     sending the balanced budget amendment to the states for \n     execution, maybe we can be rid of it for good.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to join the chorus of \nsupport for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. This \naction is long overdue. For the last quarter-century the Federal \nGovernment has failed to pass a single balanced budget. Rhetoric, desk-\npounding, and campaign promises notwithstanding Congress has time and \ntime again come up short. The fact is, willpower hasn't done it and \nterm limits won't do it. We must be boxed in by a constitutional \nmandate.\n  To say the least, Congress' fiscal irresponsibility has frustrated \nthe American people. The last election was a collective scream for \nchange. Voters did not just send new members to Congress last November, \nbut a clear message as well: cut the waste and balance the books.\n  The public clamor for term limits is largely attributable to the \nFederal budget fiasco. Ironically, term limits would not work to \ninstill courage or fiscal disciple but a balanced budget amendment may \nserve to limit terms as Members are constrained from using the Treasury \nto buy votes.\n  Unfortunately, the President has not heeded the message of last \nNovember, or did not hear it, and sent a budget that embodies more of \nthe same. Between 1994 and the year 2000, President Clinton proposes \nthat we add another $2.5 trillion to the gross national debt. I fail to \nsee how it gets us close to a balanced budget--must be some new math of \nthe 1990's.\n  Since coming to the Senate 10 years ago, I have listened to those who \noppose a balanced budget tell the American people that all we need is \ncourage. Year after year, Congress runs up billions on the public \ncredit card that is to be paid for by future generations. What right do \nwe have to ask our children and grandchildren to pay for excesses \ntoday?\n  Thomas Jefferson, a strong proponent of a balanced budget amendment, \nfelt very strongly about this. He stated:\n\n       The question whether one generation has the right to bind \n     another by the deficit it imposes is a question of such \n     consequence as to place it among the fundamental principles \n     of government. We should consider ourselves unauthorized to \n     saddle posterity with our debts, and morally bound to pay \n     them ourselves.\n\n  That was the questions our Founding Fathers wrestled with when \ndrafting the Constitution. It is the same question we contemplate as we \ncast our votes to amend this living document. Is it our place to ask \nothers to pay for our lack of discipline? I think not.\n  A balanced budget amendment will serve as a bulwark to ensure that \nspending not exceed outlays. It purposely excludes any reference to \nspecific programs--such a detailed blueprint has no place in the \nConstitution. Within this confine Congress can reprioritize spending to \nmeet the most urgent needs and eliminate those programs that are \nduplicative or outmoded. Among other things, we will need to redefine \nterminology used in Washington. Only in Washington bureaucratese does a \ncut mean an increase in spending smaller than the increase the year \nbefore.\n  Congress would have 7 years to meet the objective of a balanced \nbudget in the year 2002. This will be an evolutionary process in an \neffort to accurately reflect ongoing economic and political changes. In \ntestimony before the Senate Budget Committee, on February 7, Secretary \nRubin echoed these sentiments regarding the difficulty to predict \neconomic situations 7 years from now. It would not be possible to \nprecisely lay out budget priorities for the next 7 years.\n  Mr. President, to ensure we don't continue to resort to higher taxes \ninstead of cutting spending to balance the budget, I urge my colleagues \nto support the three-fifths vote requirement to raise taxes. The record \nis clear, Congress has been remarkably resourceful in raising taxes. \nAnd each time taxes went up it was accompanied by increased spending. \nClearly, the deficit is not a result of taxing too little, but spending \ntoo much.\n  Mr. President, let's take a look where we are now. Presently, the \nFederal debt is $4.7 trillion. If every man, woman, and child were to \npay an equal \n[[Page S3250]] share, they would owe about $18,000. Under the Clinton \nproposal, their Federal share would jump to $26,000 by the year 2000.\n  Probably one of the most astounding facts is that interest on the \ndebt has become the second largest budget item. It amounts to 5\\1/2\\ \ntimes more than is spent on education, job training, and employment \nprograms combined. On top of that, this budget function is the only \nitem truly off-limits. The only way we can reduce it is to balance the \nbudget. In the meantime it remains a very substantial charge to \ntaxpayers. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that if interest \nrates are even 1 percent higher than predicted, interest costs would \nrise by $50 billion in 2000. This is on top of the $310 billion in net \nannual payments expected that year.\n  The cumulative impact of this irresponsible behavior is staggering. \nDeficit spending crowds out savings and investment. Over the last 14 \nyears, savings has declined from its highest point to record lows. \nBillions are diverted annually from private investment to cover \ngovernment excess, and this has a direct impact on job creation.\n  Balanced budget opponents are trying to scare people with Social \nSecurity nightmare scenarios. The fact is, Congress continues to \nabdicate its fiscal responsibility, it will surely jeopardize future \ncommitments to retirees. Only by putting our fiscal house in order now, \ncan we continue to honor retirement obligations. Already actuarial \nmodels show the rapid depletion of the trust funds as baby-boomers \nbegin to retire. Unless Congress takes swift action, there will be no \nresources available to support these people.\n  Opponents of the balanced budget would like seniors to believe that a \nbalanced budget amendment will devastate the trust funds. I would be \ninterested in knowing how many of my colleagues who have engaged in \nthis rhetoric also supported the President's tax increase on seniors \nthat diverted billions from Social Security to the General Treasury? \nThis should be a clear indication of the threat posed to the trust fund \nunder an unbalanced budget. I am as committed to Social Security as \nanyone and will work to ensure this commitment can be honored, a \npromise which must entail balancing the budget.\n  Some in this body seeking to undermine the balanced budget by \nattaching a Social Security exemption. This exemption is a hoax fraught \nwith loopholes and questions. This exemption would create an off-budget \nblackhole where more and more programs are sent to be exempt from the \nconstraints of a balanced budget. If this prediction comes true, \nseniors will be sharing their special exemption with a multitude of \nother programs. This will threaten the reserves and defeat the purpose \nof a balanced budget. As the old saying goes, ``give them an inch and \nthey'll take a mile.''\n  No amount of gimmickry will protect future generations like a \nbalanced budget will. Only by relieving them of our burdens, can we \nensure that they can realize a higher standard of living. This is \nsomething every generation has been afforded until now. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution.\n  Wouldn't it be nice if our children could owe a debt of gratitude, \nand not just a debt?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, if this Senate has the courage to \nfinally approve the balanced budget amendment, I predict that my State \nof Idaho will proudly be the first State to ratify the amendment.\n  Idaho eagerly waits the opportunity to do what is right. Idaho will \nnot waste 40 years ratifying this amendment, it will not waste 40 weeks \nor even 40 days to approve this amendment. Idaho may well act within 40 \nhours to ratify this amendment. And for the simple reason Idaho knows \nwhat Congress is just now figuring out--our future as a nation, and the \nfuture of our children demand that Congress stops spending the Nation \nrecklessly into debt.\n  This past Monday evening I was in Montpelier, ID--population 2,520--\nfor a Lincoln Day meeting. What impressed me was the number of young \nfolks who came.\n  Those young folks, Mr. President, were there because they are \nconcerned about their own future. They see our generation mortgaging \naway their future. This debate is about bringing us some fiscal sanity \nso that these young people will have a future, and not one that is \nmortgaged away.\n  Idahoans, like most Americans, have lived under a State balanced \nbudget requirement for years. Has it forced tough decisions? Certainly. \nHas it prevented Idaho from doing some things the people may have \nwanted to do? Undoubtedly. But has it worked? Yes.\n  The people of my home State have shown they can and will live within \na limited budget, on both a personal and governmental level. It is an \nexample Congress would do well to follow.\n  The truth is Congress soon will once again raise the debt limit, this \ntime to more than $5 trillion--a staggering, incomprehensible amount of \ndebt, a debt we pass on as our selfish legacy to future generations. It \nis sad to say, but all signs indicate this deficit spending will \ncontinue unless we make it against the law.\n  It has been 26 years since the last balanced budget was approved by \nCongress. 26 years. Mr. President, I was preparing to graduate from \nhigh school and enter the real world 26 years ago. But for more than a \nquarter of a century, Congress has failed to operate in the real world. \nCongress' world has been one of illusions where, when the money runs \nout, it is like that Doritos Corn Chip ad where Jay Leno boasts, \n``We'll make more.'' In Congress, we fire up the printing presses, make \nmore, and add a few extra zeroes to the national debt.\n  As many of my colleagues are aware, I had the privilege of serving as \nthe mayor of Boise, ID, before coming to the U.S. Senate.\n  As chief executive officer for a municipality, I had the \nresponsibility to make sure the city's budget was balanced. I did not \nhave other options. I could not spend the city into the red. I had to \nprioritize. I would have loved to put more police officers on the \nstreet. We had vacant parcels of land which had been waiting years for \ngrass, ball fields, and playground equipment. It would have been \nfantastic to expand more bus routes, build a new firehouse, and \npurchase a new bookmobile.\n  Those were all desirable propositions. But we did what was realistic, \nand we lived within our means.\n  And do you know what? We kept our river clean. Our crime rates went \ndown. We built some great parks. We modernized our fire fighting \nequipment. We were voted one of the most livable cities in America--``A \ngreat place to raise a family''--said one national magazine.\n  We were able to do that because our mandate from Boiseans was clear: \nLearn to do more with less. And, I would add, Mr. President, that we \ndid all this and either held the line or decreased the property tax \nlevy the final 2 years I was in office.\n  We need to get used to the fact that the American people want the \nFederal Government to cut up its credit cards, prioritize the real \nneeds, ignore the wants list, learn to do more with less, and balance \nits budget.\n  I mention credit cards, and I am sure this has never happened to any \nof my colleagues, but I had a bit of an embarrassing experience while I \nwas back in Idaho this past weekend.\n  I pulled out a credit card and gave it to a hotel clerk. She ran it \nthrough the machine to print out a receipt for me to sign. But instead \nof handing me a receipt, she politely handed me my card back and said, \n``I'm sorry Mr. Kempthorne, but your card expired at the end of \nJanuary.''\n  It became painfully clear to me at that moment, that Congress' credit \ncard has also expired. And the American people aren't going to issue a \nnew card because Congress has run its limit up to a point where we no \nlonger have a favorable credit rating.\n  When that happens, the solution is obvious. You cut up the credit \ncards and start to pay off the debt.\n  The call for fiscal responsibility is nothing new, it has been \nsounding for years. Just over a decade ago, the American people heard \nthese words:\n\n       We must act not to protect future generations from \n     government's desire to spend its citizens' money and tax them \n     into servitude when the bills come due. Let us make it \n     unconstitutional for the Federal Government to spend more \n     money than the Federal Government takes in.\n\n   [[Page S3251]] This sage advice came from President Ronald Reagan on \nthe event of his second inauguration. His words were true then, and \nthey are even more so now. Since he made that call for a balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution, we have had 10 more years of \nunbalanced budgets, 10 more years of deficits, 10 more years of telling \nour children and grandchildren that they will have to discover a way to \ndo what we did not have the courage to do.\n  We have been inching closer to passing a balanced budget amendment. \nOne reason for this is the tireless efforts of Idaho's senior Senator, \nLarry Craig, who has spent 13 years working to see his dream of \ncongressional approval of a balanced budget come true.\n  His partners in this effort--Senators Hatch and Simon--have left no \nstone unturned in the effort to get this amendment passed.\n  These Senators know better than anyone else here that the Senate has \napproved this amendment in the past, only to have it fail in the House. \nNow, the House has approved a balanced budget amendment, and the eyes \nof the Nation--particularly the eyes of those young people I met in \nrural Idaho this past weekend--are watching and waiting for us to do \nwhat is right.\n  This vote is real this time.\n  This vote counts.\n  Let us finally stop talking and do what is right: Pass House Joint \nResolution 1, the constitutional amendment to balance the budget. Idaho \nand the rest of the Nation is watching, and waiting, and is ready to \nact.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I again come to the floor as an original \ncosponsor of the resolution calling for a balanced budget amendment to \nthe U.S. Constitution. I do so with the firm belief that this measure, \nand the amendment it would help establish, is the very best hope we \nhave now or in the near future of finally getting a handle on our \nmassive budget debt and yearly deficits.\n  Just as we did in the summer of 1993 by passing the largest deficit-\nreduction legislation in history, we again stand at a unique place and \ntime in history with regard to addressing our most pressing structural \neconomic problems. The American public, through countless opinion \nsurveys, consistently ranks deficit reduction as one of its paramount \nconcerns. What we did in August 1993 was the right thing to do, and we \nare seeing benefits from that legislation. Deficits are coming down for \nthe 3d year in a row. But as we know all too well, that is nowhere near \nenough. The temptation to spend is still a mighty one to resist for \nCongress, regardless of who is in control.\n  I believe in the inherent good sense of the American people, and I \nbelieve that good sense has opened millions of eyes and even hearts to \nthe fact that America has been victimized by more than a dozen years of \nborrow-and-spend Federal fiscal policies that have run up a horrendous \n$4 trillion national debt. The public is saying, ``enough is enough. \nThis irresponsibility must stop.'' There is a sense of urgency for \nprotecting the future of our children and grandchildren. The question \nis whether we will act further with an even more bold step to not only \nreduce the deficit, but to eventually wipe it out completely. If we \ndon't seize this opportunity--the best chance we've ever had to pass \nthe balanced budget amendment--we might not get another opportunity any \ntime soon. We must act to complete what the House has started.\n  Unfortunately, our viable alternatives are few. We must finally begin \nto service and reduce our debt or our Nation will face the miserable \nconsequences of bankruptcy.\n  We are deeply and sincerely committed to doing something about \ndeficit reduction. The American people, by all accounts, are prepared \nto do their part. This is one of the few times in my more than 16 years \nin the Senate that I have seen such an array of forces converged in an \nattempt to address this pervasive problem. Indeed, it is rare that we \never have a committed public and majority of Congress aligned on any \neconomic issue, much less one that strikes at the very soul of our free \nrepublic. But we need more than just a simple majority. We must get 67 \nvotes to ratify what the House has already passed overwhelmingly.\n  The bottom line is this: We have the momentum to take bold and \ndecisive action to begin reducing it. It is an opportunity to build on \nwhat we started 2 years ago. I am fearful that if we do not act this \ntime and finally send this amendment to the States for ratification, we \nwill lose that momentum, perhaps never to regain it.\n  And so, we can continue to wring our hands and play the blame game, \nor we can act. There is plenty of blame to go around, in both branches \nof Government and both parties, for how we came to this point. But the \ntime has come for the blame to end and for us, as a body, to accept \nresponsibility.\n  Winston Churchill once said, ``If we open a quarrel between the past \nand the present, we shall find we have lost the future.'' We can argue \nforever about what might have been done in the past to avoid the debt \nwe face. We do not have the luxury of replaying the past, but we do \nhave the present. And the quarreling of the present will only impact \nour future security. Let us heed Churchill's warning and cast a vote \nfor the future.\n  I implore all of my colleagues to stop the blame game and wringing of \nhands and vote for a new beginning with this resolution calling for a \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution. Let us give it to the \nStates, where it will be fully debated, analyzed, and voted on. This is \nas it should be, because amending the Constitution is gravely serious \nbusiness. This is why the process is so difficult. But the States \nshould have the opportunity to decide this issue. Support this historic \neffort at debt reduction by stepping up to the plate and accepting \nresponsibility. It is what we have been elected to do. The economic \nfuture of our Nation depends on us fulfilling that responsibility.\n\n\n                     amendment no. 300, as modified\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Nunn amendment fills the last gap in a \nvitally needed balanced budget amendment. It makes clear that the \nresponsibility for abiding by its solemn requirements rests in the \nCongress and the President. The prospect of judicial intervention into \nfiscal estimates, and taxing and spending decisions, made exclusively \nby the elected representatives of the people for more than 2 hundred \nyears, is appalling. The people of the United States must retain their \ncontrol over those whose decisions so affect their lives and their \npocketbooks.\n  Under the Nunn amendment, of course, Congress may grant this power of \njudicial review with such limitations as it deems appropriate. But the \npower can be withdrawn, and that makes all the difference. Such a power \nis highly unlikely to be misused.\n  The balanced budget amendment, House Joint Resolution 1, is the key \nto our commitment to change, to a new course of action to deal with \ndeficits that choke our economy and unjustly burden our children and \ngrandchildren. It is a revolt against the status quo and the promise of \na new way. It is a rejection of the old and discredited way of doing \nbusiness, and the promise of a brighter future.\n  With the Nunn amendment, the balanced budget amendment is the most \nimportant initiative of this Congress. It must be approved.\n                           amendment no. 291\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, on February 15, 1995, this body \nconsidered an amendment by Senator Feingold, the effect of which would \nhave been to nullify Judiciary Committee report language pertaining to \nthe impact of the balanced budget constitutional amendment on the legal \nstatus of the Tennessee Valley Authority.\n  I opposed the motion to table the Feingold amendment because I \nbelieve the Judiciary Committee report language related to TVA goes \nbeyond the plain meaning of the language of the balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment.\n  Section 7 of the Senate Judiciary Committee's Report No. 104-5 \nindicates that total receipts under section 5 of the proposed \nconstitutional amendment are intended to include all moneys received by \nthe Treasury either directly or indirectly, except for the proceeds of \nFederal borrowing. The report states that ``total outlays'' under \nsection 5 of the proposed constitutional amendment are intended to \ninclude all disbursements from the Treasury, either directly or \nindirectly through Federal or quasi-Federal agencies created by the \nCongress, whether they are \n[[Page S3252]] on budget or off budget, with the exception of that \ntotal outlays do not include the repayment of debt principal. In the \ncase of TVA or the Bonneville Power Administration, this means that \ntheir borrowing would not count as a receipt and their debt principal \nrepayment would not count as an outlay. This is correct and entirely \nconsistent with existing budget law.\n  It is the following statement in the Senate Judiciary Committee \nreport language that is troubling to me: ``Among the Federal programs \nthat would not be covered by Senate Joint Resolution 1 is the electric \npower program of the Tennessee Valley Authority.'' The text of the \nproposed constitutional amendment is clear: There are to be no \nexemptions to the amendment unless the Congress would later waive the \nprovisions of the article under the Declaration of War provision in \nsection 4. The above TVA report language attempts to go beyond the \nstated language in the proposed constitutional amendment. I do not \nbelieve this report language can overcome the plain meaning of the text \nof the proposed constitutional amendment.\n  Congress has recognized that the power programs of TVA, BPA, and the \nother power marketing administrations are unique and that ratepayer \nrevenues should not be traded off against taxpayer appropriations. \nUnder our current budget rules, the TVA and BPA power programs are on \nbudget, direct spending authority programs. These programs possess \nborrowing authority which is subject neither to sequestration nor \nreduction. This sequestration protection has been provided\n because the funds that would be reduced are derived from electric \nratepayers and not taxpayers and such reduction would not reduce the \nFederal district.\n\n  We should not return to the time when the Congress was involved in \ndetailed power system decision making for the TVA and the BPA. These \nprograms must remain direct spending and exempt from sequestration and \nbudget reduction. Reduction of the expenditure of ratepayer revenues \nwould not help reduce the Federal deficit. At the same time, the \nproposed constitutional amendment as currently written clearly applies \nto TVA and BPA. The Senate Judiciary report language cannot overcome \nthe clear language of the proposed constitutional amendment.\n  The Senate tabled the Feingold amendment on a vote of 63 to 33. I \nvoted against tabling because of my belief that the TVA report language \nwould have no effect because it exceeds the language of the \nconstitutional amendment. It is my view that the tabling of this \namendment did the disservice of reinforcing the TVA report language and \nfurther complicating the ability of courts or this body to clearly \nunderstand the legislative intent behind this part of the balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  Senator Feingold has now offered another amendment to force the issue \nof whether this report language overcomes the plain meaning of the \nbalanced budget amendment. The point is made in a counterintuitive way \nby seeking to exempt TVA in the legislative language, rather than the \nreport language, of the balanced budget amendment.\n  Because I oppose exempting TVA from the balanced budget amendment, \njust as I would oppose exempting BPA, I will vote to table the Feingold \namendment. Regardless of the outcome of this vote, I continue to \nbelieve that, to the extent it is inconsistent with the text of the \nbalanced budget amendment, the underlying report language related to \nTVA should be without effect.\n  I yield the floor.\n              the balanced budget constitutional amendment\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, today I rise as a proud cosponsor of the \nconstitutional balanced budget amendment, and I urge its adoption.\n  The time has come to put an end to out of control Federal spending \nthat has taken money from the private sector--the very sector that \ncreates jobs and economic opportunity for all Americans.\n  The President's recent budget proposals for next year offer clear \nevidence for the lack of political will to make the hard choices when \nit comes to cutting Government spending. I strongly disagree with \nPresident Clinton's decision not to fight for further deficit reduction \nthis year.\n  The American people are crying out for a smaller, more efficient \ngovernment. They are concerned about the trends that for too long has \nput the interests of big Government before the interests of our job-\ncreating private sector. They are irritated by the double-standard that \nexists between how our families are required to balance their \ncheckbooks and how Government is allowed to continue spending despite \nits deficit accounts.\n  It is clear, Mr. President. The time has come to heed the will of the \npeople. It is our duty, not only to heed their will, but to act in \ntheir best interest. And this amendment is in their best interest.\n  The President's budget maintains deficits of $200 billion over the \nnext 5 years, and the deficits go up from there. His budget does not \ntake seriously the need for spending restraint--restraint that would \nput us on a path toward a balanced budget by the year 2002.\n  In fact, Bill Clinton proposes spending over $1.5 trillion in fiscal \nyear 1995 to over $1.9 trillion in the year 2000. In other words, the \nonly path that the President proposes is one that leads to higher \nGovernment spending and ever increasing deficits.\n  Mr. President, my decision to co-sponsor this legislation was not \nmade lightly. The U.S. Constitution is our Nation's most sacred \ndocument. Dozens of countries have modeled their constitutions around \nthe principles espoused in ours. Many of the emerging democracies \naround the world recognize the profound simplicity and timelessness \ncontained in that hallowed document.\n  Any amendments to the Constitution should be made with care, and with \ncareful consideration of the intended outcome.\n  I believe the outcome of a balanced budget for our Nation is one of \nthe most important steps we can take to ensure the economic \nopportunities for prosperity for our children and for our children's \nchildren.\n  As a Nation--and as individuals--we are morally bound to pass \nopportunity and security to the next generation. This is what a \nbalanced budget amendment will help us do. As Thomas Paine has written, \nno government or group of people has the right to shackle seceding \ngenerations with its obligations. A balanced budget amendment will help \nus prevent the shackling of future generations.\n  As chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee I have \noutlined a plan to reduce the Federal bureaucracy, eliminate out-dated \nand wasteful Government programs, and to strengthen Government's \nability to better serve the taxpayers.\n  In January I kicked off a series of hearings on Government Reform: \nBuilding a Structure for the 21st Century. It is my belief that as we \nmove into the 21st Century, so should our Government. Innovative \ntechnologies should allow us to cut out many layers of management \nbureaucracy, and reduce Federal employment. Programmatic changes should \nalso occur.\n  Just this week I released a report that I asked the GAO to examine \nthe current structure of the Federal Government. The GAO examined all \nbudget and Government functions and missions. They did not conduct in \ndepth analysis, but simply illustrated the complex web and conflicting \nmissions under which agencies are currently operating.\n  The GAO report confirms that our Federal behemoth must be reformed to \nmeet the needs of all taxpayers for the 21st century. I am convinced \nthat it is through a smaller, smarter government we will be able to \nserve Americans into the next century.\n  Deficit spending cannot continue. We can no longer allow waste, \ninefficiency, and overbearing Government to consume the potential of \nAmerica's future. I am committed to spending restraint as we move to \nbalance the budget by the year 2002. And I ask my colleagues--and all \nAmericans--to support our efforts.\n         this is the vote that counts; do we trust the people?\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, we are now down to final passage of House \nJoint Resolution 1, the BBA.\n  [[Page S3253]] No matter how any Senator voted on any amendment \nearlier, your constituents will understand:\n  Vote no, and you kill any form of BBA, here and now.\n  Vote yes, and you continue one of the great debates of our age.\n  This vote is really about engaging the American people in the most \nimportant public debate about the appropriate role of the Federal \nGovernment since the Bill of Rights was sent to the States by the First \nCongress.\n  Do we trust the people with that debate?\n  Do we trust the 80 percent of the people who demand this amendment?\n  Do we trust the American people who voted for change last November?\n  This Senator trusts the people.\n\n\n                fundamental rights, limits on government\n\n  A constitution--\n  Protects the basic rights of the people;\n  Outlines the fundamental responsibilities of the Government and broad \nprinciples of governance;\n  Sets forth just the essential procedures to do these things.\n  House Joint Resolution 1 fits squarely within that constitutional \ntradition:\n  The American people have a right to be protected from the burdens of \nan intolerable public debt.\n  The Framers thought that the limited and enumerated powers of \ngovernment, a gold standard, and a moral imperative would make an \nexplicit balanced budget requirement redundant.\n  For 150 years, they were right. But times have changed.\n  We are having this debate today because the American people are \ndemanding that Congress change, as well.\n\n\n                         the debt is the threat\n\n  Even as we speak, we are adding to the Federal debt: $829,440,000 a \nday; $34,560,000 an hour; $576,000 a minute; and $9,600 a second.\n  Americans are paying now, with a sluggish economy. Under current \ntrends, our children will pay even more dearly.\n  For each year with a $200 billion deficit, a child born today will \npay $5,000 in additional taxes over his or her lifetime.\n  Last year, the President's budget projected that future generations \nface a lifetime net tax rate of 82 percent in order to pay the bills \nleft by this generation.\n  Total Federal debt is now $4.8 trillion--$18,500 for every many, \nwoman, and child in America.\n  Gross interest on that debt is $300 billion--the second largest item \nof Federal spending;\n  Growing interest payments threaten to squeeze out every other budget \nand economic priority--including Social Security.\n             the bba is the best hope for economic security\n\n  A 1992 GAO report shows gains in standard of living of between 7 \npercent and 36 percent in 2020 resulting from balanced Federal budgets.\n  According to the economic forecasting firm DRI/McGraw-Hill:\n  Balancing the budget can create 2.5 million new jobs by 2002.\n  Lower interest rates from balancing the budget could increase \nnonresidential investment 4 percent to 5 percent by 2002.\n  Balancing the budget could produce an additional $1,000 in per-\nhousehold GDP in 2002, in today's dollars.\n  We can balance the budget by simply holding the growth of spending to \n3 percent a year until 2002.\n  Spending would still grow from $1.53 trillion this year to $1.88 \ntrillion in 2002--a $350 billion increase in 2002 alone.\n  CBO and the Treasury Department say a balanced budget saves $64 to \n$74 billion in 2002, in interest costs. DRI says lower interest rates \nand economic growth would save even more.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  It's been suggested that we don't need a BBA--we already have the \npower to balance the budget.\n  We also have the power to protect freedom of speech and religion, \nprotect property rights, and ensure equal protection under the law.\n  That didn't stop previous Congresses from including those protections \nin the Constitution.\n  Today, it is clear from bitter experience that the American people \nneed one additional protection, from a profligate, borrow-and-spent \ngovernment.\n  This is not a short-term problem; the Federal Government has run \ndeficits for: 57 of the last 63 years; 34 of the last 35 years; the \nlast 26 years in a row.\n  Washington, Franklin, Madison, and others learned from experience and \ndetermined that certain protections were inadequate unless provided for \nin the Constitution.\n  We should do the same.\n  Jefferson said:\n\n       I am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and \n     constitutions. But laws and institutions must go hand in hand \n     with the progress of the human mind. * * * We might as well \n     require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a \n     boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of \n     their barbarous ancestors.\n\n  If you want to ignore the lessons of the last 35 years of excessive \ndebt, vote no on this amendment.\n  If you are willing to leave our children a stagnant or declining \nstandard of living, vote no on this amendment.\n  If you want to continue the failed status quo, vote no on this \namendment.\n  If you agree with Jefferson that, ``as new discoveries are made, new \ntruths discovered, * * * institutions must advance also,'' then vote \nyes on the balanced budget amendment.\n  If you trust the American people, and understand their demand that \ngovernment change its ways, then vote yes on the balanced budget \namendment.\n  If you want today to be the first day of new hope and opportunity for \nour Nation, our economy, and our children, then vote yes on the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining on both \nsides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 42 minutes 40 \nseconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. And the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader has 20 minutes 9 seconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am just going to finish the last day with \nthis balanced budget debt tracker that we have been keeping track of \nthroughout this whole debate.\n  As you can see, we started 30 days ago and we have gone steadily \nuphill from this baseline of $4.8 trillion.\n  We are now, in this 30th day, almost $25 billion more in debt. I do \nnot care what anybody says, that is a tremendous problem to this \ncountry. In other words, while we have been debating this matter, \nalmost every day we have gone $1 billion deeper in debt.\n  Now, we can scream and shout all we want. We can talk about how \nimportant it is to do the right thing around here. For 36 years we have \nfailed to balance the budget except once--one time in 36 years. The \npeople who are fighting this want to continue business as usual, the \nold way of doing things, forgetting about our children and the \ngrandchildren and the future of this country while we just continue to \ngo up ad infinitum.\n  And the President's own budget this year made it very clear that he \nhas no serious intent to do anything about bringing deficit spending \ndown, because for the next 12 years his budget averages, there will be \nat least $190 billion-plus deficits each of those next 12 years. That \nis, in the next 12 years, trillions of dollars in debt.\n  For the first time in history, the House of Representatives has \npassed a balanced budget amendment. Many people think that was a \nmiracle after watching the House for all these years. I, myself, feel \nthat it was a stunning occasion, as one who has brought the balanced \nbudget amendment to the floor of either House for the first time in \nhistory in 1982, then 1986, and then last year again. We won in 1982. \nWe had 69 votes. We lost in 1986 by one vote. We lost last year by four \nvotes. Now we have picked up three people who voted against it last \nyear, Senator Biden, Senator Baucus, and Senator Harkin, who have \ncommitted to vote for this. We have lost a few who voted for it last \nyear.\n  It is coming right down to one vote, one way or the other. This is \nthe last chance, it seems to me, for Members to strike out and do \nsomething that is right for our country, for our children, for our \ngrandchildren, and for their future.\n  [[Page S3254]] I hear a lot of talk about automatic stabilizers. Let \nme say, the only automatic stabilizer I know is an attempt to live \nwithin our means. All the automatic stabilizers in the world will not \nwork if we do not get spending under control. We are wrecking the \nfuture of our children and our grandchildren. This is the day. This is \nthe day. We will pass this amendment or we will not pass this \namendment. It is coming down to one solitary vote.\n  One thing is crystal clear. That is, we need to move toward a \nbalanced budget. During the debate, both sides have cited lots of \nnumbers and figures. One such figure is the $4.8 trillion represented \nby the red line on the balanced budget amendment debt tracker.\n  But how does one communicate the implications of our staggering debt \nin trillions of dollars? In 1975, before the recent borrowing spree, \nthe Federal debt amounted to $2,500 per individual in this country, \nman, woman, and child, and the annual interest charges were roughly \n$250 per taxpayer.\n  At the present, the Federal debt amounts to $18,500 for every man, \nwoman, and child in America with annual interest rates exceeding $2,575 \nper taxpayer. That is what we owe.\n  That is at today's interest rates, which could go much higher. Thanks \nto Congress, every American is endowed not only with life or liberty \nbut with over $18,500 in individual owed debt. I wonder how long \nliberty will last if we keep going the way we are going.\n  The Congressional Budget Office predicts under the current law if we \ncontinue business as usual, which is what is being argued for here on \nthe floor today by the other side--sincerely, I might add. I do not \nfind fault with people who differ from us, except I think it is time to \nwake up. The Congressional Budget Office predicts under current law in \n1999 total firm debt will be $6.4 trillion. That is under the \nPresident's current budget package. It will go from $4.8 trillion, that \nbottom red line, to $6.4 trillion. That means $23,700 per person with \nannual interest cost projected to be over $3,500 per taxpayer. The last \nfigures would mean a tenfold increase in per capita debt and a nearly \nfourteenfold increase in annual interest charges per taxpayer since \n1975.\n  This breakdown may give a bigger picture of the actual magnitude of \nthe debt. It still does not describe human implications. Its human \nimplications are that our children are shackled with an insurmountable \nburden as a result of our profligacy. How could you conclude otherwise? \nAccording to the National Taxpayers Union, a child born today will have \nto pay over $100,000 in extra taxes over the course of his or her \nlifetime in order just to pay the interest on the debt which \naccumulates in just their first 18 years of life; $100,000 more in \ntaxes for every kid born today, in the first 18 years of life, the way \nthings are going.\n  Further, the National Taxpayers Union has calculated that for every \n$200 billion deficit the Government runs up--and we will do it every \nyear now for 12 years, according to the President's budget--the average \nchild born today will have to pay an additional $5,000 in taxes just to \ncover the interest charges. That is $5,000 for every $200 billion in \ndeficit spending that will occur every year now for the next 12 years.\n  Think about that. That is $60,000 over the next 12 years that that \nchild will have to pay--extra taxes on top of the $100,000 that they \nhave to pay in the first 18 years of their lives. Over time the \ndisproportionate burdens imposed on today's children and their children \ncan include some combination of the following: Increased taxes, reduced \npublic welfare benefits, reduced public pensions, reduced expenditures \non infrastructure and other public investments, and diminished capital \nformation, job creation, productivity enhancement, real wage growth in \nthe private economy, and higher interest rates, higher inflation, \nincreased indebtedness, and economic dependence on foreign creditors, \nincreased risk of default on the Federal debt.\n  This sociopathic economic policy has continued under President \nClinton's latest budget proposal, as I have said. In complete surrender \nto deficit spending, the President's budget runs deficits of around \n$200 billion for each of the next 5 years--actually, 12 years. That is \n$1 trillion right there in the next 5 years added to the debt and \nanother $25,000 in tax for today's children. Under recent projections \nof the Congressional Budget Office, we will continue to have deficits \nof about 3 percent of GDP for the next 10 years, increasing as we go \ninto the future.\n  In a 1992 report, the GAO found that this scenario, which it called \nthe ``muddling through option,'' would not be sufficient to avoid the \nsevere economic consequences of deficit spending. Among the conclusions \nthat GAO reached are the following:\n  No. 1:\n\n       If we continue on the current ``muddling through option,'' \n     by the year 2005 the amount of deficit reduction that will be \n     required to limit the deficit to 3 percent of GDP will \n     increase exponentially. By the year 2020, it will require $1/\n     2 trillion of additional deficit reduction every year just to \n     maintain a deficit path of 3 percent of GDP.\n\n  No. 2:\n\n       The muddling through path requires one to make harder and \n     harder decisions just to stay in place, partly just to offset \n     the growing interest rates that compound with the deficit. To \n     select this path is to fend off the disaster of inaction, but \n     it would lock the Nation into many years of unpleasant and \n     relatively unproductive deficit debates rather than debates \n     about what Government ought to do and should be doing. It is \n     death by 1,000 cuts.\n\n  No. 3:\n\n       While the implications for the economy of the muddling \n     through approach are less devastating than the no action \n     scenario, they still imply an economy that grows only slowly \n     with ominous implications for the ability to sustain both the \n     commitments made to the retiring baby boomers and a \n     satisfactory standard of living for the working-age \n     population in 2020 and beyond.\n\n  It sounds like shock therapy. The shocking thing about this forecast \nis that President Clinton's much ballyhooed deficit reduction only \nkeeps us in this muddling through approach. President Clinton's one-\ntime fix of record-setting tax hikes does not set us off in the \ndirection of responsible Government nor does it move us off the path to \nlong-term fiscal disaster.\n  It just sets the stage for ever-increasing tax hikes and growing \ndebt. I think that the President's latest proposal is best described by \na famous American who said:\n\n       Look at the President. He started in with the idea of a \n     balanced budget, and said that was what he would hold out \n     for. But look at the thing now. Poor President, he tried but \n     couldn't do it by persuasion and he can't do it by law. So he \n     may just have to give up and say, ``Boys, I've tried, but I \n     guess it's back to the old ways of an unbalanced budget.''\n\n  The amazing thing about that statement is that it was made over 60 \nyears ago by Will Rogers. You see, Mr. President, budget deficits are \nnot new. They are not cyclical. They are not short-term. Budget \ndeficits are an institutional, structural problem which must be dealt \nwith in a long-term, insoluble rule. We need a constitutional amendment \nto balance the budget.\n  The debate is going to end pretty soon. We will all have to vote. I \njust want to point out to my colleagues how expensive our debate has \nbeen. It has been 30 days since we started. We are now in the 30th day, \nand just in those 30 days we have put us $35 billion further in debt. \nIf you stop and think about it, that is over $95 for every man, woman \nand child in America, just in these 30 days.\n  I hope the American people have been enjoying the debate. It has cost \neach of them $95 in national debt. One of my staffers told me that much \nwould buy him groceries for 2 weeks. I am sure most people watching \nthis debate would prefer to have the $95 to spend on something other \nthan this debate. Certainly they could have found better entertainment \nfor their money than this debate. Any way you cut it, this has been an \nexpensive debate. And if the people watching prefer things change, they \nshould call their Senators today and tell them you want them to vote \nfor change, to vote for a balanced budget amendment. I promise the call \nwill be less than the $95 this debate has cost you.\n  Now that I have reviewed what will happen without a balanced budget \namendment, I would like to tell you some of the gains we will enjoy if \nwe do adopt it.\n  DRI/McGraw-Hill, one of the country's leading nonpartisan economic \nanalysis firms, has analyzed the economic impact of the balanced budget \namendment and has concluded that it will result in a significant \nimprovement for our Nation's citizens. Their \n[[Page S3255]] study suggests that the balanced budget amendment would \ngreatly brighten the future for Americans of all generations. Among the \ngood news following adoption of a balanced budget amendment are these \nhighlights:\n  As Government spending is reduced, resources will be freed up for \nprivate investment and interest rates will drop. Both of these factors \nwill make it easier for businesses to expand, resulting in the creation \nof 2.5 million new jobs by the year 2002.\n  Further, fueled by the drop in interest rates, private investment \nwill rise and real nonresidential investment could grow by 4 to 5 \npercent by the year 2002.\n  Last, by the end of the 10-year forecast, real GDP is projected to be \nup $170 billion from what it would be without the balanced budget \namendment. That is about $1,000 per household in the United States.\n  The balanced budget amendment also serves to protect the civil rights \nof generations of young Americans. As we spend the money of generations \nnot yet old enough to vote, we commit one of the most infamous offenses \nagainst liberty in the history of our country: No taxation without \nrepresentation. Just as the 15th and 19th amendments stand as great \ndefenders of our democracy and the right to vote, so, too, does the \nbalanced budget amendment. It will prevent Congress from spending our \nchildren's future wages and preserve their future for them to shape \ntheir own destiny as all Americans have sought to do.\n  Mr. President, we have a clear choice between two visions of the \nfuture of our children and grandchildren. We can choose to continue \ndown the path to oppressive Government and increased taxes, stagnant \nwages, fiscal chaos and economic servitude, or we can choose decreased \nGovernment burdens, a robust economy, and political freedom. So I think \nit is time for the Senate to pass House Joint Resolution 1 to end \nbusiness as usual and leave a legacy to future generations we can be \nproud of, a legacy of responsible Government and greater personal and \neconomic freedom.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute of the minority \nleader's time.\n  I have been looking at this chart now for 30 days. It is a beautiful \nchart, very impressive, all these microfigures, $4.6 trillion and so \non.\n  We should remember one thing, between 1981 and 1992, the national \ndebt tripled in 12 years--tripled. I am not going to go through the \nrest of it because you have heard it too many times. In 1993, we \nproposed to cut the deficit by $600 billion. I say ``we,'' the \nDemocrats proposed to cut the deficit by $600 billion in 5 years and we \ndid it without one single Republican vote--50 Democrats plus the Vice \nPresident. That is the reason the deficit was down $100 billion less \nlast year than anticipated.\n  If you want to be honest, add one-third to the top of each one of \nthose green bars. Add one-third to the top of each one of those green \nbars and that is what it would have been if the Republicans had had \ntheir way in August 1993.\n  I yield 5 minutes to my distinguished colleague from Connecticut on \nbehalf of the minority leader.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nArkansas.\n  Mr. President, let me say first that this has been a remarkable \ndebate, a serious, thoughtful and important debate as befits the \nsubject. I must say personally that the result of it has been my own \nincreased respect for my colleagues and pride in service in this \ninstitution. As this debate ends, I wanted to rise briefly to explain \nwhy I will vote against the balanced budget amendment.\n  Our national books obviously are out of balance, and that should \nworry every American because it directly affects every American. We \nspend too much of our wealth each year on interest payments on the \ndebt, money that could otherwise remain with taxpayers for them to save \nor invest.\n  Because of the deficit, we jeopardize our capacity to fund vital \nprograms that we need to enhance our security and our futures. We \nburden our children and their children with a debt that they must pay \nfor obligations that we have incurred but not paid for. This is wrong \nand must be stopped.\n  That is why I introduced a deficit reduction program during the last \nsession of Congress which would have cut more than $150 billion from \nour projected debt. That is why I joined with a bipartisan group of \ncolleagues, including Senators Kerrey and Brown, Robb, Gregg, and \nGraham in introducing another deficit reduction package that would have \ncut $91 billion from the deficit. That is why I will work with that \nsame group this year to enact further spending cuts. And that is why I \nwill support a line-item veto as a reasonable test of whether greater \nPresidential authority will be used responsibly to prune unnecessary \nspending from our Nation's budget.\n  But, Mr. President, I will not support this balanced budget amendment \nbecause it freezes forever in our Constitution the response to a fiscal \nproblem--that is budget deficits--that has been a serious problem for \nonly a small part of our history, and it does so in a way that will \nalter the fundamental allocation of power in the Constitution from \nelected officials, the President and Congress to unelected judges who \nwill inevitably end up interpreting and enforcing taxing and spending.\n  Mr. President, we should have more respect for the wisdom of those \nwho founded and formed our democracy, if not for our personal capacity \nto govern responsibly than as expressed in this amendment.\n  I will also vote against this amendment because it takes our \nGovernment's responsibility to protect the American people and puts it \nin a straitjacket that will weaken the Government and make it \ndifficult, if not impossible, for us to respond to serious military, \neconomic or law enforcement threats to our Nation.\n  Reducing the deficit is and must be accepted as a very important \nnational goal and responsibility. But it is not our only national goal \nand responsibility. Passing this amendment will effectively make \neverything else the Federal Government may need to do subservient to \nbalancing the budget, and that, in my opinion, is not a prescription \nfor good and strong Government.\n  In a given year, the elected leaders of the American people may \ndecide that they need to spend more to protect our security or our \nhealth or our jobs than the balanced budget amendment will allow. They \nshould be free to do that, subject to the will of the people as \nexpressed at the next election.\n  Our aim should be to continue to reduce the deficit each year, both \nin absolute dollars and as a percentage of our gross domestic product, \nas we have in the last 2 fiscal years and as we in Congress must for \nthe next fiscal year, even though, sadly, the Administration has not \nsent us a budget that will do so.\n  Mr. President, the best way to eliminate the deficit is not by \nforcing into the Constitution our promise to do so. The best way is the \nhard way--by doing so, by continuing the difficult work of reducing the \nsize of the Federal Government and cutting its costs until we return to \na balanced budget.\n  Today, Mr. President, I renew my personal commitment to that work, as \nI cast my vote against this amendment.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. I thank my friend from Utah.\n  Mr. President, as I noted last Thursday, adoption of the balanced \nbudget amendment to me is very important, but I also noted that without \na limitation on judicial review, a limitation which was accepted during \nour 1994 debate when offered by Senator Danforth of Missouri, we could \nradically alter the balance of powers among the three branches of \nGovernment that is fundamental to our democracy.\n  Former Federal Judge Robert Bork, who served as Solicitor General \nduring the Reagan administration, has stated that a restriction on \njudicial intervention is ``essential if Congress is not to risk ceding \nsome of its most important powers to the Federal judiciary.''\n   [[Page S3256]] As Judge Bork has said, without some restriction on \njudicial review, the result--\n\n     would likely be hundreds, if not thousands, of lawsuits \n     around the country, many of them on contradictory theories \n     and providing inconsistent results. By the time the Supreme \n     Court straightened out the whole matter, the budget in \n     question would be at least 4 years out of date and lawsuits \n     involving the next 3 fiscal years would be slowly climbing \n     toward the Supreme Court.\n\n  Former Attorney General Nicholas Katzenback has noted:\n\n       [T]o open up even the possibility that judges appointed for \n     life might end up making the most fundamental of all \n     political decision[s] is not only an unprecedented shift of \n     constitutional roles and responsibilities but one that should \n     be totally unacceptable in a democratic society.\n\n  Mr. President, the Framers of the Constitution placed the \nconstitutional taxing and spending powers in the two elected policy \nmaking branches of Government, not in unelected life-tenure members of \nthe Federal bench, because our Founding Fathers knew well the dangers \nof taxation without representation. The single-most important \nmotivating force in the American Revolution was the opposition of the \nAmerican people to taxation without representation. They would have \nfound it inconceivable that the power to tax might be vested in the \nunelected, lifetime-tenure members of the judicial branch.\n  Mr. President, I have listened with care to the arguments on the \nissue offered by my good friend and superb floor leader on this \namendment, Senator Hatch, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. I \nhave also conferred at length on this subject with Senator Simon, an \nindividual I respect immensely, as well as Senator Craig, who has done \na superb job on this. All are highly respected in their views and \nknowledge of the Constitution and in this amendment. Senator Hatch, in \nparticular, has provided detailed arguments in the Judiciary Committee \nreport, on the Senate floor, and in personal discussions with me in \nsupport of the proposition that an amendment is not needed to address \nthe issue of judicial intervention. His arguments are carefully \nresearched and well written.\n  If my amendment does not pass, if this constitutional amendment does \npass, if this matter is adjudicated before the Supreme Court, I would \nwant the Senator from Utah to make those arguments before the Supreme \nCourt because I do not think anyone would be more effective. I just do \nnot happen to agree with the arguments because I think, in spite of his \narguments, there is considerable risk left that the courts would decide \notherwise.\n  The issue before us, however, is not whether we would personally \nagree with Senator Hatch's views on how a court should resolve a case. \nI agree with those views. We are not in the process of filing an amicus \nbrief with the Supreme Court. We are writing words that will become the \ntext of the Constitution of the United States. We are engaged--and I \nthink we all ought to think about this very, very heavily--in the same \nawesome task that was undertaken by the Framers in Philadelphia during \nthe Constitutional Convention, and the States will be making those same \ndecisions if this amendment is passed and sent to them.\n  The issue before us is whether we have taken reasonable and prudent \naction in drafting the balanced budget amendment to ensure that it does \nnot result in judicial management of the taxing and spending process. \nIn my judgment, we will not have done so unless we adopt an amendment \non judicial review similar to the Danforth amendment we agreed to last \nyear and the Johnston amendment, which was defeated last week by 47 to \n51.\n  My concerns are based upon three considerations.\n  First, the legislative history of the balanced budget amendment is, \nat best, ambiguous and, at worst, literally invites judicial \nintervention into the taxing and spending process.\n  Second, despite my high regard for the legal views of the Senator \nfrom Utah, I am constrained to note that there are other highly \nrespected legal scholars who come to a different conclusion about the \nprospects of judicial intervention.\n  We cannot ignore respectable legal arguments based upon the hope that \nthe arguments set forth in the Judiciary Committee report against the \nCourt becoming unduly involved will prevail before the Supreme Court.\n  Finally, if we believe that judicial intervention is inappropriate, \nexcept as specifically provided by specific legislation, the only \nconstitutionally certain means for eliminating the judicial role is to \nauthorize the limitations in the text of the Constitution.\n        the legislative history of the balanced budget amendment\n\n  Mr. President, the legislative history of the balanced budget \namendment contains a substantial amount of material indicating that \nCongress has contemplated a role for the courts:\n  The discussion in the report of the Judiciary Committee, on page 9, \nexpressly declines to state that the amendment precludes judicial \nreview. Instead, the report states:\n\n       By remaining silent about judicial review in the amendment \n     itself, its authors have refused to establish congressional \n     sanction for the Federal courts to involve themselves in \n     fundamental macroeconomic and budgetary questions, while not \n     undermining their equally fundamental obligation to ``say \n     what the law is.''\n\n  Mr. President, there is a vast difference between actually \nprohibiting judicial review as opposed to merely ``refus[ing] to \nestablish congressional sanction'' for judicial review. An activist \ncourt, faced with a lawsuit based upon the balanced budget amendment, \nwill have no trouble pointing out that Congress consciously decided not \nto prohibit judicial review.\n  The express actions of the Senate on this issue underscore the \npotential for such a ruling. Last year, the Senate adopted the Danforth \namendment expressly restricting judicial review. This year, the Senate \nrejected a similar amendment offered by Senator Johnston. While the \ndefeat of an amendment does not necessarily provide conclusive \nlegislative intent of a desire to achieve the opposite result, it \nconstitutes powerful evidence of intent when the issue is separation of \npowers and the Congress specifically rejects a proposal to frame the \nconstitutional amendment in a manner that would protect the \nprerogatives of the legislative branch.\n  The intent to provide for judicial review is highlighted by the \nremarks of Senator Hatch, floor manager of the amendment, during the \ndebate on the Johnston amendment. During the debate on February 15, he \nmade a number of statements reflecting an understanding that the courts \ncould be involved in budget decisions, including the following:\n\n       [I]f the Senator writes the courts out of * * * this \n     balanced budget amendment, he will be writing people out that \n     we cannot foresee at this time--I do not know--who may have \n     some legitimate, particularized injury to themselves that \n     will enable them to have standing and a right to sue.\n       We do not want to take away anybody's rights that may \n     develop sometime in the future.\n       Now we have people in both bodies who want the courts \n     involved * * *. Can we satisfy those who do not want the \n     courts involved in this to the exclusion of those who do?\n       I might add that some do like the courts involved in some \n     of these areas.\n       Congress should not, as the distinguished Senator from \n     Louisiana proposes, cut off all judicial review * * *. A \n     litigant in such a narrow circumstance, if he or she can \n     demonstrate standing, ought to be heard.\n\n  Similar statements were made by Senators Brown, Thompson, Santorum, \nand Craig.\n  The legislative history in the House is even more of a problem. As \nSenator Levin noted on February 15, Representative Schaefer, a lead \nsponsor of the House amendment, has said:\n\n       A member of Congress or an appropriate administration \n     official probably would have standing to file suit \n     challenging legislation that subverted the amendment.\n       The courts * * * could invalidate an individual \n     appropriation or tax Act. They could rule as to whether a \n     given Act of Congress or action by the Executive violated the \n     requirements of this amendment.\n\n  Representative Schaefer's statements echoed those set forth in a \ndocument prepared by an ad hoc group known as the Congressional Leaders \nUnited for a Balanced Budget Amendment, which was included in the \nRecord last year by Senator Craig on March 1, 1994. The statements by a \nlead sponsor in the House represent a wide open invitation for the \nunelected, life-tenured members of the judicial branch to make \nfundamental policy decisions on budgetary matters.\n  [[Page S3257]] Mr. President, I have the highest respect for the \njudiciary. As a general matter, the judiciary has treated questions \ninvolving the power to tax and spend as political questions that should \nnot be addressed by the judicial branch. There will be a fundamental \ndifference, however, when the balanced budget amendment becomes part of \nthe Constitution, the fundamental law of the land.\n  Our constituents view the balanced budget amendment as a\n   means to address taxation and spending decisions over which they \nfeel less and less control. They would be sorely disappointed, if not \noutraged, if the result of the amendment is to transfer the power to \ntax and spend from elected officials to unelected, life-tenure judges.\n\n\n        contrasting views on the issue of judicial intervention\n\n  The Judiciary Committee report, which reflects the committee's and \nSenator Hatch's thoughtful legal views, sets forth three basic \narguments in support of the proposition that an amendment to the \nbalanced budget amendment is not necessary to restrict judicial review:\n\n       (1) limitations on Federal courts contained in article III \n     of the Constitution, primarily the doctrine of ``standing''; \n     (2) the deference courts owe to Congress under both the \n     ``political question'' doctrine and section 6 of the \n     amendment itself, which confers enforcement authority on \n     Congress; and (3) the limits on judicial remedies to be \n     imposed on a coordinate branch of government--limitations on \n     remedies that are self-imposed by courts and that, in \n     appropriate circumstances, may be imposed on the courts by \n     Congress.\n\n  There are other views, however, from individuals who have served at \nthe highest levels in the Justice Department in both Republican and \nDemocratic administrations, as well as from distinguished legal \nscholars.\n  President Reagan's Solicitor General, Prof. Charles Fried of Harvard \nLaw School, has testified that:\n\n       [M]ost constitutional scholars agree that recent Supreme \n     Court jurisprudence would favor allowing a fair range of \n     issues relating to the implementation of the amendment in the \n     form now before you to become the subject of litigation and \n     court determination.\n\n  Professor Fried also observed that:\n\n       [T]he amendment would surely precipitate us into subtle and \n     intricate legal questions, and the litigation that would \n     ensue would be gruesome, intrusive, and not at all edifying.\n\n  Professor Fried cautioned against reliance on the political question \ndoctrine to limit judicial review under a balanced budget amendment:\n\n       I cannot be confident that the courts would treat as a \n     political question a demand by a taxpayer or by a member of \n     Congress that further spending * * * should be enjoined * * * \n     I cannot be confident that the courts would stay out of this.\n\n  The current Assistant Attorney General for Legal Counsel, Walter \nDellinger, who previously served as a professor law at Duke, testified \nlast month that:\n\n       [T]his amendment, once part of the Constitution, may be \n     read to authorize, or even mandate, judicial involvement in \n     the budgeting process. When confronted with litigants \n     claiming to have been harmed by the government's failure to \n     comply with the amendment, or by impoundment undertaken by \n     the President to enforce the amendment, courts may well feel \n     compelled to intervene. * * *.\n       The proposal appears to contemplate a significant expansion \n     of judicial authority: state and federal judges may be \n     required to make fundamental decisions about taxing and \n     spending in order to enforce the amendment. These are \n     decisions that judges lack the institutional capacity to make \n     in any remotely satisfactory manner.\n\n  Mr. Dellinger specifically addressed the possibility that the courts \ncould mandate increases in Federal taxes:\n\n       [The amendment] fails to state whether federal courts would \n     or would not be empowered to order tax increases in order to \n     bring about compliance. In Missouri v. Jenkins, [495 U.S. 33 \n     (1990)] the Supreme Court held that a federal district court \n     could mandate that a state increase taxes in order to fund a \n     desegregation program * * *. Once the outcome of the \n     budgeting process has been specified in a constitutional \n     amendment, a plaintiff with standing might successfully argue \n     that he or she had a right to have a court issue whatever \n     relief is necessary to remedy the constitutional violation. \n     The failure of the amendment to preclude such powers might \n     even be thought to suggest, in light of Jenkins that the \n     possibility deliberately was left open.\n\n  Mr. President, I recognize, as Senator Hatch has argued, that Jenkins \narose under the 14th amendment, which guarantees due process and equal \nprotection, and not under a balanced budget amendment. The problem, \nhowever, is that the Supreme Court in Jenkins authorized a lower \nFederal court to mandate the imposition of taxes by a State, even \nthough the imposition of taxes by the Judiciary was not contemplated by \nthe Framers of the 14th amendment of the congressional legislation \nimplementing the 14th amendment.\n  Justice Kennedy, concurring in the result in Jenkins, rejected the \nmajority's conclusion that a court could order a State to raise taxes, \nciting the very concerns that motivate my amendment:\n\n       Our Federal Judiciary, by design, is not representative or \n     responsible to the people in a political sense; it is \n     independent. * * * It is not surprising that imposition of \n     taxes by an authority so insulated from public communication \n     or control can lead to deep feelings of frustration, \n     powerlessness, and anger on the part of taxpaying citizens. \n     495 U.S. at 69.\n\n  Those are the very concerns that should compel us to ensure that the \nFederal Judiciary does not assert similar powers to mandate the \nissuance of Federal taxes.\n  Mr. Dellinger outlined other types of suits that could arise:\n\n       [I]t is possible that courts would hold that either \n     taxpayers or Members of Congress would have standing to \n     adjudicate various aspects of the budget process under a \n     balanced budget amendment. Even if taxpayers and Members of \n     Congress were not granted standing, the amendment could lead \n     to litigation by recipients whose benefits, mandated by law, \n     were curtailed by the President in reliance upon the \n     amendment, in the event that he determines that he is \n     compelled to enforce the amendment by impounding funds. In \n     addition, a criminal defendant, prosecuted or sentenced under \n     an omnibus crime bill that improved tax enforcement or \n     authorized fines or forfeitures, could argue that the bill \n     ``increased revenues'' within the meaning of Section 4. \n     Surely such a defendant would have standing to challenge the \n     failure of the Congress to enact the entire bill--not just \n     the revenue-raising provisions by the constitutionally \n     required means [under the Balanced Budget Amendment] of a \n     majority rollcall vote of the whole number of each House of \n     Congress. Budget bills that include enforcement provisions \n     could prove similarly vulnerable.\n\n  Prof. Cass Sunstein, a well-known constitutional expert and the Karl \nN. Llewellyn Distinguished Service Professor of Jurisprudence at the \nUniversity of Chicago Law School, sent me a letter yesterday commenting \non this debate. I ask unanimous consent that the letter be included in \nthe Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  Professor Sunstein, who makes it clear that he is not an opponent of \nthe balanced budget amendment, argues forcefully for an constitutional \nprovision restricting judicial review. He observes that:\n\n       Senator Hatch's arguments are of course reasonable, and it \n     is to be hoped that courts would follow those arguments; but \n     courts could find a sufficient basis in the text of the \n     proposed amendment and in precedent to engage in judicial \n     management under the amendment.\n\n  In his letter, Professor Sunstein notes:\n       There is a legitimate risk that the balanced budget \n     amendment would produce a significant increase in judicial \n     power. If it comes to fruition, this risk could compromise \n     the democratic goals of the amendment.\n\n  Prof. Kathleen Sullivan of Stanford University Law School also wrote \nto me yesterday commenting on the need for an amendment restricting \njudicial review. According to Professor Sullivan:\n\n       There are at least three categories of litigants who might \n     well be able to establish standing the challenge violations \n     of the Amendment. First, taxpayers might claim that their \n     rights to a balanced budget are violated, for example, by \n     projections that outlays will exceed receipts. * * * Second, \n     members of Congress might well have standing to claim that \n     congressional actions have diluted the vote they were \n     entitled to exercise under the amendment. * * * Third, \n     persons aggrieved by actions taken by the government in \n     claimed violation of the amendment might well have standing \n     to challenge the violation.\n       Each of these claims poses plausible claims of injury in \n     fact, and none of them poses insurmountable problems of \n     redressability. In most of them, in fact, simple injunctions \n     can be imagined that would redress the plaintiffs' claims.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of Professor Sullivan's February \n27, 1995, letter to me be included in the Record at the conclusion of \nmy remarks.\n[[Page S3258]] statutory limitations on judicial review must be ground \n                          in the constitution\n\n  Mr. President, there have been suggestions that my amendment is not \nnecessary because a constitutional amendment is not needed to enable \nCongress by statute to restrict judicial intervention in the future. If \nmy judicial review amendment is not passed and the constitutional \namendment is ratified, I hope that my colleague and friend Senator \nHatch will take the lead in making these arguments. I would hope that \nhis arguments would prevail, but I do not believe that we should take \nthe enormous risk that the courts would not agree.\n  In the first place, until we determine that there is a majority in \nfavor of such a proposition, there is no guarantee that such \nlimitations would be placed in the implementing legislation. I would \nlike to believe that a conservative institution would not find it \ndifficult to preclude judicial management of the budget process. I had \nmuch greater faith in the belief until the Johnston amendment was \ndefeated February 15. Reviewing that debate, and the various statements \nby leading Members about the potential for judicial review, I do not \nbelieve it is responsible for us to postpone that decision.\n  Second, I am not certain that there will be a majority in favor of \nany specific proposition. Some favor a complete ban on judicial relief. \nSome favor declaratory judgments. Others appear to favor standing for \nMembers of Congress. Still others believe that the rights of \nindividuals or groups should be subject to vindication. Again, let's \nvote now and uphold the longstanding conservative principle that judges \nshouldn't be involved in taxing and spending decisions.\n  Third, I am not persuaded by the argument that section 6 of the \namendment, which states that ``Congress shall enforce and implement \nthis article by appropriate legislation,'' precludes judicial review. \nSection 6 is not a grant of exclusive power--it does not state that \n``only Congress'' shall enforce the legislation. In light of the \nlegislative history that I have discussed earlier, there is no basis \nfor concluding that section 6 was intended to exclude the Judiciary \nfrom enforcing the act. As Professor Sullivan noted in her February 27 \nletter to me:\n\n       The proposed Amendment, as did [the 13th, 14th, and 15th] \n     Amendments gives Congress authority to legislate, but it does \n     not oust the courts, who need not defer to Congress in these \n     matters.\n\n  Fourth, although I agree that the courts have sustained certain \nstatutory limitations on judicial review of statutory and common law \nrights, there is no case in which the Supreme Court has held that \nCongress could cut off all avenues of judicial review of a \nconstitutional issue. As noted in the highly respected analysis of the \nConstitution prepared by the Congressional Research Service:\n\n       [T]hat Congress may through the exercise of its powers \n     vitiate and overturn constitutional decisions and restrain \n     the exercise of constitutional rights is an assertion often \n     made but not sustained by any decision of the Court.\n\n  In Webster v. Doe, 486 U.S. 592 (1988), for example, the Supreme \nCourt emphasized that a ```serious constitutional question' * * * would \narise if a federal statute were construed to deny any judicial forum \nfor a colorable constitutional claim.''\n  Charles Fried, Solicitor General in President Reagan's \nadministration, has stated:\n\n       [S]ection 6, as it is written, does not allow Congress to \n     so limit jurisdiction, and it seems to me that if Congress \n     tried to limit jurisdiction in this way without an express \n     authorization, which there is not in this bill, that \n     limitation itself might well be unconstitutional\n\n  Professor Sunstein, in his February 27 letter to me, expressed \nsimilar concerns:\n\n       If your proposed change, or some version of it, is not \n     added, it is by no means clear that Congress can forbid \n     judicial involvement by statute. Courts are quite reluctant \n     to allow Congress to preclude judicial review of \n     constitutional claims. . . . Courts would be especially \n     reluctant, perhaps, to preclude judicial review of an \n     amendment specifically designed to limit Congress' power to \n     provide for budget deficits. One could easily imagine a \n     judicial decision invalidating implementing legislation that \n     denies a judicial role, on the theory that the balanced \n     budget guarantee--without your amendment--is best understood \n     to contemplate a firm judicial check on congressional \n     activity.\n\n\n                     the responsibility of congress\n  Mr. President, the report of the Judiciary Committee indicates there \nis little likelihood of judicial involvement in the taxing and spending \nprocess under the budget amendment, and they cite the history of this \ncountry in that regard. The difference is that now, if this amendment \nis in the Constitution, it will be a different Constitution than has \nframed the history of our country.\n  Mr. President, others including leading constitutional authorities \nfrom both the Republican and Democratic Parties believe there is a \nreasonable likelihood the amendment could transform the courts into the \nforum for managing the budgetary process.\n  To me, the risk is too high. In the face of conflicting legal views \nby respected authorities, it is our responsibility to act. If we \nbelieve, as I do, that we should not risk subjecting the budget process \nto judicial management, then we should adopt my amendment.\n  I have modified that amendment now. The amendment very simply --and I \nam not quoting it, but the very simple essence of the amendment is that \nthe judicial power of the United States shall not extend to any case or \ncontroversy arising under this article except as may be specifically \nauthorized by legislation adopted pursuant to this section.\n  In other words, Mr. President, the Congress will decide the \njurisdiction of the courts. The courts will not decide it on the basis \nof constitutional interpretation. We can change the implementing \nstatute if it does not work. We can mold it later. We can mold the \nstatute after we have decided what the enforcement mechanism here is \nbecause those two things have to be considered together.\n  So it is my hope that this amendment, which is now modified, will be \naccepted by the managers of this bill and it will be accepted by my \ncolleagues. If it is, then I plan to support this overall \nconstitutional amendment because I think it is enormously important \nthat we have a mandate to the Congress of the United States to get this \nbudget and our fiscal house in order. Nothing else has worked. This is \nthe last resort.\n  I wish we had not reached this point. I wish we had been able to use \nour normal political process, because I do not like amending the \nConstitution of the United States. However, I do believe it is the last \nresort.\n  Mr. President, I am concerned about other areas that my colleagues \nare concerned about. I am concerned about Social Security. I am \nconcerned about economic emergency. But my bottom line has been and is \ntoday that it is my fervent hope this judicial article, this judicial \namendment will be put into this constitutional amendment so there is no \ndoubt about the intent of Congress and the authority of Congress in \nmanaging the taxing and spending of this great country.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             University of Chicago Law School,\n\n                                   Chicago, IL, February 27, 1995.\n     Hon. Sam Nunn,\n     U.S. Congress, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nunn: As a teacher of constitutional law, I am \n     writing to endorse your remarks about the balanced budget \n     amendment on the Senate floor on Thursday. There is a \n     legitimate risk that the balanced budget amendment would \n     produce a significant increase in judicial power. If it comes \n     to fruition, this risk would compromise the democratic goals \n     of the amendment.\n       It is certainly not clear that current political question \n     and standing doctrines would bar judicial involvement under \n     the proposed amendment. Issues involving spending and \n     taxation do not necessarily involve political questions, and \n     the balanced budget amendment, unaccompanied by a change of \n     the sort you propose, would increase the risk that political \n     questions would become legal questions. The political \n     question doctrine is extremely narrow in the aftermath of \n     Baker v. Carr, 369 US 186 (1962), and it is certainly \n     possible that a court would find, in the amendment, \n     ``judicial administrable standards'' for the grant or \n     injunctive relief. Under existing law, no one can rule out \n     the possibility that the political question doctrine would be \n     held inapplicable to the balanced budget amendment. Cf. \n     Michael v. Anderson, 14 F3d 623 (DC Cir 1994).\n       Taxpayers and citizens as such would probably lack standing \n     to enforce the amendment, but as you stated, it is certainly \n     possible to think of potential litigants with direct \n     financial interests at stake who would \n     [[Page S3259]] claim that, if the amendment were not \n     followed, and if the budget was not balanced, they would \n     suffer from an ``injury in fact'' sufficient to trigger \n     judicial review under Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 112 S. \n     Ct. 2130 (1992). At the very least, it can be said that \n     costly and time-consuming debates about justiciability would \n     ensue, and we cannot reasonably rule out, in advance, the \n     prospect of undemocratic and unprecedented judicial \n     involvement in the budgetary process.\n       In this light your proposal--limiting the judicial role--\n     seems to me to make a great deal of sense. You are certainly \n     correct to say that the legislative history of the balanced \n     budget would not rule out judicial management. The \n     legislative history of a constitutional amendment is \n     relevant, but it does not resolve the question of \n     constitutional meaning. Senator Hatch's arguments about \n     likely judicial deference are of course reasonable, and it is \n     to be hoped that courts would follow those arguments; but \n     courts could find a sufficient basis in the text of the \n     proposed amendment and in precedent to engage in judicial \n     management under the amendment.\n       If your proposed change, or some version of it, is not \n     added, it is by no means clear that Congress can forbid \n     judicial involvement by statute. Courts are quite reluctant \n     to allow Congress to preclude judicial review of \n     constitutional claims. See Webster v. Doe, 486 US 592 (1988), \n     allowing review of employment decisions by the Central \n     Intelligence Agency in the face of a claim that a discharge \n     of a homosexual employee was unconstitutional. Webster shows \n     that even in highly sensitive areas, judges will be likely to \n     allow review, in part because serious constitutional issues \n     would be raised by an effort to insulate constitutional \n     claims from judicial scrutiny.\n       Courts would be especially reluctant, perhaps, to allow \n     Congress to preclude judicial review of an amendment \n     specifically designed to limit Congress' power to provide for \n     budget deficits. One could easily imagine a judicial decision \n     invalidating implementing legislation that denies a judicial \n     role on the theory that the balanced budget guarantee--\n     without your amendment--is best understood to contemplate a \n     firm judicial check on congressional activity. I add that you \n     are entirely correct in your reading of Missouri v. Jenkins, \n     495 US 33 (1990), which is not limited to fourteenth \n     amendment cases, and which refers to ``a long and venerable \n     line of cases in which this Court held that federal courts \n     could issue the write of mandamus to compel local \n     governmental bodies to levy taxes adequate to satisfy their \n     debt obligations.'' Id. at 55. (While it is unlikely that \n     courts would specifically order Congress to raise taxes under \n     the proposed amendment, I share your concern about the issue, \n     and think it would be best to avoid any reasonable risk that \n     they might do so.)\n       I should add that I have not opposed the balanced budget \n     amendment as such, and that I am writing as a teacher of \n     constitutional law who is concerned that any amendment to \n     this effect ought not to increase the power of the federal \n     courts over an area in which they do not belong. Your \n     proposed change--expecially the suggestion to the effect that \n     ``the judicial power of the United States shall not extend'' \n     to enforcement of the amendment except as authorized by \n     statute--seems to me an admirable effort to deal with this \n     problem. If some such revision is not included, there is a \n     legitimate risk that the proposed amendment would transfer \n     considerable power over budgetary matters from Congress to \n     the Supreme Court or to lower federal courts. I very much \n     hope that steps will be taken to ensure that this does not \n     happen.\n           Sincerely,\n     Cass R. Sunstein.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                          Stanford Law School,\n\n                                                February 24, 1995.\n     Re proposed balanced budget amendment.\n     Senator Sam Nunn,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nunn: I have had the opportunity to review \n     your comments yesterday in the floor debate regarding the \n     role of the courts in cases that might arise under the \n     proposed Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution. My \n     views on the subject are very similar to your own, and I have \n     taken the liberty of sending you the following thoughts, \n     which were prompted by the testimony of former Attorney \n     General William P. Barr before the Senate Committee on the \n     Judiciary on January 5, 1995.\n       In that testimony, Mr. Barr argued that ``the courts' role \n     in enforcing the Balanced Budget Amendment will be quite \n     limited.'' While I have great respect for Mr. Barr, and while \n     I found his testimony to be considered and thoughtful, I must \n     respectfully state that I disagree with him. I continue to \n     believe that, as I testified before the Senate Appropriations \n     Committee on February 16, 1994, the Balanced Budget Amendment \n     in its current draft form is likely to produce numerous \n     lawsuits in the federal and state courts, and that neither \n     Article III justiciability doctrines nor practices of \n     judicial deference will operate as automatic dams against \n     that flood tide of litigation.\n       Let me begin with the doctrines of justiciability under \n     Article III of the Constitution. Mr. Barr argues that `'few \n     plaintiffs would be able to establish the requisite standing \n     to invoke federal court review.'' This is by no means clear. \n     There are at least three categories of litigants who might \n     well be able to establish standing to challenge violations of \n     the Amendment.\n       First, taxpayers might claim that their rights to a \n     balanced budget are violated, for example, by projections\n      that outlays will exceed receipts. True, taxpayers are \n     generally barred from suing the government for the redress \n     of generalized grievances. But the Supreme Court a quarter \n     of a century ago held that there is an exception to the \n     general bar on taxpayer standing when the taxpayer claims \n     that a government action ``exceeds specific constitutional \n     limitations imposed upon the exercise of the congressional \n     taxing and spending power.'' Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83 \n     (1968). Mr. Barr suggests that this exception may be \n     limited to Establishment Clause challenges, but there is \n     nothing in the principle stated in Flast that so confines \n     it. If anything, the proposed Balanced Budget Amendment \n     more clearly limits congressional taxing and spending \n     power than does the Establishment Clause. The Amendment is \n     not confined, as Mr. Barr suggests, merely to the power of \n     Congress to borrow. Thus taxpayers would have an entirely \n     plausible argument for standing under existing law.\n       Second, members of Congress might well have standing to \n     claim that congressional actions have diluted the vote they \n     were entitled to exercise under the Amendment. For example, \n     suppose that the Congress declined to hold a three-fifths \n     vote required to approve deficit spending under section 1, or \n     a rollcall vote required to increase revenue under section 4. \n     This might occur, for example, because of a dispute over \n     whether outlays really exceeded receipts, or over whether \n     revenue was really being increased, because the meaning of \n     those terms might be controversial as a matter of fact. \n     Declining to implement the supermajority voting requirements \n     in such a context, however, might be plausibly claimed to \n     have diluted a Member's vote. This is arguably analogous to \n     other circumstances of vote dilution in which the lower \n     courts have held that Members of Congress have standing. See, \n     e.g., Vander Jact v. O'Neill, 699 F.2d 1166, 1168-71 (D.C. \n     Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 823 (1983).\n       Third, persons aggrieved by actions taken by the government \n     in claimed violation of the Amendment might well have \n     standing to challenge the violation. For example, consider a \n     criminal defendant charged under a law claimed to cost more \n     to enforce than the government can finance through expected \n     receipts. Or suppose that the President, believing himself \n     bound by his Oath to support the Constitution, freezes \n     federal wages and salaries to stop the budget from going out \n     of balance. In that circumstance, a federal employee might \n     well challenge the President's action, which plainly causes \n     her pocketbook injury, as unauthorized by the Amendment, \n     which is silent on the question of executive enforcement.\n       Each of these circumstances poses plausible claims of \n     injury in fact, and none of them poses insurmountable \n     problems\n      of redressability. In most of them, in fact, simple \n     injunctions can be imagined that would redress the \n     plaintiffs' claims. Thus, contrary to Mr. Barr's \n     prediction, the doctrine of standing is by no means \n     certain to preclude federal judicial efforts at \n     enforcement of the Amendment. And further, as Mr. Barr \n     concedes, federal standing doctrine will do nothing to \n     constrain litigation of the proposed Amendment in state \n     courts, which are not bound by Article III requirements at \n     all.\n       Nor is the political question doctrine likely to eliminate \n     all such challenges from judicial review. True, the Supreme \n     Court has held that a question is nonjusticiable when there \n     is ``a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of \n     the issue to a coordinate political department; or a lack of \n     judicially discoverable and manageable standards for \n     resolving it.'' Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186 (1962). But the \n     proposed Amendment implicates neither of these kinds of \n     limitation. It does not reserve enforcement exclusively to \n     the discretion of the Congress, as, for example, the \n     Impeachment or Speech and Debate Clauses may be read to do. \n     And it presents no matters that lie beyond judicial \n     competence. Rather, here, as with apportionment, the question \n     whether deficit spending or revenue increases ``exceed \n     whatever authority has been committed, [would] itself [be] a \n     delicate exercise in constitutional interpretation,'' and \n     thus would well within the ordinary interpretive \n     responsibility of the courts. See Baker v. Carr, at 211.\n       Let me turn now from doctrines of justifiability to \n     practices of judicial deference. Mr. Barr argues that, as a \n     prudential matter, ``a reviewing court is likely to accord \n     the utmost deference to the choices made by Congress in \n     carrying out its responsibilities under the Amendment,'' \n     especially in light of the enforcement clause in section 6. \n     This is by no means clear. The Reconstruction Congress \n     expected that enforcement of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth and \n     Fifteenth Amendments would be undertaken primarily by the \n     Congress, and reflected that expectation in the Enforcement \n     Clauses specifically included in those Amendments. But we \n     have seen time and time again in our history that judicial \n     review has played a pivotal role in the enforcement of those \n     Amendments nonetheless. The proposed Amendment, as did those \n     Amendments, gives Congress authority to legislate, but it \n     does not oust the courts, who need not defer to Congress in \n     these matters. Courts rightly have not hesitated to intervene \n     in civil rights cases, even though \n     [[Page S3260]] those cases involved grave structural \n     questions as well as questions of individual rights.\n       Finally, Mr. Barr argues that courts will, again as a \n     matter of prudence and practice rather than doctrine, \n     ``hesitate to impose remedies that could embroil [them] in \n     the supervision of the budget process.'' He is correct to \n     observe that a direct judicial order of a tax levy such as \n     that in Missouri v. Jenkins, 495 U.S. 33 (1990), is highly \n     exceptional. But even if that is so, courts could issue a \n     host of other kinds of injunctions to enforce against \n     conceivable violations of the proposed Balanced Budget \n     Amendment. For example, a court could restrain expenditures \n     or order them stayed pending correction of procedural \n     defaults, or a court could enjoin Congress simply to put the \n     budget into balance while leaving to Congress the policy \n     choices over the means by which to reach that end. Thus, \n     there is little reason to expect that prudential \n     considerations will keep enforcement lawsuits out of court, \n     or keep judicial remedies from intruding into political \n     choices.\n       In sum, the draft Balanced Budget Amendment in its present \n     from has considerable potential to generate justiciable \n     lawsuits, which in turn would have considerable potential to \n     generate judicial remedies that would constrain political \n     choices. Thank you for considering these remarks in the \n     course of your current deliberations.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Kathleen M. Sullivan.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I appreciate the very kind remarks of the \nSenator from Georgia. With the Senator's permission, I would like to \nplace in the Record, a copy of the written comments on the issue of \njudicial review and the balanced budget amendment that I prepared for \nhis review. Mr. President, I so ask unanimous consent.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             Balanced Budget Amendment and Judicial Review\n\n\n                        i. preliminary comments\n\n       The balanced budget amendment (``BBA'' or the \n     ``amendment''), H.J. Res. 1, creates a constitutional \n     procedure, a mechanism if you like, that requires Congress to \n     adopt, or at a minimum, at least to move toward a balanced \n     budget.\n       For instance, section 1 of H.J. Res. 1 requires that total \n     outlays of the United States not exceed receipts unless \n     three-fifths of the whole number of both Houses waives the \n     requirement. Section 2 prohibits the raising of the debt \n     ceiling unless three-fifths of the whole number of both \n     Houses of Congress waives the requirement; and section 4 \n     requires that there be no revenue increases unless approved \n     by a majority of the whole number of each House of Congress \n     (51 Senate; 218 House). Consequently, the BBA does not create \n     a ``right'' to a balanced budget, much as the First Amendment \n     recognizes a right to free speech. What it does do is \n     establish a procedure which restricts Congress' budgetary \n     authority by creating a strong presumption in favor of a \n     balanced budget which can be overcome by a three-fifths vote \n     of each Chamber of Commerce.\n       This is amply shown by section 6 of the BBA, which provides \n     that ``Congress shall enforce and implement this article by \n     appropriate legislation, which may rely on estimates of \n     outlays and receipts.'' Thus, there is no absolute \n     requirement that Congress balance the budget to the penny. \n     Congress may rely on estimates and is mandated to implement \n     and enforce the amendment through some statutory scheme such \n     as establishing, for example, a contingency or ``rainy day'' \n     fund, providing for automatic sequestration, or delegating to \n     the President limited rescissionary authority. This is a \n     strong indication that the Congress, and not the courts or \n     the President, is the branch that is authorized to enforce \n     the amendment.\n       The import of all of this is that the judiciary will be \n     loathe to interfere in economic and budgetary matters, in \n     what is a quintessential ``political question.'' These are \n     matters committed to Congress by Article I of the \n     Constitution and the BBA does not disturb that allocation of \n     powers. Courts have no ascertainable standards to determine \n     exactly what the budget numbers ought to be, whether the \n     budgetary figures are ``good faith'' estimates, or which \n     spending program ought to be cut. In other words, there are \n     no ``justiciable'' standards for the courts to provide broad \n     based relief that interferes with the budgetary process. \n     Whether one talks in terms of standing, justiciability, \n     separation of powers, or the political question doctrine, \n     courts\n      will not be authorized to interfere with Congress' Article I \n     powers--which, after all, are exclusively delegated by the \n     Constitution to the legislative branch.\n       Furthermore, section 6 of the amendment, as well as Article \n     III of the Constitution, provide authority to Congress to \n     limit the jurisdiction of the courts. In this way, the \n     equitable powers of the courts may be restricted in such a \n     way that shields Congress' Article I spending, taxing, and \n     borrowing powers.\n       Below are detailed responses to your concerns over \n     particular judicial review and presidential impoundment \n     issues arising out of the enforcement of H.J. Res. 1.\n\n\n                              ii. standing\n       You have stated that it is not difficult to contemplate \n     scenarios where standing to sue under the BBA could occur. \n     For instance, in your February 23, 1995, floor statement \n     contained in the Congressional Record, you cite Assistant \n     Attorney General Dellinger's example that a criminal \n     defendant would have standing to challenge a forfeiture if a \n     new forfeiture provision, which would raise revenue, was \n     passed by a voice vote instead of a rollcall vote as required \n     by the BBA.\\1\\ I respectfully disagree.\n     \\1\\Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       I believe that the Dellinger example is faulty: criminal \n     sanctions and fines are simply not commonly understood to be \n     revenue or tax measures and as such would not be subject to \n     the BBA. The basic point I want to make, however, is not that \n     a court cannot ever find standing, but that standing would be \n     highly improbable and that the courts, in an improbable cause \n     where standing is found, could not provide relief that \n     interferes with the budgetary process due to other \n     jurisprudential doctrines such as justiciability and the \n     political question doctrine.\n       As you know, as a preliminary obstacle, a litigant must \n     demonstrate a standing to sue.\\2\\ The sometimes arcane nature \n     of the standing doctrine has enabled courts to avoid \n     difficult and contentious decisions on the merits.\\3\\ At a \n     minimum, however, the Court traditionally has taken the \n     position that Article III standing requires allegation of a \n     ``personal stake'' in the outcome of a controversy sufficient \n     to guarantee concrete (as opposed to speculative) \n     adverseness.\\4\\ Although application of the standing doctrine \n     still divides the Court, all Justices would agree that to \n     establish ``personal stake'' in the outcome of a case \n     challenging the BBA, a litigant must show some actual or \n     threatened concrete injury and that the injury is likely to \n     be redressed if a court grants relief.\\5\\ In suits involving \n     the BBA, litigants seeking to meet the above general standing \n     requirements fall into three categories: citizens, taxpayers, \n     and Members of Congress.\n\n                            A. Citizen suits\n\n       The most important recent Supreme Court pronouncement on \n     the standing doctrine is contained in Lujan v. Defenders of \n     Wildlife.\\6\\ There, in an opinion by Justice Scalia, the \n     Court in reviewing its own precedents made clear that \n     standing has three\n      elements: (1) the litigant must have suffered an ``injury in \n     fact'' which is concrete, particularized, actual and \n     imminent and not hypothetical,\\7\\ (2) there must be a \n     casual connection between the injury and conduct \n     complained of, e.g., the injury must result from actions \n     of the complained party and not a third party,\\8\\ and (3) \n     it must be likely, as opposed to speculative, and the \n     injury must be ``redressable'' by a favorable court \n     decision.\\9\\\n       Turning to the three-part test, it is doubtful that a \n     citizen or citizen associations could demonstrate the \n     ``injury in fact'' prong of the standing test because it is \n     well settled that a mere interest in the constitutionality of \n     a law or executive action is noncognizable.\\10\\ Moreover, it \n     is doubtful that a litigant could demonstrate that the \n     challenged law was the one that ``unbalanced'' the \n     budget:\\11\\ in a sense, every spending program could be said \n     to do so. And it is beyond cavil that a congressional \n     reduction of a spending program, or eliminating it \n     altogether, is not considered a constitutional harm and thus \n     not actionable.\\12\\\n       As to the third prong, ``redressability'', this prong \n     subsumes justiciability and the political question doctrine \n     and will be discussed in greater detail below. Suffice it to \n     say that except in highly unlikely circumstances, it is \n     nearly certain that a judicial remedy which interferes with \n     congressional control over the budgetary process or Congress' \n     Article I powers would violate the separation of powers \n     doctrine.\n\n                          B. Taxpayer standing\n\n       In Flast v. Cohen,\\13\\ the Court announced a liberalized \n     standing test for taxpayers. Under this ``double nexus'' \n     test, taxpayer standing requires that the taxpayer-plaintiff: \n     (1) challenge the unconstitutionality of the law under the \n     Taxing and Spending Clause of the Constitution, and (2) \n     demonstrate that the challenged enactment exceeds specific \n     limitations contained in the Constitution. Professor Tribe \n     has testified that some taxpayers' suits to enforce the BBA \n     would satisfy this test because the proposed amendment would \n     be a specific constitutional limitation on congressional \n     taxing and spending power. There are three counters to this \n     argument: (1) recent Court decisions appear to have severely \n     limited the Flast doctrine;\\14\\ indeed, the Court seems to \n     limit Flast to Establishment Clause situations,\\15\\ (2) \n     implementing legislation would be enacted not for some \n     illicit purpose that violates some specific provision of the \n     Constitution, but to effectuate a balanced budget, and (3) \n     the Flast test is not a substitute for the Lujan test, \n     meeting the Flast test only establishes the ``harmed in \n     fact'' first prong of Lujan\\16\\ and, as explained below, it \n     is doubtful that Lujan's ``redressability'' prong can be met \n     by taxpayer-plaintiffs. This conclusion is supported by the \n     Lujan decision itself, whereby taxpayer standing cases are \n     discussed in context of concrete harm.\n\n                       C. Congressional standing\n\n       The final possible route to standing in cases challenging \n     the BBA, congressional standing, also seems to have little \n     chance\n      of \n     [[Page S3261]] success. It must be pointed out that the \n     Supreme Court has never addressed the question of \n     congressional standing and that the Circuit courts are \n     divided on this issue.\\17\\ However, the D.C. Circuit \n     recognizes congressional standing in the following limited \n     circumstances:\\18\\ (1) the traditional standing tests of the \n     Supreme Court are met, (2) there must be a deprivation within \n     the ``zone of interest'' protected by the Constitution or a \n     statute (generally, the right to vote on a given issue or the \n     protection of the efficacy of a vote),\\19\\ and (3) \n     substantial relief cannot be obtained from fellow legislators \n     through the enactment, repeal or amendment of a statute \n     (``equitable discretion'' doctrine). Although there is an \n     argument to be made that in certain limited and far-fetched \n     circumstances (e.g., where Congress ignores the three-fifths \n     vote requirement to raise the debt limitation) the voting \n     rights of legislators are nullified and therefore there would \n     be standing, the court could equally invoke the equitable \n     discretion doctrine to dismiss the action because the Member \n     of Congress could obtain relief by appealing to his other \n     colleagues for a vote for reconsideration of the issue.\n       In other circumstances challenging the enforcement of \n     spending measures, Members of Congress would be subject to \n     the same exacting standards as citizens.\n\n\n        iii. justiciability and the political question doctrine\n\n       Faced with a case challenging appropriations that allegedly \n     cause outlays to exceed total receipts, federal courts \n     historically would inquire first whether the litigant had \n     standing and would then evaluate the content of the claim \n     pursuant to the political question doctrine.\\20\\ Although it \n     is uncertain whether the doctrine rests upon prudence,\\21\\ or \n     inheres in the Constitution,\\22\\ the doctrine is generally \n     understood as ``essentially a function of the separation of \n     powers.''\\23\\\n       The Court in Baker v. Carr,\\24\\ set out a lengthy test to \n     determine when courts should dismiss an action on political \n     question grounds. Since Baker, the Court has narrowed the \n     political question doctrine to two elements: (1) whether \n     there is a demonstrable commitment of the issue to a \n     coordinate political department, and (2) whether there is a \n     lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for \n     resolving the issue (``justiciability'').\\25\\ Essentially \n     identical to the ``redressability'' issue discussed above, \n     analysis of the first prong reveals significant separation of \n     powers concerns. Any significant relief (outside of a \n     congressional standing suit for declaratory judgment) would \n     require placing the budget process under judicial \n     receivership (e.g., injunctive relief setting a pro-rata \n     budget cut or the nullification of any measure after outlays \n     exceed receipts). This relief interferes with congressional \n     Article I powers. In other words, federal courts may not \n     exercise Congress' spending and taxing authority, such \n     authority being exclusively delegated to Congress, a \n     coordinate branch of the federal government, by the \n     Constitution. Concerning the justiciability prong, budgetary, \n     spending, and tax policies are quintessential areas of \n     governance where there is a lack of judicially discoverable \n     and manageable standards.\\26\\ Certainly,\n      there are no available standards for courts to determine \n     which spending programs to cut or to declare unlawful.\n       There is another related justifiability issue: whether the \n     granting of equitable or declaratory relief so interferes \n     with the congressional budget process that courts should \n     abstain from granting such relief as a matter of \n     prudence.\\27\\ This is another theory by which courts can be \n     constrained from interfering with congressional spending and \n     taxing powers under the BBA.\n       Finally, there is an issue whether courts could simply \n     grant declaratory relief\\27\\ adjudicating an executive action \n     or legislative act unconstitutional and leaving remedial \n     action to the political branches. Outside of the bizarre,\\29\\ \n     courts generally will not grant declaratory relief to avoid \n     the political question doctrine or where injunctive relief is \n     not available.\\30\\\n\n\n                 iv. the concern over judicial taxation\n\n       I know that you are concerned that the Supreme Court's 5-4 \n     holding in Missouri v. Jenkins\\31\\ is an invitation for \n     courts to raise taxes in the event that there is an \n     imbalanced budget. In this case, the Supreme Court in essence \n     upheld a lower court remedy ordering state or county \n     political subdivisions to raise taxes to support a court \n     ordered school desegregation order. Intentional segregation, \n     in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection \n     Clause, had been found by the lower court in a prior case \n     against the school district.\n       The fear is that the BBA would allow a federal court to \n     order Congress to raise taxes to reduce a budget deficit. \n     This is virtually impossible. First, Jenkins is a Fourteenth \n     Amendment case. Under Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence, \n     federal courts may\\32\\ perhaps issue this type of remedial \n     relief against the States, but not against Congress--a \n     coequal branch of government. The Fourteenth Amendment, of \n     course, does not apply to the federal government. Second, \n     separation of powers concerns, as well as the political \n     question doctrine, argue against courts arrogating to \n     themselves congressional power by imposing taxes. This was \n     implicitly recognized by the Jenkins Court which stated that \n     the situation before the Court was not one in which it was \n     asked to order a co-equal branch of government--Congress--to \n     raise taxes. Indeed, the Court in Jenkins noted that the case \n     before them was a Fourteenth Amendment case involving state \n     action and not ``an instance of one branch of the Federal \n     Government invading the province of another.''\\33\\ Third, \n     Congress cannot be a party-defendant. To order taxes to be \n     raised, Congress must be a named defendant. Presumably, suits \n     to enforce the BBA would arise when an official or agency of \n     the executive branch seeks to enforce or administer a statute \n     whose funding is in question in light of the BBA.\\34\\ \n     Consequently, there is no real ``analogy'' that a court can \n     make between the Jenkins case--\n      which involved state action under the Fourteenth Amendment--\nand a situation involving the enforcing of a federal statute \nimplementing the BBA.\n\n\n             V. Statutory Protection of Congressional Power\n\n       I think it just wrong that Congress cannot and will not \n     protect its institutional prerogatives. The Framers of the \n     Constitution designed a constitutional system whereby each \n     branch of government would have the power to check the zeal \n     of the other branches. In James Madison's words in The \n     Federalist No. 51:\n       ``[T]he great security against a gradual concentration of \n     the several powers in the same department, consists in giving \n     to those who administer each department, the necessary \n     constitutional means, and personal motives, to resist \n     encroachments of others. The provision for defense must in \n     this, as in all other cases, be made commensurate to the \n     danger of attack. Ambition must be made to counteract \n     ambition.''\n       Under the enforcement mechanism of the BBA,\\35\\ the \n     Congress could limit the type of equitable relief granted by \n     federal courts and thereby limit court intrusiveness into the \n     budget process and Congress' exercise of its Article I \n     powers. It is well established that this authority may also \n     arise out of Article III's delegation to Congress to define \n     and limit the jurisdiction of lower federal courts.\\36\\ \n     Congress may not, however, use its authority to limit or \n     define jurisdiction in a manner that violates specific \n     provisions of the Constitution or denies any relief what-so-\n     ever.\\37\\ Congress may also limit judicial review to \n     particular special tribunals with limited authority to grant \n     relief.\\38\\\n       Use of Congress' authority under section 6 of the Amendment \n     or Article III of the Constitution to limit the remedies a \n     court may provide, does not mean in any way, as you suggested \n     in your floor speech, a ``cut off all avenues of judicial \n     review of a constitutional issue.'' This I have readily \n     conceded above is beyond congressional power. What it does \n     mean is that Congress may protect its Article I prerogatives \n     by limiting--not eliminating--the scope of remedies that \n     courts may render.\n\n\n                      VI. Presidential Impoundment\n\n       A good deal of the ``standing'' examples you provided in \n     your floor statement are really concerns over presidential \n     impoundment.\\39\\ I want to initially say that there is \n     nothing in H.J. Res. 1 that authorizes or otherwise allows \n     for impoundment. Nor is it the intent of the amendment to \n     grant the President any impoundment authority under H.J. Res. \n     1. Indeed, H.J. Res. 1 imposes one new duty, and \n     corresponding authority, on the President: to transmit to \n     Congress a proposed budget for each fiscal year in which \n     total outlays do not exceed total receipts.\\40\\\n       In fact, there is a ``ripeness'' problem to any attempted \n     impoundment: up to the end of the fiscal year the President \n     has no plausible basis to impound funds because Congress \n     under the amendment has the power to ameliorate any budget \n     shortfalls or ratify or specify the amount of deficit \n     spending that may occur in that fiscal year.\n       Moreover, under section 6 of the amendment, Congress must--\n     and I emphasize ``must''--mandate exactly what type of \n     enforcement mechanism it wants, whether it be sequestration, \n     rescission, or the establishment of a contingency fund. The \n     President, as Chief Executive, is duty bound to enforce a \n     particular requisite congressional scheme to the exclusion of \n     impoundment. That the President must enforce a mandatory \n     congressional budgetary measure has been the established law \n     since the nineteenth century case of Kendall v. United States \n     ex rel. Stokes, 37 U.S. (1 Pet.) 54 (1838).\\41\\ The Kendall \n     case was given new vitality in the 1970s, when lower federal \n     courts, as a matter of statutory construction, rejected \n     attempts by President Nixon to impound funds where Congress \n     did not give the President discretion to withhold \n     funding.\\42\\\n       The position that section 6 implementing legislation would \n     preclude presidential impoundment was seconded by Attorney\n      General Barr at the recent Judiciary Committee hearing on \n     the balanced budget amendment. Testifying that the \n     impoundment issue was in reality incomprehensible, General \n     Barr concluded that ``the whip hand is in Congress' hand, \n     so to speak; under Section 6 [the] Congress can provide \n     the enforcement mechanism that the courts will defer to \n     and that the President will be bound by.''\n       [[Page S3262]] What we have here then, is an argument based \n     on a ``mere possibility'' or fear of impoundment. I strongly \n     believe that the President is not given any new authority \n     under the BBA to impound funds, and that the mandatory \n     enforcement implementing legislation would preclude any real \n     impoundment possibilities. This was all but conceded by \n     Assistant Attorney General Dellinger in his testimony on the \n     BBA before my Committee. I also want to emphasize that \n     because section 6 of the amendment allows Congress to rely on \n     estimates, the fact that there might be some budgetary \n     shortfall in a given fiscal year's budget does not \n     necessarily render that budget out of compliance with the \n     BBA.\n\n\n                          vii. other concerns\n\n       Finally, I want to address two additional concerns that you \n     have expressed in your floor statement. First, I have to \n     disagree with your statement that state balanced budget \n     litigation is widespread. In fact, there are very few \n     reported cases. We also have to take note that state balanced \n     budget amendments are very different than H.J. Res. 1, in \n     that there is usually a distinction made between state \n     capital and operating budgets which sometimes results in \n     litigation over the meaning of ``state debt'' and ``capital \n     expenditure.'' Also, many state courts do not have standing \n     or justiciability requirements as barriers to bringing a \n     lawsuit.\\43\\\n       Finally, concerning the statements of noted experts, such \n     as Judge Bork, that there could indeed be judicial \n     enforcement of the BBA. My response is that Judge Bork--who \n     is a very close friend--and whose contentions are contained \n     in a letter of January, 1994, has greatly exaggerated fears \n     of judicial activism in a BBA context. In fact, he admits \n     that there would probably be no standing to bring a challenge \n     to actions taken under the amendment. The substance of his \n     argument is ``what if'' courts took jurisdiction; what would \n     stop them from interfering in the budgetary process. He did \n     not consider at all in his letter, however, the well-accepted \n     precept that implementing legislation could curtail the \n     excesses of judicial activism.\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\The other ``standing'' examples you provide for in your \n     February 23 floor statement implicate presidential \n     impoundment and will be addressed below.\n     \\2\\An issue prior to standing is identification of the proper \n     party defendant. The appropriate defendant in a case \n     involving the BBA is the person acting unconstitutionally \n     under the law, almost always an executive branch official, \n     since that branch is charged with the administration of the \n     law. See Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 163-66 \n     (1803); Reigle v. Federal Open Mkt. Comm., 656 F.2d 873, 879 \n     n.6 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1082 (1981). Another \n     issue is ``ripeness.'' Because under the BBA Congress may \n     correct any budgetary shortfalls right up to the end of the \n     fiscal year, potential plaintiffs are prevented from \n     litigating until that time--another daunting hurdle litigants \n     face in challenging congressional measures implementing the \n     BBA.\n     \\3\\See, e.g., Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans \n     United, Inc., 454 U.S. 465, 475 (1982) (``We need not mince \n     words when we say that the concept of `Art. III standing' has \n     not been defined with complete consistency . . . by this \n     Court. . . .'').\n     \\4\\E.g., Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 204 (1962).\n     \\5\\It also is now clear that standing is an Article III \n     requirement that can not be waived by Congress or the courts. \n     See Valley Forge, 454 U.S. at 488 n.24; Simon v.

Suffice it to \n     say that the Court held that there was no showing of ``injury \n     in fact''.\n     \\7\\Citing, Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 508 (1975) and Los \n     Angeles v.

Reservists Comm. to \n     Stop the War, 418 U.S. 208 (1974); United States v. \n     Richardson, 418 U.S. 166 (1974).

J. 597 (1976) (where Professor Henkin argues that the \n     political question doctrine boils down to the discretionary \n     equitable power of courts not to dispense relief). See \n     Colegrove v.

Madison, 5. U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 175-80, \n     (1803)). Illustrative of this point is Powell v. McCormack, \n     395 U.S. 486 (1969), where Congressman Adam Clayton Powell \n     was ``excluded'' by the House from taking his seat. Powell \n     sued the enforcement official--Speaker McCormack, under whose \n     jurisdiction the Sergeant-at-Arms was--and not the House of \n     Congress as a whole. In contrast, Members of Congress have \n     absolute immunity to suit for actions taken on the floor of \n     the Chamber when acting in a legislative capacity, such as \n     voting for or against a measure. See U.S. Const. art. I, sec. \n     6 (``Speech or Debate Clause'').\n     \\35\\Section 6 of H.J.

Shinner & Co., 303 U.S. (1938). Furthermore, the BBA \n     does not create an individual ``right'' akin to the First \n     Amendment's Free Speech Clause. As stated above, there is no \n     right to a balanced budget much as the Twenty-first Amendment \n     repealing prohibition creates no right to drink alcohol; the \n     BBA is simply a procedural limitation on Congress' taxing, \n     spending, and borrowing powers which creates a presumption in \n     favor of a balanced budget that may be overcome by a three-\n     fifths vote of the whole number of each House.\n     \\38\\E.G., the Emergency Price Control Act, which established \n     a special Emergency Court of Appeals vested with exclusive \n     authority to determine the validity of claims under that Act. \n     The Court in Yakus v. United States, 319 U.S. 182 (1943), \n     upheld the constitutionality of this limited judicial \n     enforcement mechanism. Accord Dames & Moore v. Regan, 453 \n     U.S. 654 (1981) (upholding constitutionality of executive \n     order, promulgated pursuant to congressional delegation of \n     power, establishing Iranian-United States Claims Tribunal as \n     exclusive forum to settle claims to Iranian assets).\n     \\39\\For example, you quote Walter Dellinger's example where a \n     social security beneficiary would have standing to challenge \n     a presidential order reducing benefits. The other Dellinger \n     example given is a similar one, with welfare payments being \n     substituted for social security payments, A twist is added, \n     wherein a state would have standing to sue if a President \n     does not impound funds. I, in all respect, believe these \n     examples to be gross exaggerations of the law. First, a \n     President must faithfully execute the law pursuant to his \n     oath of office, and, therefore, must enforce these social \n     spending programs. Second, neither a state nor an individual \n     would have standing to challenge a spending program, as \n     explained above. How are they individually harmed by the \n     enforcement of the programs? Finally, and ironically, if the \n     first example challenging impoundment somehow prevailed in \n     litigation, it would be a vindication of congressional \n     prerogatives over the budget.\n     \\40\\H.J.

I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank the Senator for yielding his time.\n  Mr. President, my colleagues, amendments to the Constitution cannot \nbe passed by the Congress alone. It is a partnership arrangement. The \nprocess must also include ratification by the various States. Three-\nfourths of the States, 38 States, must also join with the Congress in \nratifying any proposed amendment to the Constitution before it comes \npart of the Constitution.\n  In order for me to justify not even voting to send this proposal to \nmy State of Louisiana and the various other States for them to debate \nand to vote on this measure, I must be convinced that on its face this \namendment is such bad public policy that it must die here in \nWashington. Is this amendment perfect? No, it certainly is not. Its \nfaults are many and they raise serious concerns in a number of areas.\n  No. 1, can unelected Federal judges who are appointed for life raise \ntaxes and cut programs to enforce this measure? The Nunn and Johnston \namendments address this particular question. I understand that there \nare those this morning who are willing to correct it with the adoption \nof the Nunn amendment which would go a long ways to correcting this \nvery serious problem. The question of how can the States cast an \nintelligent vote on ratification without having the right to know in \nadvance, for instance what will happen to them if it is ratified, is a \nvery serious concern that needs further debate and consideration. Are \nprograms, such as those that have trust funds as a means of funding \nprograms, like the Social Security Program, in danger of being cut \nunder this amendment? There needs to be further discussion and further \ndebate on that particular issue.\n  The answers to these questions are not clear and more debate, not \nless, must occur. It is an issue that has generated a great deal of \njustified emotion. National polls and polls of my State of Louisiana \nindicate that approximately 75 percent of American people support a \nbalanced budget amendment. But the polls also indicate, at the same \ntime, that they do not support the balanced budget amendment if it \nmeans that there will be cuts in Social Security, or there will be cuts \nin Medicare, or there are likely to be cuts in some other favorite \nprogram of our constituents.\n  I voted for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution in the \npast as I believe the long-term debt of our Nation is a critical \nproblem that, so far, we have been giving to our children and to our \ngrandchildren. We have made good efforts on reducing the deficits, as \nwe have in 1993 in adopting President Clinton's deficit reduction plan \nwhich cut the deficit by $500 billion over 5 years. I might add we made \nthat very difficult decision without a single Republican vote. But more \nneeds to be done, and if this amendment passes there will be many more \nand difficult decisions to make. It will not be easy.\n  I cannot vote to kill this effort today, here in Washington. Our \nStates must be involved. They should have the right to bring this \nmeasure up in our State legislatures, debate it, and then have the \nright and indeed the obligation to vote on it. For me to vote no here \nin Washington is to say to my State of Louisiana, and the other States, \nthat I know so much more than you on this particular issue that I now \nvote no so that you cannot vote at all. I will not do that. So today I \nwill vote yes on the balanced budget amendment and send it to the \nStates for ratification and consideration.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/28/senate-section/article/S3231-5", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3263-S3274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order \nfor me to move to table the following amendments en bloc, and the \nordering of the yeas and nays be in order, with one show of seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask the Senator to clarify his request to \nmake sure that the request does not include the tabling of several \namendments listed en bloc.\n  Mr. HATCH. As I understand it, what we are trying to do is make sure \nthe motions to table on each of these amendments will be in place. They \ncan be called up separately.\n  I modify my unanimous-consent request to make that clear.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, then, now that the \nunanimous consent has been modified, will the Chair restate it, please?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the Chair's understanding that the \nSenator has requested to move to table each individual amendment en \nbloc, and to order the yeas and nays en bloc, but that the votes would \nactually be taken individually. Is that correct?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is correct. I now move to table the following \namendments.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am still reserving my right to object.\n  Mr. HATCH. Sure.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Those votes would occur beginning this afternoon, is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the Chair's understanding that they \nwould take place this afternoon.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have no objection.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, with that understanding I now move to table \nthe following amendments and motion and ask for the yeas and nays: The \nKennedy amendment No. 267, Nunn amendment No. 299, Levin amendment No. \n273, Levin amendment No. 310, Levin amendment No. 311, Pryor amendment \nNo. 307, Byrd amendment No. 252, Byrd amendment No. 254, Byrd amendment \nNo. 255, Byrd amendment No. 253, Byrd amendment No. 258, Kerry motion \nto commit to budget committee.\n  The Nunn amendment is as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HATCH. Excuse me--that is right. I withdraw that last statement. \nJust the amendments I read the numbers for.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to personally chat with the \ndistinguished Senators from Georgia and Louisiana. I have listened to \ntheir comments carefully and will agree that we would take the \namendment of the distinguished Senator from Georgia, as modified--\nhopefully by a voice vote. It will save us all time but nevertheless to \naccommodate the distinguished Senator. And hope that would, of course, \nallow us to proceed from there.\n  Mr. NUNN. I thank my friend from Utah and my friend from Illinois, \nand also Senator Craig and Senator Lott and others who have worked hard \nmaking this amendment acceptable.\n  The Senator from Washington State, Senator Dorgan, and I have had \nsome conversations also. Some of the language in this amendment now as \nis modified has been suggested by the Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. President, I think this is enormously important, as I said. I \nwill not repeat my remarks but I appreciate the fact that the managers \nof the bill have agreed to accept this amendment or to recommend its \nacceptance to the Senate. I urge my colleagues to vote for the \namendment. Assuming as I do assume that the amendment will be part of \nthis constitutional amendment, then I will vote for the final passage \non the constitutional amendment and I urge my colleagues to join in \nthat effort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, there are a number of Senators who have \nexpressed concerns about a voice vote on this amendment. Given the fact \nthat it has been the subject of debate and people are on record on this \namendment during the course of the last several weeks of debate, I \nsuggest that we have a rollcall, just to provide Senators the \nopportunity to express themselves on this amendment.\n  [[Page S3264]] But that is consistent with the unanimous-consent \nrequest. I urge we do that.\n  At this time I yield 7 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Dakota for \nyielding the time. Twelve years ago I was a member of the House Ways \nand Means Committee when we wrote a piece of legislation called the \nSocial Security Reform Act, one of the most significant, important, and \nuseful things we did during the entire decade of the 1980's. We raised \npayroll taxes on both the employees and employers, we did a whole \nseries of things to make the Social Security system work for, we \nthought then, 50 years. And we solved it for that period of time.\n  During the writing of that bill, which I participated in, I expressed \ngreat concern about the fact that the surpluses that we designed to \noccur in the Social Security system would be misused unless we \nprotected them. We created surpluses. This year the surplus alone is \n$69 billion and the question is, is it being protected? The answer is \nno.\n  All during the discussion of this constitutional amendment, and on \nprevious occasions when we have debated it, I have raised this \nquestion. Unfortunately, following an hour and a half discussion \nyesterday with the proponents of this legislation, it appears that this \nquestion will not be resolved. I indicated two concerns, one of which \nhas now been resolved, for which I am appreciative: The enforcement \nissue.\n I think that resolved that concern.\n\n  But I am also concerned about the Social Security trust fund. Does \nanyone in this room believe that it is appropriate to use Social \nSecurity trust funds for other purposes? That is what is happening. \nThat is what will happen under the imprimatur of the Constitution if \nthe balanced budget amendment is passed with this language.\n  The way to correct this problem is with the Reid amendment. We had a \nvote on that and lost. The way to correct it is with the substitute \noffered by Senator Feinstein. We will have a vote on that, and I expect \nthat will lose.\n  The other way to correct it is for the proponents to bring up \nimplementing language today, before we pass the constitutional \namendment, which defines expenditures and receipts as not including \nSocial Security, and that will solve the problem as far as I am \nconcerned. Pass the Reid amendment or pass the Feinstein substitute, \neither of which will solve this problem as far as I am concerned. If \nthat does not happen, when the final roll is called, I will be voting \nagainst this amendment, and I want people to understand why.\n  This is three-forths of a trillion dollars. This is not a $10 or $20 \nbillion issue. It is three-forths of a trillion dollars and deals with \nthe promise between those who work and those who have retired and deals \nwith the agreement that we made in 1983 about how we would protect the \nfuture of the Social Security system in this country. We can protect it \nin this constitutional amendment to balance the budget. It is our \ndecision. The will of the Senate will be expressed to determine whether \nwe do that or do not. I am told that it is not possible to protect \nSocial Security because there are not sufficient votes for it. If that \nis the case, then it is not possible for me to vote for this \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget. If between now and the \nend of the day people say that is possible, I say, fine, let us do it \nthen. And then I will revisit this issue.\n  But I just want people to understand that my notion of this issue has \nnot changed. It is an enormously important consideration. Social \nSecurity is one of the most important things this country has ever \ndone. The 1983 reform act was one of the most significant pieces of \nlegislation in the last decade and a half. And the question is whether \nwe are going to be true to our word and stand for the solvency of the \nSocial Security system for the long term.\n  On the broader question, do we need a balanced budget amendment? You \nhad better believe we do. We need greater balanced budget discipline, \nwhether it is a constitutional amendment or whether some new \nlegislative initiative. We are sinking in a sea of debt. Yes, we need \nto do this. But you do not pull yourself out of a sea of debt by \ninappropriately spending three-forths of a trillion dollars of Social \nSecurity revenue. One is not a tradeoff for the other.\n  I will simply not vote for a constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget unless this problem is solved in one of two ways: either pass \nthe implementing legislation to redefine what is meant by receipts and \noutlays before we pass the constitutional amendment, or pass the Reid \namendment as embodied in Senator Feinstein's substitute. One or the \nother is satisfactory to me. If it appears neither will be done, those \nwho count votes should understand I will then vote no on the \nconstitutional amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We have about 8 minutes 10 seconds.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield the remainder of my time to the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished leader.\n  Mr. President, I compliment the distinguished Senator from Georgia \n[Mr. Nunn] on his efforts to cure a major flaw in this constitutional \namendment to balance the budget. I shall vote for his amendment. \nNevertheless, Mr. President, I do not feel that this amendment by Mr. \nNunn will effectively bar the courts from intervening in cases or \ncontroversies that will arise outside this or even inside the article. \nLet us read the amendment. The ``judicial power of the United States.'' \nMr. President, that language does not appear to say anything about the \nState courts. In fact, by omitting any reference to State courts, the \nlanguage impliedly invites them to come in.\n\n       The judicial power of the United States shall not extend to \n     any case or controversy arising under this article.\n\n  ``Under this article.'' Suppose the case or controversy arises under \nsome other article, under the takings clause, under the obligations of \ncontract clause, or under the due process clause. The Supreme Court of \nthe United States, if it construes a case or controversy as affected by \nthis amendment, is going to take into consideration the whole document, \nthe four corners of the Constitution and the other amendments thereto. \nAnd if there is a John Marshall on that court, he will find a way \nbecause, after all, the major purpose of this constitutional amendment \nis to bring into balance the outlays and receipts annually of the \nUnited States.\n  The amendment goes on to say--Mr. President, may we have order in the \nSenate? Mr. President, may we have order in the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We will not proceed until we have order in the \nSenate, please.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will read the Nunn amendment again.\n\n       The judicial power of the United States shall not extend to \n     any case or controversy arising under this article, except as \n     may be specifically authorized by legislation adopted \n     pursuant to this section.\n\n  Mr. President, we say here that the judicial power of the United \nStates shall not extend to any case or controversy arising under this \narticle except as may be specifically authorized by legislation adopted \npursuant to the article.\n  We all know that legislation that may be adopted to implement the \narticle may change from Congress to Congress. A subsequent Congress can \namend or repeal the implementing language enacted by a previous \nCongress.\n  So what we are setting up here is a situation in which uncertainty \nwill continue to be a key factor in the judgments that are to be \nreached, not only uncertainty within the government itself but by the \npeople. We are leaving it to the Congress to pass legislation \nauthorizing thus and so, perhaps authorizing the courts to enter into \nthis kind of case or that kind of case or another sort of controversy. \nSo we are left with the same uncertainty with this amendment as we are \nwithout it.\n  Mr. President, the proposed language by Mr. Nunn seeks to--and it may \neffectively do so up to a point--eliminate court jurisdiction over \nlegitimate \n[[Page S3265]] claims raised under the balanced budget amendment. This \nmeans, in effect, that the Nunn amendment confers no right not to be \nconvicted under a statute passed, for example, in violation of section \n4 of the amendment. Section 4 reads:\n\n       No bill to increase Federal revenue shall become law unless \n     approved by a majority of the whole number of each House by \n     rollcall vote.\n\n  Of course, the Constitution requires that bills that raise revenues \noriginate in the other body. If a person is convicted under a criminal \nstatute that originates in this body, but the contents of which \ncriminal statute result in an increase in revenues, then the defendant \nwho seeks relief will do well on the basis of a bill which raises \nrevenue--even though it was a criminal statute under which he was \nindicted and convicted--which did not originate with the other body.\n  The Nunn amendment confers no right not to be convicted under a \nstatute passed in violation of any of the sections of this amendment.\n  The Nunn amendment may, in certain cases, take away the right of an \ninjured citizen to challenge any cuts in benefits--mandated by law--\nordered by a President who is seeking to enforce the amendment by \nimpounding funds. As to due process, this amendment is writing the due \nprocess clause out of the Constitution, as far as such claims are \nconcerned. I have already indicated that citizens could be convicted of \na crime in violation of the Constitution, or taxed in violation of the \nConstitution. Yet, Congress would have the power to deny these citizens \naccess to the courts in which to vindicate their rights.\n  The courts could refuse to hear challenges to unconstitutional \nactions. It is unclear, Mr. President, whether this amendment can be \nraised as a defense. While the amendment seeks to bar plaintiffs from \naccess to the Federal courts to claim a violation of their rights, it \nis not clear whether the proposed language also would bar governmental \nactors--for example, the President of the United States--from raising \nthe balanced budget amendment as a defense. Here is an example: Suppose \nthe President cuts Social Security. The plaintiff might sue, but he \ndoes not sue under the balanced budget amendment but under a statute. \nThe President raises the defense that the balanced budget amendment \njustifies his action. How would a court rule? Would the court rule that \nthe case should be dismissed because of the balanced budget amendment? \nBut then, all the President has to do to escape scrutiny is to invoke \nthe amendment. Would the court rule that the plaintiff wins because the \ncourt has no power to review the defense? Then other plaintiffs could \nbring similar actions and the budget would go unbalanced.\n  Mr. President, let us say that the Nunn amendment is effective in \nbarring intervention by the Federal courts into cases or controversies \narising ``under this article.'' Even then, the result could be a shift \nto the President of unreviewable power to impound funds. The Federal \ncourts would be barred by this amendment from reviewing the President's \naction, despite the Framers' view that the power of the purse should be \nleft in the hands of the Congress, the closest representatives of the \npeople. And if Congress should respond to presidential impoundment by \ngranting the courts the power to review such actions, then the courts \nwould again be embroiled in the budget process and, quite possibly, in \nthe unseemly role of a conscripted ally of one branch against the \nother.\n  So, Mr. President, even if this amendment is effective in \naccomplishing the goal that the distinguished Senator from Georgia \nseeks, it seems to me that it creates a greater impetus to the flow of \nlegislative power and the control of the purse from the legislative \nbranch to the President. The amendment provides that the courts, in \nessence, may be authorized to intervene based on implementing \nlegislation that may be passed or may not be passed and may be changed \nfrom Congress to Congress. And thus, it gives authority for the \nCongress to transfer legislative powers to the courts.\n  Subsequent legislation to implement the article may be vetoed. That \nwould require two-thirds of both Houses to override the President's \nveto. Even if it becomes law, a subsequent Congress can change the law. \nThe provision may be read as granting Congress the power to confer \nsweeping legislative powers over taxing and spending priorities on the \ncourts, in the guise of implementing legislation.\n  This is a mess. Congress may very well, in implementing legislation, \ndecide just to hand the whole mess over to the courts of the land. Such \nlegislation would abdicate Congress' fundamental responsibility over \ntaxing and spending and transfer it to unelected judges, and thus \ndecrease the accountability of the Federal Government to the taxpayers. \nThe courts would be blamed for making the tough choices, though it may \nbe two, three or four, five years down the road. But by then the \nfingerprints of the proponents of this amendment would be cold, and the \nmess would be left in the hands of the courts. The courts would be \nblamed for making the tough choices, which should be the responsibility \nof the elected officials.\n  Assuming, Mr. President, that the amendment would be effective in \nstripping court jurisdiction and assuming further that Presidential \nimpoundment is not the result--and those are large assumptions--the \namendment would be an empty promise inscribed in the fundamental \ncharter of our Nation.\n  Mr. President, the proponents of this amendment have thus far tabled \nall amendments. Their ears have been deaf to the pleas of those \nSenators who have sought to protect the Social Security trust fund. \nThere was no give on that amendment. There was no give on amendments \nthat would deal with the ups and downs, the rises and the falls in the \neconomy--no give on that. But suddenly, here comes an amendment that \nthe proponents on the other side of the aisle seem to be willing to \ntake. What about all of the other amendments that they have rejected?\n  If the Nunn amendment is included in this overall constitutional \narticle, then the balanced budget constitutional amendment as amended \ngoes back to the House. If the House does not accept the Nunn language, \nthen the balanced budget amendment will go to a conference. The whole \nbalanced budget amendment may then be rewritten in that conference. \nWhen that conference report comes back to the Senate, it may not look \nlike the balanced budget amendment that is presently before the Senate. \nSenators would certainly not have the opportunity to debate at length a \nconference report on a constitutional amendment that had been \nmeasurably changed in the conference process.\n  Mr. President, I see many slips between the cup and lip in connection \nwith this amendment. It is well-intentioned. I intend to vote for it. \nBut, Mr. President, it demonstrates the farce that we are about to vote \non later today--the farce in the form of this constitutional amendment \nto balance the budget. It is a mess! It is a ``quick fix'', and there \nis no way to fix this quick fix. The Nunn amendment clearly \ndemonstrates that.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nUtah has 38 minutes under his control.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, today the Senate stands poised to \nvote on one of the most important measures that will come before this \nCongress. Indeed, for many in this Chamber, the vote on the balanced \nbudget amendment will be the most important vote they cast in their \ncareer, and I urge each of my colleagues to support it.\n  As I have stated on this floor before, I chose a career in public \nservice because, throughout my life, the public--through government--\nhelped broaden my opportunities. I am fundamentally committed to \nensuring that future generations have the same opportunities I enjoyed. \nEvery child born in this country--whether black or white, whether rich \nor poor--should have the chance to achieve his or her dreams. Every \nperson should have a chance to contribute to society, to the maximum \nextent their talent or ability will allow.\n  Government should play an active role in expanding people's \nopportunities. The Government should invest in technology and \ninfrastructure, in job \n[[Page S3266]]  creation and training, and in education, in order to \nraise the people's living standards. The Government should help \nunemployed Americans get back on their feet, should help those who want \nto work to find jobs, should ensure that high-quality, affordable \nhealth care is available to all Americans, and should protect our \nenvironment. Government is not the enemy of society; it should be a \npartner, an instrument of the people's will, and a facilitator of our \npublic interest. But if the Government does not get its fiscal house in \norder--if we don't act now to stop our runaway deficit spending--the \nGovernment will have little money left to provide for the public \ninterest. Only the holders of the treasury bonds will be assured of any \nGovernment assistance.\n  As I learned through my work on the Entitlements Commission, unless \nwe get the deficit under control, we will be leaving our children--and \nour children's children--a legacy of debt that will make it impossible \nfor them to achieve the American dream of living a better life than \ntheir parents.\n  There is simply no way to get around the fact that our present \nspending trends are not sustainable in the long term. In 1963, \nMandatory spending--the combination of entitlement programs and \ninterest on the national debt--comprised 29.6 percent of the Federal \nBudget. By 1983, that number has almost doubled, to 56.3 percent. Ten \nyears later, in 1993, mandatory spending was 61.4 percent of the annual \nbudget. Let me underscore that: today, mandatory spending--\nentitlements, plus interest on the national debt--comprise almost two \nthirds of the entire Federal Budget.\n  But what about the future? If we don't act now, by the year 2003--8 \nyears from now--mandatory spending will comprise 72 percent of the \nFederal Budget, 58.2 percent for entitlement programs, and 13.8 percent \nfor net interest on the national debt. Obviously, if we are spending 72 \npercent of budget on mandatory spending, there is not much left over \nfor defense, education, or infrastructure.\n  Consider this example. In real terms, AFDC benefits have actually \ndeclined since 1970. The significance of that fact should not be lost \non anyone. We are spending ourselves into a deeper and deeper hole, yet \npeople are not better off as result.\n  I have heard many opponents of the balanced budget amendment question \nthe need to tackle the deficit immediately. America is not, they \nmaintain, in the midst of a budgetary crisis. In the short term--the \nnext 7 years--that's perhaps true. The country can probably continue on \nits current irresponsible path for a few years into the next century. \nBut, after that, it will no longer be possible to ignore the basic \ndemographic and health care cost trends driving the increases in \nFederal spending. We simply will not be able to continue on our current \npath, and expect the Federal Government to function as a partner of the \npeople well into the next century. And, if we wait to act until crisis \ncomes, any action we take will be that much more painful, and that much \nless effective.\n  The entire Federal deficit for the current fiscal year--estimated at \n$176 billion--represents the interest owed on the huge national debt \nrun up during the 1980's. This year, and next year, the budget would be \nbalanced if not for the reckless supply-side economics that caused the \ndeficit to balloon from its 1980 level of about $1 trillion to its \ncurrent level of more than $4.7 trillion. If we had acted in 1980 to \ntackle the deficit, rather than adopting programs that merely fed its \nrapid growth, the problems we face today--in terms of demographics, and \nthe aging of the baby boomers--would seem much more manageable. In \n1980, interest on the debt was $75 billion--that is a lot of money, Mr. \nPresident, but it is nowhere near the $950 billion we currently pay. \nHow much better off we would be if, in 1980, congress had possessed the \ncourage to make the difficult choices, and balance the budget. Not \npassing the balanced budget amendment will not make our problems go \naway. Our ability to meet our priorities will be much greater if we \nenact the balanced budget amendment now, if we tackle the tough \nproblems now, instead of waiting until the country is on the brink of \nfinancial ruin. If we need any convincing about the need to address the \ndeficit now, in 1995, we should just look at the consequences of our \nfailure to address it then, in 1980.\n  But I disagree that deficit spending is the most effective way to \naccomplish that. In 1966, when our deficit totaled $3.7 billion, 2.6 \npercent of our budget went toward funding long-term investment. Now, \nwith our budget deficit about to hit $268 billion, our long-term \ninvestment has shrunk to 1.8 percent of the budget. The reason, I \nthink, is obvious--more and more of our funds must be devoted to paying \ninterest on the debt, leaving less and less for investment.\n  I have heard opponents of House Joint Resolution 1 state that we \nshould not be tinkering around with the\n Constitution. Well, I couldn't agree with them more. The years I spent \nstudying law at the University of Chicago gave me a deep appreciation \nfor the Constitution. I believe the U.S. Constitution to be the finest \nexposition of democratic principles ever written. I make that statement \nfully aware that, in its original form, the Constitution included \nneither African-Americans nor women in its vision of a democratic \nsociety. But it changed to better realize the promise of America. The \nbeauty of the Constitution is that it can, through a deliberate, \ncumbersome and sometimes painful process, be amended to reflect the \nchanging realities, and meet new challenges faced by our Nation. This \ncurrent problem--the problem of our growing fiscal disorder--is too \nimportant not to act on today. Who could be opposed to affirmatively \nstating in the Constitution that current generations must act \nresponsibly, so that future generations will not be forced to bear the \nburden of their irresponsibility? What could be more important than the \nfiscal integrity of our Nation? As another of our Founding Fathers, \nThomas Jefferson once said, ``We should consider ourselves unauthorized \nto saddle posterity with our debts, and morally bound to pay them \nourselves.'' Why is that proposition not important enough to be \nincluded in the Constitution?\n\n  Last year I had the honor of reading George Washington's farewell \naddress to the Nation on the floor of the Senate. In that address, Mr. \nWashington left us with some words of wisdom that, I believe, support \nthe notion of a balanced budget amendment. I would like to quote those \nhere today:\n\n       As a very important source of strength and security, \n     cherish public credit. One method of preserving it is to use \n     it as sparingly as possible, avoiding occasions of expense by \n     cultivating peace, but remembering, also, that timely \n     disbursements, to prepare for danger, frequently prevent much \n     greater disbursements to repel it; avoiding likewise the \n     accumulation of debt, not only by shunning occasion of \n     expense, by my vigorous exertions, in times of peace, to \n     discharge the debts which unavoidable wars may have \n     occasioned, not ungenerously throwing upon posterity the \n     burden which we ourselves ought to bear.\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would like to take head on the political \nimplications of this debate, because it is an important political \nquestion for the Congress. I am not a signatory of the Contract with \nAmerica. Indeed, I agree with Senator Byrd; the only contract with \nAmerica that matters to me is the U.S. Constitution.\n  But I want to be clear that this issue is not a partisan one. It \nreflects philosophical differences that have little to do with party \nlines. The senior Senator from my State of Illinois, Senator Simon, has \nbeen one of the chief advocates of the balanced budget amendment for \nyears. Senator Simon's liberal credentials are without question. He is, \nand has always been, a Democrat--he was at one time even a candidate \nfor our Presidential nomination. so this is not a Republican versus \nDemocrat debate. Nor is this a battle of the conservatives against the \nliberals. I am proud to call myself a liberal, for the simple reason \nthat I believe government has a positive and constructive role to play \nin promoting the public good. I do not believe government is the enemy \nof progress. I believe it can promote progress. In my lifetime, I have \nseen firsthand the positive contributions a commitment to the American \ndream of equality and opportunity can make, I would not be here but for \nthe struggles of people of good will to make the American dream a \nreality. And it is precisely because I so value their struggles that I \nbelieve we must take the steps that a commitment to \n[[Page S3267]] providing opportunity requires. We have a duty to use \nour decisionmaking power in a manner that preserves freedom and \nopportunity for all Americans, not only in this generation, but in \nevery generation to come.\n  Poor people are not helped by the deficits and out-of-control \nspending habits we cannot seem to shake. Its interesting as I listen to \nthe debate that swirls around the issue of the balanced budget \namendment and Social Security. The reason that debate is so intense, \nMr. President, is that current recipients of Social Security--and even \nthose of us in the baby boom generation who will be collecting checks \nin the not so distant future--have an absolute expectation that Social \nSecurity will provide for us in our retirement. The same cannot be said \nfor those in our younger generations. When you speak to people who are \nmy son Matthew's age, they have absolutely no faith that Government \nwill be there for them when they need it, that it will help them enjoy \nretirement security or affordable health care or a high standard of \nliving. And why should they, Mr. President? Since my son was born in \n1977, he has never seen a balanced budget. He has no idea what it means \nto live under a Federal Government that spends within its means. He has \nheard politician after politician promise to balance the budget, yet \nhas only seen the deficit skyrocket.\n  That cynicism grows deeper and deeper every day, despite \npronouncements of politicians that a brighter day is just around the \ncorner. The fact is, with current budget trends, a brighter day is not \naround the corner. What lies ahead, if we fail to act, is slower \neconomic growth, greater debt, fewer options and higher taxes. The time \nhas passed for us to realize that by failing to act, we are indeed \nmaking a choice--a choice that involves throwing away most of our \noptions for dealing with our fiscal problems. The only way we will be \nable to turn current budget trends around is to face reality with the \nhelp of the balanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. President, I want to take this debate back to the beginning--to \nthe Constitution. The Constitution states, in its preamble:\n\n       We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more \n     perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic \n     Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the \n     general Welfare, and to secure the Blessings of Liberty to \n     ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this \n     Constitution for the United States of America.\n\n  Mr. President, I believe that this constitutional preamble sets the \nstage for the vote we will soon cast on this balanced budget amendment, \nand tells us the direction in which we should go.\n  This Constitution gives Congress the power to protect Social \nSecurity, to respond to fiscal emergencies, and to foreclose judicial \ninterference in budgeting. It gives us the power to do everything \nnecessary to respond to concerns that have been raised in opposition to \nthis balanced budget amendment.\n  Unfortunately, absent the balanced budget amendment, the Constitution \ndoes not give us what we now lack--the will to make the difficult \ndecisions necessary for us to get our fiscal house in order. That is \nwhat the balanced budget amendment is calculated to do. It will impose \non Congress the fiscal discipline to do what we should have done years \nago, what George Washington exhorted us to do in his farewell address \nto the Nation, and what the preamble to this Constitution tells us to \ndo.\n  This is not a partisan debate, or at least it shouldn't be. The \nessence of this debate boils down to whether each individual Senator, \nregardless of party, believes we have a fundamental obligation to our \nposterity, and a fundamental obligation to the American people, to \nabide by the Constitution that we are all sworn to uphold.\n  Mr. President, I call upon my colleagues to take the pledge by voting \nfor this amendment that we will deficit spend no more, that we will be \nresponsible for the debts that we incur, that we will be responsible \nfor the budgets we pass, and that we will be responsible to future \ngenerations, and not saddle them with debt. I call on my fellow \nSenators to transcend the hysteria and fear that has fueled the \nopposition to this balanced budget amendment, and respond instead to \nour hopes, and to the responsibility that we are given as Members of \nthis U.S. Congress to get our fiscal house in order, to discharge our \ndebts, and not to ungenerously throw upon posterity the burdens which \nwe ourselves ought to bear.\n  Mr. President I thank the Senator from Utah for his yielding, and I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I will be brief. My views are already known \nto most of the Members of this body. I support the balanced budget \namendment reluctantly--as a bad idea whose time has come. What I really \nsupport are the balanced budgets this amendment seeks to achieve.\n  I support the amendment because I do not believe we are ever going to \nhave the will to actually balance our budgets without it and that out \nfailure to do so puts our future in doubt and demands extraordinary and \nuncommon action by this Congress.\n  Let me begin by saying that I endorsed this amendment more than a \ndecade ago, not because I believed then or now, that it will, in and of \nitself, bring our budget into balance, but because it establishes both \na call to action and a destination--and because it takes away an excuse \nfor not making the hard choices we are going to have to make with or \nwithout the amendment. It forces us to confront--head-on--the fiscal \ndisaster we have created, and it will force an essential discipline in \nour budget process that has been sadly absent.\n  President Clinton deserves enormous credit for the $500 billion \ndeficit reduction package, which passed this body in 1993. It took \ncourage and he did not have the bipartisan help he deserved. But it was \nnot enough.\n  Mr. President, during the course of this debate, I have heard many \nthoughtful and sincere arguments in opposition to this amendment.\n This morning, I would like to address just two of them--whether or not \nthe amendment will result in deep cuts to important programs and \nwhether or not the amendment is worthy of constitutional consideration.\n\n  Mr. President, those who oppose this amendment because it will lead \nto painful cuts are arguing not against the amendment, but against \nactually balancing the budget. None of the choices are easy.\n  But to oppose this amendment because of the difficult choices it will \nforce, is to say to the American people that we do not have the will to \ngovern responsibly and live within our means.\n  Making these choices means establishing essential priorities for our \nNation, identifying effective programs, that provide hope and \nopportunity for our people, programs that defend our freedom at home \nand abroad, and programs that invest in a better tomorrow for our \nchildren and our grandchildren.\n  Protecting these priorities means: saying ``no'' to less critical \nspending; and having the fortitude to turn to the revenue side when we \ncannot responsibly cut spending any more; and refusing to enact new tax \ncuts we cannot afford and tackling entitlement reform, the 800 pound \ngorilla of the 21st century.\n  If we do not, Mr. President, if we continue on our present course and \nspeed, entitlements and interest on the debt--and nothing more--will \nabsorb the entire tax revenue base of the Federal Government by the \nyear 2012. It will absorb all of it, with nothing left for national \ndefense or any other Federal program.\n  How then do we invest in our children?\n  Interest payments on the national debt will not ever put a single \npoor child through college. Interest payments on the national debt will \nnot ever provide nutrition for a disadvantaged pregnant woman, special \neducation for a child with disabilities, or the only hot meal of the \nday for a 6-year-old living in poverty.\n  I support this amendment, reluctantly, Mr. President, not because I \nwant to endanger programs that provide real opportunity for our \nchildren, but because I fear for the strength and security of the world \nwe leave them, and their children if we do not act today.\n  [[Page S3268]] A child born today will be 17 years old--a senior in \nhigh school--the year entitlements and interest on the debt begins to \nabsorb all our tax revenue.\n  What kind of a nation will that child inherit? Will it even resemble \nthe world of unlimited possibilities that our parents left us?\n  Today, we make that decision, Mr. President. Today, we decide the \nfuture of the class of 2012. Today, we either begin to assume the \nresponsibility for our own debt or we leave it to our children and our \ngrandchildren.\n  Our Founding Fathers would be dismayed to know that we have reached \nthe point where amending their Constitution is necessary to protect the \nstrength and security of future generations of Americans. And if we had \ngoverned with the political courage of our forefathers, we would not be \nfacing a fiscal crisis of such enormous proportion.\n  But I would argue, Mr. President, that paying our own bills is not a \ntrivial matter. Protecting our ability to invest in the kind of America \nwe want for our children, is not a minor academic argument. Tripling \nour debt in 15 years is not an inconsequential act. Mr. President, $6 \ntrillion is not trivial.\n  To me our own lack of will in paying our bills trivializes our \nConstitution--and this institution--far more than a balanced budget \namendment.\n  To the children graduating from high school in 2012, an amendment to \nbalance our Federal budget will be more important to the kind of \ncountry they inherit than the last amendment we added to the \nConstitution. That amendment, the 27th, ratified in May, 1992, required \nintervening elections before congressional pay raises go into effect.\n  The legacy of debt we leave our children, can never be trivial nor \ninconsequential. It violates a sacred obligation that has passed \nthrough generations of Americans, an obligation which has endured since \nthe birth of our democracy and the adoption of our Constitution. That \nobligation is to leave a future brighter than our past. If we do not \nact today we are violating that obligation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I thank the manager.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we are down to our last half-hour. It is my \nhonor to yield 4 minutes to the distinguished Senator from South \nCarolina, who was the first to ever fight for a balanced budget \namendment on our side and who deserves a lot of credit if this \namendment passes.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, we have seen the national debt and \ndeficits rise because, in large part, the Federal Government has grown. \nIt has grown tremendously out of reason.\n  The first $100 billion budget in the Nation occurred in 1962. This \nwas almost 180 years after the Nation was founded. Yet it took only 9 \nyears, from 1962 to 1971, for the Federal budget to reach $200 billion. \nThen, the Federal budget continued to skyrocket: $300 billion in 1975, \n$500 billion in 1979, $800 billion in 1983, and the first $1 trillion \nbudget in 1987. The budget for fiscal year 1995 was over $1.5 trillion.\n  Federal spending has gripped the Congress as a narcotic. It is time \nto break the habit and restore order to the fiscal policy of the \nNation. It is incumbent upon this body to send the balanced budget \namendment to the American people for ratification. I am pleased that we \nhave reached agreement to vote on final passage today.\n  I want to say this: The federal debt is $4.8 trillion. How did it \ncome about? Big government, big spending, not following sound fiscal \npolicy at all. The annual interest on this debt--the annual interest we \npay for which we get nothing, it just goes down the drain--$235 \nbillion. That is the second largest item in the budget.\n  The average annual deficit for each year during this decade has been \n$259 billion. It is unreasonable. How are we going to stop it? I have \nbeen here 40 years. We have balanced the budget only one time in 32 \nyears. The budget has been balanced only eight times in the last 64 \nyears. When are we going to stop it? When are we going to stop spending \nmore than we take in? When are we going to stop putting this debt on \nour children and grandchildren and generations to come.\n  I say to Members that we must take action. Today is the day to do it. \nToday is the day to pass this amendment and let the American people \nknow we mean business and we are going to protect this country. We have \nto protect it from this big spending just like we have to protect it in \ntime of war. Either can ruin this Nation.\n  Now, I want to mention this: The leadership in both houses have \nstated that Social Security will be protected in the implementing \nlegislation once the balanced budget amendment is adopted. I have long \nsupported our senior citizens and believe that the promise of Social \nSecurity is not to be broken. The Federal debt is the greatest threat \nto Social Security. Adoption of the balanced budget amendment and \nstrong language in the implementing legislation will ensure the \nviability of Social Security.\n  The Senate should pass this amendment. My home State of South \nCarolina has a balanced budget requirement. We have abided by it for \nyears. We do not run any deficits. Why? Because we have the mandate of \na balanced budget by constitutional provision. That is what we are \ntrying to get here. We also have a statute.\n  I say to Members, if we do not pass this amendment today, we will \nmiss a great opportunity. There is no one piece of legislation we can \npass this year or any year to come that is more important than this \nbalanced budget amendment. I hope we pass it today. It is for the good \nof America. It is for the good of our country. We ought to do it \nwithout delay. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator from \nTennessee for 1 minute.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, there is nothing more basic to human nature than \nlooking out for the interests of those we bring into this world. Yet we \nare not doing that in this country. On the contrary, we are creating an \neconomic disaster for the next generation, a debt that they will never \nbe able to dig out of and the prospects of living in a second-rate \ncountry.\n  We are doing this not because of some great depression. We are doing \nthis not because of some great war. We are doing this not because of \nsome natural disaster. We are doing this simply because we have lacked \nthe will to make the tough decisions.\n  Mr. President, through the history of the course of this country, in \ntimes of crisis, leaders of both parties have banded together to face \nthat crisis and overcome it. We must do so again this very day because, \nindeed, it is a crisis we face. We must do so by passing this balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  The people's voice could not be more clear on this matter. They have \nspoken in the polls. They have spoken through their legal, elected \nrepresentatives in the House. They stand ready to speak again in State \nlegislatures throughout this Nation once we have done our duty. Let it \nnot be said that it was the Senate of the United States of America that \nstifled the strong, clear voice of the American people. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished \nSenator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, Robert Louis Stevenson once said, ``These are my \npolitics: To change what we can to better what we can.'' With today's \nvote, we have the chance to do both.\n  Like so many other times in this great Nation's history, we are \nstanding today before the American people on the cusp of monumental \nchange. We have inherited the challenges and the responsibilities of \nleadership of previous generations of Americans, Americans who have \nstood in this Chamber and voted for difficult votes that molded the \nimage of their generation.\n  In this century alone we had women's suffrage, the declaration of \nWorld War II, and civil rights laws. Each of these events ended the \nstatus quo of one generation and ushered in a new beginning for the \nnext.\n  The prophetic nature of this debate cannot be understated in the \nannals of America's history. This is a defining moment for our \ngeneration. This is our chance to be remembered for what is just and \nright in our time. This is our last chance to roll back the years of \nindebtedness.\n  This legacy of debt is not just an imbalance between revenues and \nexpenditures. It is an imbalance between trust and responsibilities. \nThe last time the \n[[Page S3269]] Congress balanced its budget was when America put a man \non the noon.\n  If there is one thing that we have learned in the last 26 years, it \nis this: We cannot balance our budget in the absence of a stronger \nforce than politics.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished \nSenator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, outside the Senate Chamber on the Capitol \ngrounds, the debt clock is ticking: an additional $9,600 every second, \n$576,000 every minute, $35 million every hour, and $829 million every \nday. That is nearly $1 billion in additional debt the Federal \nGovernment is accumulating each and every day. It is a catastrophe \nwaiting to happen.\n  The choice before the Senate today is clear. We can defuse that time \nbomb of debt by passing the balanced budget amendment and begin to make \nthe tough decisions necessary to put our Nation's fiscal house in \norder, or we can bury our collective heads in the sand and pretend that \nspending $1 billion a day beyond our means will not have devastating \neconomic consequences.\n  But we ought to be honest with the American people: Without the \nbalanced budget amendment, there is no plan to balance the budget--not \nin 5 years, not in 10 years, or ever. The budget that President Clinton \nsubmitted to the Congress earlier this month proposes $200 billion \ndeficits as far as the eye can see. The President has no plan to \nbalance the budget.\n  Although the new Congress is poised to make significant cuts in \nspending, there is no assurance that when the pain begins to be felt in \na few years, it will not opt to mitigate pain by resuming Federal \nborrowing as Congresses in the past have done. That is why Gramm-Rudman \nfailed several years ago. It is why nothing less than the balanced \nbudget amendment will succeed in the future.\n  Mr. President, this is a debate about the future, about preserving \nwhat is best in America. It is about protecting senior citizens on \nSocial Security. It is about letting our families keep what they earn. \nIt is about protecting our children's future.\n  I am hopeful today when this day ends the U.S. Senate will have \npassed the balanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished \nSenator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, the passage of a balanced budget amendment \nwill do more to bring about the fundamental change that the American \npeople voted for in 1994 than anything else that we can do. This is a \nvote about our future. This is a vote about our children.\n  Let me share some sobering facts. When my parents graduated from high \nschool in the early 1940's, the debt on each child that graduated was \nabout $360 dollars. By the time my wife and I graduated in the mid-\n1960's it was up to $1,600. When my children, Patrick and Jill and \nBecky, graduated in the mid-1980's, it was up to almost $9,000.\n  If we continue to go the way we have been going, by the time my \ngrandson, Albert, graduates in the year 2012, it will be up to almost \n$25,000.\n  Mr. President, this is a defining moment. We vote today to change the \nGovernment. We vote today to carry out the mandate that was given to \nthis Congress in 1994.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished \nSenator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I am proud to rise today to urge the \npassage of House Joint Resolution 1, the balanced budget amendment to \nthe Constitution. I am profoundly convinced that the future of our \nGovernment, indeed the future of our country, depends upon reaching a \nmeasure of financial responsibility. I am equally convinced that \nfailure to pass this amendment will result in continued deficit \nspending and added burdens of debt and interest payments.\n  As Members of this body, we are honored to be trustees in the area of \npublic policy for those who we represent, for the people of the United \nStates. The financial stewardship of this Congress has not met the test \nof fiscal and moral responsibility.\n  I am persuaded that the people of Wyoming demand that Congress \nrespond to their voice in November. They called for smaller Government, \nless expensive Government. The test of good Government is the \nresponsiveness of that Government to the will of the people. We have \nthat opportunity today.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished \nSenator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized \nfor 1 minute.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, we see here 11 freshmen who were elected \nin the last election, and sophomores who are with us. You do not see \nthis many Members in the Senate--at least I do not usually when I have \ngotten up to speak.\n  We are here because we got the message. We are here because the \nAmerican people sent us on a mission. They sent us on a mission to make \nGovernment leaner, smaller and more efficient, and this balanced budget \namendment is the vehicle by which all of that happens.\n  If this does not pass, all those things that the people voted for on \nNovember 8 will not happen. But let me tell you something, the balanced \nbudget amendment will pass. Oh, it may not pass today --I think it \nwill--but it may not. But it will pass. The people who will stand in \nthe way of this balanced budget amendment today will not be around long \nto stand in the way the next time. It will pass. It is just a matter of \nwhen.\n  It is a matter of when we are going to be able to look in the eyes, \nas I do, of my 2-year-old little boy and my 3-year-old little girl and \nsay that ``it is time to look out for your future, too. It is time that \nsomeone stands up and cares about you and your opportunities.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished \nSenator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, at the State capital building in St. Paul, \nMN, lawmakers presented Gov. Arne Carlson with this petition yesterday. \nIt says:\n\n       We, the undersigned officials, duly elected by the citizens \n     of the great State of Minnesota, commit our support to \n     congressional passage of the balanced budget amendment and \n     its ratification by the Minnesota State Legislature.\n\n  Our petition is signed by 81 representatives on the Federal and State \nlevel, Republicans and Democrats, who are concerned that this debt that \nwe are heaping onto the backs of our children is not just wrong, it is \ncriminal.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this document be printed into the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the petition was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              MINNESOTANS FOR A BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT\n\n                       (As of February 25, 1995)\n\n       We the undersigned officials, duly elected by the Citizens \n     of the Great State of Minnesota, commit our support to \n     congressional passage of the Balanced Budget Amendment and \n     its ratification by the Minnesota State Legislature:\n       United States Senator Rod Grams.\n       Governor Arne Carlson.\n       U.S. Representative Gil Gutknecht (IR-1st CD).\n       U.S. Representative David Minge (DFL-2nd CD).\n       U.S. Representative Collin Peterson (DFL-7th CD).\n       U.S. Representative Jim Ramstad (IR-6th CD).\n       State Senate Republican Leader Dean Johnson.\n       State House Republican Leader Steve Sviggum.\n       State Senator Charlie Berg (DFL-District 13).\n       State Senator Joe Bertram, Sr. (DFL-District 14).\n       State Senator Florian Chmielewski (DFL-District 8).\n       State Senator Dick Day (IR-District 28).\n       State Senator Steve Dille (IR-District 20).\n       State Senator Dennis Frederickson (IR-District 23).\n       State Senator Paula Hanson (DFL-50).\n       State Senator Terry Johnston (IR-District 35).\n       State Senator Sheila Kiscaden (IR-District 30).\n       State Senator Dave Kleis (IR-District 16).\n       State Senator Dave Knuston (IR-District 36).\n       State Senator Cal Larson (IR-District 10).\n       State Senator Arlene Lesewski (IR-District 21).\n       State Senator Warren Limmer (IR-District 33).\n       [[Page S3270]] State Senator Bob Lessard (DFL-District 3).\n       State Senator Tom Neuville (IR-District 25).\n       State Senator Ed Oliver (IR-District 43).\n       State Senator Gen Olson (IR-District 34).\n       State Senator Mark Ourada (IR-District 19).\n       State Senator Pat Pariseau (IR-District 37).\n       State Senator Martha Robertson (IR-District 45).\n       State Senator Linda Runbeck (IR-District 53).\n       State Senator Kenric Scheevel (IR-District 31).\n       State Senator Dan Stevens (IR-District 17).\n       State Senator Roy Terwilliger (IR-District 42).\n       State Senator Jim Vickerman (DFL-District 22).\n       State Representative Ron Abrams (IR-District 45A).\n       State Representative Hilda Bettermann (IR-District 10B).\n       State Representative Dave Bishop (IR-District 30B).\n       State Representative Fran Bradley (IR-District 30A).\n       State Representative Sherry Broecker (IR-District 53B).\n       State Representative Tim Commers (IR-District 38A).\n       State Representative Roxann Daggett (IR-District 11A).\n       State Representative Steve Dehler (IR-District 14A).\n       State Representative Jerry Dempsey (IR-District 29A).\n       State Representative Ron Erhardt (IR-District 42A).\n       State Representative Don Frerichs (IR-District 31A).\n       State Representative Jim Girard (IR-District 21A).\n       State Representative Bill Haas (IR-District 48A).\n       State Representative Tom Hackbarth (IR-District 50A).\n       State Representative Elaine Harder (IR-District 22B).\n       State Representative Mark Holsten (IR-District 56A).\n       State Representative Virgil Johnson (IR-District 32B).\n       State Representative Kevin Knight (IR-District 40B).\n       State Representative Le Roy Koppendrayer (IR-District 17A).\n       State Representative Ron Kraus (IR-District 27A).\n       State Representative Philip Krinkie (IR-District 53A).\n       State Representative Peggy Leppik (IR-District 45B).\n       State Representative Arlon W.

The Senator from Missouri is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n\n\n       Three Worst Excuses Against the Balanced Budget Amendment\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, here are the three worst excuses that \nhave been made against voting for the balanced budget amendment in this \nChamber.\n  Bad excuse No. 1: We do not need a balanced budget amendment because \nCongress already has the authority to balance the budget.\n  Of course, we have the authority to balance the budget. What we need \nis a prohibition against doing what is wrong. The Constitution is not \nneeded to protect Americans from Congress doing what is right. \nAmericans need the Constitution to protect them from Congress doing \nwhat is wrong: Spending the money of the next generation.\n  The first five words of the Bill of Rights are, ``Congress shall make \nno law.'' These words shield the people from Congress. Now we need to \nprotect the rights and resources of the next generation from debts \nincurred by Congress.\n  Bad excuse No. 2: Before we have a balanced budget amendment, we must \nspecify every detail about how we will achieve it. When President \nKennedy made the commitment to send a man to the Moon, he did not lay \nout the design for the Apollo spacecraft or the booster rocket. He did \nnot decide which astronaut would be the first man to set foot on the \nMoon. No, President Kennedy called America to greatness, he challenged \npeople to a higher standard, because it was critical to our future.\n  Today, we need to challenge America to greatness again, because \nbalancing our budget is essential for our future.\n  Bad excuse No. 3: A supermajority requirement is undemocratic because \nit gives a minority the right to block the will of the majority.\n  What is undemocratic is that this Congress spends the resources of \nthe unrepresented next generation. No taxation without representation \nwas the cry of our Founding Fathers, and it is my cry on behalf of \nunrepresented generations yet to come.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the junior Senator from \nTennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The junior Senator from Tennessee \nis recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, 4 months ago, I was elected to the U.S. \nSenate with the mandate to aggressively treat problems that have been \nreadily diagnosed by the American people. The national debt is a \nmalignant cancer growing every second of every day, consuming the \nhealth and vitality of this Nation.\n  The future hard work and dreams of our children are being sacrificed \nevery day to feed this cancer. Conventional treatment has failed.\n  Congress has demonstrated a lack of discipline to rein in Federal \nspending. The President has said he will tolerate increasing the debt \nfrom $18,000 to $24,000 for every individual.\n  But there is a cure: The balanced budget amendment.\n  Clearly, we are mortgaging the future of our children if we do not \ntake action today. I want the children of America to inherit a \nprosperous future, not a legacy of debt. For this reason, I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting the balanced budget amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished \nSenator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I will undoubtedly cast many hundreds of \nvotes during my tenure in the Senate, but it is unlikely I will cast \nany more important vote than the one I will make later today.\n  With that vote, I will seek to amend the Constitution of our Nation \nto require that our national budget be balanced. There are many reasons \nwhy I \n[[Page S3271]] will vote this way, but first among them is my \nconviction that our responsibility to secure the economic future of our \ncountry can only be fulfilled if we adopt this amendment.\n  Last night, when I said good night to my 20-month-old twin daughters, \nI thought about the country they will inherit when they grow up. I will \nnot bequeath to them and their generation a legacy of debt.\n  For too long, this Congress has failed to meet this responsibility to \nfuture Americans. The failures have occurred on both sides of the \npolitical aisle, and so now the solution must be bipartisan as well.\n  I call on my colleagues to provide Betsy and Julie Abraham, and the \nother children of this country, the future they deserve--a future in \nwhich they will have the fullest opportunity to realize the promise of \nAmerica.\n  Mr. President, I urge this Senate to adopt this amendment to the \nConstitution.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield the distinguished Senator from \nOklahoma 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, for weeks on end now we have been debating \nthis issue, and I think we know what the arguments are.\n  The other night I took to the floor and spent 1 hour and 10 minutes \ndiffusing the 11 arguments that have been given against the balanced \nbudget amendment. The bottom line is that those are not real arguments. \nThe bottom line is that those individuals who are going to use \narguments against the balanced budget amendment really do not want to \ncut spending.\n  Mr. President, the American people do. Let us look at what happened \non last November 8. Last November 8, using the two indices of the \nstimulus bill for spending hikes and the National Taxpayers Union \nrating for tax increases, virtually everyone in the House and the \nSenate that was defeated on November 8 voted for the stimulus \nincrease--that is the spending increase--and was rated either a ``D'' \nor an ``F'' by the National Taxpayers Union.\n  The bottom line is the big spenders and the big taxers do not want a \nbalanced budget amendment, but the American people do. And we have the \nunique opportunity to give them what they asked for on November 8.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am really impressed that all 11 new \nMembers to the Senate have spoken for the balanced budget amendment. It \nshows the difference between what has gone on in the past and what is \nreally going to go on in the future.\n  I hope our colleagues pay attention, because this is the wave of the \nfuture, and we have to pass this balanced budget amendment.\n  I yield 1 minute to the distinguished Senator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am impressed by the unanimity of this \nfreshman class. I am reminded of one great truth around here, and that \nis that people who come to Washington and stay a long time sometimes--\nand I underline sometimes because it is not universal. I see many \nMembers on the floor for whom it is not true--some- times lose touch \nwith the people back home.\n It is always the most dangerous political thing that can happen to a \nMember of the Senate, is to lose touch. My father got to the Senate \nbecause his predecessor became too important in Washington to pay \nattention to the people of Utah. My colleague, the senior Senator from \nUtah, became a Senator because the man he defeated got out of touch. He \nwas just reelected for a fourth term, indicating that has not happened \nto him.\n\n  But the 11 Members who have come here now, who are the most recent \npeople to face the voters, come unanimously in favor of the balanced \nbudget amendment. When I return home to Utah and conduct my efforts to \nstay in touch, I find, again, unanimously the voice of the people are \ndemanding that we do this. So I rise to say I think the people in this \nbody should listen to the people of the country who are telling us \noverwhelmingly this is what they want, and as their representatives \nhere it is time for us to give them what they want.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished \nSenator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, I have only been \naround here 5 years. I am hardly considered a veteran. But I have never \nseen a more impressive display in my time in the Senate, indeed in all \nthe years I have spent in the Congress, both the House and the Senate. \nThis is a very personal appeal, talking about their children on behalf \nof the millions of other American children, and what this is going to \ndo to them in the future. That kind of unanimity, speaking on behalf of \nthe elections in November as you have, is something I hope my \ncolleagues who are still on the fence will hear.\n  This is much bigger than any one Senator or any one Senator's views. \nThis is the American people at stake here. This is the economic future \nof America. All this talk we hear about how we are going to get it \ndone, we do not need the amendment--we are not getting it done.\n  This has been a crusade for me since the first day I ran for Congress \nand announced I was running in 1979. I am just proud to be with you, \nall of you, and appreciate what you have done.\n  If this passes it will be because of you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield a minute to the distinguished \nSenator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, let me commend my colleagues, not only \nfor their statements but for their clarity, the clarity they have \nbrought to this argument, that they campaigned on. They did not just \nforget their campaign promises. They are committed to cutting down the \nsize of Government.\n  We must pass the balanced budget amendment. Those who oppose this \namendment will face the wrath of the people. We must force the Federal \nGovernment to live within its means. The Federal Government spends too \nmuch and taxes too much.\n  Today, as we vote on this amendment, it is ironic that the Denver \nInternational Airport is finally opening--more than 16 months late and \n$3 billion over its original budget.\n  This $4.9 billion boondoggle demonstrates why we need the balanced \nbudget amendment. It demonstrates why we need less government, not \nmore.\n  If you have any question about the balanced budget amendment, take a \nlook at the Denver airport.\n  The FBI, SEC and the Denver district attorney are investigating \nallegations of fraud and public corruption involving the construction \nof DIA.\n  This airport is a monument to Government waste and mismanagement. The \nFAA has already poured almost $700 million of Federal dollars into this \nwhite elephant. How much more will be needed to keep this airport from \ncrash landing?\n  In 1989, when Denver voters approved the construction of DIA, the \npoliticians promised that the new airport would cost $1.7 billion and \nhave 120 gates. The airport's price tax has now reached almost $5 \nbillion, and the airport has only 87 gates. What happened to gates 88 \nto 120?\n  The taxpayers have a right to know why DIA's cost increased by $3 \nbillion while the airport shrunk in size? Where did the extra $3 \nbillion go?\n  The Denver airport was built on the expectation of 56 million \npassengers per year. But a total of only about 32 million passengers \nwill fly in and out of Denver this year.\n  It is outrageous that Denver travelers will reportedly have to pay \n$40 extra on every round-trip ticket to support this airport.\n  Why was this Taj Mahal of the Rockies ever built? Why wasn't Denver's \nexisting airport, Stapleton, simply expanded? Who is to blame for this \nfolly?\n  The new Denver airport was built with almost $4 billion in municipal \nbonds. In the wake of the Orange County debacle, the Banking Committee \nis looking into the adequacy of disclosure to DIA bondholders.\n  Were bondholders adequately advised of DIA's projected revenues and \ncosts? Was information about Denver's faulty \n[[Page S3272]] baggage system withheld? What is the long-term viability \nof DIA? Will DIA's bondholders be paid in full?\n  The airport's bonds have a junk rating. Standard & Poor's says that \n``DIA faces major ongoing uncertainties that could lead to inadequate \ncapacity to meet timely debt service payments.'' Will Denver's \ntaxpayers have to pick up the tab if the airport defaults?\n  As we vote on the balanced budget amendment, we must remember the \nDenver airport. We must remember what happens when taxpayers' money is \nwasted on grandiose schemes. We must force Government to live within \nits means.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this has been a very good debate. I \nappreciate our friends and colleagues and the others who have spoken. \nThere are a number of others who would like to speak. Frankly, I would \nlike to yield the remainder of our time to a person who I think has \nfought his guts out for this amendment, who I think has shown a great \ndeal of courage, who I know has been badgered both ways, and for whom I \nhave the utmost respect in this matter. That is the distinguished \nSenator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes and 45 seconds.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I thank Senator Hatch, Senator Craig, and \neveryone who has played a part in this. I got on the Dirksen elevator \nthe other day and right after me came in Senator John Chafee and he \nsaid, ``What a horrible debt we are imposing on future generations.'' \nThat sums it all up.\n  We heard precisely the same arguments in 1986. We had $2 trillion \nworth of debt and now we have $4.8 trillion worth of debt. This year we \nwill spend $339 billion on interest. We will spend twice as much as \nwhat we spend on our poverty programs, 11 times as much as we spend on \neducation, 22 times as much as we spend on foreign economic assistance. \nIn fact, we spend twice as much money on foreign aid for the wealthy in \nterms of interest on bonds that are held overseas than we spend on \nforeign aid for the poor.\n  Will it be painful if we pass this? Yes. There is going to be some \npain. There is going to be infinitely more pain for this Nation and a \nlowered standard of living if we continue to have these huge deficits. \nThe pain we are asked to impose upon ourselves is small compared to \nsome of the steps that, for example, Margaret Thatcher took in Great \nBritain to turn that country around.\n  If you assume no change in interest rates, and every projection is \nthat if we pass this, interest rates are going to go lower--but if you \nassume no change in interest rates, and no deductions on Social \nSecurity, it means that we can grow 1.7 percent a year in income. Put \nanother way, in the year 2002, it is anticipated we will have about \n$300 billion more in income than we are spending this year. We can have \na gradual growth, but we will have to have restrained growth.\n  I have read the editorials, Mr. President, as have you, criticizing \nthis. It is interesting that not a single editorial has mentioned \neconomic history. Take a look at this chart right here. This is the \nlatest CBO estimate of where we are going in deficit versus national \nincome, GDP. Historically, as nations have come around 9 or 10 or 11 \npercent, right around here, they have started monetizing the debt, \nstarted the printing presses rolling, started devaluing their currency. \nThose who vote against this are taking the chance that we can be the \nfirst nation in history to go up to this kind of debt without \nmonetizing the debt. But what a huge gamble with the future of our \ncountry. As responsible Members of this body we should not be making \nthat gamble.\n  I have heard a lot of about Social Security on the floor of the \nSenate today and these past days. I want to protect Social Security. \nThe only way you can protect Social Security is to make sure we do not \ndevalue our currency. I think it is vital for the future of our Nation \nand our children and generations to come that we pass this \nconstitutional amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The remaining time is under the control of \nSenator Byrd.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I note that we have the entire Republican response \nteam on the floor here today. They are out in full numbers. I have \nthought heretofore, when only one or two members of the response team \ncame to the floor, that the other seven might be compared with the \nSeven Sleepers of Ephesus, to whom Gibbon referred in his magnificent \nmagisterial work, ``The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.'' But \nthey are all here today. They really did not sleep as long as the Seven \nSleepers, who slumbered 187 years, from the reign of Decius, who \nreigned from 249 to 251 A.D., until the reign of Theodosius II, who \nreigned from 408 to 450 A.D. Congratulations to the Republican response \nteam. They have worked hard and acquitted themselves well.\n  Mr. President, it may be of historical interest to some Senators, as \nit is to me, that on this very day 200 years ago, the Congress was \ndebating public debt legislation--on February 28, 1795--just as we are \ntoday, on February 28, 1995.\n  I will ask to include in tomorrow's Record, for the information of \nSenators, the materials pertinent to that debate, and to the statute \nthat resulted therefrom.\n  Mr. President, rarely have I seen in all my years in the Senate a \nmeasure so flawed as the one before us today. If adopted, this \nconstitutional amendment will surely create more mischief, generate \nmore surprise consequences, and spin-off more unfortunate crises than \nhas any other single legislative proposal in the history of this \nNation. How something that seems so simple and straightforward to the \ncasual observer can be so truly diabolical and destructive in nature \nconfounds conventional wisdom. But a closer look reveals the impossible \nnature of this oft-touted but little understood amendment.\n  Section VI of the amendment states that ``The Congress shall enforce \nand implement this article by appropriate legislation, which may rely \non estimates of outlays and receipts.'' The amendment is immediately \nrendered unworkable with those 20 words in section VI. If one looks at \nthe history of budget forecasts, it quickly becomes apparent--and no \none would know this better than the distinguished Chairman of the \nBudget Committee, Senator Domenici--that forecasting budget receipts \nand outlays is not unlike forecasting the weather. Both are far from \nexact sciences, although the local weatherman probably hits the bull's \neye with much more frequency than even our best budget prognosticators.\n  Under Section VI of this balanced budget proposal, erroneous and \nchanging budget forecasts would have us dealing with the budget almost \ncontinually. Planned spending enacted before the fiscal year could have \nto be changed one or more times during the fiscal year. In a constantly \nfluctuating economy, where outlays and receipts alter with business \ncycles, as well as with unemployment, earthquakes, fires, and overseas \nconflicts, requiring rigid end-of-year budget balance, to be determined \nby estimates is nothing short of a recipe for utter chaos. As if that \nwere not enough, the problem of inaccurate estimates is compounded by \nthe text of Section II. Section II requires that the limit on debt held \nby the public not be increased absent a three-fifths vote. Since an \nincrease in debt closely correlates with an excess of outlays over \nreceipts, the amendment actually requires Congress to take two actions \nto allow for a deficit in any given fiscal year: pass a law to increase \nthe debt limit, and pass another law for a specific deficit for the \nyear.\n  To further elaborate on the ``shop of horrors'' which this amendment \noffers, let us discuss for a moment the principle of majority rule. \nThis amendment would, for the first time, I believe, overturn the \nprinciple of majority rule. The budget of this Nation and critical \neconomic decisions that relate to that budget could, at the most \ncritical of times, be placed in the hands of a minority. Minorities are \nnot elected to control the Nation's policies. Majorities are charged \nwith that duty. Yet, this amendment would actually hand a minority the \npower to determine economic policy, and it would hand that power over \nduring times of domestic or foreign economic crises, natural disasters, \ninternational turmoil, recessions, \n[[Page S3273]]  or other economic emergencies. That makes no sense. It \nmakes no sense at all.\n  Moreover, the amendment's wording in section II--``The limit on the \ndebt of the United States held by the public shall not be increased. . \n. .,'' allows the Federal Government to keep borrowing from the trust \nfunds, including the Social Security trust fund, because ``debt held by \nthe public'' refers to externally-held debt, not internally-held debt. \nSo, we can keep putting IOU's into the trust funds and borrowing to \nmask the true size of the deficit, without ever having to make good on \nour IOU's. In the case of the Social Security trust fund, when the baby \nboomers reach retirement age and the revenues in the trust fund drop \nbecause fewer people are working and paying into the fund and more \npeople are drawing benefits out of the fund, how will we ever be able \nto replace the nearly $3 trillion which we have borrowed?\n  The amendment is so full of flaws, so reflective of flabby thinking, \nso arrogant in its disregard for the traditional checks and balances \nand separation of powers, that its consequences could be nothing short \nof a calamity.\n  The amendment so blurs and smudges the historical balance among the \nthree branches that it renders our traditional constitutional structure \nto a mere shadow of its former clarity. Congress's traditional power of \nthe purse is seriously hamstrung by the yearly supermajority \nrequirements to waive the provisions of the amendment, and by the \npossibility of unchecked impoundments of appropriated funds by the \nExecutive. The President's flexibility on budgetary matters is also \nseriously impaired because he must present a balanced budget every year \nwhether he deems it wise or not.\n  The courts will either gain tremendous power over both branches and \nover matters of budget policy or be rendered largely impotent, \ndepending upon how the implementing legislation, if there ever is any, \nis written, and depending upon the course of events. One thing is \ncertain: uncertainty will reign.\n  One additional thing is certain. The ghost of John Marshall was not \nlooking over the shoulders of the authors of this most unfortunate \namendment.\n  There is no reason to spoil our grandest historical document with \nthis macabre twisting of the balance of powers. We can begin to address \nbudget deficits right now by passing legislation to further reduce the \ndeficits, and without waiting on any constitutional amendment to \nprovide us cover for the hard choices we were elected to make.\n  Political cover has its place and can be helpful in some situations, \nbut this cover is far too costly. Destroying the Constitution is too \nhigh a price to pay for political cover.\n  We can cut the deficit without this amendment. But, I fear that the \nparamount concern of some is whether, absent this amendment, they can \nvote to cut deficits and be reelected. That is hardly a noble reason to \nproceed to rewrite our carefully preserved national charter, preserved \nfor us with blood and protected through the statesmanship and the \ncourage of the past membership of this and the other body through 200 \nyears of time. It is now up to the Members of this current Senate to \nlive up to the standard of patriotism and courage set by our \npredecessors on important and critical matters throughout our history. \nThere will be no more important vote any of us will ever cast.\n  Before this day has passed, each of us will be tested as to strength \nof character and fealty to our sworn oath as Senators.\n  I hope, Mr. President, we will not, in this critical moment, be found \nwanting. The amendment will have consequences which no one can \npredict--no one. We have tried to explore some of those consequences \nthroughout the 30 days of debate which have been consumed on this \nproposal. But it seems that the more one studies the amendment, the \nmore flaws become apparent.\n  I am confident that should we go on another 30 days, additional flaws \nand problems would very likely be found. However, here we are at the 11 \nhour, witnessing desperate--desperate --last-minute efforts to salvage \nthis amendment through a cut-and-paste process designed only to win \nvotes and to somehow shove this extremely perilous proposal through the \nSenate. Have we lost all of our senses? What other flaws are we writing \ninto the Constitution with this quick editing process which is \ncurrently going on on the Senate floor? What other checks and balances \nare we compromising with this insane bidding war for votes?\n  So here we are at the last minute, the 11 hour, the 59th minute of \nthe 11 hour, and there is this hurried, desperate effort to find a way \nto garner another vote. Cut and paste. Change. We see this frenetic \nexercise being carried on here, all the hurry at the last moment now to \ntry to patch over some of the flaws that have been brought to light.\n  Careful consideration has been thrown to the four winds, and all that \nseems to matter at this point now, Mr. President, is a victory for the \nproponents, at all costs. We are not filling in a crossword puzzle. We \nare not trying this word or that word out to win a prize. We are \nwriting a constitutional amendment. John Marshall said: ``Let us not \nforget that it is the Constitution we are expounding.'' I add my own \nmodest footnote by saying that it is the Constitution that we are \namending. We are writing a constitutional amendment--something that \nwill affect the representative democracy for generations of Americans \nthrough the coming ages. I regret the rather tawdry attempt at the \nlast-minute tinkering being made to try to salvage a proposal that is \nso flawed that it ought to be immediately rejected by the Senate. I \nhope that we will come to our senses and defeat this patched-up, \npulled-together ``Frankenstein'' before it is too late.\n  Mr. President, on March 2, 1805--that is only 2 days away from being \nexactly 190 years ago--Aaron Burr, after he had presided over the \nimpeachment trial of Samuel Chase and before leaving the Senate Chamber \nfor the last time, spoke to the Members of that body over which he had \npresided for 4 years. The speech was one which left many of the \nSenators of that ancient day in tears. As we come to a close of this \ndebate very soon, his closing words should ring in the ears of today's \nmen and women who serve in this body. Aaron Burr said, with regard to \nthe U.S. Senate: ``This House is a sanctuary--a citadel of law, of \norder, and of liberty; and it is here--it is here, in this exalted \nrefuge--here, if anywhere, will resistance be made to the storms of \npolitical phrensy and the silent arts of corruption; and if the \nConstitution be destined ever to perish by the sacrilegious hands of \nthe demagogue or the usurper, which God avert, its expiring agonies \nwill be witnessed on this floor.''\n  Mr. President, the decision which the Senate will make before this \nday's sun has set can very well turn out to be the prophetic end of \nBurr's words. I have cast 13,744 votes in this Senate since I came to \nthe Senate, now going on 37 years ago. This does not include the more \nthan 400 votes that I cast in the other body before I came to the \nSenate. But barring none, this is the most important vote of my \npolitical career on Capitol Hill. It is important, because we are \ntampering with the Constitution of the United States, an immortal \ndocument that has served us well over a period of 206 years. And we are \nreaching a critical point in the history of this country and in the \nhistory of the Constitution when we face the awful prospect of an \namendment, which has been rushed through the other body in 2 day's \ntime, and which has the support all over this country of the \noverwhelming majority of the American people--because they have not \nbeen duly informed of its contents and of the ramifications that will \nflow from its adoption and ratification. It is said that there is only \none vote that stands between the Senate and the Constitution and that \nawful end which Burr prognosticated which would be witnessed on this \nfloor. ``If the Constitution be destined ever to be destroyed by the \nsacrilegious hands of the demagogue or the usurper, which God avert, \nits expiring agonies will be witnessed on this floor.''\n  Mr. President, I pray to God that Senators will rise to the \noccasion--I have seen this Senate demonstrate courage and character \nbefore, and I hope it will do so today--and that Senators will cast \ntheir vote to protect for their children and their children's children \nthroughout all the ages to come, \n[[Page S3274]]  this unique Constitution that was written by those \nillustrious men, like Hamilton and Madison and the other Framers who \nsat in Philadelphia in 1797, lacking only 2 years, Mr. President, of \nbeing 210 years ago.\n  Mr. President, I close with the urgent plea that we remember \nMarshall's admonition. Let us not forget that it is a Constitution that \nwe are expounding and let us not forget also, Mr. President, that it is \na Constitution that we are amending.\n  God save the United States of America! God save the Constitution of \nthe United States! May this Senate rise to do its duty in order that \nour children may have cause to honor the memories of their fathers as \nwe have cause to honor the memory of ours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for \njust 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I know time has expired. I asked for 30 \nseconds to express my very profound gratitude to the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia for his powerful statement on behalf of the \nConstitution.\n  I know of no Member of the Congress who has a deeper, more enduring \ndedication to the Constitution than does the Senator from West \nVirginia. I take his wise and moving words to heart. I am privileged to \nserve with him. I want to thank him for standing resolutely on this \nfloor day in and day out and eloquently championing the basic, \nfundamental document of our Republic--the Constitution--which has \nserved us so well for 206 years.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I just want to join my colleague from \nMaryland in commending our beloved colleague from West Virginia.\n  However the Senate decides this afternoon, I can speak with a great \ndeal of certainty that the children, grandchildren, great \ngrandchildren, and great-great-grandchildren of the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia will indeed be proud of how he has stood for \nhis country and has stood for the Constitution. I am deeply proud to \nstand with him.\n  I have cast no vote in the past 20 years that will be as important as \nthe one I cast this afternoon. I am proud to cast my vote along with \nthat of the Senator from Maryland and the Senator from West Virginia in \ndefending our Constitution from this assault.\n  Mr. BYRD.

Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWest Virginia is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I first would like to commend the proponents of the \nconstitutional amendment for their spirited defense of this balanced \nbudget amendment, misnamed though it is. I cannot commend them, \nhowever, on the content of their proposal. I believe that the proposal \nis inherently flawed, wrong-headed and worth absolutely nothing in \nterms of real deficit reduction. But I do believe that the debate has \nbeen enlightening, and I also believe that an adequate amount of time \nhas been accorded to a thorough discussion of the amendment. So I thank \nSenator Hatch and Senator Dole and all of the proponents for the time \nthat we have deliberated. And I thank them for their spirited defense \nof the amendment.\n  I also commend Senator Simon. He obviously believes so wholeheartedly \nin this proposal that one must admire his constancy.\n  There have been many profiles in courage, Mr. President, and they \nwill very soon make themselves manifest. But the profiles in courage \ndisplayed by Senator Mark Hatfield and Senator Tom Daschle must not \npass unnoticed--must not pass unnoticed--as we near the end of this \nlong debate. Both of these Senators, and others who likewise will have \ndisplayed great courage in voting against this amendment, have lived up \nto the highest standards imagined by the Framers when they devised the \nmarvelous institution of the Senate and envisioned Senators as men who \nwould be able to withstand pressure, lift themselves above the \npolitical fray, and, according to their consciences, do the right and \nthe honorable thing, regardless of political cover.\n  Mr. President, I ask for attention in this Senate, and I do not want \nthe time to be charged against me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. The time will not \nbe charged against the Senator from West Virginia. He will suspend \nwhile the Senate comes to order.\n  I ask that all Senators and staff please take the conversations off \nthe floor.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I have spent most of my adult life in service to my \ncountry. No small part of that time has been engaged in trying to \nprotect the Framers' views of the powers of the legislative branch, and \nparticularly in attempting to thwart attacks on the powers of the U.S. \nSenate. I am so thoroughly in awe of the genius of the Framers, their \nforesight, their judgment, their tempered wisdom, that I would make any \npolitical sacrifice to protect the Constitution from permanent harm.\n  But we have entered an age, Mr. President, when reverence for our \nConstitution and for the wisdom of history have rather gone out of \nfashion. Talk shows, public opinion polls, bumper sticker slogans, and \na so-called political Contract With America are the order of the day. \nThere is little patience with going against the tide, and one man's \ncourage may be judged as nothing more than foolhardy if that courage \njeopardizes his chances for reelection.\n  Yet, I remain a believer in the old values. I believe that a solemn \noath binds one. I believe that courage is eventually rewarded and has \nits own reward in any event. And I believe that preserving the \nconstitutional system intact for future generations, insofar as the \nconstitutional system itself is concerned, is the most solemn and \nimportant thing that a Member of this body can ever do.\n  There are those who would scoff at these old-fashioned views. There \nare those who would put efficiency, expediency and political agenda \nbefore any considerations of courage, fealty to an oath, loyalty to a \nhigher purpose, or the preservation of the genius of a 200-year-old \ncharter.\n  ``Change'' is the watchword of the day--change, merely for the sake \nof change, is suddenly a virtue above all others, a goal to be achieved \nat all costs. But I will never, never, never bow to those messengers of \nexpediency or to the managers of any political party's agenda when \nbasic principles are at stake.\n  The hurricanes may blow, the tides may rise, but there still remain \nthose of us who will never, never bend, because we believe it is our \nsworn duty not to yield to attacks on our constitutional system of \nmixed powers and checks and balances.\n  So whatever the final outcome of this vote, I will retire to my bed \ntonight satisfied that I have done all that one man can do to live up \nto the oath that I have taken over and over again to \n[[Page S3279]] protect the written framework of our representative \ndemocracy.\n  If the amendment should pass, I shall fervently hope that the States \nwill have the wisdom that the Senate could not find to reject this \ndangerous and unwise proposal. If the amendment should fail, I shall be \nenormously proud of this body to which I have devoted so much of my \nlife. And, most particularly, I will be proud of those Senators who set \ntheir sails against the wind and who chose the harder course in order \nthat our venerable Constitution might be saved for yet a little while \nlonger.\n  Our cherished liberties were not easily won, and they are not easily \nmaintained. The preservation of our hard-won freedoms always has a \nprice. But we who serve here are charged with the awesome duty of \npreserving those freedoms for generations yet unborn. The bruising \nbattle that we have just been through demonstrates, once again, that we \nwho have the honor of calling ourselves United States Senators must be \never vigilant to guard what has been bequeathed to us by wise men--men \nof vision, men of courage, men of character.\n  The political seas may churn and boil, but our solemn duty as \nSenators must always be to drown out the noise and keep faith with our \nown inner voices. The Senate, from time to time, is the very last \nbulwark against the too-hot passions that rail in this land. However \nvarious Senators may vote today, it is my hope that each of us will \ntake away from this debate some lessons learned and wisdom gained. As \nin no other institution of this great and marvelous democracy--in the \nSenate, one individual can make a difference. Service here is difficult \nand it is demanding. It requires the very best of one's nature and the \nmost assiduous cultivation of one's character. When the battle is over \nand the roar of the debate has subsided, whether one's side has won or \nlost is not the final thing. In the final analysis, service here boils \ndown to one quality. Horace Greeley expressed it best when he said:\n\n       Fame is a vapor, popularity an accident; riches take wings, \n     and those who cheer today may curse tomorrow--only one thing \n     endures; character!\n\n  Mr. President, to all those who have stood straight and tall in the \nfight I salute them with the words ``morituri te salutamus.'' And may \nthey, like I, feel as did the Apostle Paul in writing his second \nEpistle to Timothy, when he said: ``I have fought a good fight, I have \nfinished my course, I have kept the faith.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a series of pertinent \ncommentaries from the press be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the commentaries were ordered to be printed \nin the Record as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 28, 1995]\n\n                    The Urgency of Political Courage\n\n       It is hard to decide which would be worse: if the balanced \n     budget amendment that the Senate is voting on today \n     functioned as its sponsors intend, thereby locking the \n     country into what would often be an ill-advised economic \n     policy; or if Congress found a way to duck the command, \n     thereby trivializing the Constitution and creating a \n     permanent monument to political timidity\n       Take the second possibility. The Constitution of the United \n     States is remarkable because no country in the world has \n     taken its written Constitution so seriously. It is a concise \n     Constitution, and it has not been amended lightly. Other \n     countries have acted as if their constitutions were merely \n     pieces of legislation to be changed at will, but not the \n     United States.\n       The balanced budget amendment marks the intrusion of the \n     worst kind of legislative politics onto our constitutional \n     tradition. For about a decade and a half, for mostly \n     political reasons, Congress has not found the fortitude to \n     come even close to balancing the budget. Instead of doing \n     what it should and voting the spending cuts and taxes to \n     narrow the deficit, Congress wants to dodge the hard choices \n     by changing the Constitution. But as Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan \n     argued on ``Meet the Press'' this Sunday: ``My proposition is \n     that you avoid trying to pretend a machine will do this for \n     you. . . . You have to do it yourself.'' With or without the \n     amendment, only Congress will get the budget balanced. And \n     who is to say that the amendment, which becomes effective \n     only in 2002, won't delay Congress from making the hard \n     decisions until it is against the wall of its mandate, give \n     it yet another excuse? ``Gosh, we passed the balanced budget \n     amendment,'' the unfailingly inventive members will be \n     inclined to say, ``and it goes into effect in just a few \n     years. Isn't that enough? What do you want us to do? Balance \n     the budget?''\n       Sen. Sam Nunn, whose vote could prove decisive, has argued \n     forcefully that this amendment could lead to the judiciary's \n     making decisions on spending cuts and tax increases that \n     ought only be made by the legislative branch. Last night, \n     Sen. Byron Dorgan, another whose vote had been in doubt, \n     voiced a similar reservation. Supporters of the amendment are \n     now trying to win their votes by arguing that legislation \n     could be passed to protect against judicial supremacy. But \n     surely\n      Mr. Nunn's first instinct was right: No legislation can \n     supersede the Constitution. If the amendment itself does \n     not protect against judicial interference, there is no \n     guarantee as to how a court will act. And if, on the other \n     hand, there is no enforcement mechanism for the amendment, \n     then why pass it in the first place? It becomes an utterly \n     empty symbol, which is exactly what the United States \n     Constitution has never been and never should be.\n       As bad as this prospect is, an effective balanced budget \n     amendment might be even worse. By requiring three-fifths \n     votes to pass unbalanced budgets, it would enshrine minority \n     rule. And while deficits in periods of prosperity make little \n     sense, modest deficits during economic downturns have been \n     powerful engines for bringing the economy back to prosperity. \n     This amendment, if it worked as planned, would shackle \n     government to economic policies that are plainly foolish. \n     Since government revenues drop during recessions and since \n     payments for benefits such as food stamps and unemployment \n     compensation increase, the amendment would require Congress \n     by constitutional mandate to pursue exactly the policies that \n     would only further economic distress: to raise taxes, to cut \n     spending, or do both.\n       Moreover, as Mr. Moynihan and others have pointed out, the \n     amendment could one day lead to the devastation of the \n     banking system. This might happen because a balanced budget \n     amendment could stall or stop the government from meeting its \n     obligations to protect the depositors of banks that failed \n     during an economic downturn. Mr. Moynihan is not exaggerating \n     when he says that ``everything we have learned about managing \n     our economy since the Great Depression is at risk.''\n       Voting against this amendment should be easy. It has been \n     said that were today's vote secret, the amendment would \n     certainly fail. But the political pressures on the undecided \n     senators--Mr. Nunn, Mr. Dorgan, John Breaux, Kent Conrad and \n     Wendell Ford--are immense and largely in the amendment's \n     favor. These senators have an opportunity only rarely given \n     public figures: to display genuine courage on an issue of \n     enormous historical significance. They should seize their \n     moment and vote this amendment down.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 28, 1995]\n\n                             Why Fear Debt?\n\n                         (By Robert Heilbroner)\n\n       It is doubtful that the balanced-budget amendment, which \n     the Senate votes on today, would be effective, even if \n     ratified. The reason is there are many ways of placing \n     expenditures outside the budget--Social Security, for \n     example. What is not doubtful is that the real cause for \n     worry is a balanced, not an unbalanced, budget.\n       Here's why: Deficit spending is legitimate when it is used \n     to protect the future well-being of the nation.\n       Though one hears much about ``living beyond our means,'' \n     very few people can concisely define deficit spending. In \n     fact, it means one and only one thing: borrowing. A deficit \n     refers to the amount the government has borrowed. If there is \n     no borrowing, there cannot be a deficit. That introduces a \n     ray of light into the darkness for it makes us ask whether \n     there might be circumstances in which the Government ought to \n     borrow.\n       Suppose a law enjoined households from any borrowing. That \n     would cut down gambling losses, but it would also prevent \n     families from buying houses by taking out mortgages. \n     Similarly, a prohibition on all business borrowing might \n     eliminate a few extravagances, but it would cripple private \n     investment. In the same way, a blanket injunction against \n     Federal borrowing might cause the Government to eliminate \n     waste, but it also would make much public investment \n     impossible.\n       That would mean goodbye to such improvements as bridges, \n     tunnels, highways, public-health research centers and other \n     undertakings that would normally be considered public-sector \n     business but could not be financed by taxation, because, as \n     is the case with mortgages and business capital expenditures, \n     the outlay is too large to be charged against one year's \n     income.\n       What about the Federal debt?\n       We hear pious declarations about the need to remove the \n     burden of our profligacy from the shoulders of our innocent \n     children. I often wonder how my own children would feel if \n     they opened my safe deposit box at my death to find it \n     stuffed with Government debt--bonds. Would my heirs feel I \n     had burdened them unfairly, as they transferred the bonds to \n     their own safe deposit boxes?\n       In a word, whatever its problems--and a debt, like all \n     borrowing, always poses financial management considerations--\n     a national debt also serves a vital purpose. It provides the \n     only asset in which households, insurance companies, \n     corporations, banks and, \n     [[Page S3280]] not least, pension funds, including Social \n     Security, can invest whatever assets need to be placed in the \n     least risky of all financial instruments.\n       Do not forget, there is no income-producing investment \n     other than Government securities that enjoys the power of the \n     Government to assure that it will be redeemed at full face \n     value.\n       Obviously, these arguments are not an excuse for Government \n     profligacy any more than the legitimacy of consumer or \n     corporate debt is an excuse for mindless private borrowing. \n     But these arguments do suggest that the Government needs to \n     depict its borrowing in a more understandable way. \n     Specifically, it should have what it does not now have: a \n     formal capital budget in which its expenditures for \n     investment are identified. Such an accounting method would \n     reassure the anxious public that at least an identifiable \n     part of the ``deficit'' represents borrowing for purposes \n     that most would approve.\n       Since there is no such accounting system, all public \n     borrowing is deemed to be the work of the devil--when, \n     properly understood, it may be crucial to the future strength \n     and vitality of the nation.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                   [From Business Week March 6, 1995]\n\n                  The Wrong Way to Balance the Budget\n\n                        (By Christopher Farrell)\n\n       In the early days of the American republic, financial \n     panics often led to steep declines in economic activity. Yet \n     the last time a financial crisis triggered an economic \n     collapse was the Great Depression. In the half-century \n     following World War II, financial blowups have had minimal \n     impact, and the economy has enjoyed a relatively smooth ride.\n       Now, Congress confronts the possibility of returning us to \n     the chaotic days of yore. In the coming weeks, after years of \n     debate, the Senate will decide whether to require the federal \n     government to balance its budget. Many GOP lawmakers back the \n     amendment. They shouldn't. The Balanced Budget Amendment \n     would strip away much of the government spending that \n     cushions the economy in hard times--just when disinflation \n     and the prospect of deflation are raising the odds of \n     financial crises.\n       The U.S. economy is a remarkably stable system, in large \n     part because of the government's expansive safety net. \n     Federal deposit insurance, for example, prevented the \n     collapse of the savings-and-loan industry in the late 1980s \n     from turning into a depression of the 1990s. A market \n     collapse in Mexico sparks jitters in the U.S. but not much \n     more.\n       Needed Net. Impose the Balanced Budget Amendment, however, \n     and the system breaks down. Today, as soon as the economy \n     begins to slump, government tax collections fall, and \n     government transfer payments, such as food stamps, increase. \n     The result is higher deficit spending during recessions--but \n     these automatic stabilizers also put more money into the \n     hands of Americans precisely when they most need it.\n       A Balanced Budget Amendment, by contrast, would require an \n     explicit vote of Congress to run a larger deficit to \n     counteract an economic slow-down. Given the current climate \n     against deficits, politicians may be reluctant to approve \n     large-scale deficit spending until a recession is well under \n     way. The result? Bigger swings in the economy and a far more \n     volatile financial system.\n       This at a time when changing economic conditions are \n     creating a world where stability will be particularly in \n     demand. For years, the powerful interaction of inflation \n     hawks at the Federal Reserve Board, bond-market vigilantes, \n     and the new world economic order have been exerting a firm \n     downward pressure on prices.\n      As a result, ``we are a lot closer to the edge of deflation \n     than we have been in some time,'' says Edward E. Yardeni, \n     chief economist at C.J. Lawrence Inc.\n       The Fed, for one, is pursuing an austere monetary policy \n     toward its goal of wringing inflation out of the economy. By \n     almost any measure, the U.S. money supply is growing at an \n     anemic rate--hardly fertile ground for price increases. \n     Similarly, bond-market investors send interest rates sharply \n     higher on any hint of inflation news. ``The bond market will \n     not whatever is necessary to make sure inflation won't take \n     off,'' says Charles I. Clough Jr., chief investment \n     strategist at Merrill Lynch & Co.\n       Meanwhile, with the collapse of communism and the embrace \n     of freer markets by much of the developing world, the supply \n     of goods, services, capital, and labor is soaring. White-hot \n     domestic and international competition helps explain why last \n     year's inflation rate in the U.S., measured by hourly \n     compensation, was the lowest since 1949--easily offsetting \n     price increases of many commodities and crude-materials \n     prices. Disinflation is here to stay.\n       Vicious Cycle. So what? In a world of low inflation, the \n     risk from unexpected financial crises soars. A stock market \n     crash, a bank failure, or a drop in the dollar's value could \n     send asset prices plunging. Suddenly, interest payments \n     become onerous. Credit contracts. This is the sort of vicious \n     cycle that was common in the pre-World War II era--and that \n     deficit spending later eased. ``The stability of our economy \n     is drastically diminished when the federal government is \n     powerless to intervene to prevent a disastrous debt \n     deflation,'' says Hyman P. Minsky, an economist at the Jerome \n     Levy Economics Institute at Bard College.\n       The Balanced Budget Amendment wouldn't leave us completely \n     defenseless. The Fed always can open the money spigots to \n     offset the immediate impact of a financial panic, much as it \n     did following the stock market crash of 1987. But monetary \n     policy is a tool best used to control inflation, not to \n     counteract the cyclical ebbs and flows of the economy and \n     financial markets. Getting the government's finances in order \n     makes sense. But the Balanced Budget Amendment is a dangerous \n     step back into the 19th century.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                [From the Baltimore Sun, Feb. 28, 1995]\n\n                     Risky Constitutional Amendment\n\n       ``The last thing we want to do is turn over taxing and \n     spending to the federal courts,'' Sen. Sam Nunn told Ross \n     Perot Sunday night, in explaining why he wants to amend the \n     Balanced Budget Amendment to forbid courts to get involved in \n     any ``case or controversy'' arising out of Congress' failure \n     to balance the budget. ``I don't think we want to vest \n     [judges] with spending and tax decisions. I think that would \n     stand the Constitution on its head.

But what could they \n     do?\n       Nothing without Senator Nunn's modification, which will be \n     voted on today before the vote on the Balanced Budget \n     Amendment itself (and maybe nothing with it). Senator Nunn \n     fails and then the main amendment passes and ultimately \n     becomes part of the Constitution, judges would soon be \n     rewriting the budget, based on lawsuits demanding that this \n     tax be raised and that one lowered, etc. And citizens whose \n     benefits were cut would also be in court, arguing that \n     welfare should go down but not agricultural price supports, \n     etc.\n       That is what is really at stake if the Balanced Budget \n     Amendment as now written becomes the law of the land.\n       Sen. Orrin Hatch, leading the effort for the amendment, \n     says Senator Nunn's concerns can be met with legislation. We \n     dispute that, and so do most legal scholars--from Robert Bork \n     on the right to Laurence Tribe on the left. The result would \n     likely be hundreds, if not thousands of lawsuits around the \n     country,'' Judge Bork has written. And Professor Tribe says, \n     ``Someone who has been cut off from a program, a taxpayer--\n     these people will be able to go to court. No question about \n     it.''\n       This nation has never constitutionalized its taxing and \n     spending process, so saying with complete confidence what \n     judges would do is in a sense speculation. But there is a \n     record worth noting. In states which have balanced budget \n     requirements in their constitutions, judges have taken over \n     the legislative and executive function regarding spending and \n     taxing a result of lawsuits. That has happened in recent \n     years in New York, Georgia, Wisconsin, California and \n     Louisiana.\n       We have made it clear that we oppose the Balanced Budget \n     Amendment for many reasons, including the prospect of judges \n     taking over the budgeting process. So even if the Nunn \n     amendment is added, we would oppose it. And Senator Nunn and \n     others who dread judicial control of taxing and spending \n     better be careful. Even seemingly clear language in an \n     amendment doesn't guarantee hands off. There's always a risk.\n       As Sen. Howell Heflin, a former chief justice of the \n     Alabama Supreme Court recently put it, ``Every constitutional \n     amendment that has ever been adopted has had to be \n     interpreted, has had the court to have to look at it and make \n     some kind of interpretation.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 28, 1995]\n\n  How States Handle Debt May Not Work for Nation--Staying in Balance \n                         Requires Some Juggling\n\n                            (By Dan Morgan)\n\n       If the Senate approves today a constitutional amendment \n     requiring a balanced federal budget, 48 states will say, \n     ``Welcome to the club.''\n       Only Vermont and Wyoming do not have some kind of similar \n     statutory or constitutional requirement, and state officials \n     have been among the loudest critics of the federal debt \n     spree.\n       But studies of how these requirements work in practice show \n     that states can find their ways around them when necessary. \n     And some experts question whether the states are a good model \n     for the federal government to be copying, given their vastly \n     different responsibilities and fiscal systems.\n       ``It is naive to believe that since states balance their \n     budgets, the federal government should be able to do so as \n     well,'' said Steven D. Gold, director of the Center for the \n     Study of the States, who testified before the House Budget \n     Committee in 1992. ``States do not always balance their \n     budgets. Many states avoid deficits only by using funds \n     carried from previous years, or by relying on gimmicks that \n     often represent unsound policy.''\n       A 1993 study by the General Accounting Office for Congress, \n     found that 10 states had carried over end-of-year deficits or \n     borrowed money to finance such deficits in the previous three \n     years. ``Furthermore,'' the report noted, ``some states \n     reported balanced budgets at year end at least in part \n     through one-time budget strategies,'' such as dipping into \n     cash reserves, delaying payments to suppliers or using their \n     accounting tricks.\n       States balance their budgets most of the time. But they \n     have also been known to sell \n     [[Page S3281]] assets, temporarily reduce pension \n     contributions and accelerate tax collection in order to stay \n     within the letter of budget law.\n       Despite a requirement that the governor submit a balanced \n     budget to the legislature, California has had at least four \n     deficits since 1983, and its fiscal predicament ``clearly \n     shows that a balanced budget provision is no panacea--in \n     fact, at present it seems almost an irrelevancy,'' Gold told \n     the Budget Committee. Since\n      then, California's financial plight has worsened.\n       States with large, persistent operating deficits, including \n     Louisiana, New York, and Connecticut, have issued bonds to \n     finance the shortfall, a device that is permitted under some \n     state balanced budget requirements.\n       Most of the 35 constitutional and 13 statutory balanced \n     budget requirements on the books of the states apply only to \n     state general funds--the operating budgets that pay for \n     basic, day-to-day governmental services out of revenues from \n     taxes, fees and sometimes lottery proceeds.\n       Outside of this, however, states borrow heavily to finance \n     longer-term needs for buildings, roads, education and other \n     infrastructure. They also maintain numerous ``off budget'' \n     public authorities (for ports, highways, pensions and mineral \n     extraction, for example) that issue bonds and incur debts.\n       Some experts say that longstanding political tradition, and \n     fear of a downgraded credit rating, exert at least as much \n     pressure on governors to run tight fiscal ships as the \n     balanced budget requirements.\n       Because of these pressures, governors often take harsh \n     austerity measures that would face far more resistance in \n     Washington. During the 1991 recession, 23 states did not give \n     workers salary increases; 17 states cut welfare benefits and \n     many cut funding for higher education. According to Gold, a \n     widespread response to state fiscal stress has been to \n     increase tuition at state colleges, enabling state \n     governments to reduce contributions to higher education.\n       Some say this kind of austerity, if extended to the federal \n     budget because of the sanctions of a balanced budget \n     amendment, would increase the severity and pain of economic \n     downturns in a way that has not been true since the \n     Depression.\n       State balanced budget requirements ``generally have worked \n     for state and local government,'' said Philip M. Dearborn, \n     director of government finance research at the U.S. Advisory \n     Commission on Intergovernmental Relations. ``But there is a \n     substantial difference between the management of states and \n     of the federal government.''\n\n  (During today's session of the Senate, the following morning business \nwas transacted.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/28/senate-section/article/S3274-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  COMMENDING DR. ROBERT D. REISCHAUER\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today brings to an end the very \ndistinguished term of the third Director of the Congressional Budget \nOffice--Dr. Robert D. Reischauer. He has served in that office with the \nhighest degree of professionalism. Under some very difficult conditions \nin his 6 years as Director he has been able to maintain the \nindependence and high respect all of us have for the CBO. He has always \ngiven his best, and called them as he saw them--sometimes to the \nchagrin of both sides of the aisle.\n  In the 21 years of the CBO there have been only three Directors. The \nfirst, Dr. Alice Rivlin, followed by Dr. Rudy Penner and then Dr. \nRobert Reischauer. Dr. Reischauer will now be followed in the high \ntradition of those Directors by Dr. June O'Neill. Quite frankly, one of \nthe difficulties in finding someone to replace Bob's expired term was \nthe very high standards of professionalism and objectivity Bob and his \npredecessors have brought to that office.\n  This is as it should be. The CBO directorship is a critical position \nand one that must provide objective, nonbiased, and professional \nanalysis to the Congress--not an easy task in this day of instant \ncommunications and many well funded, organized lobbyists' ``think \ntanks.'' Just being able to sort out the wheat from the chaff has \nbecome a full time responsibility of the CBO. Over the years we have \nalso given CBO more responsibilities as in the recent case of the \nunfunded mandates legislation. Of course, we have not necessarily \nalways given them more resources to go along with the additional \nworkload.\n  Last evening the U.S. Senate adopted by unanimous consent, Senate \nResolution 81, commending Dr. Reischauer for his long and faithful \nservice to the Congress and the American public. The resolution was \ncosponsored by myself and the ranking member of the Budget Committee, \nthe distinguished majority and minority leaders of the Senate, all the \nmembers of the Senate Budget Committee, and many others. I am sure, had \ntime and resources permitted we would have had 100 original cosponsors.\n  The resolution we adopted unanimously last evening can only be \nconsidered a very small token of the Senate's appreciation of Dr. \nReischauer's service to the Congress. In this arena today, where making \ndecisions about complicated, complex, and difficult public policy \nissues that can affect the future course of this country, Dr. \nReischauer has been a clear and concise voice. We may not have always \nagreed with Dr. Reischauer's analysis, but we always respected his \nanalysis. He always gave his best. He always was fair and honest in his \nanalysis. Somehow, I think wherever Bob Reischauer's career now takes \nhim, that mantle of honesty and integrity will always go with him.\n  I now wish him and his family the best and I congratulate him for his \npublic service and a job well done.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/28/senate-section/article/S3281-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3281-S3282]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n           HARRY V. McKENNA FUNERAL--THE PASSING OF A PIONEER\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I rise to share with my colleagues the news \nthat Harry V. McKenna died last week and I recently returned from his \nfuneral in Rhode Island.\n  Harry McKenna was not only the dean of broadcast journalism in our \nState for many decades, he was a premier broadcast journalist whose \nhigh standards remain a challenge for his successors.\n  Harry became the touchstone for Rhode Island politicians until his \nretirement in 1983. It seems you would not be taken seriously as a \ncandidate, unless you were interviewed by Harry McKenna.\n  When I first ran for the Senate, almost 36 years ago, my first public \ninterview was with Harry. His weekly ``Radio Press Conference'' ran for \n32 years and was Rhode Island's longest-running news broadcast.\n  I was saddened when I learned of his death and I was touched by the \ngathering that honored him at his funeral. He was a good friend and an \nexemplary journalist.\n  After he retired, I missed him. Now I miss him even more.\n  My wife's and my deepest sympathy go to his wonderful wife, Julie, \nand his children and grandchildren.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of an obituary that appeared in \nthe Feb. 22, 1995 issue of Providence (RI) Journal be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the obituary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n         Harry V. McKenna; Directed News Program on Local Radio\n\n                      (By S. Robert Chiappinelli)\n\n       Cranston--Harry V. McKenna, the former WEAN news director \n     who became an institution himself while interviewing Rhode \n     Island's movers and shakers, died yesterday at the Roger \n     Williams Medical Center.\n       Mr. McKenna, of 107 Grace St., was the husband of Jule \n     (Lister) McKenna.\n       A large man with a resonant voice, blustery style, and in \n     later years, a shock of white hair, Mr. McKenna was called \n     the dean of Rhode Island news correspondents.\n       His weekly Radio Press Conference ran for 32 years and was \n     Rhode Island's longest-running news broadcast.\n       ``He had kind of a special place,'' former Gov. J. Joseph \n     Garrahy recalled yesterday. ``He always sat at the right-hand \n     corner of my desk at a press conference.''\n       After each press conference, Mr. McKenna would collar the \n     willing governor for a special telephone interview for WEAN.\n       ``We had a wonderful relationship,'' Garrahy said.\n       Mr. McKenna, a member of the Rhode Island Heritage Hall of \n     Fame, won respect both among politicians and fellow members \n     of the press.\n       ``For more than three decades, Rhode Island radio audiences \n     tracked the course of state government and politics through \n     the WEAN news reports of Harry McKenna,'' James V. Wyman, \n     Journal-Bulletin vice president and executive editor, said.\n       ``His familiar deep voice resonated with authority and \n     credibility as he applied his aggressive style to interviews \n     with key governmental officials,'' Wyman said.\n       ``Harry's approach to newsgathering was both \n     straightforward and relentless. But he was known and \n     respected for his fairness.''\n       Mr. McKenna joined the Journal-Bulletin in 1944 as \n     nightside police and fire reporter. In 1949, he was named \n     WEAN news director and was the station's news and public \n     affairs director when he retired. More than 1,400 persons \n     attended his retirement party in February, 1983.\n       John P. Hackett, former Journal-Bulletin chief editorial \n     writer and longtime political writer who often\n      teamed with Mr. McKenna on Radio Press Conference, said he \n     was a \n     [[Page S3282]]  skilled interrogator who frequently knew the \n     answer to a question before he asked it.\n       ``He was a good newsman,'' Hackett said. ``He dug up more \n     stuff. He'd pass tips on to me.''\n       Mr. McKenna was in great demand as a master of ceremonies \n     for community dinners, Hackett said, and his introductions \n     would be a show in themselves.\n       ``Before he got through,'' Hackett said, ``he would have \n     recognized everyone in the audience.''\n       M. Charles Bakst, Journal-Bulletin political columnist, \n     said: ``He was a throwback to the days when radio coverage of \n     the State House was an important part of the daily scene, and \n     governors deferred to him, giving him extensive interviews \n     and a seat of honor at press conferences.''\n       ``He was a big man who could get angry and sound tough, but \n     who also had a playful, generous, patient side,'' Bakst said.\n       Mr. McKenna had served on the board of directors of the \n     Associated Press Broadcasters Association, was a former \n     international vice president of the Radio and Television News \n     Directors Association, and was the first president of the \n     Rhode Island Press Club.\n       In 1973, he caused a stir with a taped telephone interview \n     with underworld informant Vincent ``Big Vinnie'' Teresa from \n     a secret location. Teresa alleged that there was widespread \n     corruption in the Providence Police Department, and said New \n     England crime boss Raymond L.S. Patriarca had exerted \n     influence on the department.\n       Mr. McKenna was chairman of the Traffic Safety Commission \n     of Cranston for 20 years. He also served in numerous \n     community organizations.\n       Besides his wife he leaves two daughters, Constance A. \n     McKenna, and Deborah E.M. Brody, both of Cranston; a son, \n     Robert W. McKenna of Warwick, and five grandchildren.\n       The funeral will be held Saturday at 8:30 a.m. from the \n     Hoey Funeral Home, 168 Academy Ave., Providence, with a Mass \n     of Christian Burial celebrated by Bishop Louis E. Gelineau at \n     10 at St. Matthew Church, Elmwood Avenue. Burial will be in \n     Swan Point Cemetery in Providence.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/28/senate-section/article/S3281-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3282]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

As of the close of business yesterday, \nMonday, February 27, the Federal debt stood at $4,839,489,402,270.31--\nor $18,370.79 on a per capita basis.\n  Mr. President, anyone even remotely familiar with the U.S. \nConstitution knows that no President can spend a dime of Federal tax \nmoney that has not first been authorized and appropriated by Congress--\nboth the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. President, I am convinced today, as I was back in 1973, that it \nis the absolute responsibility and duty of Congress to control Federal \nspending.

A bill to provide for administrative procedures to extend \nFederal recognition to certain Indian groups, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n  THE INDIAN FEDERAL RECOGNITION ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Indian \nFederal Recognition Administrative Procedures Act of 1995.\n  The Indian Federal Recognition Administrative Procedures Act provides \nfor the creation of the Commission on Indian Recognition. The \nCommission will be an independent agency of the executive branch and \nwill be composed of three members appointed by the President. The \nCommission would be authorized to hold hearings, take testimony and \nreach final determinations on petitions for recognition. The bill \nprovides realistic timelines to guide the Commission in the review and \ndecisionmaking process. Under the existing process in the Department of \nthe Interior, some petitioners have waited 10 years or more for even a \ncursory review of their petition. The bill I am introducing today \nrequires the Commission to set a date for a preliminary hearing on a \npetition not later than 60 days after the filing of a documented \npetition. Not later than 30 days after the conclusion of a preliminary \nhearing, the Commission would be required to either decide to extend \nFederal acknowledgement to the petitioner or to require the petitioner \nto proceed to an adjudicatory hearing.\n  To ensure fairness, the bill provides for appeals of adverse \ndecisions to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. To \nensure promptness, the bill authorizes adequate funding for the costs \nof processing petitions through the Commission and to assist \npetitioners in the development of their petitions. This bill will also \nprovide finality for both the petitioners and the Department of the \nInterior.\n  The Department has had a process of one type or another for \nrecognizing Indian tribes since the 1930's. Great uncertainty has \nexisted about how or when this process might be concluded and how many \nIndian tribes will ultimately be recognized. I believe that it is in \nthe interests of all parties to have a clear deadline for the \ncompletion of the recognition process. Accordingly, the bill requires \nall interested tribal groups to file their petitions within 6 years \nafter the date of enactment and the Commission must complete all of its \nwork within 12 years from the date of enactment.\n  This bill is similar to the bills which I have introduced in each of \nthe last three Congresses. It is also similar to a bill which passed \nthe House of Representatives in the 103d Congress, H.R. 4462, and which \nhas been reintroduced in this Congress by Representative Faleomavaega, \nH.R. 671. The major differences between the bill I am introducing today \nand H.R. 671 are; First, H.R. 671 would make naive Hawaiians and Alaska \nNative villages eligible\n to petition for recognition while this bill does not; second, H.R. 671 \nwould create a part-time Commission, while this bill creates a full-\ntime independent entity in the executive branch, and H.R. 671 would not \nsunset the Commission or the recognition process while this bill would \nterminate the Commission and require the process to be completed in 12 \nyears.\n\n  From the earliest times, the Congress has acted to recognize the \nunique government-to-government relationship with the Indian tribes. \nThere are and always have been some Indian tribes which have not been \nrecognized by the Federal Government. This lack of recognition does not \nalter the fact of the existence of the tribe or of its retained \ninherent sovereignty; it merely means that there is no formal political \nrelationship between the tribal government and the Federal Government \nand that the enrolled members of the tribe are not eligible for the \nservices and benefits accorded to Indians because of their status as \nmembers of federally recognized Indian tribes.\n  Over the years, the Federal courts have ruled that recognition, while \nsolely within the authority of the Congress, may also be conferred \nthrough actions of the executive branch. Both the President and the \nSecretary of the Interior have historically acted in ways which the \ncourts have found to constitute recognition of Indian tribes. And \nbeginning in 1954, it was the established policy of the Congress to \nofficially sanction the termination of the Federal/tribal relationship. \nThis misguided policy was only effectively ended in 1970 when President \nNixon called for the beginning of an era of self-determination and the \nend of termination.\n  [[Page S3284]] In 1978, the Department of the Interior promulgated \nregulations to establish criteria and procedures for the recognition of \nIndian tribes by the Secretary. Since that time tribal groups have \nfiled 147 petitions for review. Of those, 31 have been resolved and 75 \nare letters expressing an intent to petition, and 7 require legislative \nauthority to proceed. The remainder are in various stages of \nconsideration by the Department. During this same time, the Congress \nhas recognized nine other tribal groups through legislation.\n  In 1978, 1983, 1988, 1989, and 1992, the Committee on Indian Affairs \nheld oversight hearings on the Federal recognition process. At each of \nthose hearings the record clearly showed that the process is not \nworking properly. The process in the Department of the Interior is time \nconsuming and costly, although it has improved somewhat in recent \nyears. Some tribal groups allege that Interior Department's process \nleads to unfair and unfounded results. It has frequently been hindered \nby a lack of staff and resources needed to fairly and promptly review \nall petitions. At the same time, the Congress extends recognition to \ntribes with little or no reference to the legal standards and criteria \nemployed by the Department. The result is yet another layer of \ninconsistency and apparent unfairness.\n  The record from our previous hearings reveals a clear need for the \nCongress to address the problems affecting the recognition process. I \nbelieve that the bill I am introducing today will go a long way toward \nresolving the problems which have plagued both the Department and the \npetitions over the years.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the \nIndian Federal Recognition Administrative Procedures Act of 1995 and a \nsection-by-section summary be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 479\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Indian Federal Recognition \n     Administrative Procedures Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to establish an administrative procedure to extend \n     Federal recognition to certain Indian groups;\n       (2) to extend to Indian groups that are determined to be \n     Indian tribes the protection, services, and benefits \n     available from the Federal Government pursuant to the Federal \n     trust responsibility with respect to Indian tribes;\n       (3) to extend to Indian groups that are determined to be \n     Indian tribes the immunities and privileges available to \n     other federally acknowledged Indian tribes by virtue of their \n     status as Indian tribes with a government-to-government \n     relationship with the United States;\n       (4) to ensure that when the Federal Government extends \n     acknowledgment to an Indian tribe, the Federal Government \n     does so with a consistent legal, factual, and historical \n     basis;\n       (5) to establish a Commission on Indian Recognition to \n     review and act upon petitions submitted by Indian groups that \n     apply for Federal recognition;\n       (6) to provide clear and consistent standards of \n     administrative review of documented petitions for Federal \n     acknowledgment;\n       (7) to clarify evidentiary standards and expedite the \n     administrative review process by providing adequate resources \n     to process petitions; and\n       (8) to remove the Federal acknowledgment process from the \n     Bureau of Indian Affairs and transfer the responsibility for \n     the process to an independent Commission on Indian \n     Recognition.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Not later than 30 days after \n     all members of the Commission have been confirmed by the \n     Senate, the Secretary is required to transfer to the \n     Commission all petitions pending before the Department of the \n     Interior that are not under active consideration. All \n     authority of the Secretary to recognize or acknowledge an \n     Indian group as an Indian tribe, except for those groups \n     under active consideration, shall cease on the date of \n     transfer to the Commission. All petitions transferred to the \n     Commission shall be considered as having been submitted to \n     the Commission in the same order they were submitted to the \n     Department.\n       Subsection (b)(1) provides that a petition must be readable \n     and contain detailed, specific evidence showing that the \n     petitioner has been identified as an American Indian entity \n     on a substantially continuous basis since 1871. The \n     Commission can determine the Indian identity of a group based \n     on any one or more of the following: Identification as an \n     Indian entity by the Federal Government; a relationship of \n     petitioner with a state government or a unit of local \n     government based on the Indian identity of the petitioner; \n     identification as an Indian entity by public or private \n     records, by anthropologists or historians, newspapers, books, \n     other Indian tribes and Indian organizations, or foreign \n     governments.\n       Subsection (b)(2) provides that the petition must contain a \n     statement of facts establishing that the membership of the \n     petitioner comprises a distinct community which has existed\n      from historical times to the present. The Commission can \n     determine the existence of an Indian community based on \n     one or more of the following items: marriages within the \n     group; social relationships and interaction within the \n     group; shared labor or economic activity; discrimination \n     or other social distinctions by nonmembers; shared ritual \n     activity and cultural patterns; collective Indian identity \n     continuously over a period of more than 50 years; and a \n     demonstration of historical political influence.\n       Subsection (b)(2) further provides that the Commission \n     shall find that the petitioner has provided sufficient \n     evidence of a community if the petitioner has provided \n     evidence that demonstrates any one of the following: more \n     than 50% of the members of the group reside in a particular \n     geographic area exclusively composed of members of that group \n     and the remainder of the group maintains consistent social \n     interaction with some members of the community; not less than \n     50% of the marriages of the group are between members of the \n     group; not less than 50% of the members of the group maintain \n     distinct cultural patterns including language, kinship or \n     religious beliefs and practices; and distinct community \n     social institutions encompassing a substantial portion of the \n     members of the group.\n       Subsection (b)(3) requires the petition to contain a \n     statement of facts establishing that the petitioner has \n     maintained political influence or authority over its members \n     as an autonomous entity from historical times. The Commission \n     may rely on one or more of \n     [[Page S3290]] the following items to determine if the \n     petitioner is an autonomous entity: the group is capable of \n     mobilizing a significant number of its members and member \n     resources for group purposes; most of the group considers \n     issues acted upon by the group leadership to be of personal \n     importance; there is widespread knowledge and involvement in \n     political processes by most group members; and there are \n     intragroup conflicts which show controversy over valued group \n     goals, properties, policies and processes.\n       Subsection (b)(3) also provides that the Commission shall \n     determine that a petitioner has provided sufficient evidence \n     to demonstrate the exercise of political influence or \n     authority by demonstrating that leaders or other mechanisms \n     exist to accomplish the following: allocation of group \n     resources; settlement of disputes between members or \n     subgroups; influence the behavior of individual members; and \n     organize or influence economic activities among the members.\n       Subsection (b)(4) provides that the petition must include a \n     copy of the governing document of the petitioner that \n     includes the petitioner's membership criteria or a \n     description of the governing procedures and membership \n     criteria.\n       Subsection (b)(5) requires the petition to contain a list \n     of all of the petitioner's current members and a statement \n     describing the methods used to prepare such list. A group's \n     membership must consist of established descendancy from an \n     Indian group that existed historically or from historical \n     Indian groups that combined and functioned as a single \n     autonomous entity. Evidence of tribal membership shall \n     include the following items: descendancy rolls prepared by \n     the Secretary; state, federal or other official records; \n     church, school and similar enrollment records; and affidavits \n     of recognition by tribal elders, leaders or the tribal \n     governing body.\n       Subsection (c) provides that a petition from a group that \n     is able to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence \n     that the group was or is the successor in interest to a party \n     to a treaty; or a group acknowledged by the Federal \n     Government as eligible to participate in the Indian \n     Reorganization Act; or a group for which the United States \n     holds lands in trust; or a group that has been denominated a \n     tribe by an Act of Congress or an Executive Order shall only \n     have to prove continuity of its existence as an Indian group \n     from the date of such event rather than from the date of \n     1871.\n       Subsection (d) provides that no petitions can be submitted \n     to the Commission after the date that is 6 years after the \n     date of enactment of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 6. NOTIFICATION OF RECEIPT OF PETITION.\n\n       Subsection (a) of this section provides that 30 days after \n     a petition is submitted or transferred to the Commission, the \n     Commission shall send a written acknowledgement of receipt to \n     the petitioner and publish a notice of such receipt in the \n     Federal Register. With regard to a petition that is \n     transferred to the Commission from the Secretary, the \n     Commission shall also advise the petitioner whether the \n     petition meets the requirements of Section 5 of this Act and, \n     if necessary, provide the petitioner with 90 days to submit a \n     petition to the Commission which does meet the requirements \n     of Section 5.\n       Subsection (b) provides that the Commission shall provide \n     written notification to the Governor, attorney general and \n     each federally recognized Indian tribe located in the state \n     in which the petitioner resides.\n       Subsection (c) provides that the Commission shall publish \n     the notice of the receipt of each petition in a major \n     newspaper or general circulation in the town or city located \n     nearest the petitioner. These notices shall include a \n     statement of the opportunity for any interested parties to \n     submit factual or legal arguments in support of or in \n     opposition to the petition. A copy of any such statements \n     shall be made available to the petitioner by the Commission \n     and the petitioner shall be afforded an opportunity to \n     respond to such statements from other parties.\n\n     SEC. 7. PROCESSING THE PETITION.\n\n       Subsection (a) requires the Commission to conduct a review \n     of all documented petitions which it receives. The review \n     shall include consideration of the petition, supporting \n     evidence and the factual statements contained in the \n     petition. The Commission may also initiate other research \n     relative to an analysis of the petition and consider such \n     evidence as may be submitted by other parties. Upon a request \n     by a petitioner, the Library of Congress and the National \n     Archives shall allow the petitioner access to their \n     resources, records and documents to conduct research and \n     prepare evidence concerning the status of the petitioner.\n       Subsection (b) provides that petitions shall be considered \n     on a first come, first served basis, determined by the date \n     of the original filing, except for those petitions which meet \n     the requirements of Section 5(c) which shall receive priority \n     consideration.\n\n     SEC. 8. PRELIMINARY HEARING.\n\n       Subsection (a) provides that not later than 60 days after \n     the Commission receives a documented petition, it shall set a \n     date for a preliminary hearing.

Not later than \n     30 days after the conclusion of the preliminary hearing, the \n     Commission is required to make available to the petitioner a \n     written list of any deficiencies or omissions the Commission \n     relied upon in the preliminary hearing. The scope of the \n     adjudicatory hearing is limited to the list of deficiencies \n     or omissions and the Commission cannot make any additions to \n     the list after it is issued to the petitioner.\n\n     SEC. 9. ADJUDICATORY HEARING.\n\n       Subsection (a) provides that the adjudicatory hearing shall \n     be held not late than 180 days after the preliminary hearing.\n       Subsection (b) provides that the Commission may require \n     testimony from the acknowledgement and research staff of the \n     Commission or from other witnesses.

EFFECT OF DETERMINATIONS.\n\n       This section provides that a determination by the \n     Commission that a petitioner is recognized by the United \n     States as an Indian tribe will not have the effect of \n     depriving or diminishing: (1) the right of any other Indian \n     tribe to govern its reservation as such reservation existed \n     prior to the recognition of the Indian group; (2) any \n     property right held in trust by the: United States for such \n     other Indian tribe as such property existed prior to the \n     recognition of such Indian group; or (3) any previously or \n     independently existing claim by a petitioner to any such \n     property right held in trust by the United States for such \n     other Indian tribe prior to the recognition of the Indian \n     group.\n\n     SEC. 12.

Mr. President, I rise today in honor of an \ninspiring Kentucky leader--Kathy Hogancamp, State representative for \nKentucky's Fourth District.\n  Representative Hogancamp's resiliency determination, and strong sense \nof community service is clearly reflected in the course of her career \nprior to political service. She is a former teacher, and also served as \nan official of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and \nDepartment of Education from 1985 to 1991. Most recently, Kathy applied \nher master's degree in guidance and educational psychology in her work \nas a private tutor.\n  As our Nation struggles to recapture the initiative and stamina \nessential to reviving the American Dream, Kathy Hogancamp exemplifies \nwhat self-empowerment and the courage to make a difference truly mean. \nSince age 17, Kathy has been wheel-chair bound. Yet, she has never \nallowed her physical limitations to deter her work in serving her \ncommunity and fulfilling her Christian mission. Kathy believes that \ncharacter and intellect are far more important than her physical \ncondition. Her optimism and drive to achieve are the basis of her \npersonal philosophy--if there are obstacles to overcome, then overcome \nthem.\n  In 1994, Kathy Hogancamp set out to win Kentucky's Fourth District \nHouse seat. Despite the odds in a predominately Democratic district, \nHogancamp won the confidence of the voters and the title of State \nrepresentative. Representative Hogancamp's campaign reflected the needs \nand interests of her district, not herself, as her platform focused on \ncutting taxes and revising the Kentucky Education Reform Act.\n  In February, Representative Hogancamp encountered a challenge that \ntested her will and strength as a serious automobile accident left her \nbattered and bruised in the hospital. I am pleased to tell the Chamber \nthat Kathy is recovering quite well and is eager to return to her \nduties as State representative. Mr. President, I want to share with my \ncolleagues her thoughts on public service and sense of responsibility \nin her role as a lawmaker and community leader. It is my hope that her \nwords will serve to remind us what our role as Members of the U.S. \nSenate means to our constituents and the future of our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the Paducah Sun's February 14, 1995, \narticle on Representative Hogancamp be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n                 [From the Paducah Sun, Feb. 14, 1995]\n\n   Rep. Hogancamp Resolved, Upbeat Since Last Brutal Brush With Death\n\n                        (By Donna Groves Haynes)\n\n       Bruised, battered and lying in a hospital bed, state Rep. \n     Kathy Hogancamp still radiates strength and determination.\n       ``That's the way God built me,'' said Hogancamp, who has \n     been paralyzed since a car wreck 23 years ago and is now \n     recovering from serious injuries sustained in a van wreck \n     Feb. 7 near Beaver Dam.\n       ``I could have decided to be a couch potato when I was 17 \n     and would have been justified in doing so,'' Hogancamp said \n     in an interview from her hospital room Monday. ``I made the \n     decision to make something of my life because I do believe I \n     have something to give back to our culture.''\n       Now after a second serious car crash, Hogancamp is \n     displaying the same resilience. ``I've learned that accidents \n     do strike twice, and God still has His hand on my head,'' she \n     said.\n       Doctors do not expect Hogancamp's mobility to be any more \n     impaired than it was before the wreck. ``It's just all the \n     logistics--getting a new (wheel) chair, a new car . . . new \n     makeup,'' she said jokingly, referring to the fact that her \n     personal belongings were strewn over about a 30-foot area in \n     the wreck.\n       Over the weekend, Hogancamp was moved out of intensive care \n     and into a private room. Although she has been told she could \n     be released Thursday, Hogancamp added, ``but I don't trust \n     doctors.''\n       Even in the hospital, Hogancamp was beginning to talk about \n     business again. When U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell called Monday \n     to ask her how she was feeling, she volunteered to speak at \n     the upcoming Lincoln Day festivities ``if at all possible.''\n       Hogancamp views her latest ordeal as a ``wake-up call from \n     God,'' an attempt on His part to ensure she is properly \n     motivated in her legislative endeavors. ``God had to get my \n     attention again, a\n      second time, telling me to stay on the track. When you reach \n     adulthood, it's easy to slip into lifeless faith, I had \n     not escaped that.\n       ``He was saying to me; `I put you in this position of \n     responsibility. Don't blow it.'''\n       Asked if she ever wanted to question, ``Why me?'' Hogancamp \n     explained that she learned from the Biblical character Job \n     that that would be futile. ``Job never got his question \n     answered. He just saw God, and his question paled in \n     comparison.\n       [[Page S3292]] ``It's an insignificant question. You can \n     waste your life on it. You just need to take what you can \n     from your past and move on. A lot of the things I learned \n     when I was walking are helpful to me now. I used to be in \n     speech and drama. That helped me learn to write a heck of a \n     speech.''\n       Although Hogancamp is alert and making jokes, she realizes \n     she has a long road of recovery ahead of her. ``I'm a lot \n     more recovered upstairs than my body is,'' she said. ``My \n     whole body is one big bruise.''\n       Among her more serious injuries are a few cracked ribs and \n     a compound fractured wrist. But because it's her left wrist, \n     Hogancamp made light of that. ``It's not my major make-up \n     hand anyway,'' she said.\n       Hogancamp is optimistic that the wrist injury will not \n     prevent her from using an adaptive device to write on her \n     computer.\n       And she believes her injuries could even result in some \n     benefits. ``It banged up my legs pretty good, so much so that \n     I may end up sitting straighter. It banged me around so much, \n     I may end up with better posture. Isn't that ironic?''\n       Hogancamp said she remained conscious as the van tumbled \n     out of control Tuesday night. ``Bright lights, going round \n     and round and wondering, `When is this going to end?' I've \n     never done drugs, but that's got to be close to what a drug \n     experience would be.''\n       When the van finally came to rest, Hogancamp found herself \n     face down in the mud with her body twisted. She could see \n     that her left wrist was severely mangled, but, being \n     paralyzed, had no idea what her other injuries might be.\n       Still, she said, her faith helped her to remain calm. ``I \n     knew if God had brought me that far, it wasn't going to be \n     the end.''\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/28/senate-section/article/S3291-3", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ALEX MANOOGIAN\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this Friday, March 3, 1995, the \nArmenian General Benevolent Union of Detroit is holding a tribute \nbanquet honoring Mr. Alex Manoogian. Mr. Manoogian is one of the most \ninspiring people I have ever met. This Friday evening at St. John's \nArmenian Church in Southfield, MI, the Republic of Armenia will award \nhim the National Hero of Armenia Award and an honorary doctorate degree \nfrom Yerevan State University.\n  As an appropriate tribute to Mr. Manoogian's stature, the president \nof the Armenian Parliament, His Excellency Babken Ararktsian will be \nthe keynote speaker.\n  Alex Manoogian's life is an affirmation of the American dream. And \nyet the key to understanding the meaning of his vast worldly success is \nto know of the love, fidelity, and loyalty that Alex Manoogian has held \nin his heart for his family, his people, and his community.\n  He was born in Asia Minor in 1901, and came to America in 1920. \nSettling in Detroit in 1924, he founded his own company in 1928 which \nhas grown into the multinational Masco Corp.\n  He was married to Marie Tatian in 1931. In over 60 years of marriage \nthey were blessed with two loving children and six adoring \ngrandchildren. To understand the depth of his love of family and his \nembrace of the Armenian community is to understand the magnanimous \nactions of his remarkable life.\n  His involvement and generosity have created or expanded hospitals, \nmuseums, libraries, universities, schools, and other important \ninstitutions throughout the world. Close to home, it is his former \nresidence, donated to the city of Detroit, that is the official \nresidence for the mayor of Detroit.\n  Mr. President, the positive impact of his life cannot be \noverestimated, and his legacy will live forever through the countless \npeople around the world that have been changed by, and benefited from, \nthe vast array of cultural, educational, humanitarian, and charitable \ninstitutions that have thrived as the result of his efforts.\n  His awards and honors have been many, and his international renown is \nwell-deserved. His life has been a tribute to all that is possible and \ngood in this great country, his adopted home. And the loyalty for and \nlove of his heritage have been the guiding light and beneficiary of his \nremarkable life. It is an honor to know him, and an honor for me to pay \ntribute to him.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/28/senate-section/article/S3292-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3292-S3293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          AMERICAN HEART MONTH\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I stand in support of February, \nAmerican Heart Month. February 1995 marks the 32d annual American Heart \nMonth. To convey the importance that all Americans participate in the \nbattle against cardiovascular diseases, including heart attack and \nstroke, in 1963 the U.S. Congress passed a joint resolution requesting \nthat the President proclaim each February as American Heart Month. But \nthe battle has not been won, cardiovascular diseases remain America's \nNo. 1 killer and a major cause of disability.\n  During American Heart Month, the American Heart Association and its \nmore than 3.7 million volunteers canvass neighborhoods nationwide \ndistributing educational materials and soliciting public support for \nthe AHA mission, the reduction of disability and death from \ncardiovascular diseases, including heart attack and stroke. The \nAmerican Heart Month theme this year is ``Life. It's What We're \nFighting For,'' highlighting the value of biomedical research and its \nsignificance in daily life for many Americans. AHA-sponsored activities \nand information during this American Heart Month focus on the \nimportance of current medical research projects in the fight against \ncardiovascular diseases and outline some medical miracles responsible \nfor longer and healthier lives of millions of Americans. Through these \neducational efforts, the AHA hopes to enhance public support and \nknowledge about the critical nature of biomedical research in the \nbattle against cardiovascular diseases.\n  Since 1949, the American Heart Association has invested about $1.3 \nbillion in medical research and hopes to reach the $2 billion mark by \nthe year 2000. The AHA reports that it will contribute about $94 \nmillion in support of almost 2,900 medical research projects across \nthis country in 1995.\n  American Heart Association-supported research has produced some \nsignificant results, such as CPR, life-extending drugs, bypass surgery, \npacemakers and other surgical techniques to repair heart defects. In \naddition, four physicians who received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or \nMedicine had been supported, at one time, by the AHA, including Dr. \nEdwin G. Krebs of the University of Washington in Seattle. Doctor Krebs \nand Dr. Edmond H. Fischer, also of the University of Washington in \nSeattle, both were awarded the 1991 Nobel Prize in Physiology or \nMedicine for their discovery of how proteins in the body are switched \non to perform functions within cells.\n  I can personally attest to the benefit of medical research. According \nto the American Heart Association, each year 1.5 million Americans \nsuffer a heart attack--that is approximately 1 heart attack every 20 \nseconds. As my colleagues know, unfortunately, last November, I \nsuffered a heart attack. But, thanks to medical research, I am living a \nhealthy, productive life.\n  As a recent beneficiary of medical research, I welcome this \nopportunity to salute the American Heart Association for their research \nsupport and public and professional education and community service \nprograms to advance the battle against heart attack and stroke. I am \nparticularly proud of the contribution of the American Heart \nAssociation Washington affiliate. The AHA Washington affiliate in 1994-\n1995 will support about $797,332 on research being conducted at the \nfollowing research facilities in Washington: University of Washington, \nWashington State University, Children's Hospital in Seattle, VA Medical \nCenter, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.\n  However, I am still concerned about the federal commitment to the \nbattle against cardiovascular diseases, including heart attack and \nstroke. The American Heart Association estimates that about 1 in 4 \nAmericans suffers from cardiovascular diseases that will cost this \nNation approximately $138 billion in medical expenses and lost \nproductivity in 1995. But, the fiscal year 1993 National Institutes of \nHealth budget for research on heart disease and stroke is only $855 \nmillion, representing a research investment of less than 1 percent of \nthe expenditures for these diseases.\n  Again, I encourage my colleagues to reaffirm our dedication to the \nfight against cardiovascular diseases. A significant growth in Federal \nresources is needed to take advantage of promising research projects in \nthis area.\n  I ask that this year's Presidential proclamation be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The proclamation follows:\n\n[[Page S3293]]\n\n                [Proclamation 6768 of February 10, 1995]\n\n                       American Heart Month, 1995\n\n           (By the President of the United States of America)\n\n\n                             a proclamation\n\n       Throughout history, the heart has been a symbol of health \n     and well-being. Yet nothing now overshadows Americans' health \n     as much as heart disease--the leading cause of death among \n     men and women. Diseases of the heart and blood vessels kill \n     nearly a million Americans each year, most from the effects \n     of atherosclerosis, the narrowing and stiffening of blood \n     vessels fro the buildup of plaque that usually begins early \n     in life.\n       Today, Americans are enjoying the rewards of the progress \n     humanity has made in understanding and treating \n     cardiovascular disease. Advances in diagnosis make it \n     possible to see the heart beat without the use of invasive \n     procedures. Thousands of heart attack victims are being saved \n     by the rapid administration of drugs to dissolve blood clots. \n     Soon, gene therapy may be able to prevent the smooth muscle \n     cell multiplication that contributes to the narrowing of \n     blood vessels. Perhaps most important, we have greater \n     understanding of how to prevent the development of heart \n     disease. By controlling blood pressure and blood cholesterol, \n     being physically active, and not smoking cigarettes, more \n     Americans can have the chance to lead long, healthy lives.\n       The Federal Government has contributed to these successes \n     by supporting research and education through the National \n     Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Through its commitment to \n     research, its programs to heighten public awareness, and its \n     vital network of dedicated volunteers, the American Heart \n     Association also has played a crucial role in bringing about \n     these remarkable accomplishments.\n       Yet the heart has not revealed all of its mysteries. No one \n     knows why heart disease begins. And, while it is known that \n     heart disease develops differently in men and women, the \n     reasons for those variations are still being studied. About \n     50 million Americans continue to suffer from hypertension, a \n     major cause of stroke, and 1.25 million Americans have heart \n     attacks every year.\n       Conquering these diseases requires unwavering national and \n     personal commitment. On the national level, the Federal \n     Government will continue to support research into the \n     prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of heart disease. On the \n     personal level, Americans can take steps to prevent heart \n     disease from striking their families, including teaching \n     their children heart-healthy habits. Working together, we can \n     make the tragedy of heart disease a nightmare of the past.\n       In recognition of the need for all Americans to become \n     involved in the ongoing fight against cardiovascular disease, \n     the Congress, by Joint Resolution approved December 30, 1963 \n     (77 Stat. 843, 36 U.S.C. 169b), has requested that the \n     President issue an annual proclamation designating February \n     as ``American Heart Month.''\n       Now, Therefore, I, William J. Clinton, President of the \n     United States of America, do hereby proclaim February 1995 as \n     American Heart Month. I invite the Governors of the States, \n     the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, officials of other areas \n     subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, and the \n     American people to join me in reaffirming our commitment to \n     combating cardiovascular disease and stroke.\n       In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth \n     day of February, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and \n     ninety-five, and of the Independence of the United States of \n     America the two hundred and nineteenth.\n\n                                       William J.

Mr. Curdes, who \nrecently passed away at his home in Fort Wayne, IN, served his country \nwith honor, and was a recognized hero of World War II.\n  Mr. Curdes demonstrated his skill and valor during his first 2 weeks \nas a fighter pilot in World War II, when he shot down a total of five \nGerman planes to become a flying ace. Several months later, when his \nplane was damaged in fighting, he was forced down in Italy and spent \nmonths in war prisons, until his eventual escape and walk to freedom.\n  Late in the war, Louis Curdes saw action in the South Pacific. He \nshot down aircraft from Japan and Italy, as well as Germany. Two of the \nItalian aircraft he shot down are displayed at the Smithsonian Air and \nSpace Museum.\n  In 1963, Mr. Curdes retired as a lieutenant colonel after 22 years of \nservice in the U.S. Air Force. He earned numerous medals including the \nDistinguished Flying Cross, Purple Heart, and Air Medals. Upon his \nretirement, he began Curdes Builders Co., and devoted his life to his \nfamily and work in Fort Wayne, IN.\n  Mr. President, it is with great respect that I call to my colleagues' \nattention the contributions Louis Curdes made to his country. He is \ntruly an example and inspiration for all who follow him .\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/28/senate-section/article/S3293-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 HOMICIDES BY GUNSHOT IN NEW YORK CITY\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today, as I have done each \nweek of the 104th Congress, to announce to the Senate that during the \npast week, 6 people were murdered by gunshot in New York City, bringing \nthis year's total to 95.\n  Today I received a letter from Sarah Brady, chairman of Handgun \nControl Inc., which brought some very welcome news. The letter, which \nnot coincidentally arrives on the 1-year anniversary of the \nimplementation of the Brady law, announces the results of a new survey \nunequivocally proving that the Brady law is working. Conducted jointly \nby the International Association of Chiefs of Police and Handgun \nControl, Inc., the survey of 115 law enforcement agencies in 27 States \nreveals that background checks in those jurisdictions prevented the \nsale of guns to over 19,000 persons prohibited by law from purchasing \nfirearms. Mrs. Brady also informs me that, according to Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms estimates, the Brady law has prevented \nsome 70,000 persons nationwide from illegally purchasing firearms.\n  Mr. President, this demonstrates that Congress can make a difference \nin the fight to reduce gun violence. I hope it will convince the Senate \nto adopt future measures to address this terrible problem.\n  I ask that the letter from Mrs. Brady be printed in the Record.\n  The letter follows:\n\n                                                February 27, 1995.\n     Hon. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Moynihan: Thanks to you, it's working. The \n     results are in! Tuesday, February 28, 1995 marks the first \n     anniversary of the implementation of the Brady Law and a new \n     survey confirms that the new law is helping to keep guns out \n     of the wrong hands.\n       Attached for your review are the results of a survey \n     conducted by the International Association of Chiefs of \n     Police (IACP) and Handgun Control, Inc. The survey found that \n     background checks in 115 state and local jurisdictions, \n     covering all or part of 27 states, stopped 19,000 felons and \n     other prohibited persons from obtaining handguns.\n       While that is no national reporting requirement, the Bureau \n     of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms estimates that background \n     checks in the past year stopped 70,000 convicted felons and \n     other prohibited persons from making an over-the-counter \n     purchase of a handgun. Forty-thousand of those denials came \n     from ``new'' states which did not previously meet the \n     requirements of the Brady Law. As a result of these \n     background checks, hundreds of arrests have been made of \n     those wanted on outstanding warrants.\n       If you have any questions regarding this information, \n     please do not hesitate to call HCI's Marie Carbone.\n       On behalf of Jim and myself, please accept our deepest \n     appreciation for all that you did to make these results \n     possible.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Sarah Brady,\n\n                                                    Chair.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/28/senate-section/article/S3293-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3293-S3295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n             RULES OF THE SENATE SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON AGING\n\n Mr. COHEN.

Witness Request. Any witness called for a hearing may \n     submit a written request to the Chairman no later than \n     twenty-four hours in advance for his examination to be in \n     closed or open session. The Chairman shall inform the \n     Committee of any such request.\n       3. Closed Session Subjects. A meeting or hearing or portion \n     thereof may be closed if the matters to be discussed concern: \n     (1) national security; (2) Committee staff personnel or \n     internal staff management or procedure; (3) matters tending \n     to reflect adversely on the character or reputation or to \n     invade the privacy of the individuals; (4) Committee \n     investigations; (5) other matters enumerated in Senate Rule \n     XXVI (5)(b).\n       4.

The Chairman shall circulate polling sheets \n     to each member specifying the matter being polled and the \n     time limit for completion of the poll. If any Member so \n     requests in advance of the meeting, the matter shall be held \n     for meeting rather than being polled. The clerk shall keep a \n     record of polls; if the Chairman determines that the polled \n     matter is one of the areas enumerated in Rule II.3, the \n     record of the poll shall be confidential. Any Member may move \n     at the\n      Committee meeting following a poll for a vote on the polled \n     decision.\n\n\n                           iv. investigations\n\n       1.

Subpoenas. Subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses or \n     the production of memoranda, documents, records, or any other \n     materials shall be issued by the Chairman, or by any other \n     Member of the Committee designated by him. Prior to the \n     issuance of each subpoena, the Ranking Minority Member, and \n     any other Member so requesting, shall be notified regarding \n     the identity of the person to whom the subpoena will be \n     issued and the nature of the information sought, and its \n     relationship to the investigation.\n       3. Investigative Reports. All reports containing findings \n     or recommendations stemming from Committee investigations \n     shall be printed only with the approval of a majority of the \n     Members of the Committee.\n\n\n                              v. hearings\n\n       1.

Statement. Any witness desiring to make an introductory \n     statement shall file 50 copies of such statement with the \n     Chairman or clerk of the Committee 24 hours in advance of his \n     appearance, unless the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member \n     determine that there is good cause for a witness's failure to \n     do so. A witness shall be allowed no more than ten minutes to \n     orally summarize his prepared statement.\n       4. Counsel:\n       (a) A witness's counsel shall be permitted to be present \n     during his testimony at any public or closed hearing or \n     depositions or staff interview to advise such witness of his \n     rights, provided, however, that in the case of any witness \n     who is an officer or employee of the government, or of a \n     corporation or association, the Chairman may rule that \n     representation by counsel from the government, corporation, \n     or association creates a conflict of interest, and that the \n     witness shall be represented by personal counsel not from the \n     government, corporation, or association.\n       (b) A witness who is unable for economic reasons to obtain \n     counsel may inform the Committee at least 48 hours prior to \n     the witness's appearance, and it will endeavor to obtain \n     volunteer counsel for the witness. Such counsel shall be \n     subject solely to the control of the witness and not the \n     Committee. Failure to obtain counsel will not excuse the \n     witness from appearing and testifying.\n       5. Transcript. An accurate electronic or stenographic \n     record shall be kept of the testimony of all witnesses in \n     executive and public hearings. Any witness shall be afforded, \n     upon request, the right to review that portion of such \n     record, and for this purpose, a copy of a witness's testimony \n     in public or \n     [[Page S3295]] closed session shall be provided to the \n     witness. Upon inspecting his transcript, within a time limit \n     set by the committee clerk, a witness may request changes in \n     testimony to correct errors of transcription, grammatical \n     errors, and obvious errors of fact; the Chairman or a staff \n     officer designated by him shall rule on such request.\n       6. Impugned Persons. Any person who believes that evidence \n     presented, or comment made by a Member or staff, at a public \n     hearing or at a closed hearing concerning which there have \n     been public reports, tends to impugn his character or \n     adversely affect his reputation may:\n       (a) file a sworn statement of facts relevant to the \n     evidence or comment, which shall be placed in the hearing \n     record;\n       (b) request the opportunity to appear personally before the \n     Committee to testify in his own behalf; and\n       (c) submit questions in writing which he requests be used \n     for the cross-examination of other witnesses called by the \n     Committee. The Chairman shall inform the Committee of such \n     requests for appearance or cross-examination. If the \n     Committee so decides, the requested questions, or paraphrased \n     versions or portions of them, shall be put to the other \n     witness by a Member of by staff.\n       7. Minority Witnesses. Whenever any hearing is conducted by \n     the Committee, the minority on the Committee shall be \n     entitled, upon request made by a majority of the minority \n     Members to the Chairman, to call witnesses selected by the \n     minority to testify or produce documents with respect to the \n     measure or matter under consideration during at least one day \n     of the hearing. Such request must be made before the \n     completion of the hearing or, if subpoenas are required to \n     call the minority witnesses, no later than three days before \n     the completion of the hearing.\n       8. Conduct of Witnesses, Counsel and Members of the \n     Audience. If, during public or executive sessions, a witness, \n     his counsel, or any spectator conducts himself in such a \n     manner as to prevent, impede, disrupt, obstruct, or interfere \n     with the orderly administration of such hearing the Chairman \n     or presiding Member of the Committee present during such \n     hearing may request the Sergeant at Arms of the Senate, his \n     representative or any law enforcement official to eject said \n     person from the hearing room.\n\n\n                    vi. depositions and commissions\n\n       1. Notice. Notices for the taking of depositions in an \n     investigation authorized by the Committee shall be authorized \n     and issued by the Chairman or by a staff officer designated \n     by him. Such notices\n      shall specify a time and place for examination, and the name \n     of the staff officer or officers who will take the \n     deposition. Unless otherwise specified, the deposition \n     shall be in private. The Committee shall not initiate \n     procedures leading to criminal or civil enforcement \n     proceedings for a witness's failure to appear unless the \n     deposition notice was accompanied by a Committee subpoena.\n       2. Counsel. Witnesses may be accompanied at a deposition by \n     counsel to advise them of their rights, subject to the \n     provisions of Rule V.4.\n       3. Procedure. Witnesses shall be examined upon oath \n     administered by an individual authorized by local law to \n     administer oaths. Questions shall be propounded orally by \n     Committee staff. Objections by the witnesses as to the form \n     of questions shall be noted by the record. If a witness \n     objects to a question and refuses to testify on the basis of \n     relevance or privilege, the Committee staff may proceed with \n     the deposition, or may at that time or at a subsequent time, \n     seek a ruling by telephone or otherwise on the objection from \n     a Member of the Committee. If the Member overrules the \n     objection, he may refer the matter to the Committee or he may \n     order and direct the witness to answer the question, but the \n     Committee shall not initiate the procedures leading to civil \n     or criminal enforcement unless the witness refuses to testify \n     after he has been ordered and directed to answer by a Member \n     of the Committee.\n       4. Filing. The Committee staff shall see that the testimony \n     is transcribed or electronically recorded. If it is \n     transcribed, the witness shall be furnished with a copy for \n     review. No later than five days thereafter, the witness shall \n     return a signed copy, and the staff shall enter the changes, \n     if any, requested by the witness in accordance with Rule V.6. \n     If the witness fails to return a signed copy, the staff shall \n     note on the transcript the date a copy was provided and the \n     failure to return it. The individual administering the oath \n     shall certify on the transcript that the witness was duly \n     sworn in his presence, the transcriber shall certify that the \n     transcript is a true record to the testimony, and the \n     transcript shall then be filed with the Committee clerk. \n     Committee staff may stipulate with the witness to changes in \n     this procedure; deviations from the procedure which do not \n     substantially impair the reliability of the record shall not \n     relieve the witness from his obligation to testify \n     truthfully.\n       5. Commissions. The Committee may authorize the staff, by \n     issuance of commissions, to fill in prepared subpoenas, \n     conduct field hearings, inspect locations, facilities, or \n     systems of records, or otherwise act on behalf of the \n     Committee. Commissions shall be accompanied by instructions \n     from the Committee regulating their use.\n\n\n                           vii. subcommittees\n\n       1. Establishment. The Committee will operate as a Committee \n     of the Whole, reserving to itself the right to establish \n     temporary subcommittees at any time by majority vote. The \n     Chairman of the full Committee and the Ranking Minority \n     Member shall be ex-officio Members of all subcommittees.\n       2. Jurisdiction. Within its jurisdiction, as described in \n     the Standing Rules of the Senate, each subcommittee is \n     authorized to conduct investigations, including use of \n     subpoenas, depositions, and commissions.\n       3.

Additional meetings may be called \n     by the chairman as he deems necessary to expedite Committee \n     business. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 3, Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       B. Calling special Committee meetings. If at least three \n     members of the Committee desire the chairman to call a \n     special meeting, they may file in the offices of the \n     Committee a written request therefor, addressed to the \n     chairman. Immediately thereafter, the clerk of the Committee \n     shall notify the chairman of such request. If, within three \n     calendar days after the filing of such request, the chairman \n     fails to call the requested special meeting, which is to be \n     held within seven calendar days after the filing of such \n     request, a majority of the Committee members may file in the \n     offices of the Committee their written notice that a special \n     Committee meeting will be held, specifying the date and hour \n     thereof, and the Committee shall meet on that date and hour. \n     Immediately upon the filing of such notice, the Committee \n     clerk shall notify all Committee members that such special \n     meeting will be held and inform them of its date and hour. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 3, Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       C.

Five members of the \n     Committee shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of \n     routine business, provided that one member of the minority is \n     present.\n       For the purpose of this paragraph, the term ``routine \n     business'' includes the convening of a meeting and the \n     consideration of any business of the Committee other than \n     reporting to the Senate any measures, matters or \n     recommendations. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 7(a)(1), Standing Rules of \n     the Senate.)\n       C. Taking testimony.

Subject to the provisions of subsection \n     (E), no vote may be taken by the Committee, or any \n     Subcommittee thereof, on any measure or matter unless a \n     quorum, as prescribed in the preceding section, is actually \n     present.\n       B. Reporting measures and matters. No measure, matter or \n     recommendation shall be reported from the Committee unless a \n     majority of the Committee members are actually present, and \n     the vote of the Committee to report a measure or matter shall \n     require the concurrence of a majority of those members who \n     are actually present at the time the vote is taken. (Rule \n     XXVI, Sec. 7(a)(1) and (3), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       C. Proxy voting. Proxy voting shall be allowed on all \n     measures and matters before the Committee, or any \n     Subcommittee thereof, except that, when the Committee, or any \n     Subcommittee thereof, is voting to report a measure or \n     matter, proxy votes shall be allowed solely for the purposes \n     of recording a member's position on the pending question. \n     Proxy voting shall be allowed only if the absent Committee or \n     Subcommittee member has been informed of the matter on which \n     he is being recorded and has affirmatively requested that he \n     be so recorded. All proxies shall be filed with the chief \n     clerk of the Committee or Subcommittee thereof, as the case \n     may be. All proxies shall be in writing and shall contain \n     sufficient reference to the pending matter as is necessary to \n     identify it and to inform the Committee or Subcommittee as to \n     how the member establishes his vote to be recorded thereon. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 7(a)(3) and 7(c)(1), Standing Rules of the \n     Senate.)\n       D. Announcement of vote. (1) Whenever the Committee by roll \n     call vote reports any measure or matter, the report of the \n     Committee upon such a measure or matter shall include a \n     tabulation of the votes cast in favor of and the votes cast \n     in opposition to such measure or matter by each member of the \n     Committee.

If any member requests, any matter \n     to be polled shall be held for meeting rather than being \n     polled. The chief clerk of the Committee shall keep a record \n     of polls; if a majority of the members of the Committee \n     determine that the polled matter is in one of the areas \n     enumerated in subsection (D) of Rule 1, the record of the \n     poll shall be confidential. Any Committee member may move at \n     the Committee meeting following the poll for a vote on the \n     polled decision, such motion and vote to be subject to the \n     provisions of subsection (D) of Rule 1, where applicable.\n\n\n             rule 4. chairmanship of meetings and hearings\n\n       The chairman shall preside at all Committee meetings and \n     hearings except that he shall designate a temporary chairman \n     to act in his place if he is unable to be present at a \n     scheduled meeting or hearing. If the chairman (or his \n     designee) is absent ten minutes after the scheduled time set \n     for a meeting or hearing, the ranking majority member present \n     shall preside until the chairman's arrival. If there is no \n     member of the majority present, the ranking minority member \n     present, with the prior approval of the chairman, may open \n     and conduct the meeting or hearing until such time as a \n     member of the majority arrives.\n\n\n                rule 5. hearings and hearings procedures\n\n       A.

The Committee, or any \n     Subcommittee thereof, shall make public announcement of the \n     date, time and subject matter of any hearing to be conducted \n     on any measure or matter at least one week in advance of such \n     hearing,\n      unless the Committee, or Subcommittee, determines that there \n     is good cause to begin such hearing at an earlier date. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 4(a), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       B. Open hearings. Each hearing conducted by the Committee, \n     or any Subcommittee thereof, shall be open to the public, \n     except that a hearing or series of hearings on the same \n     subject for a period of no more than fourteen calendar days \n     may be closed to the public on a motion made and seconded to \n     go into closed session to discuss only whether the matters \n     enumerated in clauses (1) through (6) below would require the \n     hearing to be closed, followed immediately by a record vote \n     in open session by a majority of the Committee or \n     Subcommittee members when it is determined that the matters \n     to be discussed or the testimony to be taken at such hearing \n     or hearings--\n       (1) will disclose matters necessary to be kept secret in \n     the interests of national defense or the confidential conduct \n     of foreign relations of the United States;\n       [[Page S3297]] (2) will relate solely to matters of \n     Committee or Subcommittee staff personnel or internal staff \n     management or procedure;\n       (3) will tend to charge an individual with crime or \n     misconduct, to disgrace or injure the professional standing \n     of an individual, or otherwise expose an individual to public \n     contempt or obloquy or will represent a clearly unwarranted \n     invasion of the privacy of an individual;\n       (4) will disclose the identity of an informer or law \n     enforcement agent or will disclose any information relating \n     to the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense \n     that is required to be kept secret in the interests of \n     effective law enforcement;\n       (5) will disclose information relating to the trade secrets \n     of financial or commercial information pertaining \n     specifically to a given person if--\n       (A) an Act of Congress requires the information to be kept \n     confidential by Government officers and employees; or\n       (B) the information has been obtained by the Government on \n     a confidential basis, other than through an application by \n     such person for a specific Government financial or other \n     benefit, and is required to be kept secret in order to \n     prevent undue injury to the competitive position of such \n     person; or\n       (6) may divulge matters required to be kept confidential \n     under other provisions of law or Government regulations. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(b), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever disorder arises \n     during a Committee or Subcommittee meeting that is open to \n     the public, or any demonstration of approval or disapproval \n     is indulged in by any person in attendance at any such \n     meeting, it shall be the duty of the chairman to enforce \n     order on his own initiative and without any point of order \n     being made by a member of the Committee or Subcommittee; \n     provided, further, that when the chairman finds it necessary \n     to maintain order, he shall have the power to clear the room, \n     and the Committee or Subcommittee may act in closed session \n     for so long as there is doubt of the assurance of order. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(d), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       C. Full Committee subpoenas. The chairman, with the \n     approval of the ranking minority member of the Committee, is \n     authorized to subpoena the attendance of witnesses or the \n     production of memoranda, documents, records, or any other \n     materials at a hearing of deposition, provided that the \n     chairman may subpoena attendance or production without the \n     approval of the ranking minority member where the chairman or \n     a staff officer designated by him has not received \n     notification from the ranking minority member or a staff \n     officer designated by him of disapproval of the subpoena \n     within 72 hours, excluding Saturdays and Sundays, of being \n     notified of the subpoena. If a subpoena is disapproved by the \n     ranking minority member as provided in this subsection, the \n     subpoena may be authorized by vote of the members of the \n     Committee. When the Committee or chairman authorizes \n     subpoenas, subpoenas may be issued upon the signature of the \n     chairman or any other member of the Committee designated by \n     the chairman.\n       D. Witness counsel. Counsel retained by any witness and \n     accompanying such witness shall be permitted to be present \n     during the testimony of such witness at any public or \n     executive hearing or deposition to advise such witness while \n     he or she is testifying, of his or her legal rights; \n     provided, however, that in the case of any witness who is an \n     officer or employee of the government, or of a corporation or \n     association, the Committee chairman may rule that \n     representation by counsel from the government, corporation, \n     or association or by counsel representing other witnesses, \n     creates a conflict of interest, and that the witness may only \n     be represented during interrogation by staff or during \n     testimony before the Committee by personal counsel not from \n     the government, corporation, or association or by personal \n     counsel not representing other witnesses. This subsection \n     shall not be construed to excuse a witness from testifying in \n     the event his counsel is ejected for conducting himself in \n     such manner so as to prevent, impede, disrupt, obstruct or \n     interfere with the orderly administration of the hearings; \n     nor shall this subsection be construed as authorizing counsel \n     to coach the witness or answer for the witness. The failure \n     of any witness to secure counsel shall not excuse such \n     witness from complying with a subpoena or deposition notice.\n       E. Witness transcripts. An accurate electronic or \n     stenographic record shall be kept of the testimony of all \n     witnesses in executive and public hearings. the record of his \n     or her testimony whether in public or executive session shall \n     be made available for inspection by the witness or his or her \n     counsel under Committee supervision; a copy of any testimony \n     given in public session or that part of the testimony given \n     by the witness in executive session and subsequently quoted \n     or made part of the record in a public session shall be \n     provided to any witness at his or her expense if he or she so \n     requests. Upon inspecting his or her transcript, within a \n     time limit set by the chief clerk of the Committee, a witness \n     may request changes in the transcript to correct errors of \n     transcription and grammatical errors; the chairman or a staff \n     officer designated by him shall rule on such requests.\n       F. Impugned persons. Any person whose name is mentioned or \n     is specifically identified, and who believes that evidence \n     presented, or comment made by a member of the Committee or \n     staff officer, at a public hearing or at a closed hearing \n     concerning which there have been public reports, tends to \n     impugn his or her character of adversely affect his or her \n     reputation may:\n       (a) file a sworn statement of facts relevant to the \n     evidence or comment, which statement shall be considered for \n     placement in the placement in the hearing record by the \n     Committee;\n       (b) request the opportunity to appear personally before the \n     Committee to testify in his or her own behalf, which request \n     shall be considered by the Committee; and\n       (c) submit questions in writing which he or she requests be \n     used for the cross-examination of other witnesses called by \n     the Committee, which questions shall be considered for use by \n     the Committee.\n       G. Radio, television, and photography. The Committee, or \n     any Subcommittee thereof, may permit the proceedings of \n     hearings which are open to the public to be photographed and \n     broadcast by radio, television or both, subject to such \n     conditions as the Committee, or Subcommittee, may impose. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec.5(c), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       H. Advance statements of witnesses. A witness appearing \n     before the Committee, or any Subcommittee thereof, shall \n     provide 100 copies of a written statement and an executive \n     summary or synopsis of his proposed testimony at least 48 \n     hours prior to his appearance. This requirement may be waived \n     by the chairman and the ranking minority member following \n     their determination that there is good cause for failure of \n     compliance. (Rule XXVI, Sec.4(b), Standing Rules of the \n     Senate.)\n       I. Minority witnesses. In any hearings conducted by the \n     Committee, or any Subcommittee thereof, the minority members \n     of the Committee or Subcommitee shall be entitled, upon \n     request to the chairman by a majority of the minority \n     members, to call witnesses of their selection during at least \n     one day of such hearings. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 4(d), Standing \n     Rules of the Senate.)\n       J. Full Committee depositions. Depositions may be taken \n     prior to or after a hearing as provided in this subsection.\n       (1) Notices for the taking of depositions shall be \n     authorized and issued by the chairman, with the approval of \n     the ranking minority member of the Committee, provided that \n     the chairman may initiate depositions without the approval of \n     the ranking minority member where the chairman or a staff \n     officer designated by him has not received notification from \n     the ranking minority member or a staff officer designated by \n     him of disapproval of the deposition within 72 hours, \n     excluding Saturdays and Sundays, of being notified of the \n     deposition notice. If a deposition notice is disapproved by \n     the ranking minority member as provided in this subsection, \n     the deposition notice may be authorized by a vote of the \n     members of the Committee. Committee deposition notices shall \n     specify a time and place for examination, and the name of the \n     Committee member or members or staff officer or officers who \n     will take the deposition. Unless otherwise specified, the \n     deposition shall be in private. The Committee shall not \n     initiate procedures leading to criminal or civil enforcement \n     proceedings for a witness' failure to appear or produce \n     unless the deposition notice was accompanied by a Committee \n     subpoena.\n       (2) Witnesses may be accompanied at a deposition by counsel \n     to advise them of their legal rights, subject to the \n     provisions of Rule 5D.\n       (3) Oaths at depositions may be administered by an \n     individual authorized by local law to administer oaths. \n     Questions shall be propounded orally by Committee member or \n     members or staff. If a witness objects to a question and \n     refuses to testify, the objection shall be noted for the \n     record and the Committee member or members or staff may \n     proceed with the remainder of the deposition.\n       (4) The Committee shall see that the testimony is \n     transcribed or electronically recorded (which may include \n     audio or audio/video recordings). If it is transcribed, the \n     transcript shall be made available for inspection by the \n     witness or his or her counsel under Committee supervision. \n     The witness shall sign a copy of the transcript and may \n     request changes to it, which shall be handled in accordance \n     with the procedure set forth in subsection (E). If the \n     witness fails to sign a copy, the staff shall note that fact \n     on the transcript. The individual administering the oath \n     shall certify on the transcript that the witness was duly \n     sworn in his presence, the transcriber shall certify that the \n     transcript is a true record of\n      the testimony, and the transcript shall then be filed with \n     the chief clerk of the Committee. The chairman or a staff \n     officer designated by him may stipulate with the witness \n     to changes in the procedure; deviations from this \n     procedure which do not substantially impair the \n     reliability of the record shall not relieve the witness \n     from his or her obligation to testify truthfully.\n\n\n                 rule 6. committee reporting procedures\n\n       A. Timely filing. When the Committee has ordered a measure \n     or matter reported, following final action the report thereon \n     shall be filed in the Senate at the earliest practicable \n     time. (Rule XXVI, Sec.10(b), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       B. Supplemental, minority, and additional views. A member \n     of the Committee who gives notice of his intention to file \n     supplemental, minority or additional views at the time of \n     final Committee approval of a measure or matter, shall be \n     entitled to not less \n     [[Page S3298]] than three calendar days in which to file such \n     views, in writing, with the chief clerk of the Committee. \n     Such views shall then be included in the Committee report and \n     printed in the same volume, as a part thereof, and their \n     inclusion shall be noted on the cover of the report. In the \n     absence of timely notice, the Committee report may be filed \n     and printed immediately without such views. (Rule XXVI, Sec. \n     10(c), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       C. Notice by Subcommittee chairmen. The chairman of each \n     Subcommittee shall notify the chairman in writing whenever \n     any measure has been ordered reported by such Subcommittee \n     and is ready for consideration by the full Committee.\n       d. Draft reports of Subcommittees. All draft reports \n     prepared by Subcommittees of this Committee on any measure or \n     matter referred to it by the chairman, shall be in the form, \n     style, and arrangement required to conform to the applicable \n     provisions of the Standing Rules of the Senate, and shall be \n     in accordance with the established practices followed by the \n     Committee. Upon completion of such draft reports, copies \n     thereof shall be filed with the chief clerk of the Committee \n     at the earliest practicable time.\n       E. Impact statements in reports. All Committee reports, \n     accompanying a bill or joint resolution of a public character \n     reported by the Committee, shall contain (a) an estimate, \n     made by the Committee, of the costs which would be incurred \n     in carrying out the legislation for the then current fiscal \n     year and for each of the next five years thereafter (or for \n     the authorized duration of the proposed legislation, if less \n     than five years); and (2) a comparison of such cost estimates \n     with any made by a Federal agency; or (3) in lieu of such \n     estimate or comparison, or both, a statement of the reasons \n     for failure by the Committee to comply with these \n     requirements as impracticable, in the event of inability\n      to comply therewith. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 11(a), Standing Rules \n     of the Senate.)\n       Each such report shall also contain an evaluation, made by \n     the Committee, of the regulatory impact which would be \n     incurred in carrying out the bill or joint resolution. The \n     evaluation shall include (a) an estimate of the numbers of \n     individuals and businesses who would be regulated and a \n     determination of the groups and classes of such individuals \n     and businesses, (b) a determination of the economic impact of \n     such regulation on the individuals, consumers, and businesses \n     affected, (c) a determination of the impact on the personal \n     privacy of the individuals affected, and (d) a determination \n     of the amount of paperwork that will result from the \n     regulations to be promulgated pursuant to the bill or joint \n     resolution, which determination may include, but need not be \n     limited to, estimates of the amount of time and financial \n     costs required of affected parties, showing whether the \n     effects of the bill or joint resolution could be substantial, \n     as well as reasonable estimates of the recordkeeping \n     requirements that may be associated with the bill or joint \n     resolution. Or, in lieu of the forgoing evaluation, the \n     report shall include a statement of the reasons for failure \n     by the Committee to comply with these requirements as \n     impracticable, in the event of inability to comply therewith. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 11(b), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n\n\n           rule 7. Subcommittees and subcommittee procedures\n\n       A. Regularly established Subcommittees. The Committee shall \n     have three regularly established Subcommittees. The \n     Subcommittees are as follows:\n       Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.\n       Oversight of Government Management and the District of \n     Columbia.\n       Post Office and Civil Service.\n       B. Ad hoc Subcommittees. Following consultation with the \n     ranking minority member, the chairman shall, from time to \n     time, establish such ad hoc Subcommittees as he deems \n     necessary to expedite Committee business.\n       C. Subcommittee membership. Following consultation with the \n     majority members, and the ranking minority member of the \n     Committee, the chairman shall announce selections for \n     membership on the Subcommittees referred to in paragraphs A \n     and B, above.\n       D. Subcommittee meetings and hearings. Each Subcommittee of \n     this Committee is authorized to establish meeting dates and \n     adopt rules not inconsistent with the rules of the Committee \n     except as provided in Rules 2(D) and 7(E).\n       E. Subcommittee subpoenas. Each Subcommittee is authorized \n     to adopt rules concerning subpoenas which need not be \n     consistent with the rules of the Committee; provided, \n     however, that in the event the Subcommittee authorizes the \n     issuance of a subpoena pursuant to its own rules, a written \n     notice of intent to issue the subpoena shall be provided to \n     the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee, or \n     staff officers designated by them, by the Subcommittee \n     chairman or a staff officer designated by him immediately \n     upon such authorization, and no subpoena shall be issued for \n     at least 48 hours, excluding Saturdays and Sundays, from \n     delivery to the appropriate offices, unless the chairman and \n     ranking minority member waive the 48 hour waiting period or \n     unless the Subcommittee chairman certifies in writing to the \n     chairman and ranking minority member that, in his opinion, it \n     is necessary to issue a subpoena immediately.\n       F. Subcommittee budgets. Each Subcommittee of the \n     Committee, which requires authorization for the expenditure \n     of funds for the conduct of inquiries and investigations, \n     shall file with the chief clerk of the Committee, not later \n     than January 10 of the first year of each new Congress, its \n     request for funds for the two (2) 12-month periods beginning \n     on March 1 and extending through and including the last day \n     of February of the two following years, which years comprise \n     that Congress. Each such request shall be submitted on the \n     budget form prescribed by the Committee on Rules and \n     Administration, and shall be accompanied by a written \n     justification addressed to the chairman of the Committee, \n     which shall include (1) a statement of the Subcommittee's \n     area of activities, (2) its accomplishments during the \n     preceding Congress detailed year by year, and (3) a table \n     showing a comparison between (a) the funds authorized for \n     expenditure during the preceding Congress detailed year by \n     year, (b) the funds actually expended during that Congress \n     detailed year by year, (c) the amount requested for each year \n     of the Congress, and (d) the number of professional and \n     clerical staff members and consultants employed by the \n     Subcommittee during the preceding Congress detailed year by \n     year and the number of such personnel requested for each year \n     of the Congress. The chairman may request additional reports \n     from the Subcommittees regarding their activities and budgets \n     at any time during a Congress. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 9, Standing \n     Rules of the Senate.)\n\n\n             RULE 8. CONFIRMATION STANDARDS AND PROCEDURES\n\n       A. Standards. In considering a nomination, the Committee \n     shall inquire into the nominee's experience, qualifications, \n     suitability, and integrity to serve in the position to which \n     he or she has been nominated. The Committee shall recommend \n     confirmation, upon finding that the nominee has the necessary \n     integrity and is affirmatively qualified by reason of \n     training, education, or experience to carry out the functions \n     of the office to which he or she was nominated.\n       B. Information Concerning the Nominee. Each nominee shall \n     submit the following information to the Committee:\n       (1) A detailed biographical resume which contains \n     information relating to education, employment and \n     achievements;\n       (2) Financial information, including a financial statement \n     which lists assets and liabilities of the nominee and tax \n     returns for the 3 years preceding the time of his or her \n     nomination, and copies of other relevant documents requested \n     by the Committee, such as a proposed blind trust agreement, \n     necessary for the Committee's consideration; and,\n       (3) Copies of other relevant documents the Committee may \n     request, such as responses to questions concerning the \n     policies and programs the nominee intends to pursue upon \n     taking office.\n       At the request of the chairman or the ranking minority \n     member, a nominee shall be required to submit a certified \n     financial statement compiled by an independent auditor.\n       Information received pursuant to this subsection shall be \n     made available for public inspection; provided, however, that \n     tax returns shall, after review by persons designated in \n     subsection (C) of this rule, be placed under seal to ensure \n     confidentiality.\n       C. Procedures for Committee inquiry. The Committee shall \n     conduct an inquiry into the experience, qualifications, \n     suitability, and integrity of nominees, and shall give \n     particular attention to the following matters:\n       (1) A review of the biographical information provided by \n     the nominee, including, but not limited to, any professional \n     activities related to the duties of the office to which he or \n     she is nominated;\n       (2) A review of the financial information provided by the \n     nominee, including tax returns for the three years preceding \n     the time of his or her nomination;\n       (3) A review of any actions, taken or proposed by the \n     nominee, to remedy conflicts of interest; and\n       (4) A review of any personal or legal matter which may bear \n     upon the nominee's qualifications for the office to which he \n     or she is nominated.\n       For the purpose of assisting the Committee in the conduct \n     of this inquiry, a majority investigator or investigators \n     shall be designated by the chairman and a minority \n     investigator or investigators shall be designated by the \n     ranking minority member.\n      The chairman, ranking minority member, other members of the \n     Committee and designated investigators shall have access \n     to all investigative reports on nominees prepared by any \n     Federal agency, except that only the chairman, the ranking \n     minority member, or other members of the Committee, upon \n     request, shall have access to the report of the Federal \n     Bureau of Investigation. The Committee may request the \n     assistance of the General Accounting Office and any other \n     such expert opinion as may be necessary in conducting its \n     review of information provided by nominees.\n       D. Report on the Nominee. After a review of all information \n     pertinent to the nomination, a confidential report on the \n     nominee shall be made by the designated investigators to the \n     chairman and the ranking minority member and, upon request, \n     to any other member of the Committee. The report shall \n     [[Page S3299]]  summarize the steps taken by the Committee \n     during its investigation of the nominee and identify any \n     unresolved or questionable matters that have been raised \n     during the course of the inquiry.\n       E. Hearings. The Committee shall conduct a public hearing \n     during which the nominee shall be called to testify under \n     oath on all matters relating to his or her suitability for \n     office, including the policies and programs which he or she \n     will pursue while in that position. No hearing shall be held \n     until at least 72 hours after the following events have \n     occurred: the nominee has responded to pre-hearing questions \n     submitted by the Committee; and the report required by \n     subsection (D) has been made to the chairman and ranking \n     minority member, and is available to other members of the \n     Committee, upon request.\n       F. Action on confirmation. A mark-up on a nomination shall \n     not occur on the same day that the hearing on the nominee is \n     held. In order to assist the Committee in reaching a \n     recommendation on confirmation, the staff may make an oral \n     presentation to the Committee at the mark-up, factually \n     summarizing the nominee's background and the steps taken \n     during the pre-hearing inquiry.\n       G. Application. The procedures contained in subsections \n     (C), (D), (E), and (F) of this rule shall apply to persons \n     nominated by the President to positions requiring their full-\n     time service. At the discretion of the chairman and ranking \n     minority member, those procedures may apply to persons \n     nominated by the President to serve on a part-time basis.\n\n\n          rule 9. personnel actions affecting committee staff\n\n       In accordance with Rule XLII of the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate and the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (P.L. \n     104-1), all personnel actions affecting the staff of the \n     Committee shall be made free from any discrimination based on \n     race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, state of \n     physical handicap, or disability.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/28/senate-section/article/S3295-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3299-S3304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           ORDER OF BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, my vote on the motion to table amendment \nNo. 253 should have been ``no.'' I was mistaken on the sequence of the \namendments before us today. I believe that a simple majority, as now \nprovided in the Constitution, is appropriate for decisions to increase \nrevenues. I do not believe that we--or future generations--should be \nconstrained in the options available to keep the budget in balance.\n  (Ms. SNOWE assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nUtah has 15 minutes.\n  The Senator from Idaho is recognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, thank you. Let me thank the Senator from \nUtah for yielding. There are so many people that I would like to thank \nthis evening who have been direct participants in what I believe to \nhave been one of the most important debates that the Senate of the \nUnited States has engaged in--at least in my tenure and in the tenure \nof many of our Senators.\n  I certainly would like to thank the Senator from Utah for his \nleadership on this issue and a good many others who have been directly \nresponsible for bringing this most important issue and statement to the \nfloor. I also thank the Senator from Illinois, Paul Simon, for his \nstalwart leadership in pursuit of the fiscal responsibility that most \nof us aspire to, which the Constitutional amendment would allow.\n  But tonight, let me talk to my colleagues here in the Chamber, for I \nbelieve we suffer the wrong idea. Somehow tonight, those who plan to \nvote against this amendment believe that their vote against it is like \nthe passage of the vote for or against a bill that oftentimes comes to \nthe floor. It is not that kind of vote.\n  Article V of our Constitution--the very organic document that we \nattempt to offer out an amendment to tonight--says this very clearly: \n``The Congress, whenever two-thirds of both Houses shall deem it \nnecessary, shall propose an amendment.''\n  So tonight we are not voting on an amendment to pass it or to fail \nit. We are voting on an amendment to propose it to the citizens of this \ncountry, to allow them to decide what the organic law of this land will \nbe about.\n  And anyone who suggests tonight that they will stand in opposition to \nthis amendment stands in opposition to the right of the people of their \nState to say, ``Yes, we support it,'' or ``No, we don't.'' And that is \nthe fundamental issue.\n  So I ask you to search your soul tonight and decide whether you, as a \nSenator of the U.S. Senate, are going to stand in the way of the \ncitizens of your State, if you know better than they, if you really \nhave a better vision than the average citizen of this country that \nsupports you and elects you and sends you to this Congress to represent \ntheir interest.\n  But in this instance, you are not allowed to do that. You are not \nallowed to say, ``I know better.'' What you can say is, ``I propose.''\n  Let us allow tonight the right of the citizens to decide. The \nConstitution is a basic document. It protects the people's right. \nTonight we want to protect the people's right against an overburdening \ndebt structure that has denied this country the kind of economic \nfreedom that all Americans are entitled to.\n  I ask all of you to join with us tonight in proposing to the citizens \nof this great Nation a constitutional amendment for their decision.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to my distinguished \ncolleague and prime cosponsor of this amendment, the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Madam President, and my colleagues, first, let me pay \ntribute to Senator Byrd, who is a very worthy foe and certainly one of \nthe most distinguished Members of this body.\n  I also appreciate the leadership of Senator Hatch on this, Senator \nCraig, and my colleagues on this side, Senator Heflin, Senator Robb, \nSenator Moseley-Braun, Senator Exon, Senator Campbell, and I should be \nmentioning others.\n  If we had a proposal in here that said, two decades after we balance \na budget, we are going to have an average increase in income of every \nAmerican of 36 percent, we would vote for it overwhelmingly. And yet \nthat is precisely what the General Accounting Office says will happen \nif we balance the budget in this country.\n  Data Resources, Inc., one of the two top econometric forecasters in \nthis country, says if we balance the budget, the prime rate will go \ndown 2.5 percent and we will have an increase in national income of 2 \npercent. CBO says at least 1 percent growth in income. The Wharton \nSchool in Philadelphia says the prime rate will go down 4 percent. We \nhave an opportunity to do these things that can help our economy \nimmensely. And I hope we do not muff that opportunity.\n  I heard a reference from Senator Byrd to history. It is important to \nremember that Thomas Jefferson, in 1787, said, ``If I could add one \namendment to the Constitution, it would be to prohibit the Federal \nGovernment from borrowing.''\n  And remember the rallying cry of the American Revolution--taxation \nwithout representation.\n  What are we doing to our grandchildren and generations to come? If \nthat is not taxation without representation, nothing is.\n  And talk about history, I have not heard one opponent talk about \neconomic history here. I have not read one editorial talking about \neconomic history. The reality is the history of nations is that when \nthey pile up debt and they get around 9, 10 or 11 percent of deficit \nversus national income, they start monetizing the debt. They start the \nprinting presses rolling.\n  CBO says we are headed for 18 percent. We can take a chance that we \nwill be the first nation in history to go up 18 percent without \nmonetizing the debt, but we are taking a huge, huge gamble.\n  The Declaration of Independence. We are making, every year as we add \nto the deficit, a declaration of dependence. We now owe roughly $800 \nbillion in our bonds to other countries. If the Simon family gets too \ndeeply into debt, we start losing our independence; and if a nation \ndoes, it starts losing its independence.\n  Senator Dodd and I are old enough to remember 1956, when three nation \nfriends of ours--Israel, France, and Great Britain--went in and seized \nthe Suez Canal, which President Nasser had taken. They did it because \nthey were our friends; thought they could get by with it, and it was \njust before an \n[[Page S3300]] election. President Eisenhower said, ``This is wrong.''\n  But something else happened we did not know about, or most of us did \nnot know about until sometime later. The United States threatened to \ndump the British pound sterling. And without firing a shot, the troops \nof Great Britain, France, and Israel withdrew.\n  We are in that situation.\n  Talk about American foreign aid. We now spend twice as much in \nforeign aid to the wealthy through interest and bonds than we do in \nforeign economic assistance to poor people. This year, the current \nestimate is $339 billion on interest, 11 times as much on interest as \neducation, twice as much on interest as all our poverty programs \ncombined, 22 times as much on interest as foreign economic assistance. \nIt gets worse each year, and it will continue to get worse unless we \npass this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SIMON. I ask unanimous consent for 30 more seconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield 30 seconds to the Senator.\n  Mr. SIMON. I would simply point out, is there going to be pain if we \npass this? Yes. But it is very interesting, there were polls by the \nWirthlin Group which showed 76 percent of the population favors this, \nand 53 percent said they favor it, but they also believe it is going to \ncause them pain.\n  The American people are yearning for leadership. Tonight, my friends \nin the Senate, let us give it to them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the \ndistinguished Budget Committee chairman, Senator Domenici.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the distinguished chairman, Senator Hatch, for \nyielding me 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Madam President, fellow Senators, this is a historic night. We have \nnever been so close to putting our Nation's fiscal house in order as we \nwill be in 40 minutes. It is on our shoulders, but I can tell you that \nour children and grandchildren, whether they are present, whether they \nare listening, whether they are capable of listening or they are too \nsmall, they will either thank us tonight for doing something for them \nor they will wonder where we were when they needed us most.\n  The truth of the matter is there are many risks, but the status quo \nwill not work. For those who come to the floor and raise the risks of a \nbalanced budget, the risks of this amendment, they should be asked what \nare the risks of doing nothing. I am convinced that the status quo, \nwith reference to fiscal policy for our Nation, means that the legacy \nfor our children is very close to zero.\n  I want to close by quoting Laurence Tribe, a very liberal \nconstitutional scholar. He was testifying on the balanced budget. I \nasked him whether or not it made sense to do something like this. And \nlisten carefully to what he said:\n\n       Given the centrality in our revolutionary origins of the \n     precept that there should be no taxation without \n     representation, it seems especially fitting in principle that \n     we seek somehow to tie our hands so we cannot spend our \n     children's legacy.\n\n  That is the issue. Do we spend our children's legacy or do we leave a \nlegacy to them? Plain and simple. That is the issue.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished \nSenator from Nebraska, the ranking member of the Budget Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nNebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank my friend and colleague, the manager of the bill.\n  Let me be brief. I just want to say that I have listened to what \nSenator Simon just said about the debt that continues to consume \nAmerica. Even if we pass this in the next half-hour--which I hope and \nurge we do--we are still at least 8 years away from beginning to cut \ndown the national debt. That shows how far we are behind the curve.\n  I just wish to say, Madam President, that it has been a real \nexperience in working with the many people on both sides of the aisle. \nI hope we have the 67 votes in the next few minutes when we cast this \nhistoric vote. I think this amendment must be approved.\n  I yield back the remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no remaining time.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, as a Member of the Senate, I have had the \ngreat honor of voting on many historic bills, but few in the history of \nthe Senate are as significant as this one. It is so rare that we have a \nvote that so dramatically and directly affects the future of our \nchildren and our grandchildren. This vote is clearly a vote for future \ngenerations.\n  This vote is especially significant because of who it will help and \nwho it will hurt. It will help our children and our grandchildren. By \nremoving the onerous burden of debt that we have been accumulating on \ntheir shoulders, we are helping to level the generational playing \nfield. It will restore the American dream for another generation of \nAmericans.\n  Who does this vote hurt if we prevail? For starters, the politics-as-\nusual crowd, the special interest groups, and those with vested \ninterests in the status quo, all those groups who keep feeding at the \ntrough and who think the gravy train will never run out of gas.\n  The balanced budget amendment means no more pork for the special \ninterests. And while I am at it, I want to give the special interests \nand those with vested interests in the status quo one piece of advice: \nPack your bags and hit the road. The show is over.\n  Do Members know who else is hurt by the balanced budget amendment? \nYou may find this hard to believe--everyone in this Chamber. Gone are \nthe days when politicians can take the easy way out. Gone are the days \nwhen politicians can say ``Pass it; we will worry about how to pay for \nit later.'' We can no longer pass anything that we cannot come up with \nthe money for. It is called accountability, and it starts right here, \nright now.\n  That is why I am so proud to have been a part of this debate. And \nwhen I see my grandchildren I can look them in the eye and tell them \nthat today marks a new beginning in their lives. I can smile, knowing \nthat when it comes time for them to go to college, to train for a \ncareer, to buy a house, to raise a family, they will be able to do so. \nThe American dream will live on for another generation.\n  To the President of the United States, I have a caution for him: Mr. \nPresident, you have joined forces with the special interests. Let me \nask you one simple question. How can you look your daughter, Chelsea, \nin the eye after what you are trying to do here? How can you justify \nthe trillions of dollars of red ink that you and others who are voting \nagainst this have subjected the children of America to?\n  Madam President, over the next several months, we will be working \nlate into the evening, examining every single line of the Federal \nbudget, searching for waste, fraud and abuse, cutting programs that \nhave outlived their usefulness, and finding the money for those that \nstill work. It will all be worth it. For our grandchildren, it is worth \nit.\n  Madam President, I want to thank everybody who has participated. I \nwant to pay tribute to the distinguished Senator from West Virginia for \nthe dignified manner in which he has conducted his opposition to this \namendment. I want to pay great tribute to my friend from Illinois, \nSenator Simon, and to my friend from Idaho, Senator Craig, and all the \nothers who have worked so hard on this floor, especially those 11 \nbrandnew Senators. They have made a real difference here. They have \nshown Members that this is the new way.\n  Adopting this amendment is what we have to do. We have to do so to \nhave a future for our children and grandchildren. We can no longer \nafford to spend this country into bankruptcy. I want to thank all of \nthe loyal and dedicated staff people and those who have worked so hard \nduring this debate and in preparation for it.\n   [[Page S3301]] And above all, I thank all those who will vote for \nthis amendment this evening. I urge my colleagues to vote for it. It is \none of the most important votes we will ever cast. Our national life \ndepends upon it. The salvation of this country depends on it. And the \nfuture of our children depends on it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair now recognizes the Democratic \nleader, who has the next 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, this has been a good debate. It has \nbeen a long and historic debate. But it has not been a debate about a \nbalanced budget.\n  No one supports the current debt or deficit. Every Senator believes, \nas I believe, that deficit spending must end. We heard the figures. We \nhave debated how we got to this point. We have noted all of our efforts \nso far. I have not heard anyone argue for doing nothing. The debate has \nbeen about how we achieve what we all say we want, and over what time \nperiod, and whether or not to accomplish what we say we all want, we \namend the Constitution for the 28th time.\n  During this debate, we have heard many who have argued eloquently \nthat there is no purpose in amending the Constitution for this reason. \nOur colleague, the senior Senator from New York, emphasizes over and \nover again that while 1 machine can do the work of 100 men and women, \nno machine can replace the need to take fundamental responsibility.\n  No provision in the Constitution can create a formula for automatic \ndeficit reduction. Nothing we do here will embolden Senators to make \ndecisions which we are otherwise unable to make for ourselves.\n  This debate has also underscored the role the Federal Government \nplays within our economy. No one can deny that fiscal policy has \nmoderated the extraordinary consequences of a deep recession.\n  This countercyclical strategy employed since World War II has had \nprofoundly positive consequences for the economy during our lifetimes. \nWe have seen them. We have seen the charts. We have seen all of the \narguments made on the other side, and nothing will dissuade me that the \nfiscal policy initiated since World War II has had the desired result.\n  Many who will vote no today will do so out of legitimate fear that \nour ability to counter economic downturns will be severely \njeopardized--severely jeopardized--with the passage of this amendment.\n  There are also many who believe that fiscal policy should never be \nwritten into the Constitution because it does not belong there. They \nhave argued that, like the thousands of other amendments proposed in \n200 years, this, too, should be defeated.\n  Many Members have listened to the logic of many of these arguments \nand appreciate each and every one. Many Members have also decided that \nthe time has come for a balanced budget amendment--that the question of \na constitutional amendment is before Members for a good reason.\n  But we also question the wisdom of the amendment that is now \npresented to the Senate, and we are deeply troubled by the attitude of \nmany of our Republican colleagues that we take this amendment or there \nwill be no amendment at all. We are troubled, really, for three \nreasons: First, it is our belief that this ought to be our very best \neffort. We cannot come back later as we can with statutes. We cannot \ncome back later and say, if we could only change that phrase or that \nparagraph or even that word. That is not something we can do with the \nConstitution. We will have to admit that we made mistakes in drafting, \nand, if we have, we will have to live with them for all time. This is \ngoing to be with us a long, long time. Even the prohibition amendment \nwas with us for 13 years, long after we came to the conclusion that it, \ntoo, was a mistake.\n  Second, this debate has been politicized, unfortunately. The RNC has \nused this debate as a membership drive. In fact, in my State of South \nDakota, they are interrupting ads with programs, there are so many \nthese days. The practical ramifications of this amendment, as well, as \ncurrently drafted, are profound, and we ought to realize that. We ought \nto understand the ramifications of this particular language, regardless \nof how we view the constitutional amendment itself. Let Members look at \nthis language. Let Members examine this draft, and let each and every \none ask, are we prepared, tonight, to put it into the United States \nConstitution?\n  This amendment could pass by 70 votes, yet it will fail perhaps by \ntwo tonight. Why? Not because two-thirds of a majority opposes the \nconcept of a balanced budget amendment--I am sure that two-thirds and \nmore support it--but because some of us have a grave concern about the \nspecific draft our Republican colleagues tonight insist upon, a draft \nwhich is filled with promise but devoid of details.\n  That was the reason I offered, many weeks ago, the Right to Know \namendment requiring that we spell out the details, insisting that we \nknow how we get from here to there, recognizing the importance of a \nblueprint, of a glidepath, knowing that, as you cannot build a house \nwithout a blueprint, you cannot balance the budget without one, either.\n  Today the chairman of the Finance Committee indicated that Medicare \nand Medicaid may be cut by $400 billion over the course of the next \nseveral years. This is a detail that happens to be very important, that \nwe recognize may be part of the mix. If we are not willing to spell it \nout, if we are not willing to put on paper the details, then, indeed, I \nthink we are asking for a pig in the poke, and we are asking for it in \nthe U.S. Constitution.\n  The Republicans promise, even though they are unwilling to spell it \nout, to leave Social Security untouched. But while they argue we need \nto put a balanced budget requirement into the Constitution for purposes \nof certainty, they are unwilling to do so for Social Security. Without \nthe promise in writing, we cannot require future Congresses to comply \nwith our expectations.\n  I will predict tonight, if this amendment passes, that the Social \nSecurity trust fund will be used, and that is wrong. The American \npeople oppose it. We have made a commitment to them now for over 60 \nyears. We compound the deficit reduction problem, and we mask the size \nof the deficit, but we invite the cynicism of the American people all \nover again. If we are prepared to reduce the deficit using Social \nSecurity trust funds, what confidence should they have in us with any \nfuture decision, after we have made the commitment that has stood for \nthis long?\n  In my view, the amendment is also especially lacking when it comes to \nenforcement and the role of the courts. Something this important should \nnot be unresolved. In spite of the best efforts of the senior Senator \nfrom Georgia, as written, it is very likely we will see a \nconstitutional crisis as Congress and the courts face off on the very \nquestion of jurisdiction in the years ahead.\n  It is also unfortunate that the Federal Government cannot be allowed \nto function budgetarily like virtually everyone else does. We should \nnot treat investment and operating costs alike, and yet that is exactly \nwhat we will require as a result of the actions taken in this body now \nfor the last several weeks.\n  No one does that at any level of Government, no one does that in \nbusiness, no one does that in their family budgeting. We should not do \nit either. And yet tonight, by the action taken on this amendment, we \nwill be, if indeed the amendment passes, requiring the Federal \nGovernment to do something no one else does.\n  Madam President, the bottom line, regardless of whether we are \ntalking about Social Security, a capital budget, the right to know, \nenforcement, or any one of a number of the issues that we have raised \nfor the last several weeks, the bottom line is this: We can do better. \nThis is not the best we can do. This is a shoot-now-ask-later approach, \nand we will regret it. That could destroy the very fabric upon which \nthis Nation was built. And I hope--I just hope--that we all come to the \nrealization of what the stakes are as we cast our vote tonight. It is, \nas others have said, one of the most critical votes we will cast, a \nvote which could change not only the budget but the economy and the \nperception of the very Constitution itself. Let us take care to do it \nright. Let us defeat this amendment and go back to the drawing \n[[Page S3302]] board before it is too late. Future generations are \ncounting upon us tonight to do just that.\n  I retain the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished Senate \nmajority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, do I understand the Democratic leader \nretains the remainder of his time? Are there additional requests?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I was anticipating others who may ask \nfor time, but if there is no other request for time, I yield it back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator yielding back?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate majority leader is recognized for \n15 minutes.\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, the Senator from South Dakota asked \nearlier for 1 minute, which I am prepared to allow.\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, for those who follow this debate, we have \nhad 19 days of consideration. We have had 115 hours 54 minutes of \ndebate. That does not include votes or quorum calls or morning \nbusiness, where a lot of the morning business was directed at the \nbalanced budget amendment. So we have had a lot of debate. I just say \nthat for the Record for some who think maybe we have not been on this \nlong enough.\n  My view is we are down to about one vote--one vote. Maybe it is 68; \nmaybe it is 66. I think we do stand at the crossroads in American \nhistory. I think this vote is one of the most important many of us will \nhave cast in decades because now we have an opportunity to do it, and \nwe have not had that opportunity before. In fact, this may be the \nsingle most important vote we cast in our careers.\n  I will say at the outset, and I think the figures I quoted indicate, \nwe do not take amending the Constitution lightly. This certainly has \nbeen considered at length. Everybody has had an opportunity to say just \nabout everything they wanted to say. I think we also must understand \nthat there was never a more serious time when Washington needed the \ndiscipline, when Congress needed the discipline, that the Constitution \nand only the Constitution can impose.\n  We heard a lot of talk about laws that were passed, and we passed \nsince 1969--the last time we passed a balanced Federal budget--we \npassed seven different laws containing balanced budget requirements. \nAnd despite all the speeches and the good intentions and everything \nelse that went with it over the past quarter of a century, the Federal \ndebt has grown each year and every year.\n  Why is it so important to balance the budget? There are probably a \nlot of reasons that have been stated on this floor from people who \noppose and people who support the balanced budget amendment. Oh, it is \nimportant to balance the budget and maybe it is even important to vote \nfor the balanced budget amendment if you are in a tough race for \nreelection. But in 1969, the American taxpayers paid $12.7 billion for \ninterest on the national debt. This year interest on the national debt \nwill devour a staggering $234 billion, more than all the Government \nspent on agriculture, crime, crime fighting, veterans, space and \ntechnology, infrastructure, natural resources, the environment, \neducation and training--all of that and more was spent for interest on \nthe debt.\n  We have gone through this debate where some are trying to scare \nAmerica's senior citizens, but by doing what we hope we can do in about \n20 minutes, by passing a constitutional amendment with 67 votes, we \ntake the opposite view, that we are protecting the very programs that \nthey try to scare seniors with--Medicare and Social Security.\n  What they fail to mention is the national debt threatens every \nprogram. Every program is threatened--Medicare, Medicaid, Social \nSecurity, agriculture, nutrition programs, you name it. If the debt \ncontinues to escalate, as it will, each year interest payments are \ngoing to be larger and larger and consume more and more of its share of \nthe Federal dollar.\n  According to President Clinton's budget, interest on the debt is \ngoing to consume 16 percent of every Federal dollar. And anyone who is \nstill not convinced need look no further than President Clinton's \nrecent budget, which essentially gave up on ever balancing the budget \nand ever balancing the Nation's books.\n  In 1992, Candidate Clinton seized on the $292 billion deficit, the \nhighest in history, and he campaigned against the deficit. He was \nsuccessful. He agreed to cut it in half. Now, 2 years into his \nadministration, his own budget abandons the pledge, predicting a \ndeficit of $196.7 billion next year and roughly $200 billion a year \nthrough the year 2000. In each of the next 5 years, the amount the \nFederal Government collects in taxes is projected to rise, but spending \nwill go up much more.\n  The picture only gets worse in the next century when the deficit is \nprojected to rise to $421 billion--$421 billion--by the year 2005. So \nwe are going to double it, we are going to double it if we fail to take \naction in the next few moments.\n  If there was any message last November--and different people heard \ndifferent messages; some did not hear any message at all and some are \nhere, and some will be voting. There was a revolution last November. \nThe American people said, ``Stop. Stop. Wait a minute. We want less \nGovernment, we want to rein in Government, we want to dust off the 10th \namendment, we want to return power to the States and power to the \npeople, and one way to do that is to rein in Federal spending and not \nincrease Federal taxes.''\n  So the American people--Democrats, Republicans, Independents, voters \ngenerally--sent us a message. I am not certain what the precise message \nwas, but I think the general message was, as I stated, ``Rein in the \nFederal Government.''\n  I believe adoption of this amendment is a big step in that effort. If \nwe are ever going to rein in the Federal Government, rein in spending, \nwe need help. We do not have the will in this body to do it. Oh, I have \nheard all the speeches, and then I checked the voting records and they \ndo not match.\n  Oh, I hear speeches. I hear speeches at night when I cannot sleep.\n  People on the Senate floor say all we have to do is make these tough \ndecisions. But then when the tough decision comes, oh, that is too \ntough, or it is not tough enough, or any other excuse to duck. We \ncannot wait for statutory changes. We cannot count on them. They have \nnot worked, as I said, since 1969. I think the American people want us \nto stand up to the special interests and they want us to do the right \nthing.\n  Many say, oh, well this is the easy way out. You all vote for the \nbalanced budget amendment. Then you go out and say, well, I voted for \nthe balanced budget amendment. Then you continue to vote for all the \nspending programs.\n  I do not think so. My view is, if we adopt this amendment and three-\nfourths of the States ratify it, it is going to fundamentally change \nthe way we do business in the Congress and all over Washington.\n  So this is an amendment whose time has come. Thomas Jefferson said in \n1789:\n\n       The question whether one generation has the right to bind \n     another by the deficit it imposes is a question of such \n     consequence as to place it among the fundamental principles \n     of government. We should consider ourselves unauthorized to \n     saddle posterity with our debts, and morally bound to pay \n     them ourselves.\n\n  Now, if you think about that for a moment, this was just 1 year after \nthe new Constitution went into effect. Thomas Jefferson himself was \npondering whether a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced \nbudget was needed.\n  So, Madam President, the time for a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution has come. Since our first Constitution went into effect in \n1788, a total of 27 amendments have been adopted. The first 10, \ncommonly referred to as the Bill of Rights, made the United States a \nmodel for the world by limiting the powers of Government and securing \nrights for individuals and States. The Bill of Rights was proposed to \nthe legislatures of the several States by the first Congress on \nSeptember 25, 1789, and ratified by December 15, 1791.\n  I think there is a common thread that runs through all the \namendments \n[[Page S3303]] that have been adopted, whether it is the first 10, the \nBill of Rights--there is a common thread. Most have either limited the \npower of Government or provided constitutional protection to groups of \nAmericans. And I believe the balanced budget amendment would do both. \nBy limiting the Federal Government's ability to borrow, it will help \nprovide constitutional protection to future generations of Americans \nand those who are not adequately represented in our current system.\n  Nobody has contacted me on behalf of the 5-year-olds or the 10-year-\nolds or the 15-year-olds about their future. Nobody is lobbying for \nthem. They are waiting for us.\n  I do not believe we can continue to mortgage America's future. If we \ncontinue current tax-and-spend policies, we are going to saddle that \nfuture generation with lifetime tax rates, effective rates of more than \n80 percent. So if we want to take away representation of our children \nand our grandchildren, if we want to take away the discipline, if we \nwant to have it one way in an election year and another way in the next \nyear, then we can vote against the balanced budget amendment.\n  As I look around the Chamber, I see Democrats and Republicans saying, \nwait a minute; it is time we act. This is a bipartisan effort. We need \nDemocrats and Republicans to make this happen. It is not going to \nhappen unless it is bipartisan.\n  We also took an oath of office to support and defend the Constitution \nof the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. Well, I \nconsider the rising debt and the interest rates to be sort of a \ndomestic enemy, and I think that simple oath illustrates why the \nbalanced budget amendment is so important. We have not been successful \nin the past. We have not balanced the budget in the past because the \nFederal budget never became a national priority, and if you want to \nmake it a national priority, we adopt a balanced budget amendment and \nsay we are going to have a balanced budget by the year 2002. That makes \nit clear to everyone in this body that balancing the budget is not only \na national priority but also a constitutional duty and that every \nSenator will be sworn to uphold and defend this amendment to the \nConstitution. That is the way it works. That is the way it should work.\n  So we have had a healthy debate, as I have said, of 115 hours, or 116 \nhours, plus a lot of other morning business hours. I certainly wish to \ncommend my colleague, Senator Hatch, who has been on this floor day \nafter day after day, and my colleague, Senator Craig, who every morning \nin my office has had a meeting with the group to work on the balanced \nbudget amendment, trying to find out what we need to address, how we \ncan pick up one more vote. And if anybody ever questioned anybody's \nmotives, you cannot question the motives of the Senator from Illinois, \nSenator Simon. He has been for the balanced budget as long as I have \nknown him. He can go any way he wants. He is not running again. This is \nnot politics to Paul Simon. This is a commitment he has made to the \npeople of Illinois and a commitment he has made to his colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle. So I appreciate the efforts made by my friend \nfrom Illinois.\n  Certainly the Senator from West Virginia deserves our thanks, \nhopefully not to overdo that. He has made a great contribution to the \ndebate. In fact, I have been saying around the country that Senator \nByrd is the expert, and I say it with admiration; he is a master of the \ngame. He also understands Roman history, at least he understands it \nbetter than the rest of us because we never question what he says about \nRoman history. I am trying to get C-SPAN to give college credit to \nthose who watch it. And it would be deserved because the Senator from \nWest Virginia does understand it, and certainly he has contributed to \nthis debate.\n  Then let me just have the last word. I think everybody has said out \nhere from time to time that the Constitution is a living document, and \nthat is why it includes article V, which outlines the process for \nproposing and ratifying constitutional amendments. The Founding Fathers \ndid not make amending the Constitution easy, and the action we take \ntoday, if we succeed, is not the last word. And if we fail, it is not \nthe last word, because the final word of whether or not there is going \nto be a balanced budget goes outside Washington, goes away from this \nbody and out to our respective States.\n  I will say to those who still maybe have not quite decided which way \nto go--there may be two or three of those, maybe four--maybe you are \nnot quite certain, but certainly you have some confidence in your State \nlegislature, wherever it may be. Why not give them a chance? It takes \nthree-fourths of the States to ratify. Why not say that we have some \nconfidence in the people who live in our respective States and deal on \na daily basis with problems that affect our constituents, too, because \nthe Founding Fathers said in the final analysis it is going to be \ndetermined by the people, by those who are closest to the people, and \nthose are the men and women who serve in statehouses around the \ncountry.\n  I think we ought to remember that as we vote. The Founding Fathers \ndid not put the final authority in the hands of Congress; they put it \nin the people, members, men and women, State legislators who are \nclosest to the people.\n  So I remind my colleagues as we prepare to vote here of just a few \nfacts. I think many Senators referred to these earlier. Depending upon \nwhich poll you use--and polls change from time to time--about 80 \npercent of the American people favor the balanced budget amendment. \nNow, maybe 80 percent are wrong and the 20 percent are right. It has \nhappened in the past. But these polls have been consistent--71, 75, 78, \n81, somewhere between 75 and 80 percent. Three hundred Members of the \nother body voted for a balanced budget amendment, 72 Democrats and 228 \nRepublicans. They joined together to give us this historic opportunity. \nAnd I would state what every Member already knows, that adoption of \nthis amendment, if it is adopted, is only the first step in securing \nour Nation's financial future. Whatever happens, we are going to have \nto make difficult choices.\n  Republicans will begin work on a detailed 5-year plan to put the \nbudget on a path of balance by the year 2002, and our plan will not \nraise taxes. Our plan will not touch Social Security. Everything else, \nfrom agriculture to zebra mussel research, will be on the table.\n  So, Madam President, as George Washington reminded us in his farewell \naddress:\n\n       The basis of our political system is the right of the \n     people to make and alter their institutions of government.\n\n  The time has come for us to exercise that right. So I would just say, \nlet us get prepared for this fundamental change. It is going to come. \nIf not tonight, it will come maybe next month or the next month or the \nnext year. It is not going to be business as usual in Washington.\n  So I just urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment--it will take \n67 of us--and send it back to the States for ratification. Let those \nclosest to the people then decide if we spelled out how we will reach \nthe balanced budget amendment. Let us not take that judgment away from \nthem.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, I move that the Senate stand in recess \nuntil 10 a.m.----\n  Mr. BYRD. Before the distinguished leader makes his motion, would he \nexplain to the Senate why we are going out and why we are not having \nthe vote, as we all anticipated we would be having a vote?\n  Mr. DOLE. Let me explain to my friend from West Virginia that we \nstill think there is some chance of getting this resolved by tomorrow \nmorning, because we could have 67 votes or maybe more.\n  We have been on this now for 115 hours. I do not know how many days. \nEverybody has had a right to debate. We are up to the critical time of \nthe vote. This Senator wants to make every effort he can to see if we \ncan reach the 67 votes. If we fail, we will fail, and it will be 10 \no'clock or perhaps noon tomorrow morning.\n  Madam President, I renew the motion.\n   [[Page S3304]] Mr. BYRD. Madam President, would the Senator allow me \n5 minutes before he makes that motion?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Debate is not in order at this point.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I thank the distinguished majority leader \nfor allowing me to have this privilege to address this question before \nhe makes the motion to adjourn.\n  Madam President, I think this is a sad spectacle. We have had 30 days \nof debate. Both sides have poured out their hearts, have worked hard, \nand we came to the moment that we thought we were going to have a \nrollcall vote. We entered into an agreement to that effect. Now, if we \nhad known that we were going to reach this kind of a travesty, this \nSenator would never have agreed to that unanimous-consent request.\n  Madam President, the Framers intended that, before the people at the \nState level should have an opportunity to ratify a constitutional \namendment, it must be approved by both Houses of the Congress by a two-\nthirds vote, and it was here that the amendment was supposed to be \nprobed and examined and carefully studied before it was sent on its way \nto the States.\n  Now, here is what we see: We see the sad spectacle of Senators on the \nother side trying to go over until tomorrow in order to get another \nvote for this amendment. It should be obvious to everyone that the main \nobject here is to get that vote, as the distinguished majority leader \nsays.\n  It boils down to an insatiable, insatiable desire to get a vote for \nvictory. We are tampering with the Constitution of the United States! \nThis is no place for deal-making, back-room huddles. No wonder the \npeople have such a low estimation of the Congress. Going to make deals \nin the back room. I do not imply by what I am saying--I do not want to \ncast any aspersions on any Senator in particular.\n  But this is a process that we have worked our way through. We were \ntold there would be a vote. We have waited on a vote. Up here the press \nis gathered. They want to see the outcome of this debate.\n  (Disturbance in the visitors' galleries.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will remind the occupants of the \ngalleries there will be no expressions of approval or disapproval.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, this has every appearance of a sleazy, \ntawdry effort to win a victory at the cost of amending the Constitution \nof the United States.\n  We have had our chances, why do we not vote? I hope we will vote, \nMadam President. Let us not wait until tomorrow. Now is the time for \nthe decision. That is what we were told.\n  I deplore this tawdry effort here to go over until tomorrow so that \nadditional pressures can be made on some poor Member in the effort to \nget this vote. Laugh if you must. Laugh! This is no laughing matter. We \nare talking about the Constitution of the United States. We were ready \nfor a vote. Obviously, the proponents on the other side felt they were \ngoing to lose. We cannot win them all. We cannot lose them all. I think \nit is a sad day for the U.S. Senate if this is the way that we are \ngoing to go about amending the Constitution of the United States.\n  I thank the distinguished majority leader. I hope we will vote \ntonight.\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask for 5 minutes to respond and then I will make the \nmotion. This is probably, as I said in my statement, the most important \nvote we will cast around here, maybe in our careers.\n  We do not take amending the Constitution lightly. But to suggest that \nsomehow this is unprecedented, tawdry, whatever, in my view, is out of \nbounds. We have every right to use the rules to determine if we have \nthe votes or if we can pick up votes, and I intend to do that. We have \nbeen on this amendment 115 hours, plus 20-some hours of quorum calls \nand votes. Nobody complained about that.\n  What about the 80 percent of the American people? Do you think they \ncare whether we vote at 7 o'clock or 7:30 or 10 o'clock in the morning, \nthe 80 percent who want this passed? Do Members think they feel the way \nthe Senator from West Virginia feels? Absolutely not.\n  Now, we have some obligation to ourselves. Obviously, nobody is \ntrying to put the arm on anybody around here. We have not made house \ncalls. We have not knocked on the doors. We have gone in their offices. \nBut we have good-faith negotiations going, and maybe they have helped. \nThat is fine. If they have ended, there are still other options.\n  So I just suggest, Madam President, this is an important vote. If I \nthought there was one more vote tomorrow morning or two more votes or \nthree more votes next week, I would make every effort I could to secure \nthose votes, just as the distinguished Senator from West Virginia has \ndone time after time after time in this body.\n  I think the sad spectacle is that we may lose this vote, whether it \nis tonight--it is not going to be tonight-- whether it is tomorrow or \nlater, where people who voted for the amendment before their election, \nvote against it after their election. What are the American people to \nthink? What are the American people to think about any Member in this \nbody? They sent us a loud and clear message last November, and as I \nsaid, nobody knows what the precise message was, but generally, it was \nto rein in the Federal Government, to give power back to the people and \nback to the States. That is what this amendment does.\n  So, in my view, by postponing this vote, we will attempt to reflect \nthe will of 76 to 80 percent of the American people and not the will of \n20 percent. We may fail this time. I quoted earlier statements of \nJefferson and Washington who had a little knowledge about what the \nFounding Fathers had in mind and who suggested themselves that there \nmight come a time we would have to amend the Constitution. We should \nnot pile up a debt on the next generation as we continue to do.\n  I want to commend, again, those who is worked on both sides of the \naisle. This has been bipartisan, and it should be, and it still can be. \nI know the President is very strongly opposed to the balanced budget \namendment. I know he has called Members. I know what happens when your \nPresident calls. We have gone through it on this side. It puts a lot of \npressure on a Senator or a Member of Congress.\n  We have tried to improve the conditions by accepting or agreeing to \nan amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Georgia, Senator \nNunn. I just hope that all Senators will think about this overnight. \nSomebody could decide to vote the other way. We take a gamble. We might \nlose a vote. But in my view the gamble is worth taking. The risk is \nworth taking. I know the Senator from West Virginia----\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the distinguished Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOLE. No, I will not yield for a question.\n  I know the Senator from West Virginia feels strongly about this \namendment, and he has a right to feel strongly about it. It does not \nmean he is right. He might be wrong. We may be right. If we cannot \ndetermine that tonight or tomorrow night we will determine it the next \ntime the voters have a chance to speak.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/28/senate-section/article/S3299-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECESS UNTIL 10 A.M.
