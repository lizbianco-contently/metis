Mr. President, last Friday the Senate did adopt a \nresolution naming Greg Casey of Idaho to be the new Sergeant at Arms. \nIt is a pleasure for me to be able to recognize Greg Casey. I think \nmost Senators are familiar with him. He has been around Capitol Hill \nfor a long time and has worked with Senator Craig and has been very \nclose to Senator Kempthorne. He has been very helpful in setting up the \nadministrative operation in my office as leader.\n  With his background in Idaho, in business and government, I feel he \nwill be an excellent Sergeant at Arms. He has a mighty responsibility \nof working with Senators on both sides of the aisle to make sure that \nwe operate as efficiently and honestly as we possibly can. I am \nconvinced that he will do an excellent job.\n  I yield to Senator Craig for comments in regard to his former chief \nof staff.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me thank the majority leader for \nyielding this morning and reflect on the wise and judicious decision of \nthe majority leader to choose my chief of staff, Greg Casey, to become \nthe new Sergeant at Arms of the U.S. Senate.\n  As the majority leader mentioned, Mr. President, Greg and I and \nSenator Kempthorne go back a good many\n\n[[Page S10100]]\n\nyears in working in the political effort in Idaho and here in \nWashington. I had the privilege of hiring Greg to be a field director \nfor me in my first congressional campaign. He came to Washington with \nme and served in a variety of capacities, ultimately becoming my chief \nof staff while I served in the House, left to go to Idaho to rebuild an \norganization called the Idaho Association of Commerce and Industry into \na major force as a spokesman for business and industry in the State of \nIdaho. When I was elected to the Senate in 1990, I asked Greg to return \nwith me to put my Senate staff together and he has served as my chief \nof staff since that time.\n  I am extremely excited for Greg and his family, and for Idaho, that \nthe majority leader has chosen him to become the Sergeant of Arms here \nin the Senate, a very large responsibility. I am extremely proud that \nGreg now has the opportunity to serve in that capacity, not only for \nthe Senate but for our country and for the State of Idaho.\n  I, on behalf of Idaho, can speak with a great deal of pride in saying \nwe know Idaho is extremely proud today to have Greg Casey as the new \nSergeant at Arms here in the U.S. Senate. Greg, congratulations. We \nwill look forward to working with you, and also we will seek your \ncounsel from time to time as it comes to the administration of my \noffice and my offices in the State of Idaho.\n  Again, thank you, Mr. Majority Leader, for yielding. Let me now yield \nto my colleague, Senator Dirk Kempthorne, who also has had a close \nworking relationship with Greg Casey over many years.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I join in commending the majority \nleader for his decision in naming Greg Casey as our new Sergeant at \nArms. It is an outstanding decision, and again I think it reflects well \non the majority leader and the sort of individuals that he is \nsurrounding himself with to carry out these very, very, critical issues \nand functions relating to this institution.\n  I have known Greg Casey for many, many years. We attended the \nUniversity of Idaho together in the mid-1970's. In fact, it was at the \nUniversity of Idaho that I had the honor to serve as student body \npresident. I must acknowledge that Senator Craig also had the \ndistinction of serving as student body president at the University of \nIdaho. It was in that capacity that I named Greg Casey to fill a \nvacancy that was on the student senate.\n  One of the things that I have always admired about Greg Casey is his \ndevotion to what has to be done, his devotion at that time to the \nuniversity, to the State, and as I have seen him in this atmosphere, \nhis absolute devotion to this country.\n  We have named a patriot, now, to be the Sergeant at Arms of this \ninstitution. He is an individual who brings great enthusiasm to \nanything he does, a great energy level. He is an individual who brings \ninnovation to everything he touches. I know whenever his tenure as \nSergeant at Arms is complete he will be regarded as truly one of the \nbest Sergeants at Arms that the U.S. Senate in its history ever had.\n  He also has the ability to stick to it. I think this is probably \nsomething that the majority leader, Senator Lott, has recognized, and \nthat is if you want a job done, have Greg Casey given the assignment \nbecause he will get it done, no matter what it takes, but he will do it \nwith a style and with a dignity, and with a tenacity that you never \nhave to doubt whether it will be done.\n  I also want to acknowledge that we talk about having good people \naround you. Well, Greg Casey has good people around him. In the late \n1980's, he introduced me to a young lady that truly is a remarkable \nwoman, Julia Laky, who then in 1990 became Mrs. Greg Casey. In the life \nthat we have shared together, I had the honor as serving as best man at \nhis wedding. Again, they are the sort of people that you are proud to \nsay are our friends, we like them, the values that they have in their \nhome are the values that America believes in. And I remember that, \nfollowing the wedding, I guess it falls on the best man to make a \ntoast. So I made the toast that their home would be blessed with more \nthan just the two of them, and up there joining their family is Gregory \nScott Casey, Jr. He is a fifth generation Idahoan. His dad is a fourth \ngeneration Idahoan.\n\n  I would like to say this to little Greg: Your dad is a great man, and \nhe is someone that we all look up to. I know that just as little \nGregory Scott Casey is in wonderful hands with his dad, Greg, and his \nmom, Julia, this Senate is in good hands with this new Sergeant at \nArms, Greg Casey. So I am proud to call him a friend. He is someone \nthat is going to serve us well. Again, I commend the majority leader \nfor his decision in making this happen.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho, Mr. Craig, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, certainly Senator Kempthorne and I, by our \ncomments, can display only great pride in the fact that the majority \nleader has chosen Greg Casey to be our new Sergeant at Arms. We reflect \nthat pride for our State of Idaho.\n  I say to Greg, his wife Julia, and Gregory, Jr., congratulations, we \nlook forward to a good number of years working with you during your \nservice in the U.S. Senate. I congratulate the majority leader for a \nwise choice.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me join with my colleagues in our \ncongratulations to Gregory Casey for his appointment and our best \nwishes to him and his family in these very important new circumstances \nhe faces. There are a number of people that have already spoken to his \nintelligence, ability, and his contribution to the Senate. I have had \nthe opportunity to work with him as a member of the Ethics Committee \nand have watched with great admiration as he has taken on each of his \ndifficult tasks in working with the Senators from Idaho.\n  So I know I speak for all of my colleagues on this side in wishing \nhim our sincere congratulations. Isaac Bassett, who worked in this \ngreat Chamber for 64 years, up until 1894, left a diary of many \nthousands of pages. When he was appointed to his last position, he came \nto the floor and said there is no higher calling than that of public \nservice in the U.S. Senate. I think Greg Casey appreciates that, \nunderstands that, and in the tradition of Isaac Bassett, and many of us \nwho have had the great fortune to follow him, we look forward to \nworking with him in a new role.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I just want to say how impressed I am \nwith the excellent comments and statements that have been made by my \ncolleagues about someone that Members of the Senate have known over a \nlong period of time. I have had the privilege of knowing Mr. Casey. But \nhaving the name Casey, if you track back over a long period, there must \nhave been a Democrat in there somewhere. [Laughter.]\n  I know I can speak, as well, along with the minority leader and \nassure my colleagues that we will be fairly treated as well.\n  Congratulations, Mr. Casey.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe we are ready now to go to the \nDefense of Marriage Act. Perhaps we will lay that bill down.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/10/senate-section/article/S10099-6", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 3396, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3396) to define and protect the institution of \n     marriage.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes off of the time \nallocated to the Defense of Marriage Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will not take much of the Senate's time to \nexpress my strong support for the Defense of Marriage Act this morning. \nIt has already been discussed in earlier debate, and I am sure it is \ngoing to be supported eloquently by speeches later on today from \nSenator Nickles of\n\n[[Page S10101]]\n\nOklahoma and others on both sides of the aisle.\n  I expect the outcome in the Senate will be lopsided when the vote is \ntaken, as it was in the House, which passed the Defense of Marriage \nAct, as it is popularly called, by a vote of 342 to 67.\n  Judging from the calls and letters and comments I received when I was \nhome during the August district work period--from all across the \ncountry, though--it is clear to me that this bill enjoys tremendous \nsupport among the American people.\n  President Clinton has promised to sign it into law. His Department of \nJustice has affirmed its position that H.R. 3396 ``would be sustained \nas constitutional if challenged in courts.''\n  This is not prejudiced legislation. It is not mean-spirited or \nexclusionary. It is a preemptive measure to make sure that a handful of \njudges, in a single State, cannot impose an agenda upon the entire \nNation.\n  The Defense of Marriage Act is not an attack upon anyone. It is, \nrather, a response to an attack upon the institution of marriage \nitself.\n  This matter has received so much attention in the national press, \nthat everyone should know by now what the problem is and why we need to \npass DOMA, as it is usually referred to.\n  The problem is the serious possibility--some say even the strong \nlikelihood--that the State court system of Hawaii would recognize as a \nlegal union, equivalent or identical to marriage, a living arrangement \nof two persons of the same sex.\n  If such a decision affected only Hawaii, we could leave it to the \nresidents of Hawaii to either live with the consequences or exercise \ntheir political rights to change things. But a court decision would not \nbe limited to just one State. It would raise threatening possibilities \nin other States because of article IV, section 1 of the Constitution.\n  The article requires States to give ``full faith and credit'' to \n``the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other \nState.''\n  Would that mean a same-sex union would be entitled to equal \nrecognition in South Dakota, Massachusetts, or my State of Mississippi? \nBoth proponents and opponents of same-sex unions believe it would.\n  I believe we should not wait around to find out. What the Hawaiian \ncourt decides could also affect the operations of the Federal \nGovernment. It could have an impact upon programs like Medicare, \nMedicaid, veterans' pensions, and the Civil Service Retirement System.\n  If you redefine marriage, you should redefine eligibility for \nbenefits under those and other programs. Imagine the financial and \nsocial consequences of taking such a step.\n  Inaction on the part of Congress would be equivalent to approval of \nwhat the Hawaiian courts may do. We can't afford such action.\n  No one should doubt that Congress does have the authority to act.\n  The same article of the Constitution that calls for ``full faith and \ncredit'' for State court decisions also gives Congress the power to \ndecide how that provision will be implemented. It says:\n\n       And the Congress may by general laws prescribe the manner \n     in which such acts, records and proceedings shall be proved, \n     and the effect thereof.\n\n  ``And the effect thereof.'' Those words make clear what the Framers \nof the Constitution intended.\n  None of them, I don't think, could have foreseen the day when an \nAmerican court would sanction same-sex marriages or unions, but they \nwisely provided for the possibility that some State court might do \nsomething like that someday. I don't know how to describe that kind of \naction. But it is a situation we are faced with now, and that is why we \nhave this defense of marriage bill that we are debating this morning \nand will vote on probably around 2:30 or 2:45.\n  To force upon our communities the legal recognition of same-sex \nmarriage would be social engineering beyond anything in the American \nexperience.\n  When DOMA was discussed in committee, some objected that it violated \nStates rights. Never mind that those who raised the objection never \nseemed to have any qualms about trampling those rights in the past in \nmany instances.\n  DOMA actually reinforces States rights. It prevents one State from \nimposing upon all the others its own particular interpretation of the \nlaw.\n  The Defense of Marriage Act will ensure that each State can reach its \nown decision about this extremely controversial matter: The legal \nstatus of same-sex unions.\n  The Defense of Marriage Act, likewise, ensures that for the purposes \nof Federal programs, marriages will be defined by Federal law.\n  It is Congress' responsibility to say plainly what marriage is going \nto mean--what the spousal relationship is going to mean--in national \nprograms that serve elderly, retirees, and the poor.\n  Our failure to do so would open up those programs to all sorts of \nconfusion and claims and court actions.\n  This is more than a theoretical possibility. In 1970, a Federal court \ndenied a same-sex couple legal recognition for veterans' benefits only \nbecause their State's law limited marriage to persons of opposite sex. \nI hate to think what would happen now if that case were brought in a \nState where these unions had the force of law.\n  Fortunately, it is not going to come to that. I hope we can get this \nbill passed overwhelmingly, in a bipartisan way, send it down to the \nWhite House, and have it signed into law very soon. We should not have \nambiguity in this area. We should not have confusion. We should not \nleave it to court actions and challenges. This is a very important \naction. I think it will pass after a relatively short time and with \nsurprisingly little opposition. But it is a serious matter. I think the \nAmerican people are somewhat stunned that we would even have to pass \nsuch a law, but we do, and we are doing our job when we pass this \nlegislation. It will be a small but a vital victory for the American \nfamily and for common sense.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Frahm). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As I understand it, the 3-hour time limit began when the \nlegislation was laid before the Senate. Am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time needs to conclude by 12:30, so it \nwould take unanimous consent to have the full 3 hours.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If I could have the attention of the majority leader, \nwould it be appropriate to have the 3 hours start at the time when the \nbill was actually laid down rather than at 9:30?\n  Mr. LOTT. We started, what was it, about 20 minutes until 10? \nActually, I would prefer we do that to make sure we have the full 3 \nhours.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I make that request then.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the recess will be delayed.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I oppose the so-called Defense of Marriage Act, and \nI regret that the Senate is allocating scarce time at the end of this \nCongress to consider this unconstitutional, unnecessary, and divisive \nlegislation.\n  There is, however, a silver lining to the Republican leadership's \ndecision to schedule this debate. It gave many of us the opening we \nneeded to raise a serious civil rights concern--the festering problem \nof unacceptable discrimination against gays and lesbians in the \nworkplace. We debated that issue at length on Friday, and we will vote \non it later this afternoon. I am very hopeful that a ban on job \ndiscrimination will pass the Senate. If it does, we will have the \nDefense of Marriage Act to thank for that achievement.\n  Nevertheless, I continue to be opposed to the Defense of Marriage Act \nfor a variety of reasons.\n  We all know what is going on here. I regard this bill as a mean-\nspirited form of Republican legislative gay-bashing cynically \ncalculated to try to inflame the public 8 weeks before the November 5 \nelection.\n  I do not mean to say that opponents of same-sex marriage are \nintolerant, or bigots. Marriage is an ancient institution with \nreligious underpinnings, and I understand that some people have deeply \nheld religious or moral beliefs that lead them to oppose same-sex \nmarriage.\n  But do they seriously believe this bill deserves this high priority? \nAfter all, the Hawaii court case that started all this won't be final \nfor another 2 years, according to Hawaiian authorities, and the outcome \nof the case is far from certain. Even if the Hawaii courts eventually \napprove same-sex marriage, other\n\n[[Page S10102]]\n\nStates have ample authority under under current law to reject that \ndecision in their own courts.\n  In fact, States and local governments across the country are already \ndealing with this issue in their own ways. Some have enacted domestic \npartnership laws. In others, mayors and Governors have issued executive \norders for public employers. They don't need help from Congress to \naddress the subject. And Federal law, which has never recognized same-\nsex marriages, hardly needs clarification at this suspicious moment.\n  This contrived debate has been gratuitously brought before Congress 1 \nmonth before adjournment. It has been placed on a suspiciously fast \ntrack to enactment despite the press of other business. The obvious \nexplanation is a crass desire for partisan gain at the expense of \ntolerance and mutual understanding.\n  This bill is designed to divide Americans, to drive a wedge between \none group of citizens and the rest of the country, solely for partisan \nadvantage. It is a cynical election year gimmick, and it deserves to be \nrejected by all who deplore the intolerance and incivility that have \ncome to dominate our national debate.\n  Over the past few months, we have come together as a nation to oppose \nin the strongest possible terms the church arson epidemic. We heard \nleaders across the political, racial, and religious spectrum discuss \nthe need to rededicate ourselves to the fundamental values of tolerance \nand mutual respect that are the backbone of any free society. I just \nwish the Republican leadership in Congress would practice what they \npreached in San Diego.\n  In any event, whether Senators are for or against same-sex marriage, \nthere are ample reasons to vote against this bill, because it \nrepresents an unconstitutional exercise of congressional power. This \nbill attempts to use the full faith and credit clause--article IV, \nsection 1--of the Constitution to give the States greater authority to \nrefuse to recognize gay marriages if such marriages are made legal in \nother States. But the purpose and history of the full faith and credit \nclause make clear that the Framers of the Constitution never intended \nto give Congress this power.\n  The full faith and credit clause was included in the Constitution as \na means of binding the original separate States into a United States of \nAmerica. The Framers feared that local rivalries could cause States to \nreject each other's laws, and that a dangerously chaotic situation \ncould result. The full faith and credit clause requires the States to \nrespect each other's laws; it facilitates interstate commerce and \nstrengthens our Federal system.\n  The Constitution gives Congress no power to add or subtract from the \nfull faith and credit clause. The States that ratified the Constitution \nwould never have granted such sweeping authority to Congress, and no \nCongress in 200 years has exercised such power.\n  It is true that the full faith and credit clause gives Congress the \nauthority to prescribe the effect of one State's laws in other States. \nBut this does not give Congress the power to say that any such laws \nshall have no effect.\n  In fact, for that reason, leading scholars have labeled this bill \nflatly unconstitutional. Prof. Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School \nwrites that:\n\n       The full faith and Credit Clause cannot be read as a fount \n     of authority for Congress to set asunder the states that this \n     clause so solemnly brought together. Such a reading would \n     mean, for example, that Congress could decree that any state \n     was free to disregard any Hawaii marriage, any California \n     divorce, any Kansas default judgment--or any of a potentially \n     endless list of official acts that a Congressional majority \n     might wish to denigrate. This would convert the \n     Constitution's most vital unifying clause into a license for \n     balkanization and disunity.\n\n  Conservative constitutional scholar Cass Sunstein of the University \nof Chicago reached a similar conclusion in testimony before the \nJudiciary Committee on July 11. Sunstein pointed out that if Congress \npossessed authority to negate the effect of State court judgments:\n\n       . . . a good deal of the entire federal system could be \n     undone. Under the proponents' interpretation, Congress could \n     simply say that any law Congress dislikes is of `no effect' \n     in other states . . . This would be an extraordinary power in \n     light of the needs of a commercial republic. Nothing in the \n     background of the full faith and credit clause suggests that \n     this was anyone's understanding of the clause.\n\n  In his testimony, Professor Sunstein emphasized that the Supreme \nCourt's recent opinion in Romer versus Evans, striking down an anti-gay \nreferendum in Colorado, also casts doubt on the validity of this bill. \nLike the Colorado referendum struck down in Romer, this bill is \n``unprecedented * * * an oddity in our constitutional tradition drawn \nexplicitly in terms of sexual orientation. Insofar as it draws the \nparticular line that it does, it risks running afoul of Romer's \nprohibition on laws based on animus against homosexuals.''\n  Scholarly opinion is clear: The bill before us is plainly \nunconstitutional. But even if it were constitutional, the bill should \nbe rejected because it is unnecessary and ill-advised.\n  Proponents of the bill claim to be motivated by the possibility that \nthe Hawaii courts will validate same-sex marriage, forcing the other 49 \nStates to recognize Hawaii marriages. But if Hawaii courts recognize \nsame-sex marriages some day--and that is a big ``if''--the other States \nalready have ample authority to defend their own marriage policies \nwithout meddling from Congress.\n  Dean Herma Hill Kay of the Boalt Hall School of Law is a nationally \nrecognized expert on domestic relations law. She writes:\n\n       The usual conflict of laws doctrine governing the \n     recognition of a marriage performed in another state is that \n     the state where recognition is sought need not recognize a \n     marriage that would violate its public policy. A state with a \n     clear prohibition against same-sex marriage could, if it \n     chose to do so . . . refuse recognition.\n\n  Fifteen States have already made that judgment and decision. In other \nwords, States already have the power that this bill pretends to give \nthem. This is a matter for each state, not a matter for Congress. If \nOklahoma refuses to recognize a Hawaii marriage because it violates \nOklahoma public policy, that is Oklahoma's business. Congress can not \ngive Oklahoma any more power than it already has. That is why the bill \nis not merely unconstitutional. It is, as Professor Sunstein calls it, \na ``constitutionally ill-advised intrusion'' by Congress into an issue \nhandled at the state level for the past 200 years.\n  For over two centuries, Congress has respected the right of States to \nestablish their own laws of marriage, divorce, child custody, and other \nissues in domestic relations. It is ironic that our Republican friends \nwho like to preach State rights are so quick to override State rights \nin this case.\n  The precedent created by this bill should alarm anyone who cares \nabout Federal-State relations generally. If Congress invokes the full \nfaith and credit clause to deny effect to unpopular State court \njudgments, why will it stop at gay marriages? Will Congress try to deny \neffect to unpopular commercial judgments? Will Congress try to deny \neffect to state court decisions protecting civil rights, divorce, child \ncustody, or a wide range of different other issues?\n  As Professor Sunstein testified:\n\n       This is not about same-sex marriage and homosexuality. This \n     is about punitive damages, default judgments, product \n     liability, everything else under the sun. From the \n     constitutional point of view, this is not fundamentally a \n     same-sex marriage act. This is federal permission to some \n     States to ignore what other states have mandated. That is a \n     very large step.\n\n  It is indeed. I would add only that it is a very large backward step. \nI urge the Senate not to take it, and to vote against this \nirresponsible and unconstitutional bill.\n  Madam President, I see the Senator from Minnesota rising. How much \ntime would he require?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, 5 minutes?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I thank my colleague from \nMassachusetts and I say to my colleague from Oklahoma, I hope I have \nnot gone before him and that this would be OK right now.\n  Madam President, I wanted to speak to, or build on, the remarks of my \ncolleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, about the ENDA bill, the \nEmployment Nondiscrimination Act. I listened to some of the debate. \nActually, when I was back home in Minnesota, I saw some of what went \non, on the floor on Friday. We had no votes, and on Friday evening I \ncaught some of\n\n[[Page S10103]]\n\nit. I do not think I want to repeat the different arguments that were \nmade. I would rather talk about this piece of legislation as it \nconnects to people's lives.\n  I want to talk about a very close family friend. This friend of ours, \nover the years, really has had to live in a state of terror, though it \nhas gotten somewhat better now. Several times, Madam President, he has \nhad to go from one job to another, not because of the content of his \ncharacter, not because of his ability, not because of his contributions \nto his employer or to his fellow workers or fellow employees, but \nbecause of his sexual orientation.\n  I really do think that the Employment Nondiscrimination Act is a \nmatter of simple justice. I really hope that the U.S. Senate will vote \nfor this piece of legislation. I am very proud to be an original \ncosponsor, because I believe if we vote for this piece of legislation, \nwe really will have taken an enormous step forward toward ending \ndiscrimination in our country. It is just not right that a man or a \nwoman, because of sexual orientation, should be in a situation where he \nor she could lose a job or not be able to obtain employment because of \ntheir sexual orientation. This is a basic civil rights issue.\n  There is no provision in this piece of legislation that calls for \nfavorable treatment. There are no quotas. This piece of legislation \njust says we must extend basic civil rights protection against \ndiscrimination in employment to all citizens--to all citizens--in our \ncountry and we must end this discrimination based on sexual \norientation.\n  I also want to mention, because I am very proud of my State, that in \nMinnesota, in 1992, we adopted very similar provisions to this piece of \nlegislation in the Human Rights Act. We became the eighth State to \nguarantee protection against this type of discrimination. I would like \nto say, from the point of view of the business community, of the \nreligious community, of communities within our larger Minnesota \ncommunity, I think now there is very strong support for ending this \ndiscrimination.\n  This piece of legislation that we passed in our State has served our \nState well. If we pass this in the U.S. Senate and eventually pass this \nin the U.S. Congress, we will serve our country well. This is the right \nthing to do, to end discrimination in employment. What should matter is \na person's ability. What should matter is the character of a person. \nWhat should matter is an employee's contribution to his or her business \nor place of work. What should not matter is sexual orientation.\n  We must end this discrimination. I hope my colleagues, Democrats and \nRepublicans alike, will support this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I yield myself such time as necessary.\n  I am pleased today to bring before the Senate the Defense of Marriage \nAct, along with Senator Byrd and I think 30 cosponsors. We have \nintroduced a measure which I believe is simple, it is limited in scope, \nand it is based on common sense. It shares broad bipartisan support, \nincluding that of President Clinton.\n  The bill does but two things: First, the bill restates the current \nand long-established understanding that marriage means a legal union \nbetween one man and one women as husband and wife. The act also defines \nspouse as a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife. \nThese definitions apply only to Federal law.\n  Second, the bill says that no State shall be required to give effect \nto a second State's acts, records, or judgments respecting a \nrelationship between persons of the same sex that is treated as a \nmarriage under the laws of that second State.\n  There is nothing earth-shattering here. No breaking of new ground. No \nsetting of new precedents. Indeed, there provisions simply reaffirm \nwhat is already known, what is already in place.\n  The definitions of S. 1999 are based on common understanding rooted \nin our Nation's history, our statutes, and our case law. They merely \nreaffirm what Americans have meant for 200 years when using the words \nmarriage and spouse. The current U.S. Code does not contain a \ndefinition of marriage, presumable because most Americans know what it \nmeans and never imagined challenges such as those we are facing today.\n  As mentioned earlier, the act's definitions apply to Federal law \nonly. The act does not--let me repeat--does not intrude on the ability \nof the States to define marriage as they choose. To the contrary, this \nbill protects the right of States to define marriage for themselves. \nThis way, each State will be able to decide for itself the type of \nmarriage it will sanction.\n  The Defense of Marriage Act invokes Congress' constitutional \nauthority, under article IV, section 1, to prescribe the effect that \nshall be given to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of \nthe various states with regard to the full faith and credit clause.\n  As my colleagues know, in May 1993 the Hawaii Supreme Court rendered \na preliminary ruling in favor of three same-sex couples who applied for \nmarriage licenses. The court said the State's marriage law \ndiscriminated against the plaintiffs in violation of the equal-rights \nprovision of the State Constitution. The case was remanded to the lower \ncourts for a trial, to see if the State could show a compelling state \ninterest to justify the marriage law. That trial is starting today in \nHawaii.\n  It has become clear that advocates of same-sex unions intend to win \nthe lawsuit in Hawaii and then invoke the full faith and credit clause \nto force the other 49 states to accept same-sex unions.\n  Many States are justifiably concerned that Hawaii's recognition of \nsame-sex unions will compromise their own laws prohibiting such \nmarriages. Legislators in over 30 States have introduced bills to deny \nrecognition to same-sex unions. Fifteen States already have approved \nsuch laws, and many other states are now grappling with the issue-\nincluding Hawaii, where legislative leaders are fighting to block their \nown courts from sanctioning such marriages. This bill would address \nthis issue head-on, and it would allow each State to make the final \ndetermination for itself.\n  It seems to me that the strategy of those who are advocating same-sex \nunions is profoundly undemocratic. I cannot envision a more appropriate \ntime for invoking our constitutional authority to define the nature of \nStates' obligations to one another. As State Representative Terrance \nTom from Hawaii testified before a House subcommittee:\n\n       If inaction by the Congress runs the risk that a single \n     judge in Hawaii may redefine the scope of legislation \n     throughout the other 49 States, [then] failure to act is a \n     dereliction of the responsibilities [Congress was] invested \n     with by the voters.\n\n  Another reason this bill is needed now concerns Federal benefits. The \nFederal Government extends benefits, rights, and privileges to persons \nwho are married, and generally it accepts a State's definition of \nmarriage. This bill will help the Federal Government defend the \ntraditional and commonsense definitions of the American people. \nOtherwise, if Hawaii, or any other State, gives new meaning to the \nwords ``marriage'' and ``spouse,'' reverberations may be felt \nthroughout the Federal Code.\n  The provisions of Federal law do not, of course, regulate only the \nactivities of the Federal Government. Federal law also regulates \nprivate persons. Consider the implication of the Family and Medical \nLeave Act of 1993.\n  Shortly before passage of the act in the Senate, I attached an \namendment that defines ``spouse'' as ``a husband or wife, as the case \nmay be.'' When the Secretary of Labor published his proposed \nregulations, a considerable number of comments were received urging \nthat the definition of ``spouse'' be broadened to include domestic \npartners in committed relationships, including same-sex relationships. \nHowever, when the Secretary issued the final rules, he stated that the \nstatutory definition of ``spouse'' and the legislative history of the \nact precluded such broadening of the definition.\n  That small amendment, unanimously adopted, spared a lot of costly and \nunnecessary litigation, and it spared Congress the shock it would have \nreceived from the American people if we had allowed the word ``spouse'' \nto mean something it had never meant before.\n  As my colleagues know, the White House has said that the President \nwill\n\n[[Page S10104]]\n\nsign this bill if ``presented to him as currently written.'' The U.S. \nDepartment of Justice says that it expects the bill will ``be sustained \nas constitutional if challenged in court.''\n  Enactment of this bill will allow States to give full and fair \nconsideration of how they wish to address the issue of same-sex \nmarriages instead of rushing to legislate because of fear that another \nState's laws may be imposed upon them. It will also eliminate legal \nuncertainty concerning Federal benefits and make it clear what is meant \nwhen the words ``marriage'' and ``spouse'' are used in the Federal \nCode.\n  This effort reaffirms current practice and current policy. The fact \nthat some may even consider this legislation controversial should make \nthe average American stop and take stock of where we are as a country \nand where we want to go.\n  This legislation is important. It is about defense of marriage as an \ninstitution and as the backbone of the American family. I urge my \ncolleagues to join with myself, Senator Byrd, and the other cosponsors \nin support of the Defense of Marriage Act.\n  Madam President, one final comment. Some people have stated \nincorrectly that this bill would ban same-sex marriages. They are \nincorrect. This bill does not ban same-sex marriages. It says one State \ndoesn't have to recognize another State should they legalize same-sex \nmarriages. Big difference; a big difference. If one State wishes to \nlegalize same-sex marriages, say, the State of Maryland, Massachusetts \nor any other State, they can certainly do so, and this legislation \nwould not prohibit it.\n  What this legislation would do is say they would not have to \nrecognize same-sex marriages if some other State should enact it. I \nthink it is an important distinction.\n  Also, it says for Federal benefits and Federal benefits purposes, we \ndefine marriage as legal union between male and female, and we define \nspouse as a member of the opposite sex.\n  It is very simple, very plain common sense. It should become law. I \nam pleased the House of Representatives passed it by a 5-to-1 margin, \nbipartisan support in the House of Representatives. I likewise hope \nlater this afternoon our Senate colleagues will pass it with an \noverwhelming margin as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Madam President, at the outset, I ask everyone \nlistening to this debate to note that the Federal Government has yet to \nissue a marriage license. That is not within our purview. It is not \nsomething the Federal Government does. Yet, in this instance, with the \nso-called Defense of Marriage Act, we are moving into the marriage \nbusiness unilaterally in order to prohibit the approval by one State of \nanother State's decision to recognize a particular marital or domestic \narrangement.\n  The Defense of Marriage Act--and I want to quote the act --will amend \nthe U.S. Constitution's full faith and credit clause by authorizing any \nState choosing to do so to deny all effect to any public act, record, \nor judicial proceeding by which another State either recognizes such \nmarriages as valid and binding, or treats such marriages as giving rise \nto any right or claim under the laws.\n  In other words, this legislation says if one State decides to accept \na domestic arrangement that another State does not already have, that \nother State can prohibit or deny the recognition of such domestic \nrelation arrangement by the State.\n  Many top scholars believe this provision of the bill is \nunconstitutional. Our Constitution, the U.S. Constitution, states:\n\n       Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the \n     public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other \n     State. And the Congress may by general Laws prescribe the \n     manner in which such Acts, Records, and Proceedings shall be \n     proved, and the Effect thereof.\n\n  The first sentence of that clause of our Constitution is very clear: \nEvery State is required to recognize the official public acts and \njudicial proceedings of other States. As was stated by the Supreme \nCourt in Williams versus North Carolina, the very purpose of the full \nfaith and credit clause was to alter the status of the several states \nas independent foreign sovereignties, each free to ignore the \nobligations created under the laws or by the judicial proceedings of \nthe others, and to make them integral parts of a single nation.''\n\n  Professor Tribe of Harvard, a noted constitutional law scholar, \nstates further, in regard to this issue, that\n\n       Congress possesses no power under any provision of the \n     Constitution to legislate any such categorical exemption from \n     the Full Faith and Credit Clause of article IV. For Congress \n     to enact such an exemption--whether for same-sex marriages or \n     for any other substantially defined category of public acts, \n     records, or proceedings--would entail exercise by Congress of \n     a ``power not delegated to it by the United States \n     Constitution''--a power therefore ``reserved to the States'' \n     under the tenth amendment to the Constitution.\n\n  He goes on to state that ``the proposed measure''--the domestic \nrelations act, DOMA,\n       . . . the proposed measure would create a precedent \n     dangerous to the very idea of a United States of America. For \n     if Congress may exempt same-sex marriage from full faith and \n     credit, then Congress may also exempt from the mandate of the \n     Full Faith and Credit Clause whatever category of judgments--\n     including not only decrees affecting family structure but \n     also specified types of commercial judgments--a majority of \n     the House and Senate might wish to license States to nullify \n     such contracts as their option. Such purported authority to \n     dismantle the national unifying shield of article IV's Full \n     Faith and Credit Clause, far from protecting States' rights, \n     would destroy one of the Constitution's core guarantees that \n     the United States of America will remain a union of equal \n     sovereigns, that no law, not even one favored by a great \n     majority of the States, can ever reduce any single State's \n     official acts, on any subject, to second-class status; and, \n     most basic of all, that there will be no ad hoc exceptions to \n     the constitutional axiom, reflected in the tenth amendment's \n     unambiguous language, that ours is a national Government \n     whose powers are limited to those enumerated in the \n     Constitution itself.\n\n  Professor Tribe essentially makes the point that this is not only not \nthe Federal Government's business, but it is an assault at the very \ncore of the national unity that we have enjoyed.\n  One of the real strengths of our system is that the Federal \nGovernment has limited powers, derived from the people, and those \npowers not explicitly given the Government are retained by the people \nand by the States. Our Constitution was and is as much about preventing \nthe erosion of our liberties by Government as it is about setting up \nand implementing the processes of Government.\n  This bill, the Defense of Marriage Act, moved through the House of \nRepresentatives faster than any part of the contract on America. In \nfact, based on the level of rhetoric from some Members of Congress, you \nwould think that our principal responsibility lies in the issuing of \nmarriage licenses, and getting involved in domestic relations. That, \nMadam President, I think, suggests that the real objective of this \nlegislation is not about legislating in the appropriate way for this \nCongress.\n  The second provision of the act further demonstrates that the Defense \nof Marriage Act is all about the politics of fear and division and \nabout inciting people in an area that is admittedly controversial. The \nact would amend chapter 1 of title I by adding the following language:\n\n       In determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, or of \n     any ruling, regulation, or interpretation of the various \n     administrative bureaus and agencies of the United States, the \n     word ``marriage'' means only a legal union between one man \n     and one woman as husband and wife, and the word ``spouse'' \n     refers only to a person of the opposite sex who is a husband \n     or a wife.\n\n  Madam President, you may want to consider, that it was not very many \nyears ago that 16 States in our country prevented marriage between the \nraces, interracial marriage. In fact, in some States it was called \nmiscegenation. It was not until 1967 that the U.S. Supreme Court \noutlawed State miscegenation statutes. When that case was argued before \nthe Supreme Court, the attorney general of Virginia seriously argued \nthat the Virginia statute passed constitutional muster because both the \nwhite partner and the minority partner were subject to the same \ncriminal penalty.\n\n  That kind of statutory restriction, Madam President, on people's \nability to make a commitment to one another may seem unbelievable \ntoday, but it was a reality of life in this country not\n\n[[Page S10105]]\n\ntoo many decades ago. Fortunately, our Supreme Court ultimately saw how \ninconsistent these statutes were to core American principles and \ndeclared them all unconstitutional. Just as importantly, the Supreme \nCourt decision is no longer a matter of intense controversy; most \nAmericans have come to understand just how unfair those State statutes \nwere.\n  I point out, Madam President, I grew up, I would imagine the \nPresiding Officer also grew up at a time in our country when these \nstatutes existed, and in fact I had the occasion to have a relative in \nmy family married to a person who was not African American, who was \nwhite, and their marriage was illegal in half the States of this \ncountry. As a child, that did not make any sense to me. How was it that \na State could decide that two people could not decide to make a \ndomestic arrangement that they wanted to make? It did not make any \nsense to me then. The Supreme Court subsequently acted, and here we are \nfaced with the exact same arguments, the very same arguments being made \nagainst domestic relations of another order. When two people decide to \ncome together, it seems to me it should be a matter for them, their \nconscience, their God, and indeed that it, indeed, is inappropriate for \nthis U.S. Congress to intervene in that decisionmaking.\n  As Dr. King stated so eloquently years ago, our Declaration of \nIndependence was not just a matter of rhetoric and not an exercise in \nhypocrisy and not just words trotted out on suitable patriotic \noccasions, and then ignored while we all go about the business of real \nlife. Dr. King knew that our Declaration of Independence was indeed a \n``declaration of intent,'' and that our history has been a history of \nmaking progress, albeit sometimes in fits and starts, but making \nprogress toward full implementation of those American values for all of \nus.\n  In our system, the Constitution protects our freedoms and prevents \nGovernment from taking those freedoms away. At the same time, the \ngenius of the system is that, at its best, it brings us together to \nexpand opportunity and to expand freedom. Gay and lesbian Americans, \nhowever, do not yet fully enjoy the equal protection of the laws \npromised to every American by the 14th amendment. And this legislation, \nit seems to me, is a step in the absolute opposite direction of \nextending the equal protection of the laws to Americans without regard \nto their sexual orientation, just as we moved so fitfully in this \ncountry to extend those protections to Americans without regard to \ntheir race.\n  It seems to me, Madam President, that if we examine the history, it \nwill show the fundamental truth of the notion that this Congress should \nbe involved in expanding, and not restricting, individual liberty, that \nwe should not involve the Federal Government in decisions that will \nrestrict liberty, indeed, if anything, we should involve our Government \nin providing people with opportunities to contribute to the total of \nour society to the maximum extent of their ability and to be whoever \nthey are within the context of this society.\n\n  That, indeed, is what freedom, that, indeed, is what the whole \nconstitutional framework is about in this country, as I understand it, \nand as many people understand it who hold sacred the promise of freedom \nand independence that this declaration gives us. Strides have been \nmade, Madam President, to provide gay and lesbian Americans the equal \nprotection of the laws, but DOMA is a retreat from that goal.\n  Finally, Madam President, I point out to anyone who is listening to \nthe debate, not only the divisive nature of the debate which, of \ncourse, becomes pretty apparent, but the fact that it is almost curious \nthat the very people who argue against the Federal Government as an \nactivist Federal Government, the very people who argue in favor of \nsmaller Government, have absolutely no compunction about encouraging \nthe Federal Government to expand its activism, to expand its role, and \nexpand its intrusiveness into our everyday lives when it comes to their \nown agenda. If the agenda has to do with restricting liberty, it is OK \nto have an expanded Federal role. When the agenda relates to \nencouraging expanding opportunity, then that is when they cry foul and \nargue we should have smaller Government.\n  Indeed, this legislation represents just the opposite of smaller \nGovernment. It represents an intrusion by the Federal Government in \nareas that we have never trod before. It represents a decimation of a \nconcept of a United States of America by striking at the heart of the \nfull faith and credit clause which binds us together, and it tears us \napart as Americans, and it sets up a point of controversy between and \namong the States that ought not be here.\n  I hope that every person on this floor and every person who is going \nto look at and vote on this bill considers for a moment what the \njudgment of history might be, if 50 years from now their grandchildren \nlook at their debate and look at their words in support of this mean-\nspirited legislation, and consider the judgment that will be cast upon \nthem then.\n  I had for a moment thought to bring to this floor some of the floor \ndebate and some of the debate that happened during the civil rights era \nwhen the very same arguments that are being made in favor of this \nlegislation were made in favor of keeping African Americans in second \nclass citizenship in this country. Those arguments ultimately failed. \nAnd as Dr. King pointed out, he said, ``The arc of history is long, but \nit bends towards justice.''\n  I hope that we will not contribute to the retarding of that arc in \nthe direction of justice, that we will all recognize that this is an \ninappropriate legislative activity by the Federal Government, and that \nwe leave it up to the States in their wisdom to decide what kind of \ndomestic relations arrangements they will or will not allow, and that \nwe allow, in the final analysis, for the opportunity of every American \nto enjoy the same protections under the law as every other American and \nthat we do not single out gay and lesbian Americans for second class \nstatus and as second class citizens by legislation labeled specifically \nto their domestic relations when we have never legislated in that area \nbefore in this body. On that point, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I rise in support of the Defense of \nMarriage Act. My objective this morning is to, No. 1, define what it is \nthat we are here to protect, and No. 2, to define constitutionally what \nthis issue is all about, because I sense that there is a great deal of \nmisunderstanding in the country as to what we are trying to do.\n  I will talk very briefly about the Hawaii case and why we are here \ndealing with this issue. I would like to talk about its potential \nimpact on other States, such as my State, Texas and then I would like \nto talk about a secondary, but nonetheless important, issue: the \neconomic ramifications of what we are doing.\n  Let me be the first to say that the traditional family has stood for \n5,000 years. There is no moment in recorded history when the \ntraditional family was not recognized and sanctioned by a civilized \nsociety--it is the oldest institution that exists. The traditional \nfamily is found in the oldest writings of mankind, and is an \ninstitution which people decided was so important for happiness and \nprogress that it was worth singling out and was worth giving special \nstatus above all other contracts in terms of a relationship among \npeople.\n  So when some question what, 50 years from now, we are going to think \nabout those are defending the traditional family today, I would just \nremind them that the traditional family has stood as the seminal \ninstitution which has formed the foundation for civilized society for \nsome 5,000 years. While I am confident that there will be Senators \ndebating other issues 50 years from now, I am even more confident that \nif, at that time, our society is one which we treasure and one which we \nadmire and love, then it will be a society which respects and \nrecognizes the special status of the traditional family.\n\n  We are here today because the traditional family is important to \nAmerica. Further, it has always been important to civilization. Our \nFounders recognize that, and they set out a procedure in the \nConstitution which is as clear as any procedure could be as to what is \nCongress' role in this matter.\n  Let me begin by referring you to article IV, section 1, of the \nConstitution.\n\n[[Page S10106]]\n\n Article IV, section 1 says: ``Full faith and credit shall be given in \neach State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of \nevery other State. And the Congress may by general Laws prescribe the \nManner in which such Acts, Records, and Proceedings shall be proved, \nand the Effect thereof.''\n  In other words, article IV, section 1 of the Constitution requires \nStates to recognize the contracts, the judicial proceedings, and the \npublic records of every other State. Obviously, at the top of this list \nwould be marriages. But it specifically gives Congress the power to \nprescribe under what circumstances such recognition will occur.\n  My first point is, those who say Congress has no role in this issue \nneed only read the second sentence of article IV, section 1 of the \nConstitution to see that Congress has the only role in prescribing the \ncircumstance under which one State must recognize a marriage that \noccurs in another State. We are here today doing exactly what the \nFounding Fathers prescribed in the Constitution that we should do.\n  Now, where did this issue come from? Well, its roots come from the \nfact that the Hawaiian constitution outlaws discrimination based on \nsex--basically, they have an equal rights amendment. In 1991, three \ndifferent groups of people argued that they, in trying to engage in a \nsame-sex marriage, were being discriminated against on the basis of \nsex, and that this violated the equal rights amendment written into the \nconstitution of Hawaii. Essentially, their argument was that when two \nwomen or two men are denied a marriage license, one of them is being \ndiscriminated against based on the fact that they are of the same sex \nas the other person applying for the license. This is the foundation of \nthe current judicial proceedings in Hawaii.\n  The Supreme Court in Hawaii ruled on this equal rights argument and \nsent the case back to the lower court, with the instructions that the \nlower court, in order to deny these three groups of people a marriage \nlicense, had to show that the State had an overriding interest in this \nissue. Now, obviously, we are hopeful such a case can be made and that \nthe ruling will be in favor of preserving the special union between a \nman and a woman which forms the foundation of our traditional family.\n  The point is if the Hawaii court rules under the equal rights \namendment of the Hawaii constitution--a provision that is not in the \nU.S. Constitution, though it was long debated as a potential addition--\nif the court rules in favor of single-sex marriages on the basis of sex \ndiscrimination, a failure to pass the Defense of Marriage Act here \ntoday will require the State of Texas, the State of Kansas, and every \nother State in the Union to recognize and give full faith and credit to \nsingle-sex marriages which occur in Hawaii.\n  There are those who say this is not a congressional matter, that it \nshould be left up to the courts, but if this is left up to the courts, \nunder article IV, section 1 of the U.S. Constitution, they will have no \nchoice except to impose same-sex marriages on Texas, so long as they \nare sanctioned by Hawaii.\n  The Constitution allows Congress--in fact, gives us the \nresponsibility--to prescribe the manner in which such acts, records, \nand proceedings shall be proved and the effect thereof. What we are \ndoing today in this bill is saying three things: No. 1, we are saying \nthat there can be no question, as far as Federal law is concerned, that \nStates have the right to ban same-sex marriages.\n\n  No. 2, we are saying that marriage is defined as a union between a \nman and a woman, and, therefore, with regard to the requirements of the \nfull faith and credit clause, no matter what happens in Hawaii or any \nother State, no other State will be required to recognize a same-sex \nmarriage as a traditional marriage.\n  Finally, we are saying that the Federal Government, itself, will \nrecognize only marriages that occur between a man and a woman.\n  Now, let me talk very briefly about the economic ramifications of \nthis. Speaking as a person who used to practice economics, when \ncompared to the power of the family as the foundation of our \ncivilization and our culture, dollars and cents--in this context--are \nnot terribly important. But, as a secondary issue, they are important, \nand let me explain where.\n  A failure to pass this bill, if the Hawaii court rules in favor of \nsame-sex marriages, will create, through the full faith and credit \nprovision of the Constitution, a whole group of new beneficiaries--no \none knows what the number would be--tens of thousands, hundreds of \nthousands, potentially more--who will be beneficiaries of newly created \nsurvivor benefits under Social Security, Federal retirement plans, and \nmilitary retirement plans. It will trigger a whole group of new \nbenefits under Federal health plans. And not only will it trigger these \nbenefits for the Federal Government, but under the full faith and \ncredit provision of the Constitution, it will impose--through teacher \nretirement plans, State retirement plans, State medical plans, and even \nrailroad retirement plans--a whole new set of benefits and expenses \nwhich have not been planned or budgeted for under current law.\n  So here are the issues in very simple fashion: No. 1, is there \nanything unique about the traditional family? For every moment of \nrecorded history, we have said yes. In every major religion in history, \nfrom the early Greek myths of the ``Iliad'' and the ``Odyssey'' to the \noldest writings of the Bible to the oldest teachings of civilization, \ngovernments have recognized the traditional family as the foundation of \nprosperity and happiness, and in democratic societies, as the \nfoundation of freedom. Human beings have always given traditional \nmarriage a special sanction. Not that there cannot be contracts among \nindividuals, but there is something unique about the traditional family \nin terms of what it does for our society and the foundation it \nprovides--this is something that every civilized society in 5,000 years \nof recorded history has recognized. Are we so wise today that we are \nready to reject 5,000 years of recorded history? I do not think so. I \nthink that even the greatest society in the history of the world--which \nwe have here today in the United States of America--that even a society \nas great as our own trifles with the traditional family at great peril \nto itself.\n  I intend to vote for the Defense of Marriage Act today because I want \nto defend, protect, and even perpetuate this historical recognition of \nthe traditional family as the foundation for society. I believe the \nFederal Government is given clear a role in this debate by article IV, \nsection 1 of the Constitution, which allows Congress to prescribe the \nmanner in which such acts, records, and proceedings shall be proved and \nthe effect thereof. To fail to exercise our constitutional \nresponsibility would mean that States which would not otherwise choose \nto recognize same-sex marriages would be forced to do so, if in this \ncase Hawaii grants that recognition.\n  To say that we should stay out of this issue is to simply endorse \nsame-sex marriages. I believe that we have an obligation to act. I \nbelieve this is a very clear, defining issue and I think it is one of \nthose issues where it ought to be very clear where everybody stands. I \nstand with the traditional family. I do not believe 5,000 years of \nrecorded history have been in error. I believe the traditional family--\nthe union of a man and a woman, upon which our entire civilization is \nbased--is unique, and I believe it is the foundation of our prosperity, \nour freedom, and our happiness. I want to defend this and I am \nconfident that we will do so on this very day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I will not need much more than 10 minutes \nor so.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I think if you can do it in 10 minutes, that would be \nall right.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I listened to my colleague, the Senator \nfrom Texas--and we will hear from others on this floor--talk about the \nneed to defend marriages and to affirm a traditional marriage and to \nassert that this vote is somehow a vote that will define who is for \ntraditional marriage and who is not.\n  Well, I don't agree with that definition of what this vote is about, \nand I do not want my feelings about, or opinions about, marriage or \ntraditional marriage to be somehow tailored by political definitions. I \nam not for same- \n\n[[Page S10107]]\n\nsex marriage. I have said that publicly. I would not vote for same-sex \nmarriage.\n  I do not believe that this vote is specifically about defending \nmarriage in America. I am going to vote against this bill. I will vote \nagainst this bill, though I am not for same-sex marriage, because I \nbelieve that this debate is fundamentally ugly, and it is fundamentally \npolitical, and it is fundamentally flawed.\n  The Defense of Marriage Act declares today on the floor of the Senate \nwhat most Americans think is pretty obvious. It declares what no State \nhas adopted to the contrary, and won't, I imagine, for some time. In \nfact, the trend among States is to the contrary, no State withstanding \nthat trend. Therefore, I suppose we really should not be surprised that \nthe U.S. Senate is spending its time in an exercise of this kind, which \nought to properly feed the cynicism that already attaches to so much of \nwhat we do in Washington.\n  The truth that we know, which today's exercise ignores, is that \nmarriages fall apart in the United States, not because men and women \nare under siege by a mass movement of men marrying men or women \nmarrying women. Marriages fall apart because men and women don't stay \nmarried. The real threat comes from the attitudes of many men and women \nmarried to each other and from the relationships of people in the \nopposite sex, not the same sex. Yet, this legislation is directed at \nsomething that has not happened and which needs no Federal \nintervention.\n  Obviously, the results of this bill will not be to preserve anything, \nbut will serve to attack a group of people out of various motives and \nrationales, and certainly out of a lack of understanding and a lack of \ntolerance, and will only serve the purposes of the political season.\n\n  If this were truly a defense of marriage act, it would expand the \nlearning experience for would-be husbands and wives. It would provide \nfor counseling for all troubled marriages, not just for those who can \nafford it. It would provide treatment on demand for those with alcohol \nand substance abuse, or with the pernicious and endless invasions of \ntheir own abuse as children that they never break away from. It would \nexpand the Violence Against Women Act. It would guarantee day care for \nevery family that struggles and needs it. It would expand the \ncurriculum in schools to expose high school students to a greater set \nof practical life choices. It would guarantee that our children would \nbe able to read when they leave high school. It would expand the \nopportunity for adoptions. It would expand the protection of abused \nchildren. It would help children do things after school other than to \ngo out and perhaps have unwanted teenage pregnancies. It would help \naugment Boys Clubs and Girls Clubs, YMCA's and YWCA's, school-to-work, \nand other alternatives so young people can grow into healthy, \nproductive adults and have healthy adult relationships. But we all know \nthe truth. The truth is that mistakes will be made and marriages will \nfail. But these are ways that we could truly defend marriage in \nAmerica.\n  Mr. President, this bill is not necessary. No State has adopted same-\nsex marriage. We have a judicial question before the court in Hawaii, \nand it is astonishing to me that the very people who make the loudest \nand most continuous arguments about Federal mandates and Federal \nintrusion and leaving the States to their own devices and let the \nStates work their will, before any State in the country has made a \nchoice to do otherwise those very people are leading the charge to have \nthe Federal Government not just intervene, but intervene with a power \ngrab that reaches, unconstitutionally, to do things that you cannot do \nby statute.\n  I oppose this legislation because not only is it meant to divide \nAmericans, but it is fundamentally unconstitutional, regardless of what \nyour views are.\n  DOMA is unconstitutional. There is no single Member of the U.S. \nSenate who believes that it is within the Senate's power to strip away \nthe word or spirit of a constitutional clause by simple statute.\n  DOMA would, de facto, add a section to our Constitution's full faith \nand credit clause, article IV, section 1, to allow the States not to \nrecognize the legal marriage in another State. That is in direct \nconflict with the very specific understandings interpreted by the \nSupreme Court of the clause itself.\n  The clause states--simple words--``Full faith and credit shall be \ngiven''--not ``may be given,'' ``shall be given''--``in each State to \nthe public Acts, Records and judicial Proceedings of every other \nState.'' It says:\n\n       And the Congress may by general Laws prescribe the Manner \n     in which such Acts, Records and Proceedings shall be proved, \n     and the Effect thereof.\n\n  It doesn't say no effect. It doesn't say can nullify. It doesn't say \ncan obviate or avoid. It says it has to show how you merely \nprocedurally prove that the act spoken of has taken place, and if it \nhas taken place, then what is the full effect of that act in giving \nfull faith and credit to that State.\n  I think any schoolchild could understand that allowing States to not \naccept the public act of another is the exact opposite of what the \nFounding Fathers laid forth in the clause itself. Let me repeat:\n\n       Full faith and credit shall be given in each State to the \n     public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other \n     State.\n\n  Now, if we intend to change it--and that is a different vote than \nhaving the constitutional process properly adhered to. But it seems to \nme that what Congress is doing is allowing a State to ignore another \nState's acts, and every law that Congress has ever passed has invoked \nthe full faith and credit of another State's legislation.\n  All of these laws share a basic common denominator. They all \nimplement the full faith and credit mandate. They do not restrict it. \nNot once has it been restricted in that way. For example, the Parental \nKidnapping Prevention Act of 1990 provided the States have to enforce \nchild custody determinations made by other States. The Full Faith and \nCredit for Child Support Orders of 1994 provided that States have to \nenforce child support determinations made by other States. It did not \nsay you could not do it. It did not say you could avoid it. It did not \ndiminish it. It said you have to enforce it. The Safe Homes for Women \nAct of 1994 required States to recognize protective orders issued in \nother States with regard to domestic violence.\n  Those laws are the products of constitutional exercises of the \nappropriate congressional law in implementing the full faith and credit \nclause. The bill before us, a statute, is the exact opposite. It is an \nextreme unconstitutional attempt to restrict and undermine the basic \nfundamental approach which helps create the concept of a unified and \nsingle nation. Madam President, this bill is not just unconstitutional. \nIt is not just unprecedented.\n\n  It is also unnecessary.\n  Right now, as we speak, there is no rash outbreak among the States to \nrecognize same-sex marriage.\n  In fact, States--one after another--are moving in the opposite \ndirection. For example, the State of Michigan passed a law which \ndefines marriage as the union between a man and a woman and declares \nMichigan will not recognize a same-sex marriage conducted in another \nState.\n  This bill is a solution in search of a problem.\n  Madam President, even if the Hawaiian Supreme Court decides to \nrecognize same-sex marriage, Michigan and a dozen other States have \nspoken against it. Resolving this tension rests squarely with the \njudicial branch, not the Congress. This is a power grab into States' \nrights of monumental proportions.\n  Madam President, it is ironic that many of the arguments for this \npower grab are echoes of the discussion of interracial marriage a \ngeneration ago.\n  Nearly 30 years ago, this country and this body heard similar \narguments against striking State laws criminalizing interracial \nmarriage. And, the issue was resolved by the Supreme Court in the case \nLoving versus Virginia.\n  Until the Loving case was decided, many southern States had laws \nbanning interracial marriage. When the Supreme Court ruled that this \nban was unconstitutional, one Congressman from Louisiana felt compelled \nto come to the floor of the Senate and rail against the decision in \naddition to the nomination of Thurgood Marshall. He said, ``this shows \nhow far we are removed from the ideas of our Founding\n\n[[Page S10108]]\n\nFathers. The Justices of the Court interpret laws not on the basis of \ntwo centuries of wisdom, but rather in line with current social fads \nand their own personal theories on how to create the perfect society.''\n  But that Congressman was wrong 30 years ago. And, thankfully the \nCourt exhibited wisdom in overturning the ban. What if they had not? \nPointedly and poignantly, Leon Higginbotham, Chief Justice Emeritus of \nthe Third U.S. Court of Appeals, answers the question for us. He states \nthat ``if the Virginia courts had been sustained by the United States \nSupreme Court, Clarence Thomas could have been in the penitentiary \ntoday rather than serving as an Associate Justice of the Supreme \nCourt.''\n  Madam President, as late as 1981, in the midst of a discrimination \ncase, a U.S. Senator threw his support behind a university which banned \ninterracial dating and marriage. Defending a ban on interracial \nmarriage in the 1980s.\n\n  Madam President, DOMA is unconstitutional, unprecedented and \nunnecessary. Again, I return to the original questions: What is its \nlegislative purpose? What is its motivation? What does passage of this \nbill mean for the country?\n  It is hard to believe that this bill is anything other than a thinly \nveiled attempt to score political debating points by scapegoating gay \nand lesbian Americans. That is politics at its worst, Mr. President. It \nis a perfect exemplar of the polarizing issues E.J. Dionne describes in \nhis book, ``Why Americans Hate Politics.''\n  In the past few years, legislative attacks on gay people have \nincreased in frequency and scope. Trying to keep gay men and lesbians \nout of the armed services. Trying to keep AIDS educational materials \nfree of any mention of homosexuality. Trying to take away the children \nof gay parents.\n  Certainly the struggle for civil rights is a long one and individual \nprejudices are difficult to overcome. The great civil rights teacher \nMartin Luther King observed:\n\n       It is pretty difficult to like some people. Like is \n     sentimental and it is pretty difficult to like someone \n     bombing your home; it is pretty difficult to like somebody \n     threatening your children; it is difficult to like \n     congressmen who spend all of their time trying to defeat \n     civil rights. But Jesus says love them, and love is greater \n     than like.\n\n  Madam President, that is the ultimate irony. For a bill which \npurports to defend and regulate marriage, there has been so little talk \nof love here in this Chamber.\n  Madam President, as we quickly approach the end of the millennium, \nthe problems facing average Americans and the pressures experienced by \nthe American family are overwhelming--personal debt and bankruptcies \nare at an all-time high, divorce rates are skyrocketing, schools are \ncrumbling, education costs are astronomical and health care costs \ncontinue to rise.\n  It is clear the Congress should be alleviating the pressures of the \nAmerican family. That would be the best defense of marriage. If we want \nto defend marriage, we should be working to change the ugly reality of \nspousal abuse. We should be redoubling our efforts to eradicate \nalcohol, drug and other forms of substance abuse. We should acknowledge \nthe pernicious ramifications of abandonment.\n  And we should commit our collective resources to creating educational \nopportunities for Americans, to securing health care and to easing the \neconomic burden too many people feel today. We should bring Americans \ntogether with common purpose and empower individuals and communities to \nease the pressure of today's increasingly complicated everyday life.\n  This bill does not bring people together. In fact, it does the exact \nopposite. It divides Americans. It is a stark reminder that all \ncitizens who play by the rules, who pay their taxes and who contribute \nto the economic, social and political vibrancy of this great melting \npot do not have equal rights.\n  I would have thought that the other side would have learned by now \nthat there is a nasty boomerang effect to the politics of division. It \nrends the social and political fabric. It divides the country.\n  I have some experience with divided countries. I fought in one. I \nhave looked into the eyes of hatred, bigotry, ignorance, of raw \nunbridled passion for conflict. Look to Northern Ireland, look to \nBosnia, look to the Middle East--and see the end-product of the \npolitics of division.\n  Let us stop this division. Let us balance the budget. Let us provide \nhealth security and retirement security. Let us protect our \nenvironment.\n  And, most of all, Madam President, let us give everyone a chance for \nan education. Education is the key to overcoming ignorance, to keeping \nfamilies together, to providing a glimpse of the American dream. \nBolstering education would do more to defend marriage than anything in \nthis bill.\n  This is an unconstitutional, unprecedented, unnecessary and mean-\nspirited bill. I urge my colleagues to oppose it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used the 10 minutes allowed.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Do I have control of 45 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, the Senator does.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, the senior Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, in cosponsoring the Defense of Marriage Act. Although I \nam glad to work with Senator Nickles in this effort, I must admit that, \nin all of my nearly 44 years in the Congress, I never envisioned that I \nwould see a measure such as the Defense of Marriage Act.\n  It is incomprehensible to me that federal legislation would be needed \nto provide a definition of two terms that for thousands of years have \nbeen perfectly clear and unquestioned. That we have arrived at a point \nwhere the Congress of the United States must actually reaffirm in the \nstatute books something as simple as the definition of ``marriage'' and \n``spouse,'' is almost beyond my grasp. But as the current state of \nlegal affairs has shown, this bill is a necessary endeavor.\n  Mr. President, there are some who say that the Senate is not dealing \nwith a relevant matter here, that the time has not yet arrived for the \nSenate to debate this subject. I say the time is now, and this is a \nrelevant matter. Action by the Senate and debate by the Senate are not \nsomething that should be delayed and put off until another day.\n  Let me read from ``The Case For Same-Sex Marriage,'' by William N. \nEskridge, Jr.\n  Now, the author of this treatise supports same-sex marriage. Let me \nread extracts from the treatise which clearly indicate that this is a \nmatter that is relevant. It is relevant now. Reading from page 46:\n\n       Many of the gay marriages have been performed by religious \n     groups formed specifically for the gay, lesbian and bisexual \n     faithful.\n       The situation is more complicated among mainstream \n     religious denominations. A few are openly supportive of gay \n     marriages or unions. Following a vote on the matter in 1984, \n     the Unitarian Universalist Association now affirms the \n     growing practice of some of its ministers of conducting \n     services of union of gay and lesbian couples and urges member \n     societies to support their ministers in this practice. The \n     Society of Friends leaves all issues to congregational \n     decision and thousands of same-sex marriages have been \n     sanctified in Quaker ceremonies since the 1970's. Other \n     denominations are still studying the issue.\n       The validity of same-sex marriage has been debated at the \n     national level by the Presbyterian, Episcopal, Lutheran and \n     Methodist churches.\n\n  So why not debate it here, Mr. President.\n       A committee of Episcopal bishops proposed in 1994 that \n     homosexual relationships need and should receive the pastoral \n     care of the church, but the church diluted and downgraded the \n     report. After intense debate also in 1994, the General \n     Assembly of the Presbyterian Church USA adopted a resolution \n     that its ministers are not permitted to bless same-sex \n     unions. The Lutheran Church in 1993 debated but did not adopt \n     a report advocating the blessing and legal recognition of \n     same-sex unions. The Methodists followed a similar path in \n     1992.\n       The pattern in these denominations has been the following: \n     an individual church will bless a same-sex union or marriage \n     and the ministers and theologians then call for a study of \n     the issue. A report is written that is open to the idea. The \n     report ignites a firestorm of protests from traditionalists \n     in the denomination. The issue is suppressed or rejected at \n     the denominational level. Local churches and theologians \n     again press the issue some years later and the cycle begins \n     again. My guess--\n\n\n[[Page S10109]]\n\n\n  This is the author's guess. It is not my guess. This is a guess by \nthe author.\n\n       My guess is that one or more of the foregoing denominations \n     will tilt towards same-sex unions or marriages in the next 5 \n     to 10 years. Even the religions that are most prominently \n     opposed to gay marriages have clergy who perform gay marriage \n     ceremonies. The Roman Catholic Church firmly opposes gay \n     marriage but its celebrated priest, John J. McNeill says that \n     he and many other Catholic clergy have performed same-sex \n     commitment services. Although Father McNeill's position is \n     marginalized within the Catholic Church, it reflects the \n     views of many devout Catholics. Support for same-sex marriage \n     is probably most scarce among Baptists in the South.\n\n  The author says this:\n\n       You can be assured that same-sex marriage is an issue that \n     has arrived worldwide and that efforts to head it off will \n     only be successful in the short term.\n\n  So, Mr. President, to those who say that it is not yet time to debate \nthis issue, let them read from the book, ``The Case for Same-Sex \nMarriage'' and hear what an advocate of same-sex marriage says.\n\n       You can be assured that same-sex marriage is an issue that \n     has arrived, worldwide, and that efforts to head it off will \n     only be successful in the short term.\n\n  The author closes the chapter as follows:\n\n       The argument of this book is that Western culture \n     generally, and the United States in particular, ought to and \n     must recognize same-sex marriages.\n\n  Therefore, Mr. President, the time is now, the place is here, to \ndebate this issue. It confronts us now. It comes ever nearer.\n  There are those who say, ``Why does the Senate not debate and act \nupon relevant matters?'' This is relevant. And it is relevant today.\n  In very simple and easy to read language, this bill says that a \nmarriage is the legal union between one man and one woman as husband \nand wife, and that a spouse is a husband or wife of the opposite sex. \nThere is not, of course, anything earth-shaking in that declaration. We \nare not breaking any new ground here. We are not setting any new \nprecedent. We are not overturning the status quo in any way, shape or \nform. On the contrary, all this bill does is reaffirm for purposes of \nFederal law what is already understood by everyone.\n  Mr. President, throughout the annals of human experience, in dozens \nof civilizations and cultures of varying value systems, humanity has \ndiscovered that the permanent relationship between men and women is a \nkeystone to the stability, strength, and health of human society--a \nrelationship worthy of legal recognition and judicial protection. The \npurpose of this kind of union between human beings of opposite gender \nis primarily for the establishment of a home atmosphere in which a man \nand a woman pledge themselves exclusively to one another and who bring \ninto being children for the fulfilment of their love for one another \nand for the greater good of the human community at large.\n  Obviously, human beings enter into a variety of relationships. \nBusiness partnerships, friendships, alliances for mutual benefits, and \nteam memberships all depend upon emotional unions of one degree or \nanother. For that reason, a number of these relationships have found \nstanding under the laws of innumerable nations.\n  However, in no case, has anyone suggested that these relationships \ndeserve the special recognition or the designation commonly understood \nas ``marriage.'' The suggestion that relationships between members of \nthe same gender should ever be accorded the status or the designation \nof marriage flies in the face of the thousands of years of experience \nabout the societal stability that traditional marriage has afforded \nhuman civilization. To insist that male-male or female-female \nrelationships must have the same status as the marriage relationship is \nmore than unwise, it is patently absurd.\n\n  Out of such relationships children do not result. Of course, children \ndo not always result from marriages as we have traditionally known \nthem. But out of same-sex relationships no children can result. Out of \nsuch relationships emotional bonding oftentimes does not take place, \nand many such relationships do not result in the establishment of \n``families'' as society universally interprets that term. Indeed, as \nhistory teaches us too often in the past, when cultures waxed casual \nabout the uniqueness and sanctity of the marriage commitment between \nmen and women, those cultures have been shown to be in decline. This \nwas particularly true in the ancient world in Greece and, more \nparticularly, in Rome. In both Greece and Rome, same-sex relationships \nwere not uncommon, particularly among the upper classes. Plato and \nAristotle referred to the existence of such relationships in their \nwritings, as did Plutarch, the Greek biographer.\n  Homer, the Greek epic poet, in the ``Iliad,'' wrote of the love \nrelationship that existed between Achilles and Patroclus. Homer relates \nthat after Patroclus was slain by Hector, Patroclus appeared to \nAchilles in a dream saying, ``Do not lay my bones apart from yours, \nAchilles. Let one urn cover my bones with yours, that golden, two-\nhandled urn that your mother so graciously gave you.''\n  As to the Romans, Cicero mentioned casually that a former consul, who \nwas Catiline's lover, approached him on Catiline's behalf. This was \nundoubtedly during the time of the ``Catiline Conspiracy,'' which took \nplace in the years 63 and 62 A.D.\n  Suetonius, the Roman biographer, relates that Julius Caesar \nprostituted his body to be abused by King Nicomedes of Bithynia, and \nthat Curio the Elder, in an oration, called Caesar ``a woman for all \nmen and a man for all women.''\n  While same-sex relations were not unknown, therefore, to the \nancients, same-sex marriages were a different matter. But they did \nsometimes involve utilization of the forms and the customs of \nheterosexual marriage. For example, the Emperor Nero, who reigned \nbetween 54 and 68 A.D., took the marriage vows with a young man named \nSporus, in a very public ceremony, with a gown and a veil and with all \nof the solemnities of matrimony, after which Nero took this Sporus with \nhim, carried on a litter, all decked out with ornaments and jewels and \nthe finery normally worn by empresses, and traveled to the resort towns \nin Greece and Italy, Nero, ``many a time, sweetly kissing him.''\n  Juvenal, the Roman satirical poet, wrote concerning a same-sex \nwedding, by way of a dialog:\n\n       ``I have a ceremony to attend tomorrow morning.''\n       ``What sort of ceremony?''\n       ``Nothing special, just a gentleman friend of mine who is \n     marrying another man and a small group has been invited.''\n\n  Subsequently in the dialog, ``Gracchus has given a dowry of 400 \nsesterces, signed the marriage tablets, said the blessing, held a great \nbanquet, and the new bride now reclines on his husband's lap.''\n  Juvenal looked upon such marriages disapprovingly, and as an example \nthat should not be followed.\n  Mr. President, the marriage bond as recognized in the Judeo-Christian \ntradition, as well as in the legal codes of the world's most advanced \nsocieties, is the cornerstone on which the society itself depends for \nits moral and spiritual regeneration as that culture is handed down, \nfather to son and mother to daughter.\n  Indeed, thousands of years of Judeo-Christian teachings leave \nabsolutely no doubt as to the sanctity, purpose, and reason for the \nunion of man and woman. One has only to turn to the Old Testament and \nread the word of God to understand how eternal is the true definition \nof marriage.\n  Mr. President, I am rapidly approaching my 79th birthday, and I hold \nin my hands a Bible, the Bible that was in my home when I was a child. \nThis is the Bible that was read to me by my foster father. It is a \nBible, the cover of which having been torn and worn, has been replaced. \nBut this is the Bible, the King James Bible. And here is what it says \nin the first chapter of Genesis, 27th and 28th verses:\n\n       So God created man in his own image, in the image of God \n     created he him; male and female created he them.\n       And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, \n     and multiply, and replenish the earth . . .\n\n  And when God used the word ``multiply,'' he wasn't talking about \nmultiplying your stocks, bonds, your bank accounts or your cattle on a \nthousand hills or your race horses or your acreages of land. He was \ntalking about procreation, multiplying, populating the Earth.\n\n[[Page S10110]]\n\n  And after the flood, when the only humans who were left on the globe \nwere Noah and his wife and his sons and their wives, the Bible says in \nchapter 9 of Genesis:\n\n       And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be \n     fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.\n\n  Christians also look at the Gospel of Saint Mark, chapter 10, which \nstates:\n\n       But from the beginning of the creation God made them male \n     and female.\n       For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and \n     cleave to his wife;\n       And they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more \n     twain, but one flesh.\n       What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put \n     asunder.\n\n  Woe betide that society, Mr. President, that fails to honor that \nheritage and begins to blur that tradition which was laid down by the \nCreator in the beginning.\n  Moreover, the drive being spearheaded by a small segment of today's \nculture reflects a demand for ``political correctness'' gone berserk. I \nthink of Muzzey, who wrote the American history text that I studied in \n1927, 1928, 1929, who said in the very first sentence, ``America is the \nchild of Europe.'' Now, Muzzey would have been hooted out of town for \nbeing ``politically incorrect'' in having said that. But that was \nnothing as compared with this.\n  This reflects a demand for political correctness that has gone \nberserk. We live in an era in which tolerance has progressed beyond a \nmere call for acceptance and crossed over to become a demand for the \nrest of us to give up beliefs that we revere and hold most dear in \norder to prove our collective purity. At some point, a line must be \ndrawn by rational men and women who are willing to say, ``Enough!''\n  Certainly in today's far too permissive world, traditional marriage \nas an institution is struggling. Divorce is far too frequent, as are \nmale and female relationships which do not end in marriage. Certainly \nwe do not want to launch a further assault on the institution of \nmarriage by blurring its definition in this unwise way.\n  The drive for the acceptance of same-sex or same-gender ``marriage'' \nshould serve for us as an indication that we have drawn too close to \nthe edge and that we as a people are on the verge of trying so hard to \nplease a few that we destroy the values and the spiritual beliefs of \nthe many. Moreover, to seek the codification of same-sex marriage into \nour national or State legal codes is to make a mockery of those codes \nthemselves. Many legal scholars believe that only after a majority of \nsociety comes to a consensus on the legality or illegality of one issue \nor another should that issue be written down in our legal institutions. \nThe drive for same-sex marriage is, in effect, an effort to make a \nsneak attack on society by encoding this aberrant behavior in legal \nform before society itself has decided it should be legal--a \nproposition which is far in the distance, if ever to be realized.\n  Mr. President, I have heard arguments to the effect that the bill may \nbe unconstitutional. I totally disagree with that.\n  Insofar as the proposal would relate to State recognition of same-sex \nmarriages contracted in other States, Congress is empowered by the full \nfaith and credit clause, article IV, section 1 of the Constitution, to \nenact ``general Laws prescrib[ing] the Manner'' in which such Acts of \nother States ``shall be proved, and the Effect thereof.''\n  Congress has from the beginning placed on the books implementing \nlegislation, and it has in recent years enacted more limited statutes \nrelating to child support and custody.\n  Opponents of the present bill argue that while Congress has authority \nto pass laws that enable acts, judgments and the like to be given \neffect in other States, it has no constitutional power to pass a law \npermitting States to deny full faith and credit to another State's laws \nand judgment. There is no judicial precedent one way or another on this \nissue, but it is not at all clear why a general empowering of Congress \nto ``prescribe * * * the effect'' of public acts does not give it \ndiscretion to define the ``effect'' so that a particular public act is \nnot due full faith and credit. The plain reading of the clause would \nseem to encompass both expansion and contraction.\n\n  However, the argument con and the response assumes that the full \nfaith and credit clause would obligate States to recognize same-sex \nmarriages contracted in States in which they are authorized. This \nconclusion is far from evident. It is clear that the clause mandates \nrecognition by other States of the judgments of the courts with \njurisdiction in another State. But controversy has always attended \nconsideration of the question of what the clause obligates States to do \nwith respect to the ``public acts'' of other States. The judicial \ndecisions are mixed, but ``public acts'' have never been accorded the \nsame recognition as judicial judgments. States have generally been \nrecognized to have the discretion to refuse cognizance of ``public \nacts'' that are contrary to their own public policy. Thus, in \nprescribing the ``effect'' on States of State laws that permit or \nauthorize same-sex marriages, Congress may be deemed to be exercising \nauthority under the full faith and credit clause to settle an issue not \ndefinitive within the clause itself.\n  The actual policy of the States in recognizing marriages contracted \nin other States to persons who would not be permitted to marry in the \nState in which the issue arises is mixed. The general tendency, based \non comity rather than on compulsion under the full faith and credit \nclause, is to recognize marriages contracted in other States even \nthough they could not have been celebrated in the recognizing State. \nThe trend in such promulgations as the Restatement (Second) of \nConflicts of Laws and the Uniform Marriage and Divorce Act was to \nrecognize marriages everywhere if they were legal where contracted. But \na ``public policy'' exception has been asserted, and, recently, as the \nHawaii litigation has proceeded, several States have enacted laws \ndeclaring recognition of same-sex marriages to be contrary to the \npublic policy of those States.\n  Thus, it cannot be said that Congress would be contracting a right \nheretofore clearly prescribed by the full faith and credit clause.\n  There are constitutional constraints upon Federal legislation. The \nrelevant one to be considered is the equal protection clause and the \neffect of the Supreme Court's decision in Romer versus Evans. Struck \ndown under the equal protection clause was a referendum-adopted \nprovision of the Colorado constitution, which repealed local ordinances \nthat provided civil rights protections for gay persons and which \nprohibited all legislative, executive or judicial action at any level \nof State or local government if that action was designed to protect \nhomosexuals. The Court held that under the equal protection clause, \nlegislation adverse to homosexuals was to be scrutinized under a \n``rational basis'' standard of review. The classification failed to \npass this review, because it imposed a special disability on \nhomosexuals not visited on any other class of people and it could not \nbe justified by any of the arguments made by the State.\n  The impact of the case, and in other areas of governmental action \nadversely affecting gays, cannot be clearly discerned. Despite the \nCourt's use of the rational basis standard, the opinion appears to view \nwith skepticism the differential treatment of homosexuals as a class. \nAt the least, we can say that the case requires the DOMA, if it becomes \nlaw, to be evaluated under the equal protection clause. That evaluation \nneed not be fatal to the law. The proposal does adversely classify \nhomosexuals as a class in defining what status, under the full faith \nand credit clause, States must accord.\n\n  The law would not preclude any State from recognizing such marriages. \nThe Colorado amendment fell, not solely because of its differential \nclassification but because the Court concluded, first, that the law was \nintended to affect adversely homosexuals as a class, and, second, that \nno rational basis could be asserted for the adverse treatment.\n  The proposal has been presented as one that would protect federalism \ninterests and State sovereignty in the area of domestic relations, \nhistorically a subject of almost exclusive State concern. It is \npresented as a measure that permits, but does not require, States to \ndeny recognition to same-sex marriages contracted in other States,\n\n[[Page S10111]]\n\naffording States with strong public policy concerns the discretion to \neffectuate that policy. Thus, while the proposal adversely affects \nhomosexuals as a class, it can be argued that it is grounded not in \nhostility to homosexuals, not in a legislative decision to target \nhomosexuals because of their homosexuality, but to afford the States \nthe discretion to act as their public policy on same-sex marriages \ndictates.\n  So, Mr. President, I am not here today to blast anyone. I am not here \ntoday to lash out at anybody. I am not here today to attack anybody. I \nam here saying that we need to recognize this age-old institution of \nmarriage for what it is, what it always has been under the Judeo-\nChristian concepts of human experience--the marriage union of male and \nfemale.\n  On a more pragmatic level although no less important, this bill also \naddresses concerns with respect to the matter of Federal benefits. As I \nam sure my colleagues are aware, although many other Americans may not \nbe, the Federal Government extends certain benefits and privileges to \npersons who are married, but in almost all cases those benefits are \ngiven on the basis of a State's definition of ``marriage.'' In almost \nall cases at the Federal level, there is simply no definition of the \nterms ``marriage'' or ``spouse.''\n  Indeed, the word ``marriage'' appears in more than 800 sections of \nthe Federal statutes and regulations, while the word ``spouse'' appears \nmore than 3,100 times. And, as I have said, in all but a minute number \nof those instances--namely, the Family and Medical Leave Act--those \nterms are simply not defined. Until now, of course, there has never \nbeen a need to define them. Until now. That is why to debate this issue \nis relevant.\n  As I say, in debating the issue, I am not here to bash anyone. I am \nnot here to bash anyone's personal beliefs. But if the State of Hawaii, \nor any other State, for that matter, redefines those terms, then what \nwill happen at the Federal level? Who knows, for example, what the \nSocial Security Administration is supposed to do when a so-called \n``spouse'' of a same-sex marriage walks in and attempts to collect \nsurvivors benefits under the Social Security program? What is the \nSocial Security clerk to say? Without a Federal definition--and that is \nwhat we are attempting to accomplish here--without a Federal definition \nof something that has been previously undefined, every department and \nevery agency of the Federal Government that administers public benefit \nprograms would be left in the lurch. We shall have sown the dragon's \nteeth!\n\n  Moreover, I urge my colleagues to think of the potential cost \ninvolved here. How much is it going to cost the Federal Government if \nthe definition of ``spouse'' is changed? It is not a matter of \nirrelevancy at all. It is not a matter of attacking anyone's personal \nbeliefs or personal activity. That is not my purpose here. What is the \nadded cost in Medicare and Medicaid benefits if a new meaning is \nsuddenly given to these terms? I know I do not have any reliable \nestimates of what such a change would mean, but then, I do not know of \nanyone who does. That is the point--nobody knows for sure. I do not \nthink, though, that it is inconceivable that the costs associated with \nsuch a change could amount to hundreds of millions of dollars, if not \nbillions--if not billions--of Federal taxpayer dollars.\n  Mr. President, for these reasons and others named by the opponents of \nsame-sex or gender marriage, I hope that our colleagues here in the \nSenate will demonstrate their thorough opposition to efforts to subvert \nthe traditional definition of ``marriage'' by going on record today \nagainst this very unnecessary idea.\n  Let us make clear that in our generation, at least, we understand the \nmeaning and purpose of marriage and that we affirm our trust in the \ndivine approbation--you do not have to be a preacher to say this; I am \nnot a prophet or the son of a prophet; I am not a preacher or the son \nof a preacher; one does not have to be a prophet or a preacher--to \naffirm our trust in the divine approbation of union between a man and a \nwoman, between a male and female for all time.\n  Mr. President, 41 years ago I was traveling with a House subcommittee \nof the Committee on Foreign Affairs. I visited the city of Baghdad, the \ncity of the Arabian Nights, where Ali Baba followed the 40 thieves \nthrough the streets, and from which Sinbad the Sailor departed on his \njourney to the magnetic mountain.\n  I asked an old Arab guide to take me down to the old Biblical city of \nBabylon, where one of the famous seven wonders of the world, the \nhanging gardens, was created. As I reached the old city of Babylon I \nstood on the banks of the Euphrates River, that old river that is first \nmentioned in the Book of Genesis, which like a thread runs through the \nentire Bible, the Old Testament and the New, and is mentioned again in \nthe Book of Revelation.\n  I stood on the site, or at least I was told I was standing on the \nsite of where Belshazzar, the son of Nebuchadnezzar, held a great feast \nfor 1,000 of his lords. Belshazzar took the cups that had been stolen \nfrom the temple by Nebuchadnezzar. He and his wife and concubines and \nhis colleagues drank from those vessels, and Belshazzar saw the hand of \na man writing on the plaster of the wall, over near the candlestick, \nand the hand wrote ``me'ne, me'ne, te'kel, uphar'sin'' and the \ncountenance of Belshazzar changed, his knees buckled, and his legs \ntrembled beneath him. He called in his astrologers and soothsayers and \nmagicians and said, ``Tell me what that writing means,'' but they were \nmystified. They could not interpret the writing. Then the queen told \nBelshazzar that there was a man in the kingdom who could interpret that \nwriting. So, Daniel was brought before the king and told by the king \nthat he, Daniel, would be clothed in scarlet with a golden chain around \nhis neck, and that he would become a third partner in the kingdom if he \ncould interpret that writing. Daniel interpreted the writing:\n\n       God hath numbered thy kingdom and finished it. Thou art \n     weighed in the balances and art found wanting. Thy kingdom is \n     divided and given to the Medes and Persians.\n\n  That night Belshazzar was slain by Darius the Median, and his kingdom \nwas divided.\n  Mr. President, America is being weighed in the balances. If same-sex \nmarriage is accepted, the announcement will be official, America will \nhave said that children do not need a mother and a father, two mothers \nor two fathers will be just as good.\n  This would be a catastrophe. Much of America has lost its moorings. \nNorms no longer exist. We have lost our way with a speed that is \nawesome. What took thousands of years to build is being dismantled in a \ngeneration.\n  I say to my colleagues, let us take our stand. The time is now. The \nsubject is relevant. Let us defend the oldest institution, the \ninstitution of marriage between male and female, as set forth in the \nHoly Bible. Else we, too, will be weighed in the balances and found \nwanting.\n\n  I thank all Senators and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator Byrd for that \nstatement and also for cosponsoring this legislation, and for the \noutstanding research that he did, putting it in a historical \nperspective, as well. I think his statement was very well made and I \nvery much appreciate his assistance in passing this legislation today.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] has \n10 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, yesterday I \nspoke about my views on discrimination in the workplace and on this \nDefense of Marriage Act. Today I summarize those remarks, as we head \ntoward a vote on both of these bills.\n  First, I want to say I am proud of many of the companies in this \ncountry who have endorsed ENDA, which would stop workplace \ndiscrimination against gays and lesbians, and I urge my colleagues to \njoin such blue chip companies as AT, Eastman Kodak, Genentech, \nSilicon Graphics, and Xerox, in supporting ENDA.\n  Now, there is a much longer list that I put into the Record \nyesterday, Mr. President, and I noted that many of those companies are \nbased in California and they practice a policy of not discriminating. \nAfter all, what we are talking about here is individual performance, \nand one's sexual orientation should have nothing to do with that. If \nsomeone is qualified and does a good job, they should not be \ndiscriminated\n\n[[Page S10112]]\n\nagainst for any reason, including sexual orientation. I know that most \nof us in this body in our own offices practice nondiscrimination, so it \nseems to me quite an easy thing to do. I am very hopeful we can pass \nENDA.\n  On the Defense of Marriage Act, I want to point out once again that \nthis act, in my opinion, has nothing to do with defending marriage. As \none who has been married for many years to the same person, I can truly \nsay if we want to defend marriage, we should be discussing ways that \ntruly help lift the strains and stresses on marriage. We all know what \nthose are. We all know the financial strains and stresses on marriage.\n  As a matter of fact, when I heard that we were going to be discussing \na bill called the Defense of Marriage Act, I was looking forward to \nseeing what it was because I honestly thought because it is called the \nDefense of Marriage Act that it would be doing something to help us \ndefend marriage in this country. One in two marriages does end in \ndivorce in this country, and in many cases they are tragic endings--\ntragic for the partners, tragic for the children, tragic for the \nextended families--and there are things that we could do, such things \nas paycheck security, Mr. President. Such things as pension security. \nSuch things that the Senator from Connecticut brought to us in terms of \nthe Parental Leave Act, which the President supports.\n  We ought to be looking at ways to give that additional 24 hours to \nworking families so they can spend more time if their child needs them \nat a school appointment or some special doctor's appoint. These are the \nkinds of things we ought to be looking at. These are the kind of things \nthat would defend marriage, defend families. I do not think this \nDefense of Marriage Act is about any of that.\n  I do think, however, it is about something else. I believe it is \nabout hurting a whole group of people for absolutely no reason \nwhatsoever. Not one group in this country that fights for fairness for \ngays and lesbians has asked us to legalize gay marriage here in the \nU.S. Senate. Not one Member of the House or Senate is proposing a bill \nthat would legalize gay marriage or give benefits to domestic partners. \nNot one State in the Union has recognized gay marriage at all. As a \nmatter of fact, many have absolutely said ``no'' to gay marriage.\n  So here we have a situation where we are watching a preemptive strike \non a proposal that doesn't exist. Yes, there is a court that is looking \nat the subject in Hawaii, but that decision is many years away, \naccording to legal scholars.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record pages 44 and 45 \nof the hearing on the Judiciary, where you have legal scholars telling \nus, in fact, that States will not have to recognize other States' gay \nmarriages, if they so choose.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Excerpt From the Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing on the Defense of \n                      Marriage Act, July 11, 1996\n\n       I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to you today \n     on S. 1740, the proposed Defense of Marriage Act. I will not \n     address the issues of policy that are raised by S. 1740. \n     Instead I will be speaking only to the constitutional issues, \n     which are novel, complex, and somewhat technical.\\1\\ Because \n     of the novelty and complexity of the issues, any judgments on \n     the constitutional issues must be at least a bit tentative.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ I focus throughout on section 2. I do not believe that \n     section 3 would be found unconstitutional, though it would be \n     possible to raise questions under the equal protection \n     clause, see Romer v. Evans, infra; see also W. Eskridge, \n     ``The Case for Same-Sex Marriage,'' (1996); Kuppelman, ``Why \n     Discrimination Against Lesbians and Gay Men Is Sex \n     Discrimination,'' 69 NYU L. Rev. 197 (1994).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       To summarize my view: S. 1740 is unprecedented in our \n     nation's history; it is probably either pointless or \n     unconstitutional; and while the constitutional issues are far \n     from simple, it is safe to say that S. 1740 is a \n     constitutionally ill-advised intrusion into a problem handled \n     at the state level.\n       S. 1740 responds to an old problem, not a new one, and that \n     problem--diverse state laws about marriage has been settled \n     for a long time without national intervention. Thus there is \n     a reasonable view that S. 1740 is pointless; it adds nothing \n     to current law. If S. 1740 is not pointless--if states must \n     give full faith and credit to the relevant marriages--S. 1740 \n     may well be unconstitutional. In the nation's history, \n     Congress has never declared that marriages in one state may \n     not be recognized in another; it has not done this for \n     polygamous marriages, marriages among minors, incestuous \n     marriages, or bigamous marriages. It is unclear if Congress \n     has the authority to enact such a bill under the commerce \n     clause, the full faith and credit clause, or any other source \n     of national authority. In addition, S. 1740 raises serious \n     issues under the equal protection component of the due \n     process clause in the aftermath of the Supreme Court's recent \n     decision in Romer v. Evans.\n\n\n  i. background: federalism and recognition of out-of-state marriages\n\n       The impetus for S. 1740 is easy to understand. If one \n     state--Hawaii--recognizes same-sex marriage, is there not a \n     danger that other states, whatever their views, will be \n     forced to accept same-sex marriages as well? Perhaps people \n     will fly to Hawaii, get married there, and effectively \n     ``bind'' the rest of the union to Hawaii's rules, forcing all \n     states to recognize marriages that violate their policies and \n     judgments. A national solution seems necessary if one state's \n     unusual rules threaten to unsettle the practices of forty-\n     nine other states.\n       This scenario is, however, unlikely, for the full faith and \n     credit clause has never been understood to bind the states in \n     this way. For over two hundred years, states have worked out \n     issues of this kind on their own. It is entirely to be \n     expected that in a union of fifty diverse states, different \n     states will have different rules governing marriage. American \n     law has carefully worked out practical strategies for \n     ensuring sensible results in these circumstances, as each \n     state consults its own ``public policy,'' and its own \n     connection to the people involved, in deciding what to do \n     with a marriage entered into elsewhere. In short: States have \n     not been bound to recognize marriages if (a) they have a \n     significant relation with the relevant people and (b) the \n     marriage at issue violates a strongly held local policy.\n       Thus, for example, the first Restatement of Conflicts says \n     that a marriage is usually valid everywhere if it was valid \n     in the state in which the marriage occurred. But section 132 \n     lists a number of exceptions, in which the law of ``the \n     domicile of either party'' will govern: polygamous marriages, \n     incestuous marriage, marriage of persons of different races, \n     and marriage of a domiciliary which a state at the domicile \n     makes void even though celebrated in another state. The \n     Second Restatement of Conflicts, via section 283, taken a \n     somewhat different approach. It says that the validity of a \n     marriage will be determined by the state that ``has the most \n     significant relationship to the spouses and the marriage.'' \n     It also provides that a marriage is valid everywhere if valid \n     where contracted unless it violates the ``strong public \n     policy'' of another state which had the most significant \n     relationship to the spouses and the marriage at the time of \n     the marriage. Thus a state might refuse to recognize \n     incestuous marriages, polygamous marriages, or marriage of \n     minors below a certain age.\n       The two Restatements show that it is a longstanding \n     practice for interested states to deny validity to marriages \n     that violate their own public policy. Many cases have \n     reflected a general view of this kind. See, e.g., In re \n     Vetas's Estate, 170 P.2d 183 (1946); Maurer v. Maurer, 60 \n     A.2d 440 (1948); Bucea v. State, 43 N.J. Super 815 (1957); In \n     re Takahashi's Estate, 113 Mont. 490 (1942); In re Duncan's \n     Death, 83 Idaho 254 (1961); In re Mortenson's Estate, 83 \n     Ariz. 87 (1957). There is no Supreme Court ruling to the \n     effect that this view violates the full faith and credit \n     clause.\n       All this suggests that S. 1740 would respond to an old and \n     familiar problem that has heretofore been settled through \n     long-settled principles at the state level and without \n     federal intervention. If some states do recognize same-sex \n     marriage, the problem would be handled in the same way that \n     countless similar problems have been handled, via ``public \n     policy'' judgments by states having significant relationships \n     with the parties. Different ``public policies'' will produce \n     different results. This is consistent with longstanding \n     practices and with the essential constitutional logic of the \n     federal system. The greater irony is that the Hawaii \n     legislature has recently made clear that a marriage is \n     available only between a man and a woman, and hence there is \n     no current problem that S. 1740 would address. I conclude \n     that S. 1740 is constitutionally ill-advised because it \n     intrudes, without current cause, into a traditional domain of \n     the states.\n       If this traditional view is correct, S. 1740 is also \n     pointless; it gives states no authority that they lack. But a \n     lurking question remains: Why, exactly, does the full faith \n     and credit clause not require states to recognize marriages \n     celebrated elsewhere? The Supreme Court has not offered an \n     explanation. Perhaps the answer lies in the fact that a \n     marriage is in the nature of a contract, and hence it is not \n     a ``public Act, Record, [or] judicial Proceeding'' within the \n     meaning of the Clause. Perhaps the answer lies in the \n     longstanding view that a state with a clear connection with \n     the parties and strong local policies need not defer to \n     another state's law. In either case there is no reason to \n     enact S. 1740. But if the full faith and credit clause is \n     interpreted to require states to respect certain marriages, \n     and if S. 1740 negates that requirement, S. 1740 raises \n     serious constitutional doubts.\n\n\n                      ii. congressional authority\n\n       Whether S. 1740 would be struck down as unconstitutional \n     raised novel and complex issues. My conclusion is that no \n     simple view\n\n[[Page S10113]]\n\n     is plausible, and that in view of the fact that this sort of \n     issue has always been handled at the state level, S. 1740 \n     makes little constitutional sense.\n     (a) Full faith and credit\n       The purpose of the full faith and credit clause was \n     unifying--the clause was designed to help create a ``United \n     States'' in which states would not compete against one \n     another through a system in which judgments could be made \n     part of interstate rivalry. The clause's historic function is \n     to ensure that states will treat one another as equals rather \n     than as competitors. In this way, the full faith and credit \n     clause is akin to the commerce clause, operating against \n     protectionism, in which one state uses its power over its \n     persons and territories to punish outsiders. See Jackson, \n     Full Faith and Credit--The Lawyer's Clause of the \n     Constitution, 45 Column L. Rev. 1 (1945).\n       For reasons just stated, the full faith and credit clause \n     has not been understood to mean that each state must \n     recognize marriages celebrated in other states. But does the \n     full faith and credit clause authorize S. 1740 if it is \n     understood to give states permission to ignore judgments by \n     which they would otherwise be bound? This is not clear. An \n     affirmative answer might be supported by the following \n     language: ``And the Congress may by general Laws prescribe \n     the Manner in which such Acts, Records and Proceedings shall \n     be proved, and the effect thereof.'' Perhaps Congress can say \n     that some Acts, Records and Proceedings are of ``no effect.'' \n     Perhaps Congress' power over ``the effect thereof'' means \n     that Congress can decide which Acts, Records and Proceedings \n     have ``effect.'' The question, then, is whether Congress may \n     not only prescribe the manner of proof and also implement the \n     clause by requiring ``effect'' upon certain proofs (what we \n     might call the accepted ``affirmative'' power), but also say \n     that certain Acts, Records, and Proceedings may be without \n     effect when, in the absence of legislation, they would have \n     effect (what we might call the ``negative'' power). Does the \n     negative power exist, and how might it be limited? (Even if \n     it does, Congress would have no power here if a marriage is \n     not an Act, Record, or judicial Proceeding. I put that point \n     to one side.)\n       This is a complex and difficult question, and no Supreme \n     Court decision gives a clear ruling. A detailed historical \n     study of the grant of power to Congress seems to suggest that \n     the grant was designed to ensure that Congress could \n     implement the full faith and credit clause by expanding the \n     reach of state rules and judgments. That is because the \n     clause has above all a unifying power. See Cook, The Powers \n     of Congress Under the Full Faith and Credit Clause, 28 Yale \n     LJ 421 (1919). In this view, the clause may well authorize \n     Congress (for example) to make state judgments directly \n     enforceable in other states, compel states to recognize \n     rights created . . .\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. So one has to ask oneself, why are we doing this? I think \nthe Washington Post today had an excellent editorial in which they say, \n``Why is the Senate taking up this matter now?'' They also point out \nhow this issue is years away--years away.\n  Well, I think we know why it is happening. It is election-year \npolitics, and as one of the two Senators from California, I am not \ngoing to be part of that kind of politics.\n  As I said before, it is a preemptive strike on a nonexistent \nproposal. It is as if we decided, as a Nation, to bomb a country \nbecause we thought they were going to do something to harm us when, in \nfact, all they wanted to do is live in peace. Of course, America would \nnever do such a thing. Why would we want to do it to a whole group of \npeople?\n  I believe we are all Americans, Mr. President. I believe we do much \nbetter when we work together on issues, when we don't divide. If you \nread history books, you will see so many cases in history where a group \nof people is identified, and they are scapegoated, and they are treated \ndifferently, and they become nameless and faceless. It is what I call \nthe politics of division, the politics of fear. I could never be \nassociated with that kind of politics.\n  Mr. President, when I went into politics 20 years ago, I said to my \nconstituents then--and I continue to tell them--that I would not always \ntake the popular side of an issue. If I felt it was mean-spirited, I \nwould come to the floor of whatever body I was in--and I have been in \nlocal government, I have been in the House, and now I am very fortunate \nto be in the greatest deliberative body in the world, the U.S. Senate--\nand say I felt the proposal was mean-spirited; it was scapegoating \npeople, and I simply could not be a part of it. I think if I were to do \nthat--and we all know what the polls show on this one--I think it would \nbe an insult to my constituency and to me, and it would demean all of \nus, because I don't think that is why we get elected here. I think we \nget elected here sometimes to go against the wind. I think if we don't \ndo that, it diminishes us.\n  Now, this vote isn't about how I feel on the issue of gay marriage. I \nthink Senator John Kerry said that very clearly. I have always \nsupported the idea of communities deciding these issues without the \nlong arm of the Federal Government. Many communities in my State \nrecognize domestic partnerships for those who choose to make a \ncommitment.\n  Frankly, I have to say, Mr. President, I haven't had one letter or \nphone call indicating that Congress should override these community \ndecisions. So it isn't about how Senators feel on the issue of marriage \nor domestic partnerships. DOMA doesn't have anything to do with that. \nIt certainly doesn't do anything, as I said, to defend marriages.\n  Now, we have read newspaper reports that the author of this bill on \nthe other side happened to have been married three times. Now, I don't \npersonally believe, if DOMA was the law, it would have had a difference \non any of his marriages. Maybe he believes that, but I don't believe \nthat is true. I believe if we were sincere and those of us who have \nlong-term marriages would sit down and frankly discuss the stresses on \nour marriages and what needs to be done to defend our marriages, I \ndon't believe we would list that our marriages are threatened by some \ncommunity that is considering making domestic partnerships legal in \ntheir community.\n  So, to me, this is ugly politics. To me, it is about dividing us \ninstead of bringing us together. To me, it is about scapegoating. To \nme, it is a diversion from what we should be doing. Why don't we use \nthis time to pass President Clinton's college tax breaks, to ease the \nstress on our families today? Now, that would be defending marriage. \nThat would be defending marriage. So by my ``no'' vote today, I am \ndisassociating myself from the politics of negativity and the politics \nof scapegoating.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am not positive if I heard my colleague \nfrom California correctly, but if you mentioned the sponsor of the bill \nhas been married three times, I am the sponsor of the bill, and I \nhaven't been married three times.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I said it was in the House. I meant the sponsor in the \nHouse.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate the correction, because I wasn't aware of \nthat fact.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I said the sponsor of the bill in the House, clearly.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today on the floor of \nthe Senate, along with many of my colleagues, to support the Defense of \nMarriage Act. In doing so, I am reiterating my strong, unequivocal \nsupport for traditional marriage as a legal union between one man and \none woman.\n  Marriage is the institution in our society that civilizes our society \nby humanizing our lives. It is the social, legal and spiritual \nrelationship that prepares the next generation for duties and \nopportunities. An 1884 decision by the Supreme Court called marriage \n``the sure foundation of all that is stable and noble in our \ncivilization, the best guaranty of that reverent morality which is the \nsource of all beneficent progress in social and political \nimprovement.''\n  I don't think anything has changed that would change that definition \ngiven by the Supreme Court more than a hundred years ago.\n  The definition of marriage is not created by politicians and judges, \nand it cannot be changed by them. It is rooted in our history, in our \nlaws and our deepest moral and religious convictions, and in our nature \nas human beings. It is the union of one man and one woman. This fact \ncan be respected, or it can be resented, but it cannot be altered.\n  I suggest that our society has a compelling interest in respecting \nthat definition. The breakdown of traditional marriage is our central \nsocial crisis, the cause of so much anguish and suffering, particularly \nfor our children.\n\n[[Page S10114]]\n\n Our urgent responsibility is to nurture and strengthen the institution \nof marriage, not undermine it with trendy moral relativism.\n\n  The institution of marriage is our most valuable cultural \ninheritance. It is our duty--perhaps our first duty--to pass it intact \nto the future.\n  Government cannot be neutral in this debate over marriage. It has \nsound reasons to prefer the traditional family in its policies. A \nsocial thinker, Michael Novak, has written:\n\n       A people whose marriages and families are weak have no \n     solid institutions . . . family life is the seedbed of \n     economic skills, money habits, attitudes toward work and the \n     arts of independence . . . parent-child roles are the \n     absolutely critical center of social force.\n\n  So when we prefer traditional marriage and family in our law, it is \nnot intolerance. Tolerance does not require us to say that all \nlifestyles are morally equal. It doesn't require us to weaken our \nsocial ideals. It does not require a reconstruction of our most basic \ninstitutions. And it should not require special recognition for those \nwho have rejected that standard.\n  It is amazing to me--and I join Senator Byrd and others in this--and \ndisturbing that this debate should even be necessary. I think it is a \nsign of our times and an indication of a deep moral confusion in our \nNation. But events have made the definition of traditional marriage \nessential because the preservation of marriage has become an issue of \nself-preservation for our society.\n  We have a straightforward bill before us. We define ``marriage'' and \n``spouse'' for the purposes of Federal law, and we ensure that no State \nwill be required to give effect to a law of another State with respect \nto same-sex marriage. It is the reserve and the simplicity of the bill \nthat I think ought to be commended. It does not overreach. It does not \nbring to bear the full range of authorities that Congress could invoke. \nRather, it simply restates well-known and well-understood definitions \nand only legislates concerning a constitutional provision, the full \nfaith and credit clause, which was to become the means by which same-\nsex marriages are promulgated throughout the States.\n  I'd like to discuss the two facets of the bill in greater detail. The \ndefinitions included in this bill for the words marriage and spouse are \nbased on our common historical understanding of the institution of \nmarriage, and simply state that marriage is the legal union between one \nman and one woman as husband and wife.\n  This definition is not surprising. But as Hadley Arkes wisely \ncommented: ``in the curious inversion that seems characteristic mainly \nof our own time, the act of restating, the act of confirming the \ntradition, is itself taken as an `irregular' or radical move. That we \nshould summon the nerve simply to restate the traditional understanding \nis taken as nothing less than an act of aggression.'' But no act of \naggression is being undertaken. Rather, the definition included in this \nbill merely restates the understanding of marriage shared by Americans, \nand by peoples and cultures all over the world.\n  The Defense of Marriage Act also legislates concerning the full faith \nand credit clause of the Constitution. Through this bill, Congress \navails itself of the power reserved for Congress in the Constitution \nand ensures that no State be required to give legal authority to a \nrelationship between two people of the same sex which is treated as a \nmarriage under the laws of another State.\n  Let me be very clear. This bill does not outlaw same-sex marriages: \nit merely ensures that if one State makes same-sex marriages legal, no \nother State will be automatically required through the full faith and \ncredit clause to uphold that marriage in their own State.\n  That is our prerogative. That is what we seek to do today, and that \nis what I believe we should do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. COATS. I ask if I could have one more minute.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield the Senator an additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. COATS. As I said earlier, it is disturbing that the debate is \nnecessary at all. I am thankful for the opportunity to discuss the \nimportance of traditional marriage. For too long too many people have \njust assumed that marriage will survive whether or not it is \nencouraged, nurtured, or promoted.\n  The sad news is that the evidence is in. Marriage, like any other \ninstitution such as communities, churches, and schools, can suffer, and \nis, without the critical support of Federal, State, and local \ngovernments, communities, religions, and societal norms.\n  We need to begin a process of reminding ourselves what marriage is. \nWe must tell our children what it means to be married. We must \nencourage young men and women to get married. We must help married \ncouples to stay together when times are difficult. There is no longer \nany doubt that the slow demise of marriage in our country has been \nterribly harmful to children. It is time that we remind this country \nand ourselves how critically important heterosexual marriage is to a \nhealthy society.\n  The Defense of Marriage Act is a wake-up call for our society. This \nbill gives us clear guidance as to the definition of marriage. It tells \nthe States, clearly, that they are responsible for the marriages within \ntheir State. This bill ensures that States maintain the freedom to \nestablish their own definitions and policies relating to marriage.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to use this debate and the ensuing \nvote to make their support and belief of traditional marriage \nabsolutely plain. Without a doubt, this vote is of the utmost \nimportance to our children and to the very future of this country.\n  I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for the time.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from Indiana for \nhis excellent speech, and I will yield the Senator from South Carolina \n3 minutes.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a question, \nare we going to have the opportunity of going back and forth? Perhaps \nafter this we would have that chance to do it.\n  I appreciate it.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Thurmond] \nis recognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor \nand in support of the Defense of Marriage Act.\n  This needed legislation is a straightforward approach to protect the \nrights of the individual States to determine policy decisions \nappropriately within their borders. Simply stated, this bill provides \nthat no State be required to recognize a same-sex marriage that may \nhave been given effect in another State. Additionally, this bill \nreaffirms the 200-year-old Federal policy in this country concerning \nthe use of the words ``marriage'' and ``spouse''--a marriage is the \nlegal union of a man and a woman as husband and wife, and a spouse is a \nhusband or wife of the opposite sex.\n  Mr. President, I can say without reservation that the fine people in \nmy home State of South Carolina should not face the possibility of \nbeing forced to legally recognize same-sex marriages. This bill is \nneeded to protect the right of every State to make their own \ndeterminations concerning the definition of a legal marriage.\n  Article IV, section 1 of the Constitution provides that full faith \nand credit be given in each State to the public acts, records, and \njudicial proceedings of every other State. Additionally, the Congress \nis granted the power to prescribe the manner in which State acts are \ngiven effect in other States. The Defense of Marriage Act is wholly \nconsistent with the Constitution and protects the sovereignty of the \nStates to make their own decisions concerning same-sex marriages.\n  Mr. President, I am amazed that we have reached the point in this \ncountry where the Congress must adopt this type of legislation to \nprotect the sanctity of marriage. Because it is needed, I support the \nDefense of Marriage Act which reaffirms the notion of marriage as it \nhas been recognized throughout 5000 years of civilization--marriage as \na legal union between one man and one woman, as husband and wife.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I will vote for the Defense of Marriage \nAct. What this bill does is really quite simple.\n\n[[Page S10115]]\n\n  It puts in the Federal law books what has always been the definition \nof a marriage--the legal union between one man and one woman. The bill \nalso allows each State to determine for itself what is considered a \nmarriage under that State's laws, and not to be bound by the decisions \nmade by other States.\n  However, I would like to make some comments which I believe are \nimportant. First of all, I have been very concerned by the overheated \nrhetoric that has characterized the congressional and national debate \non this issue. It has been divisive and much of it has been nasty and \ndemeaning.\n  The last thing Americans need right now is another wedge issue. The \nlast thing Americans need is an issue that turns us against one \nanother, and that exacerbates bigotry and hate. It is time to stop the \npolitics of hate. It might make for an exciting sound bite or a boost \nin the polls here and there, but it demeans us as a people. We are a \nbetter people than that.\n  We should recognize the politics behind this debate. It is an effort \nto make Members of Congress take an uncomfortable vote. It is an effort \nto put the President and Democrats on the spot, and at odds with a \ngroup of voters who have traditionally supported the President and the \nDemocratic Party. I regret that. We owe it to the American people not \nto play politics with an issue as important as marriage.\n  My second point is this, and let me be very clear. I am against \ndiscrimination. My support for the Defense of Marriage Act does not \nlessen in any way my commitment to fighting for fair treatment for gays \nand lesbians in the workplace.\n  Later today we will have an opportunity to vote on legislation \nintroduced by Senator Kennedy, the Employment Nondiscrimination Act. \nThis bill would end job discrimination based on sexual orientation. I \nam proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation and will proudly vote \nfor it today. It is long overdue.\n  Mr. President, since I first came to the Congress I have made it a \npriority to fight to eliminate discrimination, whether it is \ndiscrimination on the basis of race, gender, disability or sexual \norientation. Each of us deserves to be judged on the basis of our \nunique skills and talents and nothing else. Discrimination is wrong, \nplain and simple.\n  The Employment Nondiscrimination Act would extend Federal employment \nprotections based on race, religion, gender, national origin, \ndisability, and age to sexual orientation. In over 40 States, \ndiscrimination in employment based on sexual orientation is legal. \nHardworking individuals can be fired from their jobs simply because of \ntheir sexual orientation.\n  And, as the law currently stands they have no legal recourse for \ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation. This amendment would extend \nthe protections in title VII of the Civil Rights of 1964 and the \nAmericans With Disabilities Act of 1990 to sexual orientation.\n  The Employment Nondiscrimination Act exempts from its coverage small \nbusiness employing fewer than 15 people, private membership clubs, \nreligious organizations, and education institutions controlled by \nreligious organizations, as well as the Armed Forces.\n  Individuals should not be fired or denied a job simply based on their \nsexual orientation. Unfortunately, this kind of discrimination is \nrampant in both the public and private sectors. The extension of \nemployment protections to sexual orientation is long overdue.\n  This is not about providing preferential treatment for any class of \ncitizens. In fact, the Employment Nondiscrimination Act specifically \nprohibits preferential treatment.\n  The Defense of Marriage Act is about reaffirming the basic American \ntenet of marriage. The Employment Nondiscrimation Act is also about a \nbasic American tenet--fairness. It is about fairness in hiring and \nfairness in treatment for people in their workplace.\n  I expect the Senate today will overwhelmingly approve the Defense of \nMarriage Act. And I support that. I hope that we will also pass--by an \nequally large margin--the Employment Nondiscrimination Act.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, today the Senate has before it an issue \nthat has generated a great deal of debate across this Nation. I will \nsupport this legislation because I believe the question of State \nrecognition of same-sex marriages must be resolved by each State \nindividually, and not by one State on behalf of all others.\n  While the focus of this debate is whether members of the same sex may \nmarry, the root of the matter is the full faith and credit clause of \nthe Constitution, article IV, section 1. This clause provides that the \nStates must recognize legislative acts, public records and judicial \ndecisions of other states:\n\n       Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the \n     public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other \n     State. And the Congress may by general Laws prescribe the \n     Manner in which such Acts, Records and Proceedings shall be \n     proved, and the Effect thereof.\n\n  Marriages are commonly given full faith and credit by other States. \nAt this time, no State allows same-sex marriages, and a number have \nspecifically outlawed them. Hawaii now appears to be on the verge of \nsuch recognition. If Hawaii becomes the first to allow same-sex \nmarriages, other States would be required to recognize and give full \nfaith and credit to those marriages.\n  The Defense of Marriage Act has been introduced in response to this \npossibility. The bill would restrict the effect of any state law that \nallows same-sex marriages to that state only. By making an exception to \nthe full faith and credit clause, this legislation would allow each \nState to decide this divisive issue on its own.\n  The issue appears to be: Which side of the argument should have the \nburden of proof? If Congress does not act, the burden would be on those \nin opposition to same-sex marriages to affirmatively block them on a \nState-by-State basis. If Congress passes this legislation, those in \nsupport same-sex marriages would have to win recognition of such \nmarriages on a State-by-State basis.\n  I believe each State should determine this volatile issue on its own, \nafter a thorough debate. Therefore, I will cast my vote in favor of \nH.R. 3396.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Defense of \nMarriage Act.\n  Throughout the history of our Nation, family law has always been the \nprovince of the States and not the Federal Government. For we are a \nnation founded upon the principals of States' rights and limited \nFederal intrusion. And that is why this legislation is appropriate. The \nDefense of Marriage Act will ensure that each State shall be free to do \nwhat it believes is fitting and proper in regard to domestic law, \nincluding the recognition of same-sex marriages.\n  By defining the term marriage, Congress is protecting the individual \nsovereignty of each State. No State will now be required to recognize a \nsame-sex marriage--and no State will be prevented from recognizing a \nsame-sex marriage. Passing the Defense of Marriage Act is the surest \nmethod of preserving the will and prerogative of each and every State.\n  Additionally, the ramifications of the absence of a definition of \nmarriage in Federal law are becoming apparent. The court case in Hawaii \nhas merely brought some of those ramifications to our attention.\n  The Defense of Marriage Act does not prevent same-sex marriages at \nthe State level; it merely defines marriages for Federal purposes, \nthereby establishing legal certainty and uniformity in federal \nbenefits, rights and privileges for married persons.\n  I also rise to comment on the Employment Nondiscrimination Act. There \nare obvious and serious problems in employment discrimination and on \nits face, this bill may appear to resolve some of those problems. \nHowever, I believe that this bill will only heighten employment \nproblems and discrimination based on sexual orientation.\n  The Employment Nondiscrimination Act will directly threaten an \nindividual's right of privacy, a right specifically protected in the \nAlaska State Constitution. This bill will make sexuality an issue in \nthe workplace because it will enable employers to ask employees \nquestions regarding their sexual orientation. Indeed, the bill will \nrequire employers to keep records as to the sexual orientation of each \nand every employee in the same manner that employers are required to \nmaintain records on other protected classes\n\n[[Page S10116]]\n\nunder title VII of the United States Code. The Employment \nNondiscrimination Act represents Federal intrusion in an area that most \nbelieve warrants the highest level of privacy.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Defense of Marriage Act and to \noppose the Employment Nondiscrimination Act.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nsupport for the Defense of Marriage Act [DOMA]. The bill we consider \ntoday is an important step in defending States rights--as we have \nworked so hard to do throughout the 104th Congress--and in officially \ndeclaring the intent of Congress with regard to the issue of marriage.\n  Earlier this year, the State of Idaho took action on the issue of \nsame-sex marriages. The State legislature, by a combined vote of 87 to \n10, joined 13 other States in passing legislation which clearly \ndeclares that Idaho will not recognize same-sex marriages conducted in \nother States. Idaho has long prohibited same-sex marriages and should \nbe allowed to ensure that, should such unions be approved elsewhere in \nthe United States, Idaho's longstanding policy will not be changed. As \nthe Idaho State Senate president pro tem stated when the bill was being \nconsidered, ``[W]e should not change policy which has been there for \n100 years because some other State changes policy.'' I could not agree \nmore. The people of Idaho should not be forced to accept same-sex \nmarriages, in violation of the longstanding policy of the State, merely \nbecause some other State decides to do so.\n  DOMA, therefore, merely serves to confirm that Idaho may do what it \nhas already done. Acting under the guidance of the ``Effects Clause'' \nof the Constitution, section 2 of DOMA clarifies that a State has the \nright to deny other States' marriages which violate the public policy \nof that State. Opponents of this legislation have claimed that this \nportion of DOMA is unnecessary, and indeed, they may be correct. The \ncourts have already upheld cases in which polygamous or incestuous \nmarriages were not acknowledged by States outside of the one in which \nthe marriage was performed. The courts may very well find the same \nthing with same-sex marriages. If so, section 2 is at worst redundant. \nIf not, then it is imperative for Congress to use its constitutional \nauthority to ensure that States are not required to recognize a \nmarriage which is in violation of the policies of that State.\n  Section 3 of the bill establishes the Federal definition of the terms \n``marriage'' and ``spouse.'' There is nothing shocking here. Combined, \nthese terms appear in nearly 4,000 places in Federal statutes and \nregulations, yet they have not been defined because State laws on \nmarriage are so similar as to make such a definition unnecessary. DOMA \ntakes the step to clarify the intent of these words, so the Federal \nmeaning of these terms will not be changed even if a State should \ndecide to radically alter its definition of ``marriage'' or ``spouse.''\n  Under the bill, marriage is defined as ``a legal union between one \nman and one woman as husband and wife,'' and spouse is defined as ``a \nperson of the opposite sex who is a husband or wife.'' Looking at the \ndefinition of marriage and spouse in the States, this is clearly how \nthese terms are intended to be defined. DOMA in no way prevents any \nState from using its own definition of these terms, but it does ensure \nthat for Federal purposes, the definition will remain constant.\n  Mr. President, as part of the welfare reform bill which this Chamber \noverwhelmingly supported, we stressed the importance of marriage. The \nfirst two findings in the bill said, ``Marriage is the foundation of a \nsuccessful society,'' and ``Marriage is an essential institution of a \nsuccessful society which promotes the interests of children.'' What we \nare doing today is saying that we want to protect that institution. We \nwant to maintain marriage as it has existed from the foundation of the \nUnited States, and, in fact, as it exists throughout the world today. \nEstablishing a Federal definition of marriage and ensuring that States \nare not required to accept marriages which violate their public \npolicies are modest, yet very important, parts of that process.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, as a cosponsor of the legislation now \nbefore us, H.R. 3396, the Defense of Marriage Act, I rise today to \nexpress my strong support of this bill. This straightforward \nlegislation does just two things: First, provides that no State shall \nbe required--I repeat, no State shall be required--to give effect to a \nlaw of any other State with respect to a same-sex marriage. Second, the \nDefense of Marriage Act defines the word ``marriage'' and ``spouse'' \nfor purposes of Federal law. Though this bill is short in length--just \n2\\1/2\\ pages in fact--it is long in substance.\n  As most of you are aware, the issue of same-sex marriages and \nconsequently the introduction of the Defense of Marriage Act has come \nto the political forefront in part because of a 1993 Hawaii State \nSupreme Court decision. In the case of Baehr versus Lewin, the Hawaii \nState Supreme Court rules that the Hawaiian Constitution discriminates \nagainst the civil rights of same-sex couples by declaring that a legal \nmarriage can only exist between individuals of the opposite sex.\n  In response to this decision,the Hawaii State Legislature has since \nindicated that the question of same-sex marriages is one of public \npolicy and that the court therefore had no jurisdiction to decide the \nmatter. The legislature has further held that the institution of \nmarriage is inexorably linked with procreation and therefore may be \nvalidly limited to male/female couples.\n  Though Hawaii's Legislature has made it unmistakably clear that \nmarriage is limited only to a man and a woman, the same-sex marriage \nissue still thrives in the Hawaii courts, and a lower court is \nscheduled to begin considering the issue this month. Should this court \nrule in favor of legalizing same-sex marriages, the repercussions of \nsuch a decision would have quite a legal effect.\n  Mr. President, because article IV, section I of the U.S. \nConstitution, requires that every State honor the ``public Acts, \nRecords, and judicial Proceedings'' of every other State, the Hawaii \ncourt decision could potentially create a situation in which the \nremaining 49 States, including Montana, would have to recognize same-\nsex marriages if couples from or married in Hawaii move to another \nState. In addition, because there is currently no definition of \nmarriage on the books, the Federal Government would be forced to \nrecognize same-sex marriages for Federal benefit purposes. Since the \nword ``marriage'' appears in more than 800 sections of Federal statutes \nand regulations, and the word ``spouse'' appears more than 3,100 times, \nFederal benefits, such as Veterans, Health and Social Security, would \nall be subject to revision. Given the budget difficulties we are \ncurrently facing, it would be an understatement to say that this could \nhave an enormous financial impact on our country. That troubles me \ndeeply.\n  I know that there are people who are concerned that this bill will \ndiminish the power of States to determine their own laws with respect \nto marriage. Now, let me say that anyone who knows me well, understands \nthat I have always supported giving power back to the States. And I \nwould have serious reservations about supporting this legislation if it \nmandated to the State of Hawaii, the State of Montana, or any other \nState for that matter what marriages they can legally recognize. As \nwritten, this bill in no way does that.\n  By adding a second sentence to article IV, section I of the \nConstitution that reads, ``And the Congress may be general Laws \nprescribe the Manner in which such Acts, Records and Proceedings shall \nbe approved and the Effect thereof,'' the Framers of the Constitution \nhad the foresight to give Congress the discretion to create exceptions \nto the mandate contained in the ``Full Faith and Credit Clause.'' \nTherefore, the Defense of Marriage Act, as provided for by this \nexception, permits us to tackle the issue of same-sex marriages head on \nand, I am pleased to note, allows States to make the final \ndetermination concerning same-sex marriages without other States' law \ninterfering. Let me say that another way. This bill will not outlaw \nsame-sex marriages, it simply exempts a State from legally recognizing \na marriage that does not fit its own definition of marriage. Under this \nbill, States will still be free to recognize gay marriages if they so \nchoose. Under this bill, States will still be free to recognize\n\n[[Page S10117]]\n\ngay marriages if they so choose. That is the way it should be, \nindividual States deciding what is best for themselves.\n\n  Beside protecting the right of States to set their own policies on \nsame-sex marriages, the Defense of Marriage Act puts Congress on record \nas defining the word marriage as ``the legal union between one man and \none woman as husband and wife,'' and the word spouse as ``a person of \nthe opposite sex who is a husband or wife.'' This is not ground-\nbreaking language. It merely restates the current understanding. This \nlanguage reaffirms what Congress, the executive agencies, and most \nAmericans have meant for 200 years when using the words marriage and \nspouse--that a marriage is the legal union of a male and female of \ncertain age in a holy estate of matrimony.\n  Mr. President, numerous polls show that the majority of American \npeople, no matter their religious belief, clearly support protecting \nthe sanctity of marriage. As a Nation we understand that the \ninstitution of marriage sets a necessary and high standard. Though most \nof us agree that everyone should have the right to privacy, most \nAmericans believe the institution of marriage should be cherished and \nrespected and so do I.\n  Although I know that this bill will not solve the problems that take \nplace within individual marriages--particularly in light of statistics \nshowing that one out of every two marriages in this country now ends in \ndivorce--this legislation reaffirms that marriage between one man and \none woman is still the single most important social institution. \nMarriage and the traditional values it represents is the heart of \nfamily life and has been shown to promote a healthy and stable society. \nPrinciples we sorely need to uphold in our country today.\n  Mr. President, at a time when it is becoming the exception, we have \nan opportunity today to reaffirm our commitment to the traditional two \nparent family. And I want to take a moment to thank all of those on \nboth sides of the aisle who have worked so hard to bring this \nlegislation to this point. I particularly want to commend Senator \nNickles for leading the way on this issue. On that note, because of \nSenator Nickles efforts, and with the overwhelming support this bill \nreceived in the House earlier this summer, it looks as though we are \ngoing to see our way clear and pass this bill through Congress.\n  In closing, Mr. President, a number of my colleagues have delivered \nsound and eloquent arguments both in support of and in opposition to \nthis bill today. I truly believe they do so with the most honorable of \nintentions. Let me remind my colleagues on both sides of this issue, \nhowever, that we are not the only voices speaking today. I have \nreceived literally thousands of letters and phone calls asking me to \nuphold the institution of marriage by voting for this legislation. I am \nsure many of my colleagues here in the Senate have as well. I trust you \nwill listen to those voices.\n  Though I am fully aware that a vote for the Defense of Marriage Act \nwill provide a reason for some to label me as intolerant, a bigot or \nuncompasionate--which I might add is not true--I am going to vote to \nsend this bill to the President. I strongly urge my colleagues in the \nSenate to do the same. Thank you Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I strongly support passage of the \nDefense of Marriage Act. It defies common sense to think that it would \neven be necessary to spell out the definition of ``marriage'' in \nFederal law. Yet it has become necessary, because what used to be a \nmatter of self-evident truth has now become a topic of debate. The \nDefense of Marriage Act would make that definition clear, and it would \nprotect States from being forced to recognize same sex unions \nrecognized as marriages in other States.\n  Now, I don't claim to be an expert on what marriage is. But I think I \ncan fairly confidently say what it should not be. First, it should not \nbe simply a convenient arrangement that can be entered into or \ndissolved for frivolous reasons. Marriage forms families, and families \nform societies. Strong families form strong societies. Fractured \nfamilies form fractured societies. So all of us have an interest in \nseeing that strong families are formed in the first place.\n  Same-sex unions do not make strong families. Supporters of same-sex \nmarriage assume that they do. But that assumption has never been tested \nby any civilized society. No society has ever granted same-sex unions \nthe same kind of official recognition granted to marriages, and for \ngood reason.\n  In addition, marriage most certainly should not be just another means \nof securing government benefits. Yet this is one of the arguments that \nproponents of same-sex marriage use to justify this unprecedented \nsocial experiment. They claim that laws restricting marriage to persons \nof the opposite sex are discriminatory in part because, after all, \nsame-sex partners are not entitled to health and other benefits \nextended to dependent spouses. I can think of few worse reasons for \ngetting married. And I can think of few worse times to talk about \ncreating yet another entitlement to government benefits.\n  Mr. President, some 15 States--including my State of North Carolina--\nhave passed similar legislation clarifying the definition of marriage. \nGovernors of several States have signed executive orders. And \nlegislation is pending in some 20 other States. Even in the State of \nHawaii--where a pending court case is helping drive this debate--the \nlegislature has declared that marriage is defined as a legal union \nbetween one man and one woman.\n  Whatever happens in Hawaii, other States should not be forced to \nrecognize same-sex relationships as marriages. This legislation would \nprotect States rights to set standards in this area.\n  It is high time Congress spoke on this issue. I intend to vote for \npassage of the Defense Marriage Act, and I strongly urge my colleagues \nto do the same.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to address the legislation \nunder consideration, the Defense of Marriage Act.\n  Proponents claim Congress needs to act swiftly to thwart an impending \n``threat against the family.''\n  Let's put this in perspective.\n  Nearly 4,000 people have been killed in Los Angeles County alone in \nthe last 5 years from gang-related violence. Criminal gangs are \noperating in more than 93 percent of American cities today. Children \nare being recruited to their death by gangs who prey on juveniles to do \ntheir bidding.\n  This is a threat against American families.\n  More than 10,000 people were hospitalized from methamphetamine abuse \nin California in 1994. Methamphetamine-addicted babies now outnumber \ncrack babies in some hospitals.\n  And more than 1,000 toxic meth labs in California alone remain a \npublic health threat because local jurisdictions don't have enough \nmoney to clean them up.\n  This is a threat against American families.\n  Right now, as we speak, some 15-year-old girl is dropping out of high \nschool somewhere because she is pregnant, unmarried and unable to \nfinish school. Teenage pregnancy is still at epidemic proportions in \nthis country.\n  This is a threat against American families.\n  If we had our priorities straight, we'd be voting on legislation \naddressing these issues today instead of this bill.\n  Having said that, let me address the merits of the legislation before \nus.\n  I personally believe that the legal institution of marriage is the \nunion between a man and a woman. But, as a matter of public policy, I \noppose this legislation for two reasons: One, I believe it oversteps \nthe role of Congress--setting a very bad precedent and perhaps even \nbeing unconstitutional; And Two, I believe it is unnecessary.\n\n\n  OVERSTEPS THE ROLE OF CONGRESS AND SETS A BAD PRECEDENT AND MAY BE \n                            UNCONSTITUTIONAL\n\n  I understand that the issue of same-sex marriage is one that \ngenerates strong feelings, and that an overwhelming majority of \nAmericans are opposed to its legalization. That's why no State has, to \ndate, ever sanctioned such unions.\n  But, even though some people hold deep moral convictions in \nopposition to the idea of same-sex marriage, and however substantial \nthe majority opinion might be on this issue, Federal legislation is not \nthe answer. In this case,\n\n[[Page S10118]]\n\nthis bill will do nothing to settle the question of whether same-sex \nmarriages ought to be recognized.\n  It will only add fuel to an already divisive and mean-spirited \ndebate--a debate conspicuously timed to coincide with the upcoming \nelections. It will only perpetuate more litigation and more \ncontroversy. It will only generate more division. And, worst of all, it \nsets this Nation on the slippery slope of transferring broad authority \nfor legislating in the area of family law from the States to the \nFederal Government.\n  To my knowledge, never in the history of this Nation--for over 200 \nyears--has Congress usurped States' authority to define marriage or \ndelineate the circumstances under which a marriage can be performed.\n  If Congress can simply usurp States' authority to determine what the \ndefinition of marriage is, what is next? Divorce? Will we tell States \nthey are not required to recognize divorce judgements they disagree \nwith?\n  Should the Federal Government have the power to decide it won't \nrecognize a second or third marriage?\n  How about age? Will the Federal Government determine at what age a \nperson is permitted to marry?\n  Whether one accepts the idea of same-sex marriages or not is not the \ncentral issue here. The legislation before us will not prevent States \nfrom recognizing same-sex marriages. The issue before us is whether we \nwant to inject the Federal Government into an area that has, for 200 \nyears, been the exclusive purview of the States.\n  Proponents argue that Congress' authority to legislate in this area \ncomes from the Constitution's full faith and credit clause. However, \nthis is a pretty exotic interpretation of Congress' authority under \nthat clause. Congress, in it's 200-year history has never once used the \nfull faith and credit clause to nullify rather than implement the \neffect of a public act or judgment by a State.\n  In fact, this bill would turn the full faith and credit clause on its \nhead. If Congress enacts this bill, the consequences could reach into \nmany other areas of law and interstate commerce.\n  University of Chicago Law Professor Cass Sunstein said it best in \ntestimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee:\n\n       Under the proponents' interpretation, Congress could simply \n     say that any law that Congress dislikes is of no effect in \n     other States. There are interest groups all over the Nation \n     who would be extremely thrilled to see the possibility that \n     Congress can nullify the extraterritorial application of one \n     State's judgments that it dislikes. Californian divorces, \n     Idaho punitive damage judgments, Illinois products liability \n     judgments--all of them would henceforth be up for grabs.\n\n  There is also the question of whether or not Congress has the \nauthority to single out one class of people to impose such a broad \ndisability on. It raises the question of whether this law would stand \nup to constitutional scrutiny under the equal protection clause.\n\n\n    legislation is unnecessary states already have the power not to \n                    recognize out of state marriages\n\n  Even if Congress has the constitutional authority to grant itself \nthis broad new power, there is nothing in our Nation's history to \nsuggest that this law is necessary.\n  Whether or not to recognize an out-of-State marriage is not a new \nissue. It is quite old. And one which States have dealt with quite \nfrequently without Federal legislation. There are volumes of cases \ninvolving incest, polygamy, adultery, minors and more, where the States \nhave grappled with these issues successfully without the Federal \nGovernment.\n  According to conflict-of-laws doctrine, States may already refuse to \nrecognize out-of-State marriages when the marriage violates that \nState's public policy. For example, expressions of public policy may be \nfound in State statutes, State case law, or pronouncements by State \nattorneys general.\n  Section 283 of the Restatement of Conflicts of Law states:\n\n       A marriage which satisfies the requirements of the state \n     where the marriage was contracted will everywhere be \n     recognized as valid, unless it violates the strong public \n     policy of another state which had the most significant \n     relationship to the spouses and the marriage at the time of \n     the marriage.\n\n  A host of State court decisions dating back to the 1880's demonstrate \nStates ability to invalidate out-of-State marriages on public policy \ngrounds.\n  For example, many States differ in what age they allow a person to \nenter into a marriage contract. Some States allow people to marry as \nyoung as 14. Other States do not permit such marriages or require \nparental consent.\n  State courts have made determinations on what marriages they will \nrecognize based on their own public policies regarding age and other \nissues:\n  In Wilkins versus Zelichowski, a New Jersey court use public policy \ngrounds to annul a marriage performed in Indiana involving a female \nunder the age of 18.\n  In Catalano versus Catalano, a Connecticut court invalidated a \nmarriage between an uncle and his niece declaring that ``[a] state has \nthe authority to declare what marriages of its citizens shall be \nrecognized as valid, regardless of the fact that the marriages may have \nbeen entered into in foreign jurisdictions where they were valid.''\n  In Mortenson versus Mortenson, an Arizona court applied the public \npolicy exception to void a marriage performed in New Mexico between two \nfirst cousins.\n\n\n              States are already legislating in this area\n\n  States are no less capable of dealing with the issue of same-sex \nmarriages than they have been with other marriage issues. In fact, 15 \nStates already have passed legislation either banning same-sex \nmarriages or prohibiting the recognition of out-of-State same-sex \nmarriages. Many others have or are currently considering similar \nlegislation.\n  Many States already have statutes or case law reflecting State policy \ntoward same-sex marriage. California law, for example, limits marriage \nto a ``civil contract between a man and a woman,'' and has considered \nState legislation against recognition of out-of-State same-sex \nmarriages.\n  The bottom line is, States have the authority to do what this \nlegislation would do without Federal intervention, and should be left \nalone to deal with these issues according to their own laws and \nconstitutional parameters.\n  I would be the first to say, that, if one State decides to recognize \nsame-sex marriages, and if any other State is forced to recognize same-\nsex marriages against their own public policy as a result, then Federal \nlegislation would be a reasonable course of action.\n  But, at the very least, Congress should wait until the Hawaii case \nworks its way through the courts--which by all estimates could be \nseveral years away from final resolution--before entering into this \nfray and further complicating the legal issues involved.\n  For a Congress whose mantra has been returning power to the States, \nthis legislation, it would seem, is a serious retreat from that idea, \ngiving broad new power to the Federal Government in an area \nhistorically left under State control. I hope my colleagues will \nconsider this and vote no on this bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator. Let me say in regard to the Defense of \nMarriage Act, I agree with my colleagues who have risen and raised \nquestions as to the motivations of why this legislation is before us. \nIt is clearly, in my view, premature.\n  I hope, because this so-called Defense of Marriage Act is going to \npass, that for those who claim they truly want to protect domestic \nrelationships, partnerships that are not the traditional marriage \nrelationships, we will consider that so that the protections in \nhospital rooms and other places where domestic partnerships are denied \ntoday is something all of us will determine we are going to resolve.\n  I do want to use this time, because I think we are on the brink, Mr. \nPresident, of adopting historic legislation in the midst of all of \nthis, to speak in behalf of the Employment Nondiscrimination Act. I \ncommend my colleagues, Senator Kennedy of Massachusetts, my colleague \nfrom Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, and Senator Jeffords from Vermont \nfor their leadership on this issue. I am urging my colleagues to \nsupport the Employment Nondiscrimination Act.\n\n\n[[Page S10119]]\n\n\n       The history of our country thus far has been a history of \n     the gradual extension, refinement and perfection of the \n     guarantees of human freedom. By removing the denials of \n     freedom experienced by some Americans, we are strengthening \n     and giving greater validity to the freedom of all Americans.\n\n  Mr. President, those words were spoken by another Senator from \nConnecticut 32 years ago during the consideration of the landmark 1964 \nCivil Rights Act. Those words were spoken by my father in this Chamber. \nI believe those words are as germane today as they were when they were \nuttered 32 years ago. Over our entire history, this Congress and this \nNation embarked on a quiet but monumental revolution, and that was to \nrealize the full aspirations of our Founders that all men and women are \ntruly created equal.\n  Throughout our history, Americans have strived to extend those rights \nto all Americans regardless of their skin color, religion, gender, \ndisability, or political belief. But today, one group of Americans \ncontinues to be left unprotected in the workplace. That is gay and \nlesbian Americans. The Employment Nondiscrimination Act would go a long \nway toward extending greater equality to these Americans and ensuring \nthem that they will be judged more by the strength of their labors than \nby their sexual orientation.\n  Much has changed in the 30 years since my father and others fought to \nenact civil rights legislation. At the time it was a controversial \nnotion. It inflamed great passions. It tied up this body for weeks on \nend, the very notion that we would not be allowed to discriminate \nagainst people based on the color of their skin.\n  Today, I would suggest that if we were considering the 1964 Civil \nRights Act, a resolution would be carried on a voice vote unanimously \nwithout any debate and any division. That was not the case 32 years \nago. But for the reasons that I believe have more to do with \nintolerance and ignorance and moral courage, this country continues to \nallow gay and lesbian Americans to be judged not by their abilities or \neven the content of their character but by the prejudice of others. The \namendment we are considering today is a commonsense response to this \noutrage. I hope we all want to say to gay Americans that when you are \non the job in this country, you will be judged in the same manner that \nany American will be judged. The American people know this is the right \nthing to do. In fact, 84 percent of Americans believe that employers \nshould not be allowed to discriminate based on sexual orientation.\n  Prominent business leaders, from Xerox, Microsoft, and RJR Nabisco, \nsupport this legislation. In fact, more than 650 private businesses \ninclude sexual orientation in their antidiscrimination policies. \nPolitical leaders past and present are also behind this effort.\n  From our former colleague, the Senator from Arizona, Senator \nGoldwater, to civil rights leader Coretta Scott King, the Governor of \nNew Jersey, Christine Todd Whitman, and more than 30 Senate Democrats \nand Republicans--they all urge the adoption of this amendment. In fact, \nironically, 66 of us in this body--66 of us, and 238 House Members, \nalready have nondiscrimination policies for their employees. If just 66 \nin this body would ask the country to do what they do in their own \noffices, then we can adopt this legislation.\n  In my home State of Connecticut we have such protection for gay and \nlesbian workers. Has our business community suffered untoward \nconsequences? Has the moral character of our State been dramatically \nharmed? Has Connecticut been overwhelmed by an onslaught of litigation? \nHave quotas been established for hiring gay workers? All of these \nissues have been raised in this body over the last several days, and to \nevery one of them the answer in Connecticut has been ``no.'' And in \nevery other State where this has been adopted, the answer has been \n``no.'' In fact, Connecticut's antidiscrimination law is considered a \nsuccess in providing recourse for those Americans affected by antigay \nbias, in giving them the guarantee they will be judged by the abilities \nof their labor and not their lifestyles.\n  In my view, this debate is behind the curve of where the American \npeople are on this issue. The business community and the vast majority \nof American people recognize that gay Americans deserve and should be \ntreated equally in the workplace. I believe this Congress must follow \ntheir lead. It is never a happy event when an American loses his or her \njob. It is particularly difficult when it is because of events out of \none's control, such as downsizing, layoffs, companies moving offshore. \nWe all understand the pain that people go through when they lose their \njobs because of those circumstances.\n  But I can imagine few things worse than for one to lose a job because \nof the intolerance of others, and that is what exists today in the \nworkplace. Rightly, we have acted to combat these wrongs when they are \ncommitted against people because of race, gender, age, and disability. \nI believe we must take this opportunity to extend that protection \nfurther to gay and lesbian Americans.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join us in supporting this bill and \nproviding to gay Americans the protections against job discrimination \nthey so desperately need and deserve.\n  I thank my colleague from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remain 7 minutes and 11 seconds.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield the Senator from Kansas 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I would like to speak for just a few \nmoments on the Defense of Marriage Act. I will speak in support of it. \nBut it is an issue relating to marriage that I think is one that is an \nexample of where divorce and related domestic matters have \ntraditionally been subject to State law. I believe they should remain \nso.\n  Same-sex marriage is a concept with which few Americans are \ncomfortable, and I do not believe that the judgment of one court in a \nsingle State should hold sway over the rest of the Nation. States \nshould have the ability to disregard same-sex marriages if they so \nchoose, and this legislation would permit them to do that.\n  Many aspects of this debate are troubling, as it touches not only on \nquestions of law and the Constitution, but also on deeply held personal \nviews about values, cultural traditions, and religion. As legislators, \nwe are not always adept at debating matters such as this, and we find \nourselves on far less comfortable ground in debating Federal \nlegislative approaches to highly personal matters. We are more adept at \ndebating matters of law and policy. But here I think we are on \nuncertain territory, and we have had already differing views expressed \nduring the course of this debate.\n  Unfortunately, such debate sometimes occurs in an atmosphere of \nrigidity and intolerance. They are not dialogs aimed at reaching any \nsort of understanding but, rather, become shouting matches, which can \nhappen in the public arena in our own States, not aimed at reaching any \nsort of understanding, in which each side becomes securely stationed \nbehind its line in the sand. The terms of engagement are set by \nextremists at both ends. I have been picketed by both sides, out in my \nown State, in Kansas.\n  The debate over this legislation has been no exception. Nothing will \nmake the issues any easier, but no purpose is served by abandoning \ncivility and a respect for differing viewpoints in the process. Nor \nshould we forget that at the heart of the debate over homosexuality are \nindividual Americans. An abstract subject takes on different dimensions \nwhen given the face of a friend, a family member, a coworker. The \nthings we all hold dear--family, friendships, a job, a home--present a \nunique set of challenges for the gay community. It should come as \nlittle surprise that, like anyone else, gay men and women would like to \nlive their lives without being defined only by their sexual \norientation.\n  Shortly after the August recess, I visited with a young man from \nKansas who made a strong plea in opposition to the Defense of Marriage \nAct, arguing that fear was the driving force behind the measure. \nAlthough I was not persuaded to change my position on the legislation, \nI was deeply moved by his very genuine desire to move the debate beyond \nstereotypes and unchallenged assumptions.\n  Congress is not the ideal forum for the resolution of these issues, \nnor will\n\n[[Page S10120]]\n\nany piece of legislation settle them. However, the tone we set in our \ndeliberations is one which will be echoed around kitchen tables and \nworksites throughout the Nation. Let that tone be one which honors our \ndemocratic traditions of reasoned debate, responsible decisionmaking, \nand respect for all individuals.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the legislation before this body \nobviously touches upon a deeply personal and emotional area. The \ninstitution of marriage is a vital foundation of any ordered society \nincluding this one. However, I think it is important amid a great deal \nof talk about the need to defend marriage, that we look at the context \nin which this legislation is brought before this body.\n  As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I recently had an \nopportunity to attend a hearing on this legislation and review the \narguments made by both sides. Based upon that record, it was obvious \nthat both sides feel very strongly about the positions they hold. \nHowever, having reviewed the arguments, I have reached the conclusion \nthat this legislation is neither necessary nor appropriate for the \nFederal Government to enact at this time.\n  First, it is not clear that this is even an appropriate area for \nFederal legislation. Historically, family law matters, including \nmarriage, divorce, and child custody laws, have always been within the \njurisdiction of State governments, not the Federal Government. \nThroughout my tenure in this body, I have opposed legislation which \nneedlessly extends Federal jurisdiction into issues that have \ntraditionally been the domain of the State and local governments. For \nthis reason, I opposed crime legislation that expanded Federal law \nenforcement into areas traditionally handled by the State and local law \nenforcement. Similarly, I opposed efforts to federally mandate helmets \nfor motorcycle riders, because I believed that States should retain \nthat authority. This legislation is yet another example of a continuing \ntrend of the Federal Government needlessly injecting itself into areas \nof the law which have been historically left to the States.\n  Second, and perhaps more telling, the alleged urgency of this Federal \nintervention is wholly unwarranted. The simple and undeniable fact is \nthat no State currently recognizes same-sex marriage, nor does it even \nremotely appear that any State legislature may be contemplating doing \nso. While some of my colleagues voice a concern over a court case in \nthe State of Hawaii, resolution of that trial will not determine this \nmatter with any finality. There will be a series of appeals, no doubt. \nEven if the Hawaiian State courts find the Hawaiian constitution \ncompels recognition of same-sex marriage, final resolution of this \nissue is at least a couple of years away. Somehow, this is still deemed \na priority in the waning days of the 104th Congress. It is ironic that \nthis Congress would set aside time needed for addressing issues such as \nthe Chemical Weapons Treaty and funding for Head Start, to address a \nperceived problem which does not exist today and will not exist, if \never, for at least 2 years.\n  And this is from the same Congress that, for the second year in a \nrow, will likely fail in its fundamental responsibility to pass all of \nthe appropriations bills necessary to keep the Government operating. \nThe same Congress that stalled passage of health insurance reform for \nnearly 9 months and took nearly as long to give the working families of \nthis Nation a much-deserved and overdue raise in the minimum wage has \nsomehow made this issue a priority.\n  Mr. President, even at some point in the future the Hawaiian State \ncourts reach the conclusion that same-sex unions must be recognized \nunder their constitution, there is a great deal of uncertainty as to \nwhat effect, if any, that decision might have on other States.\n  Legal opinions vary on this, but there is plenty of legal opinion \nthat the States simply would not be compelled to give recognition to \nthese marriages from other States. A number of legal scholars believe \nthat States already have the authority, under traditional conflict of \nlaws doctrines, to refuse to recognize marriages which are contrary to \ntheir own laws or public policy. If this is the case, States do not \nneed the Federal Government granting them permission to exercise a \nright which they already hold. Until that view is resolved differently, \nit seems to me we should defer to the power of the States to address \nthis issue on their own.\n  Some scholars believe that States would be compelled to recognize \nthese unions by the full faith and credit clause of the U.S. \nConstitution, irrespective of this statutory effort to say otherwise. \nAnd still others oppose this bill because it, seemingly for the first \ntime, assumes that Congress has the power to determine the \napplicability and scope of the full faith and credit clause, a position \nwhich would signal a significant change in the traditional application \nof this provision.\n  The degree of uncertainty surrounding the constitutional implications \nof this legislation is striking. That uncertainty, coupled with the \nfact same-sex marriage is not legal anywhere in this country, suggests \nto me we should move with caution. It is far more prudent, in my \nopinion, given the personal and divisive nature of this issue, to wait \nuntil a real, not a speculative, conflict arises between the States.\n  So, in my opinion, this legislation is unwarranted. Congress and the \nAmerican people face many pressing challenges, challenges we all heard \nso much about at the recent conventions, challenges ranging from the \nneed to reduce the Federal deficit to increasing educational \nopportunities and job security for all Americans and preventing the \nspread of drugs and crime in our country. Real problems which affect \nthe lives of millions of Americans today.\n  (Mrs. KASSEBAUM assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I cannot think of a lower priority for \nthe Federal Government than to spend this time interfering with the \nprivate laws of law-abiding citizens. Before we endeavor to address \nproblems which do not even exist, we should dedicate ourselves to \nsolving those that do. The people of this Nation expect and deserve \nnothing less, and, therefore, Madam President, I will oppose this \nlegislation.\n\n\n                    Employment Nondiscrimination Act\n\n  Let me say with regard to the ENDA bill, that is a piece of \nlegislation I will support and cosponsor. It does, in fact, deal with a \nreal problem in this country, unlike the DOMA legislation, and I hope \nthat we have a strong positive vote of putting the Senate in favor of \nending discrimination in that area.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to offer my strong support for the \nEmployment Nondiscrimination Act. I want to commend my colleague from \nVermont, Senator Jeffords, and my colleague from Connecticut, Senator \nLieberman, as well as my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, \nfor their dedication to bringing this important piece of legislation \nbefore this body and to the attention of the American people. I am a \ncosponsor of this legislation and believe it should be adopted for very \nsimple, but important and fundamental reasons.\n  Mr. President, there can be no doubt that the history of this Nation \nis marked by our continuing efforts to stop discrimination--be it in \nthe work-place, in our schools, or in our places of public \naccommodation. It is also equally true that this Nation's history is \nmarked by the simple notion that if one works hard and keeps their nose \nto the grindstone, then they too may share in the American dream. Yet, \nin this country today, these simple but important foundations of our \nculture are denied to gay and lesbian Americans for no other reason \nthan that they are in fact, gay or lesbian.\n  Mr. President, this legislation would attempt to stop that practice \nand prohibit employment discrimination against individuals because of \ntheir sexual orientation. To date only nine States, including my home \nState of Wisconsin, have passed comprehensive legislation to ban \nemployment discrimination based on sexual orientation. In the 41 \nremaining States, however, it is permissible to discriminate against a \nworker based upon that workers sexual orientation irrespective of their \nqualifications, dedication to their job, or work performance.\n  What this legislation would do is to simply ensure that basic \nAmerican\n\n[[Page S10121]]\n\nright to fair and just treatment in the employment arena cannot be \ndenied based solely upon a person's sexual orientation. It provides, in \nessence, the right for gay and lesbian workers to be treated like \neveryone else--to be judged on the merits of one's contributions, not \ntheir sexual preference.\n  Mr. President, it is essential to note that this bill confers no \nspecial or preferential rights upon gays and lesbians. It exempts small \nbusinesses, the military, and religious organizations and explicitly \nprohibits preferential treatment, including quotas. The focus of this \neffort is directed at stopping employment discrimination which exists \ntoday. The discrimination targeted by this measure is real. It is not \nspeculative or merely a possibility at some point in the future--it is, \nin fact, occurring today. If this Nation is to reach its full potential \nin these ever changing economic times, then we must acknowledge and \nwelcome the contribution of all hard-working Americans in the \nworkplace. The Employment Nondiscrimination Act does just that. It is a \nsound, and in my view, necessary step to helping ensure the opportunity \nfor millions of Americans to earn a living free of the fear of \ndiscrimination. It has the support of Members of both political \nparties, church and civic leaders, the President, as well as major \ncorporations--corporations which know first hand the value of a \ndiscrimination free workplace. We should learn from their experiences.\n  The notion that someone could be fired solely because they are gay or \nlesbian should be offensive to each of us. Just a few weeks ago, for 8 \ndays of political conventions, both major political parties spent \ncountless hours in a battle to seem more inclusive, more tolerant, more \nfair than the other. This legislation offers Members of both parties a \nlegitimate opportunity to move from rhetoric into action and provide \ngay and lesbian Americans the opportunity to work and earn a living \nfree of the fear of losing their jobs solely because of their sexual \norientation.\n  The very premise of job discrimination contradicts traditional \nAmerican values and we must do all we can to stop it. We should adopt \nthis legislation.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 3 minutes for the Senator from \nOklahoma and 29 for the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for an \nadditional 2 minutes and recognize the Senator from Missouri for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I object, unless we have 4 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask unanimous consent both sides have an additional 2 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  I am grateful for this opportunity to rise in support of this \nlegislation, known as the Defense of Marriage Act. I believe it is \nimportant for us to outline exactly what this bill would do and what it \nwould not do, because in much of the discussion, it is portrayed as a \nmeasure which would overrule State laws and somehow snatch from States \nthe capacity for defining what a marriage is within the State.\n  The truth of the matter is, this would not change the capacity of \nStates to define for their own purposes the nature of marriage in any \nState in America. It would define, for purposes of the Federal \nGovernment, what constitutes a marriage. And that is very important, \nbecause unless we have a Federal definition of what marriage is, a \nvariety of States around the country could define marriage \ndifferently--they have not to date--and if they were to define marriage \ndifferently, people in different States would have different \neligibility to receive Federal benefits, which would be inappropriate.\n  It has been said that it is not important to do this because there \nhave not been any States making these changes. I think it is pretty \nclear that it is important to do this because States are on the brink \nof making such changes, one State's law having been stricken by its \nhighest court on the basis that it was unduly discriminatory.\n  Let me just indicate that as long ago as in the 1970's, a male \ndemanded increased educational benefits from the U.S. Government when \nhe claimed that another male individual was his dependent spouse. The \nVeterans' Administration turned him down, and the Veterans' \nAdministration was sued. The outcome turned on a Federal statute that \nmade eligibility for the benefits contingent on his State's definition \nof ``spouse'' and ``marriage.''\n  If the definition is different in one State for Federal benefits than \nit is in another State, we will find that States will be able to accord \nbenefits to citizens in a way which is irrational and inconsistent, \ngiving citizens of one State higher benefits or different benefits than \ncitizens of another State.\n  It is time for the Federal Government to define what a marriage is \nfor purposes of Federal benefits which, obviously, come at the expense \nof the taxpayers of this country. It is not unreasonable at all, for \npurposes of Federal benefits, whether it is Social Security, education \nbenefits, or veterans benefits of one kind or another, for this \nCongress to say these are the conditions under which those benefits \nflow. They should be uniform for people no matter where they come from \nin this country. People in one State should not have a higher claim on \nFederal benefits than people in another State.\n  For that reason, it is entirely appropriate for us, as a Congress, to \nsay that we want a Federal benefits structure that follows a uniform \ndefinition of ``marriage,'' and for purposes of the Federal benefits \nprogram, we have this definition, and that is what this law provides.\n\n  Second, this law then says that a State will not be required to \nrecognize another State's definition of marriage if that includes \nindividuals of the same sex. Now, every State has benefits that flow to \nthose who are married. It comes from the fact that there are real \nsocietal and social benefits to marriages. Marriages bring children \ninto the world. That is the next generation.\n  Unfortunately, it is the young people who defend the country when we \nare assaulted from abroad. And if you don't have children who grow up \nto be in the work force, who pays for the retirement of those who have \nalready retired? We have set up our society on the basis of children \nwho come into the world, and we honor the institution that brings \nchildren into the world and gives them values, by according special \nstanding to marriage. That is not only done at the Federal level, which \nwe already have addressed, it is done in every State in America.\n  A State ought to be able to say you are going to get these benefits \nif you are in this category, if you meet this definition of marriage. \nBut if we use the term marriage in one State and then we allow another \nState to define it as something entirely different than what the first \nState which was developing the benefit structure intended, we have \nreally allowed one State to define for other States what will be the \nqualifying characteristics for their laws and their benefits.\n  It is clear to me that a State should have the right to say that \nthese are the characteristics of the relationship which will result in \nour State according you either the deduction or the special benefit, \nwhether it relates to taxes or education or inheritance or the like. \nStates should have the right to do that on their own terms.\n  So this proposal simply defines, in a uniform way for Federal \nbenefits, the nature of what a marriage is, and it says that no State \nshall be able to impose its definition of marriage on other States.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Who yields \ntime?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, as I understand it, now there are 31 \nminutes remaining for our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I yield 20 minutes to the Senator from \nVirginia, 6 minutes to the Senator from Nebraska, and 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n\n[[Page S10122]]\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, as one who represents a traditionally \nconservative State, it's not easy to take on this issue. In fact, many \nof my friends and supporters have urged me to sit this one out because \nof the potential political fallout, but I can't do that. I feel very \nstrongly that this legislation is fundamentally wrong--and feeling as I \ndo I would not be true to my conscience or my oath of office if I \nfailed to speak out against it. I believe we have an obligation to \nconfront the very real implications of the so-called Defense of \nMarriage Act.\n  Despite it's name, the Defense of Marriage Act does not defend \nmarriage against some imminent, crippling threat. Maintaining the \nfreedom of States to define a civil union or a legal right to benefits \ncannot--and will not--harm the strength and power of marriage. Neither \ncan it diminish the love between a husband and a wife, nor the devotion \nthey feel toward their children.\n  Whether the Government should give official sanction to same-sex \nrelationships does raise some extremely difficult issues, Mr. \nPresident--issues of morality, of religion, of child-bearing, of \nmarriage and of the intimacies of life. But this legislation is not \nreally about these difficult questions of domestic relations. As a \nconstitutional matter, it is about placing the Federal Government in \nthe midst of an issue firmly and historically within the jurisdiction \nof our States. And as a political matter, it is about denying a class \nof people benefits that no single State has yet conferred.\n  This bill also raises fundamental questions about the nature of our \nFederal system of Government, including the powers of the States under \nour Constitution and the scope of the full faith and credit clause. I \nbelieve the full faith and credit clause does not enable one State to \nlegislate for another, and so the States don't need the protection of a \nFederal statute in this case. I also believe that it's inappropriate \nfor the Federal Government to get involved in defining marriage--\nsomething States have done for themselves throughout our history.\n  These are important issues, Mr. President, and they deserve a full \ndiscussion, but they are not the issues that make this debate so \ndifficult--or so important.\n  For beneath the high-minded discussions of constitutional principles \nand States rights lurks the true issue which confounds and divides us: \nthe issue of how we feel about intimate conduct we neither understand \nnor feel comfortable discussing.\n  Mr. President, scientists have not yet discovered what causes \nhomosexuals to be attracted to members of their own sex. For the vast \nmajority of us who don't hear that particular drummer it's difficult to \nfully comprehend such an attraction.\n  But homosexuality has existed throughout human history. And even \nthough medical research hasn't succeeded in telling us why a small but \nsignificant number of our fellow human beings have a different sexual \norientation, the clear weight of serious scholarship has concluded that \npeople do not choose to be homosexual, any more than they choose their \ngender or their race. Or any more than we choose to be heterosexual. \nAnd given the prejudice too often directed toward gay people and the \npressure they feel to hide the truth--their very identities--from \nfamily, friends and employers, it's hard to imagine why anyone would \nactually choose to bear such a heavy burden unnecessarily.\n  The fact of the matter is that we can't change who we are, or how God \nmade us and that realization is increasingly accepted by succeeding \ngenerations. It has been my experience that more and more high school \nand college students today accept individual classmates as straight or \ngay without emotion or stigma. They accept what they cannot change as a \nfact of life. Which brings to mind one of my favorite prayers:\n\n     God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot \n           change\n     The courage to change the things I can,\n     And the wisdom to know the difference.\n\n  I suspect that for older generations fear has often kept this issue \nfrom being discussed openly before now--fear that anyone who expressed \nan understanding view of the plight of homosexuals was likely to be \nlabeled one. Because of this fear, the battle against discrimination \nhas largely been left to those who were directly affected by it. Mr. \nPresident, I believe it is time for those of us who are not homosexual \nto join the fight. A basic respect for human dignity--which gives us \nthe strength to reject racial, gender and religious intolerance--\ndictates that in America we also eliminate discrimination against \nhomosexuals. I believe that ending this discrimination is the last \nfrontier in the ultimate fight for civil and human rights.\n  Most Americans accept the basic tenet that discrimination for any \nreason is wrong. We grow uncomfortable, however, with some of its \nimplications. The question we face now is whether that discomfort \nwarrants continued discrimination.\n  Although we have made huge strides in the struggle against \ndiscrimination based on gender, race and religion, it is more difficult \nto see beyond our differences regarding sexual orientation. It's human \nnature to be uncomfortable with feelings we don't understand or share \nand to step away from those who are different. But it's also human \nresolve that allows us to overcome those impulses, to step forward and \ncelebrate those many qualities we share. The fact that our hearts don't \nall speak in the same way is not cause or justification to \ndiscriminate.\n  There are not many in this Chamber who truly seek to discriminate. \nSome here support the Defense of Marriage Act because many of the good \npeople they represent believe that homosexuality is morally wrong, and \ntherefore same-sex unions should not be permitted by the Government. A \nnumber of our colleagues have told me privately that they are not \ncomfortable supporting this legislation, but the political consequences \nare too great to oppose it.\n  Others admit that they intend to discriminate, but they believe that \ndiscrimination here is justified. They justify their prejudice against \nhomosexuals by arguing that homosexuality is morally wrong--thereby \nassuming it is not a trait but a choice, and a choice to be condemned.\n  But history has shown that current moral and social views may \nultimately prove to be a weak foundation on which to rest \ninstitutionalized discrimination.\n  Until 1967, 16 States, including my own State of Virginia, had laws \nbanning couples from different races to marry. When the law was \nchallenged, Virginia argued that interracial marriages were simply \nimmoral. The trial court upheld Virginia's law and asserted that \n``Almighty God created the races white, black, yellow, malay, and red, \nand he placed them on separate continents. The fact that he separated \nthe races shows that He did not intend for the races to mix.'' Loving \nv. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967). The Supreme Court struck down these \narchaic laws, holding that ``the freedom of choice to marry'' had \n``long been recognized as one of the vital personal rights essential to \nthe orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.''\n  Today we know that the moral discomfort--even revulsion--that \ncitizens then felt about legalizing interracial marriages did not give \nthem the right to discriminate 30 years ago. Just as discomfort over \nsexual orientation does not give us the right to discriminate against a \nclass of Americans today.\n  Ultimately, Mr. President, immorality flows from immoral choices. But \nif homosexuality is an inalienable characteristic, which cannot be \naltered by counseling or willpower, then moral objections to gay \nmarriages do not appear to differ significantly from moral objections \nto interracial marriages.\n  Mr. President, at its core marriage is a legal institution officially \nsanctioned by society through its Government. This poses the dilemma of \nwhether a society should recognize a union which the majority either \ncan't relate to or believes is contrary to established moral tenets or \nreligious principles. We find ourselves again at the intersection of \nmorality and Government, a place where some of our most divisive and \ncomplicated social issues have torn at us throughout our history as a \nNation. Prayer in school, abortion, the death penalty, assisted \nsuicide--these most troubling issues of our day force us to confront \nthe difficulty of legislating where social mores and individual \nliberties collide.\n\n[[Page S10123]]\n\n  I believe social mores can and should guide our Government. But \nsometimes we need to choose between conflicting moral judgments. For \nexample, some believe very deeply that no matter how heinous a crime a \nperson commits, the death penalty is immoral because no human should \ntake the life of another. But while we respect those views, we have \nlegally restored the death penalty. Many believe homosexuality is \nimmoral, but many also believe that discriminating against people for \nattributes they cannot control is immoral. When moral objections are \nused to justify blatant discrimination, however, we need to tread \ncarefully.\n  In this case, we should tread more carefully still, because marriage \nis also a religious institution. Religious ceremonies evoke powerful \nimages: a couple committing themselves to each other before God and \nfamily, a union blessed and supported by religious teachings, a \nceremony based on scripture and biblical studies. But we have to \nremember today that government has a role only in the civil \ninstitution, separate and distinct from marriage as a religious \nceremony.\n  The truth is, this bill will not affect, one way or another, how \nindividual religions deal with same-sex marriages. Government sanction \nof gay marriages does not alter the religious institution, and as \nauthor Andrew Sullivan has argued, ``Particular religious arguments \nagainst same-sex marriages are rightly debated within the churches and \nfaiths themselves.'' Religions that prohibit gay marriages will \ncontinue to do so, just as some refuse to permit marriages between \nindividuals of different faiths. Such couples simply have to forgo the \nreligious blessing of the marriage, and be content with only civil \nrecognition of their union.\n  Marriage, as a civil institution, recognizes the union of two \nindividuals who are so committed to each other that they seek to have \ntheir civic rights and responsibilities formally merged into one. And, \nMr. President, when that civil institution is separated from a \nreligious ceremony, and that civil institution is recognized by a \nsovereign State, then denying Federal recognition of that union amounts \nto nothing short of indefensible discrimination.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, discrimination is not new in this \ncountry. Countless courageous Americans have risked their careers and \neven their lives to defy discrimination. We forget today how difficult \nthese acts were in their own time. We forget how different our world \nwould be if these pioneers had taken the easy path. One thing we do \nknow, Mr. President, is that time has been the enemy of discrimination \nin America. It has allowed our views on race and gender and religion to \nevolve dramatically, inevitably, in the American tradition of progress \nand inclusion.\n  We're not there yet, Mr. President. In matters of race, gender, and \nreligion, we've passed the laws, implemented the court decisions, \nsigned the executive orders. And every day we work to battle the \nunderlying prejudice that no law or judicial remedy or executive act \ncan completely erase. But we've made the greatest strides forward when \nindividuals, faced with their moment in history, were not afraid to \nact. And time has allowed us to see more clearly the humanity that \nbinds us, rather than the religious, gender, racial, and other \ndifferences that distinguish us. But I fear, Mr. President, that if we \ndon't stand here against this bill, we will stand on the wrong side of \nhistory, not unlike the majority of the Supreme Court who upheld the \n``separate but equal'' doctrine in Plessy versus Ferguson. And with the \nbenefit of time, the verdict of history is not likely to be as \nforgiving as we might believe it to be today.\n  Mr. President, I believe we ought to continue to let the States \ndecide if and how they want to confront the issue of a civil union \nbetween members of the same sex. They decide it in all other instances. \nIn fact, they have managed it without congressional interference for \n200 years. As the supreme court of Hawaii has recently noted, in the \nvery case which has led to the introduction of the Defense of Marriage \nAct, ``the power to regulate marriage is a sovereign function reserved \nexclusively to the respective States.''\n  Most of us are uncomfortable discussing in public the intimacies of \nlife. And most of us are equally uncomfortable with those who flaunt \ntheir eccentricities and their nonconformity, whether gay or straight.\n  But in the end, we cannot allow our discomfort to be used to justify \ndiscrimination. We are not entitled to that indulgence. We cannot \nafford it. But doing the right thing is not always easy and I know this \nis not an easy vote even for those who may agree with my argument.\n  It is, in a very real sense, a test of character and I hope as many \ncolleagues as possible will take time to reflect before casting their \nvote. If enough of us have the courage to vote against the Defense of \nMarriage Act, I believe we can convince the President to do what I know \nin his heart of hearts he knows he should do to this discriminatory \nlegislation. A nation as great as ours should not be enacting the \nDefense of Marriage Act.\n  Ultimately, Mr. President, I would say to our fellow Senators: you \ndon't have to be an advocate of same-sex marriages to vote against the \nDefense of Marriage Act. You only have to be an opponent of \ndiscrimination.\n  Mr. President, I'll conclude today with the words of a courageous \nAmerican whom I seldom quote but to whom I'm eternally indebted. \nPresident Lyndon Johnson often said, ``It's not hard to do what's \nright, it's hard to know what's right.'' We know it is right to abolish \ndiscrimination. And if we reflect on what this bill is--an attempt to \ndiscriminate--rather than on what it is packaged to be--a defense of \nmarriage--we will come down on the right side of history.\n  With that, Madam President, I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized for 6 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Could the Senator yield for a unanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. KERREY. I yield.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that prior to \nthe two consecutive votes scheduled at 2:15, there be 2 minutes of \ndebate equally divided in the usual form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Madam President, the Defense of Marriage Act [DOMA] is \nproposed and sold as a simple measure, limited in scope, and based on \ncommon sense. It is none of these things. DOMA certainly cannot be \ncalled a simple measure when it proposes to have the Federal Government \nintervene in matters previously reserved to the States. Conservative \nadvocates of States rights should not brush aside this interference \nmerely because they find a purpose which holds special appeal to them. \nAnd with this law the Federal Government will have taken the first--and \nif history is a good guide, probably not the last--step into the \nStates' business of marriage and family law.\n  DOMA certainly cannot be called limited in scope except for those of \nus who will be unaffected by this abridgement of rights. The small \nclass of citizens affected do not believe this law is limited in scope. \nOf course the fact that only a relatively few homosexual couples will \nbe affected begs the question: Why should we heterosexuals worry? We \nhave more important business to tend to. Why should we put ourselves at \nrisk for a small minority of men and women who are willing to make a \nlifetime commitment to another human being but, whose love of someone \nof the same sex violates others' personal beliefs? Two reasons. First, \nthese couples are not hurting us with their actions; in fact they may \nbe helping us by showing us that love can conquer hatred. Second, we \nmay be next. That's how the rights of the majority are threatened: One \nminority group at a time.\n  As to the third representation made by supporters, DOMA does not \nappear to me to be based on common sense. Common sense tells me: Do not \npass a law that is not needed. And DOMA is not needed. States can \nalready refuse to recognize marriages that violate their strong public \npolicies. For example, if Nebraska's Legislature chooses to not \nrecognize a marriage contract between under-age couples, it can do so. \nThe courts have upheld that right. The court would also uphold \nNebraska's right to not recognize a same-sex marriage in another State \nalthough no State currently allows such marriages.\n  In fact, same-sex marriage laws are not sweeping their way through \nState\n\n[[Page S10124]]\n\nlegislatures. Local politicians are just as nervous or frightened of \nthis issue as we are. Rather than getting ahead of an issue that is \nheading our way, we are losing our way to save our political heads.\n  So why worry about DOMA? I worry because despite references to the \ncontrary we are doing much more than passing a law that is not needed. \nWe are establishing, in the Federal code, a prohibition against a \nnarrow class of people; a Federal law will preempt State law and \ndiscriminate against these individuals by saying they cannot do what \nall other Americans can legally do. And, we are establishing a means to \ncarry out other Federal remedies to State-level family law problems. I \nwould vote against DOMA if it only did the first of these things. \nHowever, it is the second which should strike fear into the heart of \nheterosexual Americans who wonder if this could affect them some day. \nThe answer is it can and probably will. Even if it is not your loved \none who is unable to visit you on your deathbed because laws forbid \nnon-family members from entering your room, this bill could someday \ntouch your life.\n  For example, once this bill has passed and been signed into law, \nadvocates of Federal involvement in personal decisions may propose \nadding other language. They may say: Let's examine the heterosexual \nactivity which common sense and empirical evidence tells us is a threat \nto the institution of marriage: divorce. Divorce--not same-sex \nmarriage--is the No. 1 enemy of marriage. And, with a Federal \ndefinition of marriage in chapter 1 of title 1 of the United States \nCode, future Congresses would have a Federal vehicle to attack \ndivorce. DOMA's language, which provides that `` `marriage' means only \na legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife,'' \ncould easily be amended to prevent States from recognizing divorce \ndecrees which occurred in the 1st year of marriage, 2nd year, or the \n10th year. Beyond divorce, we could add custody language or other \nFederal requirements on married couples. Supporters of DOMA say they \nare not creating a Federal certificate of marriage. True enough today. \nHowever, they are creating an easy way for us to reach that goal.\n\n  Supporters of DOMA say a Federal definition of marriage is needed \nbecause Federal benefits are at risk. This is making a mountain out of \na mole hill. Even if the same percentage of homosexual Americans were \nmarried as heterosexual Americans, 40 percent, the threat to the \nTreasury would be modest. Approximately 5 percent of the population is \ngay or lesbian. Therefore, we are only talking about 2 percent of the \npopulation that could possibly benefit if same sex marriages were \nrecognized. Further, Congress can choose to exclude same-sex partners \nfrom any Federal benefit it chooses, as we did with the family and \nmedical leave legislation.\n  Proponents also say, the current United States Code does not contain \na definition of marriage, presumably because Americans have known what \nit means. Not true. Federal definitions of marriage, divorce, child \ncustody, and other family matters have been omitted because Americans \nhave known what it means when the Federal Government starts to \nlegislate in new areas. Americans know that once we start, we cannot \nstop.\n  Heterosexual Americans who wonder why they should be concerned with a \nlaw that restricts the freedom of a minority class should be advised: \nThe bell that tolls for them could soon toll for thee.\n  Heterosexual Americans should know: Marriage is not under attack from \nrising numbers of homosexual Americans who are making commitments to \neach other. Marriage is under attack when a person is too busy, too \npreoccupied, and too concerned about taking care of No. 1 to take care \nof No. 2 or 3 or 4. Marriage is under attack in that moment when a man \nor woman is tempted to forget their commitment to love ``until death do \nus part.''\n  My mother and father's generation did not forget. My generation \nunfortunately did. My children's generation, thank God, appears to be \nremembering again. And in this remembering lies the hope for marriage \nand other sacred traditions so important to our Nation. Not a Federal \nstatute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Madam President. Madam President, at the heart \nof this debate is a judgment each Senator must make about what the \nFederal Government ought to stick its nose into.\n  This has been a Congress dedicated to the proposition of reducing the \nrole of the Federal Government in the lives of our citizens. This \nCongress has sought to turn away the Federal desire to intrude and \nleave important decisions to private individuals and, if necessary, \nlocal and State government.\n  Marriage has historically been a private matter between two people. \nIt has long been a matter that has been reserved for the States. Now \nthe Congress that has sought to contract Federal power hungers for \nFederal regulation of the institution of marriage. This Federal \nexpansionism makes no sense to me.\n  When I talk with gay and lesbian Oregonians, they invariably ask me \nabout the concerns held by the majority of Americans. They ask about \njobs and wages and health care and crime. Not once has a gay or lesbian \nOregonian come to me and asked that the Federal Government endorse \ntheir lifestyle. They simply ask to be left alone. In this regard, they \nare very similar to what I hear from ranchers and small business owners \nand fishermen and scores of other of our citizens.\n  One of the fundamental principles on which our Nation was built is \nthe freedom to enjoy life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The \nConstitution doesn't give Congress or the States the power to \nspecifically exclude an individual or group of individuals from the \nenjoyment of life, liberty, or the pursuit of happiness. But this \nlegislation would.\n  Is the legislation constitutional? Where in the Constitution does it \nsay equal rights for all--except those that the majority disagrees \nwith? This bill is not only of dubious constitutionality, it seems to \nme to be a repudiation of traditional conservatism. It is conservative, \nMadam President, to keep private conduct private. It is certainly \nconservative to promote monogamy. It is conservative to promote \npersonal responsibility and commitment.\n  This bill isn't conservative; it is Big Brother to the core. My \njudgment is that this is a subject the Federal Government ought not \nstick its nose into.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for \n4 minutes.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. I ask unanimous consent to continue until my speech is \nfinished.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Madam President, the first point to make is that this \nissue should not be coming before us today. No State in the United \nStates has passed a law that recognizes same-sex marriages. To the \ncontrary, 15 States have passed laws prohibiting them. I wish I did not \nhave to deal with this issue. It makes me feel uncomfortable. I feel \nI'm on ground full of quicksand. But, as a Senator, one is asked to \nvote to decide, so that is what I am doing today.\n  My views on gay issues have evolved over the years. I have always \nbeen opposed to discrimination on the basis of race, gender, ethnicity. \nThen I came to see that the same concerns about discrimination have to \nalso apply to sexual orientation, if I were to carry the logic of civil \nrights to its natural conclusion.\n\n  But the countervailing thought in a society as diverse as ours is \nthat opponents of gay rights have rooted their opposition to religion. \nMany opponents assert that God has not ordained homosexuality. These \nindividuals sometimes use the power of Scripture to perpetuate the idea \nthat homosexuality is a choice, and if you choose it, similar to \nchoosing anything that Scripture prohibits, you are guilty of flaunting \nyour dismissal of God's will and strictures. These individuals also \nsometimes use Scripture to perpetuate blatant discrimination, hiding \nbehind Scripture to cover up an underlying intolerance.\n  Madam President, I believe that homosexuality is not a choice. \nHomosexual behavior, on occasion, might be a choice. But having a \nhomosexual orientation and being a gay is not a choice. I believe that \nit is more similar\n\n[[Page S10125]]\n\nto being born with red hair than it is to choosing to tell a lie. The \nlatter requires a decision; the former just is. You can cover up the \nformer, but underneath the dyes and wigs the hair is still red.\n  At the same time, I believe there is no denying the fact that large \nnumbers of Americans have deeply held religious beliefs about \nhomosexuality and marriage. Even in questions of discrimination against \ngays, there is a conflict between religious faith and rights. Madam \nPresident, I have resolved that conflict in my own mind by saying that \nin things secular rights shall prevail, be dominant.\n  I believe, for example, that there should be no discrimination \nagainst gays in housing and employment, and that is why I have been a \nlong supporter of gay rights in these areas, with the proviso that \nreligious institutions that would see these antidiscrimination laws as \ninterfering with their freedom of religion are exempted. ENDA, in my \nview, does that. It achieves the balance between ending discrimination \nagainst gays and respecting freedom of religion. The issue of gay \nmarriage, in my view, does not achieve that balance.\n\n  I believe marriage is, first of all, a predominantly religious \ninstitution. For example, it is one of the sacraments of the Christian \nfaith, but it is also, in our society, a secular institution. \nTherefore, it is fraught with a degree of ambiguity. In all cases, it \nhas been a state that exists between a man and a woman. In no country \nin the world, in no religion that I know of, does the state of marriage \nexist between two people of the same sex. Therefore, when we \ncontemplate giving state sanction to same-sex marriages, we need to \nproceed cautiously.\n  At the same time there are many partners of same-sex relationships \nwho have loving and committed relationships over many years. The \nquestion arises, how do we acknowledge the existence of these committed \nrelationships--the partner's desire to be at the bedside of his or her \ndying partner or to see that a partner receives the benefits that \naccrue to a survivor of a long and loving relationship?\n  One might point out that the only way we can do that now is through \nmarriage. There ought to be another way, and I am prepared to look for \nthat other way, but I do not see marriage as flexible enough an \ninstitution to accept such redefinition at this time. Too many people \nin too many places of too many faiths see it as the state that exists \nbetween a man and a woman, and they see same-sex marriages as an \nincomprehensible trespass.\n  Madam President, that is what this bill is all about. That is what \nthe so-called DOMA legislation is all about. It says marriage should \nnot be redefined to include individuals of the same sex because \nmarriage with all its religious connotations is different from a \nsecular desire to get housing or a good job.\n  So, Madam President, in trying to balance the religious and \nhistorical idea of marriage with the need for extending rights, I say \nthat rights should extend up to but not include recognition of same-sex \nmarriages.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/10/senate-section/article/S10100-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, this Defense authorization bill has been \ndone from the very outset in a very bipartisan spirit. Senator Nunn, I \nam sure, will speak on that side to that effect. We have worked \ntogether, Republicans and Democrats, to bring into the Senate a bill \nthat we feel is fair and just. The House has already passed this \nparticular bill. The President has said he will sign this particular \nbill. I urge all Senators to vote for this bill and show support for \nour Armed Forces, the men and women who are sacrificing by serving our \ncountry and risking their lives to protect the liberty and freedom of \nthis country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I share the sentiments of the Senator from \nSouth Carolina. This is a good bill for the men and women who serve in \nour military. This bill is an increase over the President's budget, but \nit is a decrease in real terms from last year's budget. So the decline \nin defense spending continues downward, but it is an incremental step \nupward from the President's budget.\n  The President said he will sign this. Virtually every provision in \nthe House bill that the administration objected to has been either \ntaken out of this conference report or has been handled in a way \nsatisfactory to the administration. That would include the arms control \nprovisions relating to the ABM Treaty and missile defense. It would \nalso include those members of the military service who have HIV who, \nunder the House bill, would have been automatically expelled from the \nservice. That provision has been dropped.\n  So I urge those on this side of the aisle to vote for this bill as a \nstrong step forward for our Nation's security.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the conference \nreport on the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997. \nI oppose the conference report for many of the reasons I opposed the \nSenate bill. Unfortunately, the conference report is in many respects \nworse than the Senate bill.\n  The conference report includes $11.2 billion in unrequested funds, \nincluding almost $1 billion in additional funding for ballistic missile \ndefense, hundreds of millions of dollars for unrequested military \nconstruction projects, and billions of dollars for weapons programs the \nPentagon does not think it needs.\n  Another troubling aspect of the conference report involves land \nconveyances. I have been very concerned by the yearly practice in which \nMembers of Congress include special land conveyances in the Defense \nauthorization bill enabling the transfer of Federal property outside of \nthe requirements of the Federal Property Act of 1949. Having been \nunable to curb outright the practice of making these sweetheart land \ndeals, I have worked to ensure that the properties are screened by the \nGeneral Services Administration to make sure that there is no other \nFederal interest in the properties. The conferees found the idea of \nprotecting the Federal taxpayers' assets so distasteful that they \nrefused to require a Federal screening for the land conveyances \ncontained in the House bill. This decision is unacceptable in my view \nand I did not sign the conference report in large part due to this \ndecision.\n  In addition, the conferees adopted a provision from the Senate bill \nwhich affords special retirement rights to a select group of employees \naffected by base closure. There has been no demonstrated need for this \nauthority that will cost the American taxpayer millions of dollars in \nthe out years and it is unfair to the hundreds of thousands of other \nFederal employees who have been affected by ongoing efforts to downsize \nthe Government.\n  I would also mention my concern with a provision in the conference \nreport that terminates the defense business operations funds [DBOF] in \nthe year 1999. The purported reason for this provision as I understood \nfrom its proponents is to instill more discipline in the Defense \nDepartment's financial management. I have been concerned about the \nstate of the Government's financial management for years. I have worked \nto enact legislation creating the inspectors general and the chief \nfinancial officers. I have held numerous and long detailed hearings on \nthe condition of DBOF. I agree that the Pentagon has an obligation to \nthe American taxpayer to focus more attention on getting its financial \nhouse in order. But, I do not agree that terminating DBOF will \naccomplish anything other than to create chaos where we should be \nseeking progress.\n  In addition, I have concerns about section 1033 of the conference \nreport which significantly expands an existing program within the \nDepartment of Defense regarding the transfer of excess\n\n[[Page S10126]]\n\npersonal property. The Senate bill was silent on this issue. The House \nbill however expanded an existing DOD program which enables State and \nlocal agencies involved in drug enforcement activities to have a \npreference to obtain excess DOD personal property. The House bill \nexpanded this program to enable all law enforcement activities to have \nthis preference. Beyond that the conference added counterterrorism as \nan additional preferential category.\n\n  Now I bow to no one in my willingness to take action to enforce our \ndrug laws and to fight terrorism. And it may be entirely appropriate \nfor excess small arms and ammunition to be made available to law \nenforcement agencies for these purposes. However, I have serious \nconcerns regarding the conference's approach. In particular, I have \nquestions about the effect this provision will have on other entities \nentitled to receive excess property as a public benefit. I'm speaking \nnot about small arms parts, but about computers, furniture, vehicles, \nand other equipment. Under current law potential beneficiaries to this \nequipment include, State agencies, hospitals, schools, the homeless, \nand other worthy causes. I do not believe that this concern was \nadequately considered in the conference. I intend to work with other \nSenators and Congressmen who share my concerns to clarify how the \nSecretary of Defense intends to implement this provision, and to take \ncorrective legislative action if necessary.\n  The conferees also dropped a provision from the Senate bill that \nwould allow women who are serving in the military or who are \nservicemembers' dependents from obtaining abortions in overseas \nmilitary medical facilities. We have debated this issue repeatedly and \nI am very sorry the conferees again chose not to afford women who are \nstationed overseas the same basic rights available to women living in \nthe United States.\n  Finally, I mention a number of House provisions that were dropped in \nconference: the so-called multilateralization and successor state \nprovisions affecting the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, the provision \nto repeal the don't-ask, don't-tell policy and the provisions relating \nto servicemembers diagnosed with HIV. I am genuinely pleased that these \nprovisions were dropped from the conference report. However, I do not \nbelieve the mere elimination of completely unacceptable provisions from \nthe conference report is a sufficient reason to support the conference \nreport.\n\n\n                         humanitarian demining\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to ask a question regarding \nsection 1304 of the pending fiscal year 1997 National Defense \nAuthorization Act. This provision would amend title 10, section 401 \nentitled ``Humanitarian and civic assistance provided in conjunction \nwith military operations.''\n  The point that I would like clarified is whether the annual $5 \nmillion cap in new subsection (c)(3) would be a U.S. Governmentwide \ncap, or whether it is a cap on only DOD humanitarian assistance \nappropriations.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I can assure Senator Leahy that the cap imposed by \nsection 1304 applies only to funds made available to the Department of \nDefense for humanitarian and civic assistance. It was not intended as a \nU.S. Governmentwide cap. It does not apply to funds that are made \navailable to other Federal agencies such as the Department of State or \nthe Agency for International Development.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senator for his explanation.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my extreme \ndisappointment in the outcome of the House and Senate conference on the \nDepartment of Defense authorization legislation. The Senate's version \nof this legislation contained an amendment offered by myself and \nSenator Snowe to allow women servicemembers stationed abroad to obtain \nprivately funded abortions at military facilities. It was very \nunfortunate that this provision was dropped from the final version of \nthis legislation during negotiations between the Senate and the House.\n  Mr. President, my amendment simply restored a policy which responds \nto the unique needs of women serving overseas in our armed services. \nThis policy, which was in place between 1973 and 1988 and between 1993 \nand 1996, allowed women to use private resources for medical abortion \nservices at military hospitals. This policy is necessary to ensure the \nhealth and safety of women servicemembers because overseas health care \nfacilities often do not provide comparable and safe care. Women serving \nour country in the Armed Forces deserve the same quality of care as \nwomen in the United States and to put them at risk is dangerous, \nunnecessary, and plain wrong.\n  Further, as I have said before, requiring a woman to travel to the \nUnited States to perform this procedure only delays a very time-\nsensitive procedure and increases the cost--both for the individual and \nthe taxpayer--when a woman is stationed abroad.\n  We have had many debates in the 104th Congress about a woman's right \nto choose. My amendment simply guaranteed that women who serve in our \nArmed Forces have the same rights as women in the United States. It is \na right women service personnel have held for most of the last 23 \nyears.\n  Dropping my amendment is yet another in a long series of actions \ntaken by this Congress to eliminate a woman's right to choose. From the \nfirst days of the 104th Congress to the closing hours of this second \nsession, women have seen the new majority seek to undermine their \nrights at every opportunity. It saddens me to see the will of the \nSenate and the health care options of women serving in the Armed Forces \ntraded away to the voices of extremism.\n  This Congress must know that the women and men of this country are \nawake and aware of these actions. We will be back. I assure you.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the conference \nagreement on the fiscal year 1997 National Defense Authorization Act. I \nurge all of my colleagues to support this bill, which represents a \nreasonable and balanced compromise between the House and Senate on a \nnumber of very difficult issues.\n  Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to highlight just a few \nof the very positive aspects of this bill.\n  This bill provides $265.6 billion for defense activities for the \ncoming fiscal year, implementing the decision of the Republican \nCongress to add $11.2 billion to the President's defense budget \nrequest. We fought hard for the last 2 years to add a total of $18 \nbillion to the inadequate defense budgets of this administration, \nbecause we recognized the need to ensure both current and future \nreadiness of our military services.\n  In the Readiness Subcommittee, we provided $1 billion more than the \nbudget request for operations and maintenance of the Armed Forces, and \n$270 million more than requested for ammunition procurement. These \nincreases will ensure sufficient funding for day-to-day operations and \ntraining for the coming fiscal year.\n  The bulk of the added funding was allocated to military modernization \nprograms. The bill authorizes an additional $6 billion for procurement \nof modern weapons systems, including tactical aircraft, sealift and \nairlift assets, improved communications systems, surveillance and \nreconnaissance, and other important warfighting equipment. The bill \nalso adds $2.6 billion for research and development to maintain the \ntechnological edge of our military forces on the battlefields of the \nfuture, including a significant increase in both theater and national \nmissile defense programs.\n  The bill also includes a number of legislative provisions which, I \nbelieve, will serve the best interests of the taxpayer and the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  First, the bill includes a new discretionary waiver of domestic \nsource restrictions for our allies with whom we have reciprocal defense \nprocurement agreements. This provision, which was included in the \nSenate bill, will provide the needed flexibility for the Secretary of \nDefense to purchase the best equipment at the lowest price for our \nmilitary services. It will also help to promote continued free trade \namong our allies, rather than threatening reciprocal trade in defense \nitems by restricting the United States to buying only American-made \nproducts. In my view, this is one of the most important provisions in \nthis bill because of its potential to save money and preserve \nour longstanding positive defense trade balances with our allies.\n\n  The bill also authorizes $14 million in a newly established account \nunder the\n\n[[Page S10127]]\n\ncontrol of the Secretary of Defense for antiterrorism activities and \nprograms. This provision was added to make funds available for urgent, \nemergency requirements necessary to deter or defend against terrorism \ndirected at our military personnel. The bombing of the U.S. military \nhousing complex in Dhahran demonstrated the need for such an account.\n  Last year, the Congress approved the enactment of several provisions \nrelated to accounting for missing service personnel which the Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff and our warfighting CINC's opposed, \narguing that they would interfere with their ability to conduct their \nmissions in the event of war. This bill repeals several of those \nprovisions without harming or limiting in any way the ability of the \nDepartment of Defense to continue its intensive program to locate and \nrecover the remains of all those missing in action in wartime.\n  I am particularly pleased that the conferees agreed to drop from the \nbill both the Senate and House provisions regarding discharge of \nmilitary personnel who test positive for the HIV virus. This allows the \nDepartment of Defense to continue its current policy of non-\ndiscrimination and fair treatment of all military personnel with \nconditions which prevent them from deploying with their units.\n  The bill authorizes compensation for Vietnamese commandoes who \nparticipated in United States wartime operations in Vietnam and were \ncaptured by North Vietnam. Payment of these amounts is a matter of \nfairness and is long overdue.\n  The conferees also approved a Senate provision, cosponsored by \nmyself, Senators Lieberman, Coats, and Robb, which directs the \nDepartment of Defense to conduct a new assessment of U.S. national \nsecurity strategy and military force structure requirements. This \nprovision provides specific guidance to the Department for its \nQuadrennial Defense Review. The provision also establishes a \nnonpartisan panel of national security experts to review the \nDepartment's work and to provide an independent assessment of \nalternative force structures and strategies. In light of the continuing \nchanges in the post-cold-war world, I believe it is necessary to \nconduct such a comprehensive reassessment of our national security \nposture.\n  The bill also requires the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to \nprovide an assessment of the readiness requirements of each of the \nservices, using a tiered readiness concept that I discussed in a March \n1996 white paper. This report is important to the development of this \nconcept, which could result in savings in operation and maintenance \nfunding which could be reallocated to the modernization accounts where \na significant shortfall remains.\n  The bill also includes language requiring fair pricing of United \nStates military equipment to be transferred to Bosnia under existing \ndrawdown authority. Since the equip and train program for the Bosnian \nMuslims is an essential part of the exit strategy for United States \ntroops serving in the peace implementation force [IFOR] in Bosnia, it \nis essential that the program be implemented properly and promptly if \nwe are to meet the end-of-1996 withdrawal deadline for IFOR.\n  Finally, the bill includes a provision requiring organizers of \ncivilian sporting events to reimburse the Department of Defense for the \ncost of providing security and other support services, only if the \nevent makes a profit. This provision is designed to ensure that defense \ndollars are available for defense purposes, but it will have no effect \non the availability of our military services to provide needed security \nassistance at these events.\n  Again, I thank Chairman Thurmond and his staff for achieving such an \nexcellent conference agreement on these important issues.\n  At the same time, Mr. President, I regret that the conferees deleted \nthe Senate's provisions related to competitive allocation of workload \namong public and private maintenance depots. The Senate tried to take a \npositive step toward fair and open competition for depot maintenance \nwork. I am sorry that the conferees were unable to agree to include \nthese provisions, because it could have saved the taxpayers money and \nallowed the Pentagon to shed excess capacity at its government-owned \ndepots.\n  The most controversial aspect of the depot issue is the 60-40 rule \nwhich requires that at least 60 percent of all funds expended on depot \nmaintenance be spent in public depots, owned and operated by the \nDepartment of Defense. I believe that this 60-40 rule is arbitrary and \nprevents the Department of Defense from taking actions that could \npotentially result in a savings of billions of dollars. I would like to \npoint to a recent report by the Congressional Budget Office entitled \n``Reducing the Deficit: Spending and Revenue Options.'' This report \ncontains a section dealing with the depot issue and the potential \nsavings that could be realized by relying upon the private sector to \nperform much of the work that the current 60-40 rule requires to be \nperformed by the public depots. According to this report, cumulative \nsavings after 6 years might amount to roughly $400 million, rising to \nover $3 billion after 10 years if the total workload assigned to public \ndepots on a sole source basis is reduced to 30 percent. CBO estimates \nthat, in the long run, DOD might save on the order of $1 billion \nannually if it used public depots only for those tasks that could not \nbe handled competitively in the private sector. Estimated savings of \nshifting from public to private production range from 20 to 40 percent.\n  Mr. President, although readiness has been used as the justification \nfor maintaining the arbitrary 60-40 rule, I believe that it is a \njustification without foundation. DOD already relies on the private \nsector to repair many specialized components on its most up-to-date \nsystems. Furthermore, since we rely upon the private sector industrial \ncapability to supply our military forces with this equipment, it seems \nunreasonable to distrust this same private sector capability to \nmaintain the equipment.\n\n  That is the only major legislative provision which was resolved in a \nway that I cannot approve. In fact, let me say that I was very pleased \nwith the resolution of a number of legislative provisions adopted in \nthe last few days of the Senate's consideration of this bill. The \nconferees chose to remove legislative earmarks for all of these \nprojects and considered each on a case-by-case basis. Of the most \negregious legislative earmarks attached to the bill, none were included \nin this final conference agreement as legislative earmarks. For that \nwise decision, I thank the conferees.\n  However, Mr. President, I note with serious disappointment that many \nof the special interest and pork-barrel items, to which I objected in \nthe additional views I filed with the Committee, are included in this \nconference agreement.\n  These programs are: $850 million in unrequested, low-priority \nmilitary construction projects--$150 million more than the Senate-\npassed bill; $780 million for unrequested Guard and Reserve equipment, \nincluding $189.6 million for four C-130J aircraft; $470.7 million for \nnine additional C-130J aircraft, only one of which was requested by the \nAir Force; $15 million for continued aurora borealis research and \nconstruction of the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program \n[HAARP], for which there is no current military requirement or \nvalidated use; $13 million for an unnecessary, duplicative, and \ncumbersome bureaucracy for oceanographic research, which the Navy does \nnot need or want; and $701 million for advance procurement of a second \nnew attack submarine, and language repeating the earmarking of these \nnew submarines divided evenly between Newport News Shipbuilding and \nElectric Boat Shipyard.\n  Mr. President, these pork-barrel projects add up to approximately \n$2.8 billion. I am astonished that, once again, after fighting hard to \nsustain a much-needed increase in the defense budget, the conferees \nchose to spend these funds on pork.\n  Last year, we wasted $4 billion, or more than half of the total \ndefense budget increase, on pork-barrel projects. I suppose this year's \nbill shows progress of a sort--we are only wasting $2.8 billion.\n  But, Mr. President, I will say again that the American people will \nnot stand for this type of wasteful spending of their tax dollars. If, \nwe, in Congress refuse to halt the pork-barreling, it will be more and \nmore difficult to explain to the American people why we\n\n[[Page S10128]]\n\nneed to maintain adequate defense spending. I would prefer that the \n$2.8 billion wasted on pork-barrel projects had not been included in \nthe bill. I hope that, next year, with the very real threat of a line-\nitem veto of some of these items, the Congress will stop wasting \ndefense dollars on these kind of special interest items.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by saying, again, that I believe this \nis, overall, a very good conference agreement on the Defense \nauthorization bill. Chairman Thurmond, Senator Nunn, and the staff on \nboth sides of the Senate Armed Services Committee should be commended \nfor their excellent work. I urge my colleagues to support this \nconference agreement.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will vote for the fiscal year 1997 \nNational Defense Authorization Act. I signed the conference report on \nthis bill insofar as it pertains to bill language. I did not, however, \nsign the conference report's report language because I do not agree \nwith the report language on the missile defense provisions, all of \nwhich were dropped from the bill. Several of my Democratic colleagues \non the Senate Armed Services Committee took a similar position on the \nconference report's ballistic missile defense report language.\n  I will vote for the national defense authorization bill because, \nunlike last year, the vast majority of provisions in the bill are the \nresult of bipartisan drafting and have full bipartisan support. I \ncommend Senator Thurmond and Senator Nunn for their efforts to improve \nthe process of the Senate Armed Services Committee during this \nlegislative session. I would also like to commend Senator Smith for \nfostering a cooperative working relationship on the Acquisition and \nTechnology Subcommittee.\n  Mr. President, let me briefly talk about the report language on arms \ncontrol and ballistic missile defense. In order to get this bill signed \nby the President, the majority agreed very late in the conference to \ndrop all of the provisions regarding multilateraliza- tion of the ABM \ntreaty and theater missile defense demarcation, which the President's \nadvisers had objected to. If these provisions had not been dropped, I \nwould not be supporting this bill, nor would the President be prepared \nto sign this bill. However, having given up the bill language, the \nmajority attempted in this report language to revive what they had \ngiven up. As a matter of law I would urge the President to treat this \nreport language as totally nonbinding and certainly not representing \nthe views of this conferee, and perhaps not even representing the views \nof the majority of conferees. This report language was first presented \nto the minority in the middle of the last night of conference, and we \nhad no opportunity to discuss it at member level. I felt compelled to \nmake my very strong views known, that this language is unacceptable to \nme and as I just said should be treated by the administration as not in \nany way having the force of law.\n  The provisions dropped by the conferees raised serious legal and \nconstitutional issues and would have infringed upon the President's \nprerogative to make foreign policy. What could not be achieved in bill \nlanguage cannot be revived through report language. That is the \nstrongly held view of at least this Senator.\n  Mr. President, that having been said, there is much that is good in \nthis bill. While I do not believe that all of the additional funding \nincluded in this bill is warranted, there are many provisions that I \nworked to have included and that will strengthen our national security. \nThese provisions include the extension of flexible section 845 \nauthority to carry out advanced research projects to the services; the \nclarification of the section 2371, other transactions authority, to \nspur broader use by the services; a fair compromise with the \nadministration with regard to dual-use technology programs; the \nreduction in the total amount allocated for the renovation of the \nPentagon by $100,000,000; very strong support for the Department of \nEnergy's stockpile stewardship program; very strong support for the \nNunn-Lugar program and the Department of Energy's nonproliferation \nefforts. I also strongly supported the additional funds for the \ntactical high-energy laser program with Israel, and cosponsored an \namendment with Senator Kyl to restrict remote sensing over Israel. I \nsupported a pay raise and an increase in the basic allowance for \nquarters for our troops, which I believe is well deserved. The bill \nalso includes a provision supported by the Environmental Protection \nAgency that could speed the process for opening the waste isolation \npilot plant while retaining EPA's clear authority on health and safety \nmatters.\n\n  I have previously stated that we are entering a period of military-\ntechnical transformation. I believe that by maintaining a strong lead \nin advanced technologies, and using these technologies as a force \nmultiplier, we can meet our national security requirements with a \nsmaller force structure and at reduced costs. I believe many of us on \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee will be looking hard at the \nimplications of these changes for our military during the coming years.\n  I would like to address one issue that has raised some questions from \nmy constituents in New Mexico. The House National Security Committee \ninserted a provision, sponsored by Congressman Thornberry, which allows \ncertain Department of Energy sites, including the Pantex plant in \nCongressman Thornberry's district, to report directly to the \nheadquarters office in Washington, DC, rather than through the \nAlbuquerque Operations Office. The provision adds no value to the \nperformance or reporting authorities for the Department of Energy. \nIndeed, if carried out, it would likely lead to balkanization within \nthe weapons program. I am working with Senator Domenici to block this \nprovision in the energy and water appropriations bill. If this attempt \nfails, I will pursue this issue in the next Congress to have the \nprovision repealed.\n  Despite my concerns regarding the excessive funds which have been \nallocated for missile defense, I will vote for the National Defense \nAuthorization Act. The effort to prepare this legislation was \nsignificantly improved since last year, resulting in a bill which \ncontains many provisions which I can wholeheartedly support. Despite \nsome differences on emphasis or funding amounts, I believe we have \nstruck a reasonable balance. I would again like to commend Senator \nThurmond and Senator Nunn on their leadership on this defense \nauthorization bill. I would also like to acknowledge that we are losing \nseveral valued members of the Senate Armed Services Committee at the \nend of this legislative year. Senator Nunn, Senator Exon, and Senator \nCohen will all be retiring and moving on to new challenges. Senator \nNunn, of course, is the ranking member and former chairman, and has \ndedicated countless hours over the past 24 years to the Armed Services \nCommittee work. His expertise and strong leadership are widely \nrecognized and will certainly be missed.\n\n  Senator Exon has been our leader on strategic issues for the past 10 \nyears. His contributions both there and in tying our committee's work \nto the Budget Committee will be sorely missed.\n  Senator Cohen has been one of the most productive members of the \ncommittee, a leader on issues ranging from acquisition reform to arms \ncontrol matters and one of the members of the majority who has most \nfrequently reached out to the minority to formulate truly bipartisan \npolicies.\n  We have all benefited from their participation and membership on the \nSenate Armed Services Committee. They will be sorely missed by this \nSenator. I would also like to thank the many Senate Armed Services \nCommittee staff members who work so diligently on this complex and \nlengthy legislation and support us so well. I want to particularly \nthank Bill Hoene, who, this year, took on supporting the Acquisition \nand Technology Subcommittee, as well as supporting the Strategic \nForces, and John Etherton, who has supported the Acquisition and \nTechnology Subcommittee for many years. They were an effective team.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on agreeing to the \nconference report to accompany the Defense authorization bill, H.R. \n3230. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate, equally divided, prior to the vote on passage of \nH.R. 3396, the Defense of Marriage Act.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  Mr. President, during the debate this morning, we had excellent \npresentations by the Members who spoke at length about the serious \nlegal and constitutional concerns raised by this bill. The first \nconcern was that for over 200 years the States themselves have had \nsufficient power in recognizing or not recognizing marriage conditions \nin other States. They have done that for 200 years, and 15 States now \nhave already indicated they would not recognize same-sex marriages, so \nthey have the authority already after 200 years.\n  Second, by trying to enhance or diminish the full faith and credit \nprovisions of the Constitution, that is basically unconstitutional. We \ncannot enhance full faith and credit. We cannot diminish it. It is a \nconstitutional issue, and authority and action by statute cannot affect \nit. Therefore, I think, there are serious questions about the \nconstitutionality.\n  Third, Mr. President, this is really, I think, a dangerous precedent. \nToday it is marriage, tomorrow it may be divorce, the third day it may \nbe custody. Where will it end?\n  Mr. President, I do not think support of this is wise judgment. The \nStates have the authority to be able to deal with it. It is \nparticularly not necessary at the present time. I hope the legislation \nwill be defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today the State of Hawaii's court is \nconsidering a case that would legalize same-sex marriage. This bill \ndoes not ban same-sex marriage, it just says that any State does not \nhave to recognize a marriage performed in a State that does legalize \nsame-sex marriage either through the courts or through legislation. I \nthink this is a positive bill. Senator Byrd spoke eloquently on it.\n  In addition to that, this bill defines marriage as a legal union \nbetween male and female. It is almost absurd or unheard of to think we \nwould have to do that. A lot of people, a lot of gay activists are \nrequiring that we do that.\n  Mr. President, I urge our colleagues to support this legislation. It \nis constitutional. We do have opinions from the Attorney General and \nothers in the Justice Department saying that it is constitutional. I \nurge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the third reading of the \nbill.\n  The bill was ordered to a third reading and was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. 2056, the Employment Nondiscrimination Act \nof 1996, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2056) to prohibit employment discrimination on \n     the basis of sexual orientation.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. May we have order, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. President, every American should have the opportunity to work, to \nuse their talents to the fullest extent possible, and no one should be \ndiscriminated against. No one should be denied the opportunity to work \nat jobs they are qualified to fill. That is why I am so proud to be a \ncosponsor of S. 932, the Employment Nondiscrimination Act, along with \n30 of my colleagues.\n  Strides have to be made to provide gay and lesbian Americans with \nfull and equal protection of the laws promised every American by the \n14th amendment. Nowhere is the absence of that protection felt more \ninsidiously than in the area of employment.\n  The Employment Nondiscrimination Act prohibits employment \ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation. It\n\n[[Page S10130]]\n\ncreates no special rights, or quotas, it merely grants gay and lesbian \nAmericans the same rights afforded other Americans in the workplace. \nThe legislation exempts religious organizations and businesses with \nfewer than 15 employees, prohibits preferential treatment, and does not \nrequire an employer to provide benefits to domestic partners. It also \ndoes not apply to the Armed Forces.\n  It is so important to enact this bill into law. This bill is not \nabout special rights; it is, instead, about equal rights, equal \nprotection. Congress has the power to act to protect your rights, and \noverwhelming majorities of Americans support doing so. Every Member of \nCongress should support ENDA, because this legislation embodies \nAmerican values. It is an essential step to take if we are to continue \nmaking progress toward ensuring equal opportunity for all Americans.\n  A broad coalition of religious, labor and business leaders have \nendorsed the bill, including the United Methodist Church, the \nPresbyterian Church, the ACLU, and the National Education Association.\n  The American Bar Association endorsed the bill when they stated:\n\n       Over the years, and with some struggle, this Nation has \n     extended employment discrimination protection to individuals \n     on the basis of race, religion, gender, national origin, age, \n     and disability. ENDA takes the next necessary step by \n     extending this same basic protection to another group that \n     has been vilified and victimized--gay men, lesbians, and \n     bisexuals. All workers, regardless of their sexual \n     orientation, are entitled to be judged on the strength of the \n     work they do; they should not be deprived of their livelihood \n     because of the prejudice of others.\n\n  Ending employment discrimination is an area where Federal action is \nneeded to protect individual liberty and opportunity. Furthermore, it \nis important to provide a stable, healthy, and productive work \nenvironment for employees. Many companies have already adopted their \nown antidiscrimination policies, recognizing the negative impact \ndiscrimination can have on our country's transition into the 21st \ncentury's global workplace. They know that there is no place for \ndiscrimination in this country.\n\n  Furthermore, this is an issue of economic competitiveness. Our work \nforce is what makes America strong. If we are going to head into the \n21st century as strong as we can, we need to utilize the talents of \nall. Every American stands to benefit when each citizen is given a \nchance to contribute to the maximum extent of his or her ability.\n  This is also about fundamental fairness. Each of us should be allowed \nto fully participate in society, regardless of our gender, race, or \nsexual orientation. Americans should not be held back by conditions \nthat have nothing to do with merit, or talents and abilities.\n  If there is any objective that should command complete American \nconsensus, it is ensuring that every American has the chance to \nsucceed--and that, in the final analysis, is what this bill is about. \nNo issue is more critical to our country, and nothing makes a bigger \ndifference in a person's life than opening up opportunities.\n  At this time there is no truly effective recourse for sexual \norientation job discrimination in 41 States across the Nation. \nCurrently, nine States have laws that prohibit discrimination on the \nbasis of sexual orientation in employment, as well as in other areas, \nsuch as housing. But the vast majority of gay men and lesbians across \nthe country have no protection.\n  Opponents of ENDA claim that this legislation will provide gay men \nand lesbians with special treatment and cause a proliferation of \nlitigation, but that is not the case. ENDA prohibits giving \npreferential treatment to any individual based on sexual orientation. \nThus, employers may not provide special treatment to gay men, lesbians, \nor heterosexuals. The bill provides that an employer may not use the \nfact of an individual's sexual orientation as the basis for positive or \nnegative action against that individual in employment opportunities.\n  Furthermore, existing data suggests that ENDA will not result in much \nlitigation. Consider the experience of the District of Columbia whose \nHuman Rights Act (1977) was the first statute to bar employment \ndiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The D.C. Department \nof Human Rights states that in fiscal year 1995, 435 discrimination \ncomplaints were filed. Out of the 435 complaints, only 20 were based on \nsexual orientation. The nine States having statutes giving legal \nremedies to employees suffering from sexual orientation job \ndiscrimination follow the same pattern as the District.\n  Although Illinois does not have an employment discrimination statute, \nthe city of Chicago has an ordinance protecting gay men and lesbians \nfrom discrimination in the work place. Due to this city ordinance, \nChicago residents have protection against discrimination. And it works. \nFor example, in October 1991, a Chicago man, shortly after being hired \nas a waiter at a restaurant told his manager that he was gay. From that \npoint on, the manager yelled and screamed at the man using derogatory \nepithets. None of the other employees were called similar names.\n  After a few months on the job, the man's shifts were cut from 6 to 7 \nshifts per week to 2 to 3 shifts per week. The assistant manager stated \nthat the hours were being reduced because the waiter complained about \ncarrying three hot plates at once and because he brought a donut into \nthe restaurant. However, none of the other waiters carried three hot \nplates at once, nor were other employees penalized for bringing food \ninto the restaurant. No one else on the staff had their shifts cut for \nthe above reasons.\n  Because Chicago has a city ordinance protecting gay men and lesbians \nfrom employment discrimination, this man was able to file a complaint \nwith the city of Chicago Commission on Human Relations. The commission \nfound substantial evidence that the ordinance was violated. The \nrestaurant appealed the case to the State courts and the court upheld \nthe commission's decision.\n  It is clear that discrimination in the workplace still occurs. \nWithout national legislation to protect all Americans, cases of \ndiscrimination against gay men and lesbian women will continue to occur \nunchallenged.\n  The basic principle we should keep in mind is that every American \nmust have the opportunity to advance as far in their field as their \nhard work will take them. Gay and lesbian Americans should not have to \nface discrimination in the workplace, including being fired from a job, \nbeing denied a promotion, or experience harassment on the job just \nbecause of their sexual orientation.\n  As a matter of fundamental fairness and because all workers should be \nentitled to legal protection in the work force, I will enthusiastically \nsupport this legislation.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Kansas 3 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized for up \nto 3 minutes.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I would like to reiterate my opposition to the \nlegislation before us.\n  Last Friday, we had a thorough debate on the Employment \nNondiscrimination Act during the course of which important arguments \nwere made why it should not become law.\n  First, Senator Hatch pointed out the relationship between this bill \nand title VII and how the use of statistics in certain cases will also \nbe available under this bill. The net result is that under this bill, \nas under title VII, statistics may be used by the EEOC as evidence of \ndiscrimination. Employers, as a defensive measure, may feel compelled \nto keep track of the sexual preferences of their employees. This is an \nexample of the unintended consequences that may flow from this bill.\n  Second, Senator Ashcroft pointed out that the bill itself \nacknowledges that there are legitimate reasons why in certain \nsituations the law should not apply. For example, the bill exempts the \nmilitary as well as religious organizations and their not-for-profit \nactivities. His question, which I think is a good one, is: If there are \nreasons for exempting these employers, may not these same reasons apply \nto other employers in the private sector?\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to repeat my own principal objection \nto this bill. I do not believe that relying on more lawsuits and \nlitigation, as this bill would do, will promote greater tolerance in \nthe workplace. I believe prejudice and discrimination can be fought\n\n[[Page S10131]]\n\nin other ways, and I hope that it would be done--leading by way of \nexample.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy], who is the author of \nthe legislation, pointed out numerous examples of employers who adopted \ntheir own nondiscrimination policies, and I applaud those efforts, but \nI do not believe we need to create another legal cause of action with \ncompensatory and punitive damages that will only lead to more division \nin the workplace, not less.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill, and I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nRhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized \nfor up to 2 minutes.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to make two \ncomments in favor of this bill, the Employment Nondiscrimination Act, \nor ENDA.\n  I believe the matter before the Senate is a very simple one: Whether \nor not sexual orientation is a factor that should be considered in \nemployment decisions. In my view, the answer is clear. The only factor \nthat should be considered in the workplace is the ability of an \nemployee or potential employee to do the job at hand. Since sexual \norientation, like race or ethnicity, has nothing to do with job \nability, it seems to me it has no place as a basis for discrimination.\n  There is nothing particularly radical about this proposition, Mr. \nPresident. It is a singularly American belief that each and every \nperson shall be judged not on unrelated factors such as color or gender \nbut on their merits. In the workplace, that translates to an \nindividual's job skills and capabilities. To judge a person otherwise, \nI believe, goes against the grain of what this whole country stands \nfor. As Barry Goldwater recently noted, ``job discrimination against \ngays or anybody else is contrary to each of our founding principles.''\n\n  Other Senators have recounted tales of gays and lesbians who have \nsuddenly lost their jobs when employers discovered their sexual \norientation. These instances are shocking and, I believe, shameful. No \none deserves such treatment.\n  So let me make one point clear, Mr. President. An employee whose \nbehavior in the workplace is inappropriate deserves no protection from \nsanction. A gay employee who makes inappropriate statements or \notherwise conducts him or herself in an inappropriate manner should not \nbe countenanced. That is clear. The same would apply to a nongay \nindividual who conducts him or herself inappropriately. That conduct \nwould not be tolerated.\n  As my colleague from California, Mrs. Feinstein, put it last Friday, \n``Do something that is improper conduct, and it all changes.'' Any kind \nof untoward behavior, no matter from whom it comes, must not be \npermitted.\n  This bill before us would provide basic protection to Americans who \nare subject now to arbitrary and unreasonable job denial or dismissal. \nI think that is appropriate, Mr. President, so I urge support of this \nmeasure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized for up \nto 2 minutes.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I understand the difficulty many Members may \nhave with the prospect of same-sex marriages, and so I understand why \nthe vote completed just a few minutes ago was so tough for many \nSenators. But this one shouldn't be. Those of us who support the \nEmployment Non-Discrimination Act have a simple plea--let's end \ndiscrimination in the work-place.\n  We can't forget, Mr. President, that we are a nation made prosperous \nand strong by the labor of millions of American workers. And each \nAmerican worker--whether they build houses, pave roads, serve meals in \ncountry diners, or manage corporations--deserves to be judged by their \ndedication to their job and the quality of their work.\n  It is indefensible, that in a great country like ours men and women \ncan lose their jobs, be passed over for promotions, or suffer \nharassment because they have--or are perceived to have--a different \nsexual orientation than the rest of us.\n  And for their part, American businesses deserve a work force which \nembodies maximum talent and minimal prejudice and dissention. Surely \nending discrimination will improve productivity and enhance employee \nsatisfaction. Former Senator Barry Goldwater, just quoted by the \nSenator from Rhode Island, wrote in support of this legislation: ``job \ndiscrimination excludes qualified individuals, lowers work-force \nproductivity and eventually hurts us all. It's not just bad--it's bad \nfor business.''\n  So this bill, Mr. President, which extends Federal employment \ndiscrimination protections modeled after those currently in place for \nrace, gender, age, and disability to sexual orientation, is good for \nAmerican businesses and good for American workers.\n  It is moderate, reasonable, and eminently fair. This vote on this \nbill ought to be an easy one. It specifically rejects special rights \nand preferences. It exempts businesses with 15 or less employees, as \nwell as all religious institutions and educational nonprofits owned or \nmanaged by religious organizations. It does not affect the U.S. \nmilitary. It does not provide benefits for same-sex partners.\n  I first became a cosponsor of the 1994 act in the midst of a very \ndifficult re-election campaign. But I knew that equality on the job \nought to be the right of every single American, that prejudice divides \nus, that discrimination is wrong, and that I could justify my support \nfor this bill to anyone.\n  Mr. President, this bill is not about special rights for anyone. It \nis about equal rights for everyone. I urge my colleagues to vote \n``yes'' to the Employment Non-Discrimination Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield the Senator from Indiana 4 minutes.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, today's debate concerns an issue of extreme \nimport and controversy--extending civil rights protection to sexual \norientation.\n  This is an issue of great importance because, for the first time in \nour history, Federal legislation would protect an individual's \nbehavior, rather than an individual's status, as traditional civil \nrights laws have done. The practical impact of this bill is that \nemployers will no longer be able to consider or hold an employee \naccountable for any acts related to their sexual orientation.\n  The fact that this issue--the extension of civil rights to an \nindividual's behavior--is controversial goes without saying. This is an \nissue about gay rights in the workplace, which the American people have \nnot reached a moral consensus. Many Americans, including business \npeople, those who support strong traditional families, and persons with \nreligious or moral objections, have serious concerns about promoting \nhomosexuality as a lifestyle. This is important, because if this bill \nbecomes law, it will give the Federal stamp of approval to activities \nthat are still considered illegal in many States. It is significant \nalso because individual employers, employees, forprofit religious \norganizations and enterprises will no longer be able to conduct their \nbusiness without the fear of Federal intrusion and potentially costly \nlitigation.\n  Mr. President, we are not speaking of extending rights that every \ncitizen of the United States is guaranteed--rather we are considering \nspecial rights for persons based on their lifestyle choice, as \nevidenced by their behavior. I share the concern of many that no person \nbe subjected to violence and hatred simply because they do not meet \nwith societal approval. But I am just as concerned about individuals \nwho, because of sincerely and deeply held religious or moral \nconvictions, find certain lifestyles to be morally unacceptable and yet \nare told by the Government that those beliefs must be kept private and \nmay not be applied to their business decisions. These individuals are \ntold that the first amendment's protections do not apply to the way \nthey run their businesses, their family bookstore, or their day care \ncenter. This should not be the case.\n\n[[Page S10132]]\n\n  I ask my colleagues to join with me in voting to preserve one of our \nNation's most cherished rights: The freedom to freely exercise our \nreligious beliefs and to not be coerced by the Government into \naccepting into our employ those whose behavior violates our deeply held \nreligious convictions.\n  I yield back any time I have.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Vermont, a \ncosponsor on this important legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I have spoken at length on this issue \npreviously so I will not extend my remarks to any great extent. I \nremind people what we are talking about here.\n  First of all, we ought to have a sense of the public; 84 to 85 \npercent of the people in this country say, ``What is the issue? Pass \nthe bill.'' Nobody should be inquired of about their sexual preference \nor whatever in getting employment. They ought to be allowed to work.\n  The questions about all these things that have been brought up--there \nare exceptions to almost all of them. The religious organizations are \nexcepted, nonprofits are excepted. The rights of employers in all these \nareas are protected. There is no question here.\n  My question is why should I or why should my wife or my kids be \nasked, when they go to get a job in this Nation, ``Where are you living \nand who are you living with?'' And, if it is of the same sex, be \ninquired of as to what their sexual preferences are, their sexual \nactivities? To me, that is a disgrace, to allow that to happen in this \nNation of freedom, where working is so important, where our people \nought to be free to work where they please and ought to be able to have \na life they want and to live free from that kind of intimidation.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut, a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized for \n2 minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to support the bill. This bill \noffers us an opportunity to take, not only a fundamental principle of \nAmerican life and history, but in my opinion the driving impulse of the \nAmerican experience, which is equal opportunity, and apply it to a \nspecific circumstance. The basic question here is whether a person who \nworks hard, plays by the rules, does the job, is entitled to be \nprotected from discrimination in hiring, in promotion, in salary, based \non a very private and personal decision which is that person's sexual \norientation.\n\n  You do not have to decide the question of whether you believe \nhomosexuality is right or wrong. You do not have to decide the question \nof whether domestic partnership is right or wrong. You do not have to \ndecide the question of whether one's sexual orientation is a matter of \nchoice or whether you are born with it, to vote for this bill. All of \nthat is irrelevant.\n  The question here is whether we are going to protect a category of \nour fellow Americans, fellow citizens, fellow human beings--children of \nGod--from being discriminated against based on their sexual \norientation; a private matter.\n  I say the answer has to be ``yes.'' In 1996, it is time to offer that \nprotection to keep the promise of the American Constitution and the \nAmerican dream. This is a narrowly circumscribed bill. By God, this \nbill even says to an employer you can regulate the clothing of someone \nworking for you if that is an issue.\n  I support the bill and ask all my colleagues to do the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Utah 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized for 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, everybody here knows I have worked hard to \npass the hate crime statistics bill, I worked hard with the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts to pass AIDS bills and do \nother things that benefit people who are gay and lesbians. I believe \nthat we should respond to the needs of our citizens in these regards. \nSpecial protected status in the law, however, is another matter. I, \ntherefore, oppose this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I oppose this legislation. This bill represents a \nmassive increase in Federal power. The Federal bureaucracy will have a \nfield day with this bill. The bill will be a litigation bonanza. \nMoreover, this bill deals in a blunderbuss way with an issue much more \ncomplex than issues raised by legislation addressing race, ethnicity, \nand gender. Sexual orientation involves conduct, not immutable \nnonbehavioral characteristics.\n  Indeed, during the debate about homosexuals in the military, Gen. \nColin Powell made this point in responding to the suggestion that \ndiscrimination against homosexuals in the military should be equated \nwith racial discrimination. He said,\n\n       Skin color is a benign, non-behavioral characteristic. \n     Sexual orientation is perhaps the most profound of human \n     behavioral characteristics. Comparison of the two is a \n     convenient but invalid argument.\n\n  Indeed, this very bill exempts employment in the U.S. military, \nalthough it does not exempt the National Guard.\n  It is totally indefensible to say that a black person should be \ndenied the right to teach children of any race in any of our public or \nprivate schools. But should the Senate run roughshod over the concerns \nof parents and educators about having homosexuals teach their kids?\n  I mentioned last week on the floor that Loudoun County, VA, parents \nand educators wanted to fire a male health and physical education \nteacher at a middle school, who was also an assistant athletic coach at \na high school because of public homosexual conduct, in this case, \nparticipation in homosexual videos. Such concern is not triggered just \nby participation in videos. It can be triggered by public displays of \nromantic, physical affection between two persons of the same sex.\n  In Loudoun County, the school superintendent said,\n\n       We believe that teachers, as people who are chosen to be \n     instructors as well as leaders of our young people, should be \n     exemplary in their professional as well as personal lives. \n     What we have here is an allegation of a lifestyle that is not \n     in keeping with that. If the allegations are true, that is \n     not conduct befitting a teacher.\n\n  One parent of a daughter who attended a school where this person \ntaught said she believed that what people do in their private lives is \ntheir business--unless they are teachers. ``I want our teachers to have \nthe highest moral fiber. I'm not comfortable with him doing both.'' A \nschool board member said,\n\n       Here we have a teacher in a middle school working with \n     children who are at that age where they are struggling with \n     their identity. This is obviously a person who has made bad \n     choices. To give someone like this access to children at that \n     stage of development would be irresponsible of us.\n\n  And just because some of the citizens of Loudoun County and across \nthis country do not share the view of public morality of some of the \nsponsors of this measure, who seek to cast aspersions on opponents of \nthis legislation, does not make those citizens bigots.\n  Moreover, those proponents of this bill who, wrongly in my view, \nsupport blatant, intentional discrimination on the basis of immutable \ncharacteristics such as race and ethnicity in teacher hires in order to \nprovide role models to students, are in no position to lecture parents \nconcerned about the conduct of teachers as role models. Finally, I want \nto know how it is that proponents of a bill that itself exempts the \nmilitary can dismiss the concerns of parents about the conduct of their \nchildren's teachers.\n  I note, Mr. President, that if a school district wanted to dismiss, \nor decline to hire, a male teacher, for example, who engages in \nromantic, physical displays of affection in public with his male \npartner, this bill makes such a dismissal or refusal illegal--unless \nthe school district will do the same regarding a male teacher's \nequivalent display of romantic affection for his wife or girlfriend.\n  Additionally, this bill will empower the EEOC to require employers to \ncollect statistics on the sexual orientation of their employees.\n\n  One proponent of this bill last week said the bill does not give the \nEEOC this authority. That is wrong. The bill,\n\n[[Page S10133]]\n\nat section 11, gives the EEOC, ``with respect to the administration and \nenforcement of this act'' the same power the EEOC has to administer and \nenforce title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Under title VII, the \nEEOC collects statistics on the race, ethnicity, and gender of \nemployees. Would the EEOC request such information? No one in this body \ncan assure us that the EEOC won't do so at some time in the future. \nRemember, the EEOC is one of those entities responsible for the growth \nand development of quotas and other preferences under title VII, \nrelying heavily on statistics in the process.\n  Moreover, it is well established that statistics can be used in \nintentional discrimination cases under title VII, such as pattern or \npractice cases. So, notwithstanding language in the bill about prima \nfacie cases of disparate impact, this bill does not at all preclude the \nuse of statistics in sexual orientation cases.\n  Suppose a complainant, alleging that he was discriminatorily denied a \npromotion because he is a homosexual, asserts that a supervisor made \nanti homosexual remarks, and one or two more complainants make the same \nallegations. Those allegations, and evidence of a supervisor's anti \nhomosexual remarks, could be combined by a Federal enforcement agency \nor private plaintiffs' lawyer with statistics on the number or \npercentage of homosexuals in the job in question, or the promotion \nrates based on sexual orientation, or both, to press a case of a \npattern or practice of discrimination.\n  Finally, let me note that this bill will lead to reverse \ndiscrimination and preferences in favor of homosexuals, and I will \nmention just one way that will happen. The bill's provision allegedly \nbarring preferential treatment does not affect judicial power to \nenforce this bill. This bill gives the courts the same jurisdiction and \npowers as such courts have to enforce title VII of the Civil Rights Act \nof 1964. Further, the procedures and remedies applicable for a title \nVII violation are available under this bill.\n  Under title VII's section 706(g), the Federal courts are authorized \nto order such affirmative action as may be appropriate in cases of \nintentional discrimination. The Supreme Court has said, unfortunately, \nthat there are some cases in which a court may order numerical and \nother forms of preferential relief under title VII. Moreover, such \npreferential relief can be entered as part of a consent decree with the \nFederal Government, which wields enormous leverage over employers in \nthese costly lawsuits, and in cases with private plaintiffs' lawyers.\n  Proponents of this legislation have argued that it will not produce \nmuch litigation, because there have been very few cases brought in the \nStates with similar laws. That prediction is not persuasive. By \nauthorizing the EEOC to become involved in and to initiate law suits \nbased on gender-preference discrimination, this bill would lead to \nscores of thousands of new law suits against persons acting on the \nbasis of strongly held religious views. Consider the case of religious \nbroadcasters, for example. This bill would force religious broadcasters \nto engage in hiring and promotion practices that are contrary to their \nreasonable, deeply held religious views. We should not force citizens \nto endorse sexual practices that are contrary to their religious views. \nThis bill, however, would do just that.\n  Let me also say that my support for the Hate Crimes Statistics Act, \nwhich Senator Simon and I have gotten through the Senate and enacted \ninto law twice, is fully consistent with my position on this bill. My \nview that absolutely no one should be subjected to violence or \nvandalism because of who they are is, of course, widely shared. But it \ndoes not follow from the fact that while everyone, including \nhomosexuals, should be free of violence, society must confer \naffirmative civil protections on the basis of sexual orientation not \navailable, I might add, to everyone else.\n  Let me just add this. There is a religious side to this that must be \nconsidered. There are sincerely believing, mainstream religious people \nin this country who believe we have gone too far in this matter. Can \nyou imagine a religious broadcaster, because they are in a profitmaking \nbusiness, having to comply with the provisions of this act?\n  I urge the defeat of this legislation.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, throughout my career in public service, \namounting to over four decades now, I have fought to end discrimination \nand advance the ideal of equal opportunity in society. One of my first \nsuccesses as a young Oregon State legislator in the early 1950's was as \nthe sponsor of the Oregon Public Accommodations Act, which prohibited \ndiscrimination on the basis of race in public accommodations. With this \nnew law, Oregon set an example for the Nation.\n  The Public Accommodations Act was the first of many divisive civil \nrights debates in which I have become involved. I have also played a \nrole in many other civil rights advances as this Nation has attempted \nto stamp out the irrational and hateful scourge of discrimination. \nThese efforts have often taken the form of extending protection from \ndiscrimination in the workplace. Over the years, we have focused on \ndiscrimination on the basis of race, gender, national origin, age, \nreligion, and disability. These laws are based on a simple premise: \nEmployees should be judged on the work they do, not on the basis of \nprejudice not related to workplace performance.\n  The time has arrived to take the next logical step toward equality of \nopportunity in the workplace. Senate bill 2056, the Employment \nNondiscrimination Act which would prohibit discrimination in employment \non the basis of sexual orientation is such a step. The Employment \nNondiscrimination Act focuses on a group of citizens who have been \nvictimized and vilified like few other minority groups in this Nation's \nhistory. Oregon has not been spared from this prejudice, and I speak \nhere today on behalf of many Oregonians touched by it. One prominent \nexample took place in Medford, OR, last year where two women were \nmurdered. Their murderer confessed that he killed them because of his \nhate for homosexuals.\n  While we will not be able to wash this type of deep-seeded hatred \nfrom our society merely by enacting a Federal statute, employment \nrelations is narrowly focused and appropriate for a Federal statement \nof national policy, as we have demonstrated many times. This \nlegislation now before the Senate takes a very measured approach toward \naddressing this difficult problem. It does not create special \nprotections, preferences, or hiring quotas for gay people. As has been \nthe case in prior civil rights statutes, particularly the Civil Rights \nAct of 1991, this legislation specifically prohibits quotas on the \nbasis of sexual orientation. This prohibition is further undergirded by \na provision that prohibits an employee from bringing a disparate impact \nsuit.\n  Religious organizations are given a broad exemption from this \nproposal. The armed services are also exempt, as are small businesses \nwith fewer than 15 employees. Moreover, no business would be required \nto provide benefits to an employee's same-sex partner.\n  As this Nation turns the corner toward the 21st century, the global \nnature of our economy is becoming more and more apparent. If we are to \ncompete in this marketplace, we must break down the barriers to hiring \nthe most qualified and talented person for the job. Prejudice is such a \nbarrier. It is intolerable and irrational for it to color decisions in \nthe workplace.\n  The employee manual for my office has for some time included a \nspecific provision prohibiting discrimination based on sexual \norientation. A majority of the Fortune 500 companies have reached this \nsame conclusion. It is time for this body to do the same. It is time \nfor our laws to reflect a point of fundamental fairness: An employee \nshould be free from discrimination at work because of personal \ncharacteristics unrelated to the successful performance of his or her \njob.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor of the \nEmployment Nondiscrimination Act, or ENDA, to urge my colleagues to \nsupport this historic and important legislation.\n  This bill would ensure that no American citizen is discriminated \nagainst in employment because of their sexual orientation. It's a \nsimple, straightforward bill. And it stands for a fundamental American \nprinciple: the principle that discrimination of any kind is wrong.\n  Mr. President, our Nation was founded over 200 years ago by people \nwho had\n\n[[Page S10134]]\n\nmigrated to America largely to escape persecution. The earliest \nAmericans often didn't fit in where they used to live. They were \ndifferent. Maybe they belonged to a religious minority. Maybe they had \ndifferent political ideas. Or maybe they were ostracized merely because \nof the way they looked.\n  These earliest Americans left their homes, their communities, and \ntheir homelands to live in a new kind of nation. A nation that not only \ntolerated differences, but honored them.\n  From the beginning, Mr. President, this respect for individual \ndifferences--perhaps more than anything else--is what has defined us as \nAmericans. It lies at the heart of our culture. It's embedded in our \nConstitution. And, in the eyes of the world, it's what makes America \nthe special place it is.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, our Nation has not always lived up to \nour own highest principles. And it's often taken great battles to make \nsure that we do.\n  It took almost 100 years and a civil war to eliminate slavery.\n  It took another 100 years, and enormous social strife, to outlaw \nracial discrimination.\n  And it took a long, difficult effort to win women the right to vote, \nand to prohibit sex discrimination.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, the fight for equal rights for all \nAmericans is not over. Today, it is still legal to fire someone because \nthey are gay, lesbian, or even heterosexual--or merely for \nbeing perceived as such.\n\n  This kind of discrimination affects hardworking Americans in all \nsorts of jobs, no matter how well they perform their duties. With \nhundreds of such cases documented, and many others undocumented, \ncountless Americans fear losing their jobs to discrimination.\n  Mr. President, today we have another opportunity to restore our \ncommitment to American principles. But, this time, we can do it without \nthe bloodshed and division of previous battles.\n  Today we have an opportunity to extend the Civil Rights Act, and to \nsay to each and every American, that you have a right to be treated as \nan individual in employment. You have a right to be judged on the \nquality of your work. A right to be judged on the basis of your \nperformance. And sexual orientation is irrelevant.\n  Mr. President, the right to be treated as an individual in employment \nis consistent with the great American tradition of individual \nliberties. And so it should not be surprising that it enjoys strong \npublic support. Most Americans believe that people should not be denied \na job, or a promotion, simply because of their sexual orientation.\n  But discrimination against homosexual Americans remains a serious \nproblem. Many employers just will not hire a gay or a lesbian. Or they \nwill fire or fail to promote them once they have been hired.\n  Sometimes, Mr. President, employment discrimination is based on raw \nand malicious bigotry--open hatred of people different than themselves.\n  But often, the discrimination is more subtle. Often, employers don't \nhate gays. They're just uncomfortable with them. They're uneasy with \nthe concept of homosexuality. And, so, all other things being equal, \nthey'll choose to hire someone with whom they're more comfortable.\n  Mr. President, from the perspective of an individual employer, that \ndecision may seem entirely reasonable. But that's equally true of \nemployers who are just uncomfortable with blacks. Or employers who are \njust uncomfortable with Jews.\n  For those employers, we say: you may be uncomfortable with blacks or \nJews. But you may not discriminate against them. Because it's wrong. \nIt's wrong morally and ethically. And it's not fair.\n  The same reasoning applies in the case of discrimination based on \nsexual orientation.\n  Mr. President, individual employers are not making these decisions in \nisolation. Millions of employers are making similar decisions. And \ntogether, they can create a systemic bias with serious consequences.\n  In the case of homosexuals, this bias limits their opportunity to \nfind meaningful employment. It limits their ability to make ends meet \nfinancially. It limits their ability to live full and satisfying lives, \nand to make meaningful contributions to society.\n  Mr. President, that's not right. Every American should have the \nopportunity to live the American Dream. Every American. No matter their \nrace. No matter their religion. And no matter their sexual orientation.\n  Mr. President, as Senator Lieberman said on the floor last week, we \nare all God's children. Each and every one of us.\n  And if we allow hate and discrimination against anyone, we damn our \nown loved ones. We shame ourselves. And we violate the fundmental \nprinciples upon which this great Nation was based.\n  Mr. President, let me just close by recalling the words of the \nDeclaration of Independence. All men are created equal. They are \nendowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights. Among those \nare life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n  Mr. President, let us live up to the principles of that Declaration. \nLet us be true to our values as Americans. And let us ensure that our \nown loved ones enjoy the respect and dignity that each and every \nAmerican deserves.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts controls 5 \nminutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, for 200 years, we have tried to free this Nation from \nforms of discrimination. Discrimination was written into the \nConstitution of the United States, and the American people have paid a \nfierce price for discrimination over its history.\n  We fought a civil war in the 1860's. It really was not until the late \n1950's that we began to rally in support of the work of Dr. Martin \nLuther King--by businessmen, by laborers, by church leaders, by all \nAmericans--and said, ``Let's finally get serious and free ourselves \nfrom discrimination.''\n  We all remember what happened with the Japanese internment, one of \nthe darkest periods in American history at the beginning of World War \nII. And still this country went ahead with that dastardly act.\n  So in the 1960's, we began to make progress on the issues of race, \nwith the 1964 and 1965 act. Many of the arguments I just heard on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate were made during that particular debate. Then \nin 1965, we freed ourselves from a national-origin quota system in \nimmigration, we freed ourselves from the Asian Pacific triangle that \nwas left over from the early part of the 1900's, called the yellow \nperil. We made progress.\n  We made progress on race. Then we began on religion and national \norigin. Then we began to make progress on gender. We did not include an \nequal rights amendment that said there were ``founding mothers'' as \nwell as Founding Fathers, but, nonetheless, we began to knock down the \nwalls of discrimination on the issues of gender, and we became a more \npowerful and significant and stronger nation.\n  In recent years, we have made progress with regards to Americans with \ndisabilities. Six years ago we passed that legislation to say to 44 \nmillion Americans, ``We will do everything we can to recognize it isn't \ndisability, it is ability, it is what you can do, what you can \ncontribute, that you can be a part of the American dream.'' That has \nbeen the path that we have taken in this country, and we have an \nopportunity to take a very important and significant step by supporting \nENDA.\n  Just the other night, under the leadership of Senators Domenici and \nWellstone, we began to make progress in terms of knocking down the \ndiscrimination that exists with regard to mental health in our country. \nThat exists out there. It exists in our health care systems. We began \nto knock down that barrier as well with the action that was supported \nby Republicans and Democrats alike.\n  Mr. President, today we have the chance to take a meaningful forward \nstep on the road to make America America. We have a really important \nopportunity to turn our back on bigotry, to turn our back on \nintolerance, to turn our back on discrimination. We can take an \nimportant step in the progress of making America America.\n  America will only be America when we free ourselves from \ndiscrimination,\n\n[[Page S10135]]\n\nand this particular legislation, carefully crafted, tries to say, ``If \nyou work in America, if you have the ability to work, you can work, and \nyou ought to be judged on your ability to work and not on the issues of \nsexual orientation.'' That is the case.\n  We know that discrimination against gay men and lesbian women exists \nin this country today, No. 1.\n  No. 2, we know that there are no laws to protect them.\n  No. 3, we know that the whole issue of gay men and lesbian women is \nan immutable condition. It is a condition of life.\n  What we are trying to say is when Americans want to work and can work \nand do a job, they ought to be able to be judged on the job that they \nare going to do and not on one of these other factors.\n  We can free ourselves from discrimination against those gay men and \nlesbian women in the employment place. This is a targeted response to \nthat challenge, and I hope we will support it and pass it \noverwhelmingly.\n  I withhold the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. How much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma controls 5 minutes \n40 seconds. The Senator from Massachusetts 1 minute 26 seconds.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to Senator Kennedy's \nbill, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Senator Kennedy's bill before us elevates sexual orientation to \nspecial status under the Civil Rights Act. It grants Government \napproval, acceptance, and protection to homosexual and bisexual \nbehavior under the Civil Rights Act.\n  Sexual orientation, as defined under the bill proposed by Senator \nKennedy, includes homosexuality, bisexuality, and heterosexuality. It \ndoes not just apply to people in a monogamous relationship. Basically, \nany of the above sexual behaviors are going to be protected by the \nFederal Government. Such behavior must be OK, because Uncle Sam is now \ngoing to protect it.\n  Senator Byrd made an eloquent speech earlier today, and he read from \nthe Bible. He quoted a couple verses in Genesis talking about what God \nsaid about marriage. Many people believe the Bible and believe in it \nvery strongly. Maybe that is recognized by the authors of ENDA, because \nthey exempted religious organizations, but they did not exempt \nreligious people.\n  We exempt churches under the bill. Well, a lot of people consider \nthemselves part of a church 7 days a week, and they have very serious \nproblems with granting special status to people based on their sexual \norientation because they are learning, whether they are Jewish or \nwhether they are Christian or whether they are Muslim, that \nhomosexuality is wrong, it is immoral and should not be condoned and \ncertainly should not be elevated to a special protected status by the \nFederal Government.\n  Does that mean that you want to discriminate? No. But should \nhomosexuals and bisexuals have special protected status? Most people \nwould say no.\n  Mr. President, nine States have something in their statutes, in their \nState codes, that provide some protections for sexual orientation; 41 \nStates do not. The State of Massachusetts does. The State of Oklahoma \ndoes not. I do not really want the State of Massachusetts putting their \nmandate on my State. Maybe our norms are a little different.\n  The sponsor of ENDA did exempt religious organizations. They did not \nexempt schools. There is a high school principal in West Virginia who \nwas recently caught cross-dressing, and he was arrested for soliciting. \nThat was against the law. That was against the State's prostitution \nlaws. What if he was just cross-dressing? He would be protected under \nENDA. Cross-dressing could be considered part of a sexual orientation.\n  What about a schoolteacher who is found to be in homosexual videos--\nSenator Hatch mentioned one example--what if somebody was particularly \nwell known as a gay activist? What if the school board said, ``We \nreally don't want this person to be teaching our kids physical \neducation in the fifth grade.'' The school board might say, ``That is \nnot the type of mentor, teacher or role model that we would like to \nhave for our young people.'' They can be sued, under this legislation, \nnot only for compensatory damages, but for punitive damages.\n  Some of us have stated the net result of this bill is going to \nrequire employers to ask questions about sexual orientation. That has \nbeen denied by the proponents. But the facts are, if you are sued, if \nsomeone sues you and says, ``Mr. Employer, you didn't hire me because \nof my sexual orientation, the fact I am well known as a gay, the \nemployer might say, I didn't know that.'' But they can still sue.\n  How are employers to protect themselves? They are going to have to \nask a lot of questions. One way of protecting yourself is to tell the \ncourt or convince the court that you have hired homosexuals in the \npast. How do you find that out? Well, you better ask questions.\n  You will have to ask questions and have to survey all your employees. \nWe have never done that before. But the net result of this legislation \nis that employers would have to ask an employee to at least be able to \ndefend himself. And they would have to ask what their sexual \norientation is. That may not be well received by the employees, and it \nmay not be well received by their employers because now you really have \nthe intrusive arm of the Federal Government going into areas they \nshould not.\n  The sponsors of ENDA have exemptions for religious organizations that \nare not-for-profit. What about a religious broadcaster? What about a \nreligious book store? Bingo, we are going to tell them, we do not care \nwhat your belief is, you are going to have to hire somebody that maybe \nis diametrically opposed to your fundamental beliefs.\n  Three years ago, we passed legislation that said we rejected \nPresident Clinton's call for gays in the military--Congress did--with \nan overwhelming vote. Three years ago today, we adopted a policy that \nsays, ``Don't ask, don't tell.'' We are going to tell the school boards \nthat such a policy is not good enough, because this legislation goes \nway beyond ``don't ask, don't tell,'' way beyond ``don't ask, don't \ntell.''\n  So that is what Congress said was acceptable for the military. \nCongress said, sexual orientation is relevant concerning the military, \nbut now, if ENDA becomes law, we are going to tell millions of \nemployers, oh, sexual orientation is irrelevant; it does not make any \ndifference; we do not care what your personal beliefs are, we do not \ncare what your religious beliefs are, it is irrelevant. For some people \nit is relevant, and for some school boards it might be relevant, or for \nsome religious people or some religious groups or religious \nbroadcasters it is very, very relevant.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is a serious mistake and goes way too \nfar. I urge my colleagues to vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to use my leader time for \nwhatever time I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader has a right to do so.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, there has been so much misinformation \nabout what this does and does not do, so many claims about the effect \nit has on certain groups and places of employment, that I would not be \nsurprised that people are confused and very concerned.\n  As we vote, I think we ought to try to clear the air as much as \npossible as to what this does. This bill simply rectifies a significant \nomission in our job discrimination laws, period. It simply prohibits \nanyone from using sexual orientation as the basis for hiring, firing, \npromotion, or pay. ENDA allows no special privileges, period. It grants \nno special rights to any group of people. It simply ensures that no one \nwill be denied the opportunity to support him or herself financially \nbecause of discrimination on the job.\n  This is a matter of simple fairness and common sense. In terms of \nfairness, no one should be denied employment on the basis of a \ncharacteristic that does not relate to his or her ability to get the \njob done. This principle is already embodied in our civil rights laws. \nIt protects religious institutions. Churches, synagogues, and related \ninstitutions will not be forced to change\n\n[[Page S10136]]\n\ntheir hiring practices by this bill, nor will it apply to the military \nor to small businesses with fewer than 15 employees. This is a narrowly \ncrafted bill that simply upholds the basic American principle that \nemployees should be judged by the work they do. It deserves our \nsupport.\n  I ask my colleagues, prior to the time we vote, how many times have \nwe heard the same arguments raised against minorities in other segments \nof our society, against African Americans, against the disabled, \nagainst women? The same arguments that I just heard presented to our \ncolleagues on the Senate floor moments ago were used in the 1960's, in \nthe 1970's, and in the 1980's. We have heard them all.\n  I ask my colleagues, who today would come to the floor to roll back \nthe rights now that we provided African Americans? Who would come to \nthe floor to roll back the rights we have given women? Who would \npropose now we roll back the rights for the disabled? Every time we \ncome to the floor, we pronounce our advocacy of freedom. We talk about \nhow free this democracy is, how great it is for all of us to enjoy the \nmagnificent freedom that we enjoy beyond that of anybody else. If this \nis true, then we will support the freedom guaranteed in this \nlegislation, too. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts has 1 minute, 26 seconds remaining. \nFor the Senator from Oklahoma, all time has expired.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, let me just check and see if the majority \nleader wants to make a speech on his time. In the meantime, unless the \nSenator from Massachusetts wants to speak, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will use leader time to make a closing \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has that right.\n  Mr. LOTT. The legislation we will be voting on in a few minutes, the \nEmployment Nondiscrimination Act, known here as ENDA, should be \nrejected by the Senate, in my opinion. In its various versions it has \nbeen around for many years, I think probably as many as 20 years. But \neven when there was a Democratic majority in the Senate, this bill was \nnever even called up before.\n  We are bringing it up today for a vote, a freestanding vote without \namendments, as part of our larger effort to work together and move \nahead on urgent business of the Senate. There were intense and lengthy \nnegotiations last week to try to come to a conclusion on how to handle \nthe appropriations bill, the Defense of Marriage Act, ENDA--this \nlegislation--and the defense authorization bill, and I have tried to \nset a record of trying to be fair and make sure that we have our chance \nto make our cases here, within limits, and then move on, do the \nbusiness of the Senate, and then move on.\n  So that is how this legislation was set up to be considered in a \nfreestanding way. There are those that really do not think it should \nhave been brought up this way or would have preferred it not even come \nup as an amendment. But I think it is a fair process, and it is one \nthat we agreed to in order to be able to do our business. So, be that \nas it may, that is how we got to where we are.\n  ENDA, in my opinion, is part of a larger attempt to equate, by law, \nwhat the bill itself calls, in the language of the bill, \n``homosexuality, bisexuality, or heterosexuality.'' This is part of a \nlarger campaign to validate or to approve conduct that remains illegal \nin many States. That has to be of concern to a lot of Senators whose \nStates would fall in that category.\n  ENDA would mean that ethical and religious objections to homosexual \nor bisexual conduct would have to be pushed aside or closeted. Those \nobjections could no longer touch the workplace. The bill before us \nseems to be full of exceptions, exceptions for small businesses, the \nArmed Forces, religious organizations, though not for law enforcement, \nschools, day care, or for-profit entities that are part of a church's \nreligious mission.\n  It seems to me there are many instances that should have been \nexempted or should have been excluded. It seems to me that this is just \na guarantee of multiple lawsuits as to exactly what the intent is and \nwhat it means. We do not need that. I think Senator Hatch explained in \nhis very definitive statement on September 6 those exemptions will not \nlimit the damage that will be done by this bill. It would put the full \nforce of the Federal Government behind the campaign to validate a \nlifestyle that is unacceptable in many areas. I think that is the heart \nof the matter.\n  Under ENDA, the antidiscrimination apparatus of the Federal \nGovernment--the apparatus of the Federal Government--would treat sexual \norientation like race. It would scrutinize employment practices, \nrequire remedial hiring or promotion, and treat negative attitudes in \nthis area as workplace harassment.\n  President Clinton's letter supporting this legislation notes that 41 \nStates currently do not outlaw discrimination in employment on the \nbasis of sexual orientation. Only nine States have adopted anything \nlike ENDA. Only 18 Senators represent States which have their own \nversions of this type of legislation, and 82 Senators are here to \nrepresent States which do not have their own laws similar to this one. \nI cannot believe that the majority of the Senate will impose upon those \n41 States a piece of legislation which the citizens of those States \napparently do not want.\n\n  If ever there was a case of ``Washington knows best,'' ENDA is it. If \never there was a one-size-fits-all approach to social engineering, ENDA \nis it.\n  Mr. President, the American people are not bigoted or hateful or \nprejudiced. They just are not. When it comes to ENDA, the American \npeople are cautious, prudent, and weary. I think they are right. They \nhave seen the good intentions of official Washington go astray time and \ntime again. They have heard sweet slogans to cover up legislation with \nmajor problems.\n  That is the case with ENDA. Senators Nickles and Ashcroft and others \nwho have spoken have very forcefully explained the ramifications of \nwhat seems to be a simple bill. But it is not simple at all. It is a \nblank check to a court system increasingly out of touch, in many \ninstances, with the public. It is an open invitation to a Federal \nbureaucracy brutally indifferent to what goes on in American life--in \nour businesses, in our schools, and in our communities.\n  In short, I think this legislation is out of sync with the majority \nof American people. I think the Senate should not pass it. It a very \nserious matter, and I urge my colleagues to vote against it.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, we are about to vote on final passage of \nS. 2056, the Employment Nondiscrimination Act. I urge each Senator to \nvote ``no.''\n  Before we vote, I want to address a few issues that have come up \nduring debate. Time does not, of course, allow me to go into these \nissues in detail.\n  I urge each Senator to consider the moral implications of this vote. \nIn her recent, acclaimed book, ``The De-Moralization of Society,'' \nGertrude Himmelfarb reminded us of a truth that needs to be repeated \nhere:\n\n       Individuals, families, churches, and communities cannot \n     operate in isolation, [they] cannot long maintain values at \n     odds with those legitimated by the state and popularized by \n     the culture. * * * Values, even traditional values, require \n     legitimation. At the very least, they require not to be \n     illegitimated. And in a secular society, legitimation or \n     illegitimation is in the hands of the dominant culture, the \n     state, and the courts.\n\n  This bill goes to the heart of traditional values--the values of \nreligious liberty, free association, and traditional sexual morality.\n  ENDA is solicitous of religious organizations, Mr. President, but \nwhat about religious individuals? This bill concedes that it is going \nto compel an approval of homosexual and bisexual behavior--that is why \nreligious organizations are exempted from the bill--but what about \nreligious individuals?\n  ENDA will punish those Americans who believe it is important to apply\n\n[[Page S10137]]\n\ntheir moral views in the workplace. To millions of Americans, human \nsexuality is still a matter of the deepest moral concern, but ENDA says \nto them that in the workplace they cannot make distinctions based on \nsexual orientation, no matter how compelling.\n  Mr. President, I have heard it said on this floor that ENDA is \nnecessary to guarantee to homosexuals and bisexuals the equal \nprotection of the laws. That is not true.\n  The Constitution of the United States guarantees to every person the \nequal protection of the laws.\n  Our colleagues know, for example, that under Federal employment laws \nas now written every heterosexual, homosexual, or bisexual person is \ntreated equally. Of course, Federal law does not prohibit \ndiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, so Government \nbureaucrats cannot forbid or require a particular result if ``sexual \norientation'' should become an issue in the workplace, but each person \nhas identical rights, whatever his or her sexual orientation.\n  I believe that ENDA is going to mean quotas. The sponsors don't think \nso, and they point to Section 7 of the bill that says that an employer \nshall not give preferential treatment or establish a quota based on \nsexual orientation.\n  Of course, there were many people who thought that the Civil Rights \nAct of 1964 also prohibited quotas and preferential treatment. History \nhas shown that view to be naive. Today, quotas and preferential \ntreatment are a red-hot issue all across the country--but they are \nopposed by the vast, vast majority of the American people.\n  I would remind Senators that ENDA gives to the EEOC--in \nSec. 11(a)(1)--the Attorney General--in Sec. 11(a)(4)--and the Federal \ncourts--in Sec. 11(a)(5)--the same powers they have with respect to \nrace and sex discrimination under current law--see Sec. 11(b). All of \nthe powers of the EEOC and the courts will be brought to bear against \nthe employer who believes that sexual orientation cannot be ignored in \nhis workplace.\n  There are a hundred traps for every covered employer. For example, if \nENDA is enacted 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(m) will make it an ``an unlawful \nemployment practice'' if sexual orientation `'was a motivating factor \nfor any employment practice, even though other factors also motivated \nthe practice.''\n  Mr. President, ENDA is a power grab, and it is exactly the kind of \ninside-the-Beltway power grab that Americans have come to resent.\n  ENDA threatens to make sexuality an issue where it has never been an \nissue before. Currently, most employers don't know about their \nemployees' sexual orientation and don't care. ENDA will help put an end \nto that. Some employers do care, and ENDA will put an end to that, too. \nENDA is about sexuality, but it is not about privacy. ENDA is about \ngoing public.\n  Mr. President, I have heard it said on this floor that 80 percent of \nthe American people support this bill. This is not true.\n  The claim seems to be based on a poll taken by Newsweek magazine: In \nthat poll, conducted in May of this year, 84 percent of the Newsweek \nrespondents did say there should be ``equal rights for gays in terms of \njob opportunities''--but that doesn't mean 84 percent of Americans want \na new Federal mandate. In fact, that very same poll shows that they \ndon't.\n  When asked about the effort the country has already made ``to protect \nthe rights of gays and lesbians,'' 26 percent said the country had made \nthe right amount of effort, 27 percent said more effort is needed, but \n40 percent said the effort had gone too far.\n  When asked specifically if there should be ``special legislation to \nguarantee equal rights for gays,'' 41 percent agreed that there should \nbe such legislation but 52 percent said there should not be such \nlegislation. In sum, Americans favor fairness but they oppose the heavy \nhand of government which is what ENDA represents.\n  Mr. President, ENDA equates homosexuality and bisexuality with \nheterosexuality, but the American people have never regarded \nhomosexuality or bisexuality as the moral or legal equivalent of \nheterosexuality, whether in the workplace or not.\n  ENDA for bids discrimination ``on the basis of sexual orientation'' \nwhich it defines to mean ``homosexuality, bisexuality, or \nheterosexuality, whether such orientation is real or perceived.'' \nFrankly, no one knows what those words mean or how they will be applied \nin many real-life situations.\n  There is much more that ought to be said, Mr. President, but let me \nconclude with this.\n  Just 3 years ago yesterday, the Senate voted 63 to 33 for a \ncompromise policy on homosexuals in the military. With that vote and \nlater votes and the President's signature, the laws of the United \nStates states that homosexuality was relevant to service in the Armed \nForces of the United States, and that open homosexuality was \ndisqualifying.\n  Today, we will vote on ENDA, a bill that will tell every employer in \nAmerica that homosexuality and bisexuality must at all times and in all \nworkplaces be irrelevant. Can the Senate truly believe that \nhomosexuality can be relevant in the military services but must be \nirrelevant in the thousands of private workplaces that will be covered \nby ENDA?\n  The Congress and the President have told the Pentagon that \nhomosexuality is contrary to good order and discipline--is it now going \nto tell every private employer in America that, regardless of his or \nher own moral judgment, homosexuality and bisexuality are just another \norientation that Congress has decreed to be irrelevant?\n  Mr. President, are we prepared to levy fines on a school district \nthat uses a policy that looks very much like the military's ``don't \nask, don't tell''? Are we prepared to force the American people into a \npolicy that holds sexual orientation irrelevant in every workplace \nexcept the church and the military? What are we going to say to the \nsmall business owner who wants to know why he, a private citizen with \nstrong moral views, doesn't have at least as much freedom to choose \nemployees as a Navy recruiter?\n  ENDA is a radical step, and it is a step in the wrong direction. It \nshould be defeated.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent several letters urging \nopposition to this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                     U.S. Chamber of Commerce,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 10, 1996.\n       Members of the U.S. Senate: The Senate will soon consider \n     the Employment Nondiscrimination Act (ENDA), S. 2056. On \n     behalf of our membership of over 215,000 businesses, 3,000 \n     state and local chambers of commerce, 1,200 trade and \n     professional associations, and 76 American chambers of \n     commerce abroad, I am writing to urge you to vote against \n     this bill.\n       S. 2056 amends Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act to \n     allow lawsuits against employers, for compensatory and \n     punitive damages, based on an individual's actual or \n     perceived sexual orientation. Notwithstanding our concerns \n     regarding the specifics of S. 2056, a significant addition of \n     this nature to our basic laws against employment \n     discrimination should be thoroughly deliberated and vented \n     through our legislative process. Thus, the measure should be \n     the subject of hearings and careful consideration by the \n     appropriate committees. ENDA has not been considered by the \n     Labor and Human Resources Committee nor any other committee \n     in the 104th Congress. To pass this bill without thorough \n     consideration by the appropriate committees would be, at \n     best, manifestly unfair to American employers as well as all \n     of the citizens who would be affected by such sweeping \n     legislation.\n       The Senate should not hastily pass this legislation without \n     first thoroughly considering all of its advantages and \n     disadvantages. We urge you to vote against ENDA and send it \n     to the appropriate committees for careful consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              R. Bruce Josten.\n\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n     Membership Policy Group.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                             of Manufacturers,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 10, 1996.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     Senate Hart Office,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nickles: On behalf of the NAM's 14,000 member \n     companies, 10,000 of which employ 500 or fewer workers, I \n     urge your opposition to the Employment Non-Discrimination Act \n     (ENDA), S. 2056.\n       This measure is an unwarranted and unwise extension of \n     Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. Expanding Title VII is a \n     significant legislative initiative that should not be \n     undertaken without the careful consideration afforded by the \n     committee process. The ENDA has not been the subject of any \n     hearings in the Labor and Human Resources Committee, nor has \n     it been considered by any committee in the 104th Congress. \n     Surely an initiative that would have such far-reaching \n     consequences for individual privacy\n\n[[Page S10138]]\n\n     rights, employment policies and employers, rights should have \n     the benefit of full congressional consideration.\n       Expanding the reach of Title VII would not only increase an \n     already daunting case load at the EEOC (which currently has \n     significant backlogs due to enforcement authority for the \n     Americans With Disabilities Act), but would dramatically \n     increase record-keeping requirements for most employers. The \n     burden of federal recordkeeping requirements falls \n     disproportionately on smaller companies. It is these same \n     companies that continue to generate the greatest number of \n     new jobs and growth in our economy.\n       I urge you to reject the efforts of the ENDA backers to \n     short-circuit the legislative process, and vote against S. \n     2056.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Sharon F. Canner,\n\n                                                   Vice President,\n     Human Resources Policy.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                  Business Leadership Council,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 10, 1996.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nickles: On behalf of the Business Leadership \n     Council I am writing to express strong opposition to S. 2056, \n     the so-called ``Employment Nondiscrimination Act.''\n       At a time when Congress and the Nation should be working \n     toward cooperation in the workplace, this measure once again \n     revives the failed agenda of confrontation, regulation, and \n     litigation. This bill would expand Title VII of the Civil \n     Rights Act to include and amorphous category based on sexual \n     orientation. As a result the legislation threatens to embroil \n     virtually every workplace in politically and socially \n     motivated controversies which will cost jobs for thousands of \n     workers.\n       We hail your leadership in opposing this dangerous and \n     costly piece of legislation and will work vigorously to \n     ensure its defeat.\n           Very truly yours,\n     David L. Thompson.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                    Small Business\n\n\n                                           Survival Committee,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 10, 1996.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nickles: On behalf of the 45,000 members of \n     the Small Business Survival Committee, I urge the defeat of \n     the Employment Nondiscrimination Act, S. 2056. Unlike other \n     protected classes under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of \n     1964, sexual orientation is a private matter of choice and \n     lifestyle. Federal workplace policy has not and should not \n     intrude in this highly volatile area.\n       This radical piece of social legislation is anti-worker and \n     anti-small business. There can be no doubt that the bill, if \n     enacted, would result in excessive lawsuits, regulations and \n     costs. As is typically the case with dictates and mandates, \n     the brunt of the federal policy would fall on small \n     businesses across the country. Every dollar spent defending \n     against this ill-conceived measure would be money denied to \n     workers in the form of raises and denied to small businesses \n     to be used to create jobs.\n       We strongly oppose S. 2056. Thank you for your leadership \n     against the bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Karen Kerrigan,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. If the Senator yields back his time, I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I just want to take 30 seconds.\n  Mr. President, our friend from Rhode Island pointed out that Barry \nGoldwater supports this legislation. Coretta Scott King wrote to all of \nus. In the Coretta Scott King letter she says:\n\n       As my husband, Martin Luther King, Jr. said, ``Injustice \n     anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere,'' and, ``I have \n     fought too long and hard against segregated public \n     accommodations to end up segregating my moral concern. \n     Justice is indivisible.''\n\n  Those are the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. They could be said \nagain here on the floor of the U.S. Senate on this particular issue, \nbecause what it is all about is the questions of discrimination and \nbigotry in the workplace. Below the clock in this Senate are the words \n``E pluribus unum,'' one out of many. Why do we not eliminate the \ndiscrimination that excludes so many of our fellow citizens and make \nthem part of the one as well?\n  This legislation will help. I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record the letter from Coretta Scott King.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The King Center,\n\n                                  Atlanta, GA, September 10, 1996.\n       Dear Senator: Ernest Dillon, an African-American postal \n     employee in Detroit, worked hard and was good at his job. But \n     that wasn't enough. Deciding he was gay, his co-workers \n     repeatedly taunted him, until one day, while on the job they \n     beat him unconscious. And the harassment did not end there. \n     It continued unabated until he was forced out, fearing for \n     his life.\n       Mr. Dillon sought relief--first from his employer, then \n     from the courts. Tragically, both turned their backs on him. \n     Had he been harassed for being black, federal civil rights \n     law would have protected him. But job discrimination, and \n     even serious harassment, based on sexual orientation is still \n     perfectly legal in the United States of America in 1996. This \n     is unjust, un-American, and intolerable.\n       Today, workplace discrimination against gay men and \n     lesbians is real, widespread, and continues to cast a dark \n     shadow on our ideals as a free and fair nation. To remedy \n     this situation a bipartisan coalition in Congress introduced \n     the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. This essential \n     legislation will provide dedicated workers with long-overdue \n     protection from irrational fear and unjust discrimination \n     based on sexual orientation.\n       I am proud to join mayors, governors, religious leaders, \n     CEOs, and the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights in \n     support of this essential legislation. Lesbians and gay men \n     are a productive part of the American workforce, but the gap \n     in current law leaves them vulnerable to bigotry in the \n     workplace. For too long, our nation has ignored \n     discrimination against this group of Americans. They work \n     hard, pay their taxes, and yet continue to be denied equal \n     protection under the law. It is time for a change.\n       I am encouraged that in a recent Newsweek poll, 84 percent \n     of the respondents favored protecting gay and lesbian people \n     from job discrimination, and I am proud to stand with the \n     overwhelming majority of Americans who recognize the \n     importance of such protection.\n       The bill in Congress will grant the same rights to victims \n     of discrimination based on sexual orientation that are now \n     available to victims of racial, gender, and religious \n     discrimination and those who have been unfairly treated in \n     the workplace because of their age, ethnic background, or \n     disability. The bill provides no preferential treatment or \n     special rights. It simply requires that all people be judged \n     by their skills and the quality of their work, and not by the \n     prejudice, fear, and stereotypes of others. It is time to \n     root out bias, whatever form it takes.\n       As my husband, Martin Luther King, Jr. said, ``Injustice \n     anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere,'' and ``I have \n     fought too long and hard against segregated public \n     accommodations to end up segregating my moral concern. \n     Justice is indivisible.''\n       Lesbians and gays supported the African American freedom \n     struggle. None of us who achieved that freedom should turn \n     our back on this next phase of the movement for freedom and \n     dignity. Like Martin, I believe you cannot stand for freedom \n     for one group of people, and deny it to others. As history \n     affirms, none of us is free until all of us are free.\n       The Employment Non-Discrimination Act is a logical \n     extension of the Bill of Rights and the civil rights reforms \n     of the 1950s and 1960s. Then as now, we were told that \n     employers were not prejudiced, but their workers and \n     customers feared diversity. In the 1960s, businesses cited \n     ``customer preference'' to rationalize their refusal to hire \n     African Americans. We should learn from these mistakes and \n     not repeat them.\n       The great promise of our democracy is that we encourage all \n     people to reach their full potential, and provide protection \n     against senseless discrimination and persecution. In doing \n     so, we strengthen ourselves as a nation and all that America \n     stands for.\n       Congress should help stop job discrimination by enacting \n     the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. Fundamental principles \n     of fairness and human dignity are at stake. All Americans who \n     support real equality in the workplace should watch closely \n     on Tuesday, September 10th as Senators cast their votes on \n     this landmark legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Coretta Scott King.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back.\n  The bill having been read the third time, the question is, Shall the \nbill pass?\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Pryor] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 49, nays 50, as follows:\n\n[[Page S10139]]\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 281 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--49\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Chafee\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hatfield\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Pell\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Simpson\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--50\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Exon\n     Faircloth\n     Ford\n     Frahm\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Pressler\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Pryor\n       \n  The bill (S. 2056) was rejected.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I voted against S. 2056, the Employment \nNondiscrimination Act. I would like to take a few moments of the \nSenate's time to explain my opposition and concerns with respect to \nthat legislation.\n  At the outset, however, I would first like to acknowledge the fact \nthat I do not condone employment discrimination based on factors \nimmaterial to the performance of one's duties. I do not practice it in \nmy own office, nor am I aware of any other member of the Senate that \ndoes. And, as the proponents of S. 2056 have shown, many employers \nthroughout this nation--both large and small--have adopted \nnondiscrimination provisions as part of their corporate policies. I \napplaud that effort.\n  But the fact that I do not approve of, or practice, employment \ndiscrimination does not mean that I believe it is wise for the Senate \nto pass this bill at this time. On the contrary, I think it is \ninadvisable, at this late stage of the 104th Congress, for us to shift \nour focus from the immediate tasks at hand to a matter that is clearly \ndeserving of extended deliberation by way of committee hearings and \nfloor debate.\n  Mr. President, in my opinion, the legal ramifications that could \nnecessarily extend from enactment of this Act are monumental. I believe \nthis is so because passage of the Act would, for the first time in our \nhistory, place sexual conduct on an equitable legal footing with such \nbenign, nonbehavioral factors as race, gender, and national origin--\nimmutable characteristics which each of us possess, but which none of \nus can alter.\n  It is my hope, then, that when the 105th Congress convenes next year, \nhearings may be held that will bring together various legal scholars \nwho will concentrate on this important aspect, and in so doing help us, \nas Senators, in making a more informed decision.\n  Until such considerations and debate has taken place, I cannot, in \nall good conscience, support this measure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/10/senate-section/article/S10129-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10139-S10155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TREASURY, POSTAL SERVICE, AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                                  1997\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in February 1992, it occurred to me one day \nafter reading some mail from people in North Carolina that the Senate \nwasn't paying very much attention to the steadily rising Federal debt, \nand I decided on that February afternoon in 1992 that I would begin a \ndaily report to the Senate specifying the exact Federal debt as of \nclose of business the day before down to the penny. Of course, on \nMonday it would have to be close of business the previous Friday.\n  We have not missed a day in making that report. There have been a few \ntimes when I was absent when fellow Senators made the report for me.\n  In any case, Mr. President, at the close of business yesterday, \nMonday, September 9, the Federal debt of the United States stood at \n$5,214,144,675,542.25.\n  Five years ago, on September 9, 1991, the record shows that the \nFederal debt stood at $3,618,482,000,000 rounded off.\n  And 10 years ago, September 9, 1986, the Federal debt stood at \n$2,106,631,000,000.\n  Just for the interest in it, we checked the Federal debt of 15 years \nago--that was September 9, 1981--at which time the Federal debt stood \nat $977,439,000,000.\n  So those figures alone will show you the escalation of the spending \npractices of the Congress of the United States, and all the \nirresponsibility of that lies like a dead cat on the doorstep of the \nCongress of the United States, where I work and where Members of the \nHouse of Representatives work.\n  Twenty-five years ago, if you want to go back that far, on September \n9, 1971, the Federal debt stood at $415,807,000,000. This report \nreflects an increase of more than $4 trillion in Federal debt during \nthe 25 years from 1971 to 1996. If you want the precise figure, the \nFederal debt has increased during the past 25 years by \n$4,798,337,675,542.25.\n  Mr. President, this is a perfect outrage imposed upon the next \ngeneration and the next generation after that and the next generation \nafter that, because they are the ones who are going to have to pay this \ndebt. They are going to have to pay the interest on it, which is \nenormous. We have all of these promising politicians running around the \ncountryside these days promising everything under the Sun for the \ntaxpayers to pay for, which means that it will be bought on credit and \nnot a thing will be done about this Federal debt. That is precisely why \nin February 1992 I began to make these reports.\n  I might add as a matter of interest, Mr. President, that one day when \nI came to make this report, I stopped in the cloakroom and Senators \nwere waiting for a rollcall vote that had been scheduled by unanimous \nconsent about 10 minutes hence. Just to see what the answers would be, \nI asked Senators how many million there were in a trillion. They \nscratched their heads, and I got two or three different answers. Only \none of them was correct. Of course, as every schoolboy knows, or is \nsupposed to know, there are a million million in a trillion, and the \ncoming generations are going to have to deal with $5 million million-\nplus in debt run up by the Congress of the United States.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Paul Irving, \na legislative fellow with the subcommittee, and Bruce Townsend, a \nfellow with the office of Senator Mikulski, be granted floor privileges \nduring deliberations on H.R. 3756, the Treasury, Postal Service, and \ngeneral Government appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today with my distinguished ranking \nmember, Senator Kerrey, I bring before the Senate the Appropriations \nCommittee recommendations on fiscal year 1997 appropriations for the \nDepartment of the Treasury, the U.S. Postal Service, the Executive \nOffice of the President and certain independent agencies.\n  The bill we are presenting today contains total funding of \n$23,487,761,000. This bill is $324,007,000 above the appropriations \nprovided in fiscal year 1996. The mandatory accounts make up \n$320,850,000 of this increase. In other words, this bill is $3,157,000 \nin discretionary spending above the fiscal year 1996 level.\n  Of the totals in this bill we are recommending $11,291,000,000 for \nnew discretionary spending.\n  The $11,291,000,000 the committee proposes for domestic discretionary \nprograms is $1.354 billion below the President's request. Let me repeat \nthat, Mr. President. This bill is $1.354 billion below the President's \nfiscal year 1997 request. The fiscal year 1996 bill was $1.8 billion \nbelow the President's request. That is a reduction of $3.15 billion \nbelow what the President requested in 2 years.\n  Reaching this level has not been an easy task. We have had to make \nsome very difficult decisions, while trying to ensure that funds are \nmade available to\n\n[[Page S10156]]\n\ncarry out essential Government services.\n  Mr. President, this bill includes $10,185,009,000 for the Department \nof the Treasury. The Treasury Department has varied responsibilities, \nthe bulk of which are directed to the revenues and expenditures of this \nGovernment and law enforcement functions.\n  This bill includes $90,433,000 for payment to the Postal Service Fund \nfor free mail for the blind, overseas voting, and a payment to offset \nprevious shortfalls in revenue forgone funding.\n  The President receives $183,339,000 to exercise the duties and \nresponsibilities of the Executive Office of the President.\n  This bill includes $657,724,000 for construction of new courthouses \nand Federal facilities. This funding provides the General Services \nAdministration with the ability to let construction contracts for \ncourthouses for which the construction schedule is slated in fiscal \nyear 1997.\n  The courthouses funded in this bill are those listed as the top \npriority of the administrative office of the courts for fiscal year \n1997.\n  There is $12.08 billion in mandatory payments through the Office of \nPersonnel Management for annuitant and employee health, disability and \nretirement, and life insurance benefits. There is $850 million for \nother independent agencies.\n  Mr. President, this subcommittee continues to be a strong supporter \nof law enforcement. We have done what we can to ensure that the law \nenforcement agencies funded in this bill have the resources to do the \njob we ask them to do.\n  We have utilized the salaries and expenses account, as well as, funds \nfrom the Violent Crime Trust Fund to enhance law enforcement efforts.\n  In addition, the committee has provided funding over the President's \nrequest for the Nation's drug policy office. While I have been highly \ncritical of this administration's previous commitment to combating the \ngrowing drug problem in this country, I fully support the efforts and \nleadership of the new drug czar, General Barry McCaffrey.\n  Under his leadership, it is my hope that the alarming rise in teen \ndrug use can be turned back, before this country feels its tragic \nconsequences--such as, more crime, more death, more young futures lost. \nDrugs are a plague that claim the hopes and dreams, the aspirations and \ngoals, of our young people. We need to do more. This bill does more.\n  The fiscal year 1997 Treasury bill funds the Office of National Drug \nControl Policy at the President's request of $34,838,000 and provides \n$103 million for high-intensity drug trafficking areas.\n  While the committee has attempted to give the drug czar sufficient \nflexibility to address the high-intensity drug trafficking areas, the \nbill does encourage the drug czar to give high priority to certain \nareas of the country where the methamphetamine problem is overtaking \nmany communities.\n  The committee has further provided an additional $13 million in \nfunding within the Violent Crime Trust Fund to designate new HIDTAs.\n  In addition, the committee has provided $65 million for southwest \nborder antidrug efforts, $83 million for air and marine interdiction \nand $45 million for procurement of an additional P-3AEW aircraft for \ndetection and interdiction purposes.\n  There has been considerable discussion since this bill was reported \nfrom the subcommittee about the level of funding for the Internal \nRevenue Service.\n  Some have questioned overall funding in this bill for the IRS, but \nthe major focus has been directed toward the committee's action \nregarding the IRS tax systems modernization or TSM program. I would \nlike to take a few moments to describe how we arrived at the funding \nlevel for the IRS.\n  This bill includes $6,880,221,000 for the IRS; this total is $1.14 \nbillion below the President's request and $468 million below the fiscal \nyear 1996 appropriation. There are those, including the President, who \nhave said--you have to fund the IRS at the requested level to ensure \nthat tax systems modernization continues and that funds ``owed'' the \nGovernment are collected.\n  Mr. President, the IRS budget makes up approximately 65 percent of \nthe committee's discretionary spending. Think about it--65 percent.\n  As the largest consumer of revenues under the committee's \ndiscretionary budget and competitor with equally important funding \npriorities in the budget, like law enforcement, the IRS is subject to \nreductions, which would otherwise have to come from these other \nimportant programs.\n  A dollar more for law enforcement, means a dollar less somewhere \nelse--and this budget, which I believe to be consistent with the \npriorities of the President, reflects an emphasis on law enforcement, \nparticularly drug enforcement.\n  While the Committee's funding for the IRS is significantly below the \nPresident's request--$1.14 billion and $468 million below last year's \nappropriated level--the Committee feels strongly that these funding \nlevels are adequate, and more than justified given the dismal record of \nthe Internal Revenue Service.\n  Mr. President, the IRS, until very recently, has refused to respond \nto bipartisan concerns that have been raised by the Congress and the \nGeneral Accounting Office.\n  Its overall lack of financial accountability and failure to produce \nquantifiable results in tax systems modernization has done little to \nencourage the committee of the IRS's commitment to ensuring that funds \nappropriated are being spent wisely or effectively. The taxpayer \ndeserves accountability, particularly from the IRS. But more than that, \nMr. President, no taxpayer should be held to a level of accountability \nthat even the IRS cannot meet.\n  The committee has gone to great lengths to ensure that the IRS is \nadequately funded, and that sufficient resources are provided for \ntaxpayer assistance and tax return processing.\n  There is nothing in this bill which will inhibit the IRS from doing \ntheir job. Any forecasts of doom and gloom are not accurate.\n  We have spent a long time looking at IRS operations, especially tax \nsystems modernization over the past 1\\1/2\\ years during my tenure as \nchairman. I worked with Senator Kerrey, the ranking Democrat on this. \nFrankly, I am not pleased with what I have seen after the expenditure \nof millions of dollars.\n  TSM programs that the committee and the GAO have reviewed, have \nalmost always come in late and over budget and have almost \nuniversally--universally, Mr. President--not lived up to expectations, \ndespite hundreds of millions of dollars being spent. The Department of \nthe Treasury has indicated the current program is off course.\n  They are not the only ones, though, who have reached that conclusion. \nThe General Accounting Office and National Research Council have been \nhighly critical of the direction TSM is headed.\n  I have stated many times that we must modernize the IRS. I will \nsupport that effort. To follow the current course, or lack of course, \nthe IRS has chartered for TSM at this time would be irresponsible.\n  TSM is clearly not providing us with what we have been seeking and \nwhat taxpayers deserve.\n  Mr. President, I feel very strongly that the subcommittee would be \nabdicating its responsibilities if it did not take action.\n  Funds are provided in this bill to continue current information \nsystems, but no money is available for further TSM development. I \nexpect the Department's review board to take an active roll in ensuring \ncorrections are made, and made soon.\n  When the Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service \nhave shown that things are back on track, we can proceed with providing \nfunds for programs that work. Let me repeat that--we will support \nprograms that work and provide the IRS with the necessary tools to \nachieve efficiency and effectiveness.\n  Mr. President, this bill does not spend as much as the President \nwould like. If it did, the subcommittee would be over a billion dollars \nabove its allocation, and that is not the way to balance the budget.\n  Tough choices were made as said--in a way that attempted to reflect \nthe priorities of the President and the Congress--law enforcement is \nplussed up across the board. It is, however, the result of long, hard \nhours of work on the\n\n[[Page S10157]]\n\npart of the members and the staff of this subcommittee.\n  I want to thank all of them for that effort. I believe it is workable \nand should be enacted.\n  I yield to Senator Kerrey, the subcommittee's ranking member.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, as the distinguished Senator from Alabama, \nChairman Shelby, just indicated, we are bringing to the floor of the \nSenate recommendations on the fiscal year 1997 appropriations for the \nDepartment of Treasury, Postal Service, and independent agencies.\n  First of all, I thank Senator Shelby for his dedicated work on this \nbill. He worked very long and hard on the difficult issues he has just \noutlined for Members, and throughout the process, as well, he has \nforged a very cooperative relationship not just with myself but with \nall the subcommittee members on both sides of aisle.\n  The subcommittee has achieved a balanced approach of dealing with the \nmany programs and activities under the jurisdiction of the subcommittee \nwhile staying within the 602(b) allocation. This allocation is $11.081 \nbillion, $1.6 billion below the administration's request. While \nrequired to make substantial reductions from the request level, I \nbelieve the program funding levels included in the bill are both \nfiscally responsible and very reasonable.\n  Senator Shelby has discussed the major funding highlights, and rather \nthan repeating those highlights, I will limit my comments to a few \nareas I would like to emphasize. As Senator Shelby said, the IRS \nreceived $6.8 billion, 60 percent of the discretionary allocation, \nwhich is $1 billion lower than the administration's request, but it is \n$200 million above the House mark.\n  The reduction from the request reflects our decision to limit IRS \nspending to cost-effective and operational efforts. As you know, there \nhave been continuing questions, as the chairman just indicated, \nconcerning the TSM, the tax system modernization efforts, questions I \nam attempting to answer, as well, through my work on the subcommittee, \nas well as through the efforts of the newly formed IRS Restructuring \nCommission.\n  A June 1996 GAO report stated the IRS has not made adequate progress \nin correcting its management and technical weaknesses, nor have they \nfully implemented any of the GAO recommendations. In addition, the IRS \ndoes not have a process for selecting, controlling, and evaluating its \ntechnology investments. It does not have a clear basis for making \ninvestment decisions, and it does not have a complete procedure for \nrequirements management, quality assurance, configuration management, \nproject planning and tracking.\n  Finally, it does not have an integrated structural architecture or \nsecurity and data architecture. The recommended funding in this bill is \nadequate to support ongoing operations and maintenance and to support \nthose systems that have provided taxpayer assistance, such as Telefile \nand the Electronic File Transfer System.\n  Of the funds provided IRS, $200 million of non-TSM and $66 million of \nTSM funds may not be obligated until the Secretary of the Treasury \nconsults with the Committee on Appropriations and provides criteria to \nexplain the needs and priorities of the proposed programs. It is our \nhope that by fencing these funds, the IRS will develop an integrated \nsystems architecture and that we can proceed toward completing a \nmodernized tax system.\n  As I mentioned, I will continue to work with the IRS both through the \nsubcommittee and the IRS restructuring commission to ensure they are \nmoving in the right direction and that a modernized tax system will be \nprovided to our citizens.\n  I believe, second, the administration is moving in the right \ndirection. As the chairman indicated, I, too, strongly support the \nappointment of General McCaffrey as the head of the Office of National \nDrug Control Policy. This bill fully funds the administration's \nefforts. However, I continue to have a number of questions on the \ndirection we are pursuing in the war against drugs.\n  I believe ONDCP must develop long-term measurable strategies for \ndecreasing drug use and drug-related crimes. I want ONDCP to set \nstandards for measuring success. I want these measures to show that the \ndollars being spent are keeping children from starting to use drugs, \nreducing the number of hard-core drug users, and limiting the amount of \ndrugs coming into the country.\n  To ensure the law enforcement agencies can work in conjunction with \nthe ONDCP to achieve these results, the subcommittee has increased the \nlaw enforcement funding levels to provide additional training and \nequipment, infrastructure investments in technologies on the Southwest \nborder and, as the chairman stated, a P-3AEW aircraft for interdiction \nof illegal narcotics.\n  Through the violent crime reduction trust fund, we have continued \nfunding for important crime reduction programs, such as gang resistance \neducation and training, and FinCen enforcement programs.\n  In addition, we have provided funding above the request level to \nincrease participation in the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, or \nthe HIDTA Program.\n  A third area I want to mention, Mr. President, is the General \nServices Administration. We have provided, through the GSA, for Federal \nbuildings funds, for the site, design, or construction of five \ncourthouses. Funding for these court facilities is consistent with the \ncourthouse construction criteria we established last year. The \napplication of these criterion allowed us to choose specific court \nprojects, as opposed to applying the House approach of applying across-\nthe-board cuts to the entire construction program.\n  As Senator Shelby indicated, we have also included funding for the \nfive northern border stations, the construction of a Federal office \nbuilding in Portland, OR, the site preparation for the Food and Drug \nAdministration consolidation, the completion of a Veterans' Affairs \noffice complex, and the environmental cleanup of the southeast Federal \nCenter.\n  I also point out that this bill fully funds the administration's \nrequest for the Executive Offices of the President, the Federal Labor \nRelations Authority, the Merit Systems Protection Board, and the Office \nof Personnel Management.\n  Finally, funding increases are specified for the National Archives \nrepairs and restoration account. These increases will provide much-\nneeded repairs of two Presidential libraries: The Truman and Roosevelt \nLibraries and the National Archives headquarters facility. The funding \nlevel also indicates that we continue to support the Archives \nelectronic access project. The Archives has recently provided us with a \nwork plan for completing this important project to bring their files \nonline and to provide a full catalog system. We are looking forward to \nthe Archives making significant strides toward accomplishing this \nproject in the near future.\n  However, Mr. President, I must raise an objection to the provision \nwhich provides funding of $500,000 to cover the attorneys' fees for \nthose fired from the White House Travel Office. It is a genuine \ndisagreement between the chairman and I--I believe the only one in the \nentire bill. This action, in my reasoned opinion, would set a bad \nprecedent for Congress paying the attorney fees of an indicted \nindividual. This is not a precedent I believe we should set.\n  Mr. President, that summarizes, as I see it, the bill's funding \nlevels. We have tried to accommodate the numerous Member requests, and \nwhile it is difficult to always accommodate these requests, we have \ntried to include all those that were possible given funding \nrestrictions. I also acknowledge the fine work done by the staff on \nthis bill. They are Chuck Parkinson, Diane Hill, Hallie Hastert, Paul \nIrving, and others. I thank them for their helping in permitting us to \nbring this bill before the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, we are trying to clear, with both sides, a \nnumber of matters. We have worked out a number of committee amendments, \nand we have several that we are trying to clear with the other side of \nthe aisle at the moment. I want to take a minute to thank Senator \nKerrey for his leadership on the committee. We have had a number of \nhearings throughout the year. Some of them have been tough hearings. He \nhas made a real contribution to the tax system changes that we envision \nin the future.\n\n[[Page S10158]]\n\n  We have set up a task force that he is involved in. As a matter of \nfact, he suggested this to me a year or so ago, as he was not \nsatisfied--and he worked on this committee before I had --with the \nmodernization program of the Internal Revenue Service and thought that, \nof all the agencies in Government, Internal Revenue Service should be \non the cutting edge of technology and should not be behind in any way. \nSome of us are concerned that maybe the IRS is getting behind. Getting \nbehind what? The marketplace.\n  There has been a tremendous revolution in the software industry, and \nSenator Kerrey and I both have talked and met with various people that \nare dealing in financial electronic software of various kinds. The \nmarket, it seems to me, is farther ahead in various areas than the IRS. \nThis is not a good sign for the future of the IRS or the future of \nGovernment, because most people in America always thought--and I came \nto believe it--that the IRS had the best of everything and was on the \ncutting edge. But I will submit to you that they are not. I believe the \nSenator from Nebraska believes that. He is also interested in--and so \nam I--the task force to study the IRS and our tax laws and everything \nthat goes with it. I believe we are going to get some good results out \nof that, some great recommendations. He may want to take a minute to \ntalk about that.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, the chairman is quite right. Last year, \nduring the conference deliberations--we had seen, throughout the last \ncouple of years, a considerable accumulation of reports, specifically, \nthe General Accounting Office evaluation of tax system modernization. \nWhile it has not all been a loss, there is no question that there has \nbeen significant disappointment and the evaluation of GAO is quite \nnegative. I must point out that some of that difficulty is caused by \nus.\n  Earlier today, we actually had the first meeting of the restructuring \nof the commission. Commissioner Richardson appeared before that \ncommission, observing that the mission statement itself very often does \nnot connect to many of the things that are identified as great \nsuccesses. Very specifically, the mission statement of the IRS is to \ncollect taxes in the most cost-effective way possible. One of the \nthings that we often don't look at is what does it cost us to collect \nthe taxes, and how can we do it in a more cost-effective way, not just \nmeasuring the money we spend but the money the taxpayers spend to \ncomply with the laws. One of the examples is we have this alternative \nminimum tax. There are about 4 million taxpayers that are identified as \npossibly candidates for paying this AMT. What has happened is, of 4 \nmillion taxpayers, 90 percent--3.6 million of that 4 million--after \nthey have gone through all the work and hired the accountants to do the \ncalculation of taxes, they discover they owe no taxes at all. The \nquestion is, what are the man and women hours and time on task?\n  That is substantial to collect a relatively small amount of money. \nWhat we have to do, in my judgment, is not just look at the cost-\neffectiveness of the IRS versus what they collect, but what kind of \nfriction or cost is imposed out there for that taxpayer, either the \nhouseholds or the business, because they have substantial costs that \nare imposed. When I say ``sometimes we cause the problems,'' we passed \na tax bill with 900 new changes that are required, and the President \nsigned it and it goes into law. I asked the Commissioner this morning \nif she ever, in the 3\\1/2\\, or whatever years she has been in office, \nhad a time when she has gone to the President and said, Mr. President, \nI urge you to veto the tax bill because this is going to make it \ndifficult to accomplish the mix of keeping the IRS a cost-effective, \nlow-cost operation, both in terms of the costs to the taxpayers and the \ncosts to the people that are out there in the community. The answer to \nthe question was, ``no,'' she never has. The day that starts to \nhappen--the day the IRS Commissioner says to the President, you may \nwant to do this for whatever the reason, but here is what it will cost \nthe American taxpayers to fill out the forms and go through that, it \nseems to me that will be the day you are going to start to see the \ncustomer out there, the taxpayer, say they are finally understanding \nit.\n\n  We, very often, say here that we have to collect money to accomplish \nsome social or economic good. We don't really think about what that \ntaxpayer out there is going to have to go through in order to comply \nwith the forms, the regulations, and the rules, and all the other sort \nof things to put in place.\n  But there is no question that we have a very, very serious problem in \nthat we have to go from where we are now, which is we have expended $8 \nbillion or $9 billion, thus far, on TSM, perhaps a great deal more than \nthat, over a bit longer period of time. It depends on when you track \nit. We are really not much closer to where we needed to go when we \nstarted the whole process.\n  All of us understand that one of the most costly things that happen \nin tax collection is when a mistake is made--not by the taxpayer but by \nthe IRS. When the IRS makes a mistake, that is an expensive thing to \ntry to correct, whether it is giving somebody advice over the phone, or \nany mistake made in the entire system. Those mistakes are the most \ncostly things of all to fix. So the more they can reduce the mistakes, \nthe better off they are. The least costly environment of all, the least \nnumber of mistakes are the mistakes made in a paperless environment. \nThose transactions that are currently done, a limited number of \ntransactions to be done without paper, have a very, very substantial \ndifference in terms of mistakes versus the ones that continue to be \ndone by paper, through all the processing centers.\n  So I hope, I say to my friend from Alabama, that we are able, in \nrestructuring the commission, to come to the Congress, and all the \nstakeholders involved, and we are able to make some recommendations so \nthat 10, 15 years from now, at some point in the future, people will \nsay that it was worth spending a million dollars on. You did actually \nmake some recommendations. I point out, Mr. President, that one of the \nthings that I think makes that more likely rather than less, is \nCongressman Portman and I are cochairs. He is from the House and he is \nalso a Republican. My experience is that more often, some things you \ncan't make bipartisan but we have a difficult subject. If you can make \nit bipartisan, you tend to make it more likely you are going to be \nsuccessful. So I appreciate the Senator's support in the hearings.\n\n  Mr. President, I can tell you that there is no better cross-examiner \nthan Chairman Shelby when it comes to watching out for the taxpayer's \nmoney. There is no better cross-examiner than the Senator from Alabama \nwhen it comes to trying to make sure that the taxpayers are getting a \ngood dollar's return on their investment, and I appreciate the \nSenator's support for this effort.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I again acknowledge the hard work and the \nleadership that the Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Kerrey, has brought \nhere. He is absolutely right. When we are dealing with something as \ncomplicated as the Internal Revenue Service modernization and taxes in \ngeneral, it is going to take, I believe, as he does, a bipartisan \neffort to do this. If we can bring something out of this commission \nthat we will listen to and do something about here that will modernize \nthe IRS, that will help the taxpayers understand the system, will help \nthe taxpayers keep more of their money without a lot of cumbersome \ninvolvement, we will be doing part of our job here today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee amendments \nto H.R. 3756 be considered and agreed to en bloc, provided that no \npoints of order be waived thereon and that the measure, as amended, be \nconsidered as original text for the purpose of further amendment, with \nthe exception of the following amendments: Page 2, line 18; page 16, \nline 16 through page 17, line 2; page 80, line 20 through page 81, line \n4; that portion of the amendment on page 129, line 20 through page 130, \nline 18.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KERREY. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendments were considered and agreed to en bloc with \nthe above noted exceptions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n[[Page S10159]]\n\n            Excepted Committee Amendment on page 2, line 18\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, let me inquire of the Parliamentarian and \nthe Chair, all committee amendments have been approved except one, is \nthat my understanding? Except four.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are four committee amendments that have \nnot been adopted.\n  Mr. HELMS. Very well. Will the clerk just reference them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the first excepted \ncommittee amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       On page 2, line 18, strike the numeral and insert \n     $111,348,000.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. That is subject to amendment, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n\n Amendment No. 5208 to Excepted Committee Amendment on page 2, line 18\n\n  Mr. HELMS. On behalf of the distinguished occupant of the chair, Mr. \nThompson, I send an amendment to the desk and ask it be stated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms], for Mr. \n     Thompson, for himself, Mr. Helms, Mr. Thurmond, and Mrs. \n     Hutchison, proposes an amendment numbered 5208 to the \n     committee amendment on page 2, line 18.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the committee amendment insert the following:\n       No adjustment under section 5303 of title 5, U.S. Code, for \n     Members of Congress and members of the President's Cabinet \n     shall be considered to have taken effect in FY '97.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the pending amendment that the \ndistinguished Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Thompson] and I have offered \nforbids any Member of Congress, House or Senate, from receiving a pay \nraise or cost of living adjustment in the fiscal year 1997 that begins \nin a few days on October 1. Here we are, both Houses of Congress, \nasking the American people to make the sacrifices necessary to get the \nNation's fiscal house in order, and it seems to me that all of us \nshould be willing to forego even the thought of a pay increase.\n  Each day I make a formal report to the Senate specifying the \nstaggering federal debt as of the close of business the previous day. \nMost of this enormous burden was run up by Congress in prior years. \nBut, the point is that Congress alone is charged with the \nconstitutional duty of authorizing and appropriating funds for Federal \nspending, and it's our responsibility to pay the debt down and live \nwithin our means. The activities of Congress, the timidity of Congress, \nthe inclination to play politics with the public purse--all of this has \nbrought us to a Federal debt that, as of close of business yesterday, \nstood at $5,214,144,675,542.25, or $19,625.30 for every man, woman and \nchild in America on a per capita basis.\n  Mr. President, while we are systematically piling on to the arrearage \nwhich our children and grandchildren must bear, the notion that \nCongress deserves a pay raise is absurd.\n  Since I came to the Senate, interest on the money borrowed and spent \nby the Congress of the United States cost the American taxpayers over \n$3.5 trillion. Three trillion and 500 billion dollars, just to pay \ninterest on excessive spending authorized and approved by the Congress. \nJust last year Congress spent over $235 billion on interest alone.\n  It is true, Mr. President, that the 104th Congress has garnered an \nimpressive list of accomplishments. For the first time since Neil \nArmstrong walked on the moon, this Congress has enacted a balanced \nbudget--which was vetoed to the glee of the national media. It has \nreformed the dilapidated welfare system; the President signed the bill, \nbut immediately gutted part of it by issuing a host of waivers. \nCongress reined in the out-of-control trial lawyers and passed the \nPartial Birth Abortion ban, but both pieces of legislation were \nvetoed.) And Congress eliminated 270 wasteful Federal programs and \nagencies and succeeded in cutting year-to-year discretionary spending \nby $53 billion.\n  This Congress has done a lot, Mr. President, but we can't rest on our \nlaurels. We're asking the American people to tighten their belts. And \nwe should demonstrate our solidarity with them by rejecting the built-\nin congressional pay raises which, as Senator Thompson said last year, \n``stick in the craw of the American people.'' It's the least we can do.\n  It is crucial that while the American people are making sacrifices \nand taking steps toward independence from the Federal Government, the \nCongress of the United States share in these sacrifices.\n  Americans need lower taxes, higher wages and better jobs. Only a \ngrowing economy can provide the society we want. Only a balanced \nbudget--and proper tax policies--can provide an atmosphere in which the \neconomy can approach the rate of growth of which it's capable. Until \nthis is realized, Mr. President, Congress deserves no pay raise.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask the managers of the bill, in order to \nsave a little time: Senator Inhofe has an amendment that will take no \ntime at all. It will not require a vote or anything like that. I wonder \nif it would be in order, in the judgment of the managers of the bill, \nfor me to set aside the pending amendment for the purpose only of \nSenator Inhofe's being recognized for his brief amendment. Would that \nbe satisfactory?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I have no problem with that.\n  Mr. HELMS. I make that as a unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is not my intention to offer an \namendment at this time, as I told the Senator from Oregon, but just to \nmake a brief statement about the concern that I have with the bill in \nhopes that, when you come up with the management amendments, you will \ninclude the proposed amendment as a part of those. It should be \nnoncontroversial. I cannot imagine anyone would be opposed to it.\n  Back in the 100th Congress, which is the year I was first elected to \nthe other body, they passed Public Law 100-440, in that they made the \nrequirement that the General Services Administration be required to \nhire up to, and maintain an average of, 1,000 full-time Federal \npositions for the full-time Federal Protective Officers. These are the \npeople who serve as security in Federal buildings. Both the House and \nSenate versions have language that would take that section out.\n\n  When the Murrah Federal Office Building in Oklahoma was bombed, they, \nthe GSA, had only provided security of one individual. It was from a \ncompany called Rent-A-Cop. That Rent-A-Cop individual, one individual, \nhad to cover that building and several other buildings.\n  While it can never be known if the tragedy could have been averted, \nit is the opinion of the police officers from whom the American \nFederation of Government Employees solicited comments that any trained \nFPO would have noted the parked rental vehicle which carried the bomb \nand immediately raised questions about its presence.\n  It is also the opinion of the law enforcement community that the \nphysical presence of FPO's at the Murrah Building would have served as \na major deterrent to those who might have been contemplating committing \nthat crime.\n  The current ratio is something in the neighborhood of one officer for \nevery 21 buildings. If they complied with this, the GSA, they should \nhave reached a ratio of 1 per 8 by 1992. They did not do this. I think, \nif we repeal this section, it is sending the wrong message out, saying \nwe want to be more lenient in terms of protection in Federal buildings.\n  So I have an amendment that would merely delete that particular \nsection that would repeal Public Law 100-440, section 10, and would \nallow the GSA to continue and encourage them to go ahead and comply \nwith the law they should be complying with right now. That would be the \nintent. I only ask the two managers of the bill, when the\n\n[[Page S10160]]\n\nmanagers' amendments come up, that they give serious consideration to \nthis.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Will the Senator from Oklahoma yield?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I, as the manager of the bill, along with Senator \nKerrey--we are going to try to work with you to make that part of the \nmanagers' amendment. We believe it will be. But if it is not, we will \ntell you and give you a chance to offer it on the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. It seems to me what the Senator is asking for is quite \nreasonable. We will work with him to try to get it done.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator and thank the Senator from North \nCarolina for yielding to me. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, regular order. What is the pending \nbusiness?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the amendment by the \nSenator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, this amendment would deny the automatic \ncost-of-living adjustment [COLA] to Members of Congress.\n  Last year, I sponsored this very same amendment with the Senator from \nNew Mexico, Senator Domenici. I believe now, as I did then, that this \namendment is an important part of the efforts we have made in this \nCongress to balance the budget by the year 2002.\n  Mr. President, some might ask how passing an amendment requiring \nMembers of Congress to forego a cost-of-living adjustment will achieve \nsavings that will move us towards a balanced budget. The simple answer \nis that a pay freeze for Members of Congress will not produce \nsignificant budget savings. But, Mr. President, the savings that this \namendment achieves is not the point. This amendment is important \nbecause of what it communicates to the American people. Let me take a \nminute to explain what I mean.\n  During this 104th Congress, we have debated many fundamental issues \nfacing this country. While Republicans and Democrats still disagree on \nmany of these issues, there are certain principles around which a \nconsensus is developing.\n  Probably the most important of these principles is that we need to \nget our fiscal house in order to avoid national bankruptcy and to \npreserve the country that we have known for our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  It is true that our national debt and interest on that debt are \nstrangling us. We cannot sustain deficits endlessly in the future at \nthe rate we have. It will cause interest rates to soar and national \nsavings, investment and growth to plummet. If we continue on the path \nwe have followed in the past, we will be leaving a legacy of \nsignificantly lower living standards to future generations.\n  Mr. President, I think we are in the beginning stages, finally, of \nfacing up to these problems. Last year, this Congress sent the \nPresident the Balanced Budget Act, which will lead us to a balanced \nbudget in the year 2002--for the first time in decades in this country. \nI regret that the President chose to veto this legislation. However, I \ndo think that the Republicans in Congress have succeeded in convincing \nthe President--however belatedly--that a balanced budget is both \nnecessary and important.\n  As a consequence, I believe that we have a great opportunity to work \ntogether to solve this problem. Although we may differ on the means by \nwhich we solve it, I think we can certainly agree on the end that we \nmust all work toward.\n\n  During this debate, I think that we in Congress have done a better \njob of communicating to the American people the level of sacrifice that \nis necessary to reach a balanced budget. People are beginning to \nrealize that, if we are to solve this problem, we cannot have \neverything exactly as we have had it in years past. Sooner or later we \nare going to all have to make some sacrifices for the sake of our \ncountry. We will have to look at things like the rate of growth in non-\ndiscretionary spending, the cost of some of the major military \nengagements abroad, and the whole issue of cost-of-living increases, \namong other things.\n  Mr. President, the point of all of this is that everybody is going to \nhave to pitch in, and the American people now know it. Nobody is going \nto get all of what they want. I feel there are very few Americans who \nare not willing to help, as long as they believe that they are being \ntreated fairly, and that everyone is being asked to sacrifice.\n  The amendment we offer today is based upon the simple proposition \nthat while we are asking the American people to make these adjustments, \nwe must ask the same of ourselves. We certainly should not be having \nautomatic cost-of-living increases for this body during this particular \nperiod of time. Automatic pay increases, where we do not even have to \nvote on them, stick in the craw of the American people, and further \ndiminish the already low regard they have for Members of Congress.\n  Some people will say that freezing the pay of Members of Congress is \na largely symbolic act. I agree. I have already stated that the turning \nback a COLA does not achieve much in budget savings. But, Mr. \nPresident, I believe that symbolism is important. We need to lead by \nexample by showing the American people that we in Congress are willing \nto make a personal contribution to the effort of balancing the budget.\n  Mr. President, I think we have already begun to demonstrate to the \nAmerican people that this body is willing to do its part. We have \naddressed the problems of gifts and free trips for Members of Congress. \nWe have applied the laws to ourselves that have, for so many years, \nbeen applied to the American people. We have tried to face up to the \npension issues which will bring us more into line with other employees \nand other people in the private sector. So, turning down an automatic \ncost-of-living increase this year--as we did last year--is a part of \nthat overall picture.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I want to note that I did not decide to \noffer this amendment without giving thought to the impact that it would \nhave on my colleagues in the Congress who have families with children \nand are faced with expenses for education and maintaining two separate \nresidences. These individuals cannot continue to withstand indefinitely \nthe erosion of purchasing power that this pay freeze represents. \nHowever, at this crucial time in our history, I believe that a pay \nincrease is not appropriate. Since we have made significant progress on \nbudget issues in these past 2 years, it is my hope that we can make \neven more progress and avoid the need for pay freezes in the future.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Thompson-Helms amendment to \ncontinue the work we have started in this historic Congress.\n  Mr. HELMS. I do not know if there is further debate, Mr. President. \nThat is up to the managers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, we have no objection to the amendment, the \nThompson amendment.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, if the Senator from Alabama will just \nwithhold and give me a couple of minutes here?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent Senator Wellstone, \nfrom Minnesota, be added as a cosponsor to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. I am ready to proceed.\n  Mr. SHELBY. We have no objection to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 5208) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KERREY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I have an amendment involving managed care; \n5206 is the number of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator wish to amend the first \ncommittee amendment?\n\n[[Page S10161]]\n\n  Mr. KERREY. If the Senator from Oregon would allow me to dispose of \nthis, I have to dispose, I believe, of the underlying committee \namendment that we just attached an amendment to.\n  Mr. President, I urge adoption of the underlying committee amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the underlying committee amendment, as amended.\n  The excepted committee amendment on page 2, line 18, as amended, was \nagreed to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KERREY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n Amendment No. 5206 To Excepted Committee Amendment Beginning On Page \n                  16, line 16, Through Page 17, Line 2\n\n   (Purpose: To prohibit the restriction of certain types of medical \n      communications between a health care provider and a patient)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I have an amendment No. 5206, involving \nmanaged health care.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator attempting to amend the next \ncommittee amendment?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       Excepted committee amendment beginning on page 16, line 16, \n     through page 17, line 2.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment which will add \nmuch-needed new protections for the sacred, confidential relationship \nbetween physicians and their patients. In doing so, I want to single \nout, on a bipartisan basis, the excellent work done by a number of \nMembers of Congress on this issue.\n  In particular, I would like to single out Dr. Greg Ganske, a Member \nof the House, a physician, a Republican. He has done excellent work \nwith Congressman Markey in the House, and also to thank Senator \nKennedy, who joins me in this effort.\n  This matter of protecting the rights of patients in health \nmaintenance organizations has been thoroughly bipartisan through this \nCongress, and I want to make sure that this body understands that there \nis a very strong track record of bipartisan support for this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will suspend so we might have \nthe amendment read. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Wyden], for himself and Mr. \n     Kennedy, proposes an amendment numbered 5206 to the committee \n     amendment on page 16, line 16, through page 17, line 2.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the Committee amendment, insert the following \n     new title:\n\n             TITLE   --PROTECTION OF PATIENT COMMUNICATIONS\n\n     SEC.   01. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This title may be cited as the ``Patient \n     Communications Protection Act of 1996''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Patients need access to all relevant information to \n     make appropriate decisions, with their physicians, about \n     their health care.\n       (2) Restrictions on the ability of physicians to provide \n     full disclosure of all relevant information to patients \n     making health care decisions violate the principles of \n     informed consent and practitioner ethical standards.\n       (3) The offering and operation of health plans affect \n     commerce among the States. Health care providers located in \n     one State serve patients who reside in other States as well \n     as that State. In order to provide for uniform treatment of \n     health care providers and patients among the States, it is \n     necessary to cover health plans operating in one State as \n     well as those operating among the several States.\n\n     SEC.   02.

The Senator can continue.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, again, this amendment involves some very \nimportant rights with respect to consumer protection as it relates to \nhealth care practitioners, health care plans and the fact that it \nappears that some physicians are actually gagged in terms of what they \ncan tell their patients about their illnesses and their treatment.\n  These gag provisions often are included in contracts for purely \nfinancial reasons. They limit the kinds of therapies that physicians or \nother licensed health care practitioners may recommend. It can restrict \na practitioner from recommending a patient consult a physician outside \na plan or go to a facility outside the plan's network.\n  In addition, these kinds of approaches may even prohibit a \npractitioner from discussing financial incentives or penalties \nphysicians may be subject to based on treatments that are recommended \nor ignored, in the case of an individual physician.\n  Mr. President, the preamble of the Hippocratic oath tells physicians, \n``First, do no harm.'' The message of these gag restrictions, \nunfortunately, is, ``First, support the bottom line.'' That is not good \nhealth care, and it is certainly not good managed care.\n  Several months ago, the Washington Post cited a startling example \ninvolving Mid-Atlantic Medical Services health plans, a large \nWashington metro area provider. This plan wrote a letter to network \npractitioners informing them that:\n\n       Effective immediately, all referrals from (the plan) to \n     specialists may be for only one visit.\n\n  And in bold type the letter stated:\n\n       We are terminating the contracts of physicians and \n     affiliates who fail to meet the performance patterns for \n     their specialty.\n\n\n[[Page S10162]]\n\n\n  Obviously, this is a bad deal for patients on two counts. First, the \npatients may not be getting the kind of health care that is needed.\n  Second, the plan may restrict the physician from informing the \npatient about referral restrictions so the patient doesn't even know \nwhether they are being medically shortchanged via the plan's policy.\n  In my home State of Oregon, where we do have a great number of \nmanaged health care services and plans, our State law specifically \nprohibits these kinds of provisions. Many managed care plans in our \nState are offering good quality services. They are able to do it in a \nway that allows them to be both patient-oriented and consumer-friendly \nand still be sensitive to their financial needs.\n  Unfortunately, even in our State, a State where there are good \nmanaged care plans, problems can develop. For example, an orthopedic \nsurgeon in Portland recently was in a situation where their managed \ncare plan demanded that this particular physician diagnose problems in \npatients apart from the ones for which they were referred. He was, in \neffect, in a situation where he was told to keep his mouth shut and \ninstead re-refer those particular patients back to their primary care \nphysician.\n  This physician wrote to us:\n\n       This is extremely disappointing to patients, as you might \n     imagine. This requires more visits on their part to their \n     primary care physician and then back to me, which is \n     extremely inefficient.\n\n  Another physician, a family practice physician in rural Enterprise, \nOR, wrote that this antigag legislation is needed because ``when a \nphysician recommends medical treatment for a patient and a plan denies \ncoverage for that treatment, patients and physicians need an effective \nmechanism to challenge the plan.''\n\n  I think it is understood that the free flow of information between \ndoctors and patients is the very foundation of good health care. State \nlegal protections on this matter vary. Some States have taken steps to \nlimit these gag rules, but one of the reasons that I come to the floor \ntoday and why this legislation has received strong bipartisan support \nis that I think it is time for a national standard to deal with a \nnational problem.\n  This amendment is rifle-shot legislation prohibiting only oral gag \nprovisions in contracts or in a pattern of oral communications between \nplans and practitioners that limit discussion of a patient's physical \nor mental condition or treatment options. Health plans would still be \nable to protect and enforce provisions involving all other aspects of \ntheir relationship with their practitioners, including the \nconfidentiality of proprietary business information.\n  In developing this amendment, Mr. President, I and others have talked \nwith many who offer managed care health services, as well as \npractitioners and consumer advocates. Our enforcement provision \nspecifies penalties for violations by plans of up to $25,000 per event. \nThe amendment also specifies that State laws which meet or exceed the \nFederal standard set herein will not be preempted by Federal law.\n  I would like to point out to my colleagues that this amendment has \nbeen endorsed by the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, \nthe American Association of Retired Persons, the Center for Patient \nAdvocacy, Citizen Action, Consumers Union, the American College of \nEmergency Physicians and a number of other organizations. I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters from these \ngroups.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   August 1, 1996.\n     Hon. Ron Wyden,\n     259 Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wyden: We are writing to express our strong \n     support for ``The Patient Communications Protection Act.''\n       As you know, it has become common for insurers to \n     incorporate clauses or policies into providers' contracts \n     that restrict their ability to communicate with their \n     patients. Such ``gag clauses'' seriously threaten the quality \n     of care for American patients. Not only do gag clauses deny \n     patients the fundamental right to make a fully informed \n     decision about the care they receive, but also they prevent \n     health care providers from delivering the highest quality of \n     care.\n       Your legislation would prohibit the use of gag clauses. By \n     opening the lines of communication between patients and their \n     physicians, the bill helps to ensure that the practice of \n     medicine occurs in the doctors office not in the corporate \n     boardroom.\n       We, at the Center for Patient Advocacy, applaud your \n     efforts in behalf of American patients. We look forward to \n     working with you to secure passage of the Patient \n     Communications Protection Act.\n           Sincerely,\n     Neil Kahanovitz, M.D.,\n       President and Founder.\n     Terre McFillen Hall,\n       Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                   Oregon Medical Association,\n\n                                      Portland, OR, July 22, 1996.\n     Hon. Ron Wyden,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C.\n       Dear Senator Wyden: Thank you for asking for input from the \n     Oregon Medical Association prior to your introduction of the \n     Patient Communication Act of 1996. The ``gag rules'' decreed \n     by some of the managed care organizations would, indeed, make \n     a reasonable person gag. We appreciate your interest in \n     halting such activities and your intent to prohibit by \n     federal law such draconian practices. I know how much you \n     value and how well you understand the necessity of open \n     communication between patients and their physicians. Such \n     rules, and the knowledge that such rules exist, undermine the \n     trust that patients absolutely must have for their physicians \n     if the relationship is to be of value.\n       As you know, we here in the O.M.A. introduced and \n     orchestrated the 1995 state legislature's passage of the \n     Oregon Patient Protection Act which prohibited ``gag \n     clauses'' in managed care contracts here in Oregon, as you \n     are now intending to do at the federal level. As usual, your \n     state is out in front showing the way in health care.\n       We appreciate your sharing and exchanging ideas and \n     apprising us of pending legislation and we value such \n     dialogue. Please keep us informed of the progress of this \n     bill, on which we certainly are in agreement.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                   Frank J. Baumeister, Jr., M.D.,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n           National Committee to Preserve Social Security and \n                                                     Medicare,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 30, 1996.\n     Hon. Ron Wyden,\n     Russell Senate Office Building, U.S. House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wyden: The National Committee to Preserve \n     Social Security and Medicare, on behalf of its 5.5 million \n     members and supporters, endorses S. 2005, the ``Patient \n     Communications Protection Act of 1996.'' By addressing a \n     concern health care providers and patients may have with \n     managed care, this bill may encourage Medicare beneficiaries \n     to enroll in managed care plans.\n       This bill will encourage full and open communication \n     between physicians and their patients, which are vital to the \n     prevention of and recovery from illness. Frank discussions \n     cannot occur if providers are prohibited by health plans from \n     disclosing all available treatment options. In addition, the \n     use by some managed care companies of financial incentives to \n     limit costly care also limits communication between the \n     provider and the patient.\n       Managed care enrollees have a right to expect that they \n     will receive appropriate care for their medical condition, \n     without regard to the cost to the managed care company. The \n     best way to ensure that appropriate care is given to foster \n     full communication between provider and patient.\n       We applaud your effort to advance the ``Patient \n     Communications Protection Act'' and look forward to working \n     with you toward final enactment of this important bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Martha A. McSteen,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                           Association of American\n\n\n                                Physicians and Surgeons, Inc.,\n\n                                        Tucson, AZ, July 29, 1996.\n     Hon. Ron Wyden,\n     Russell Senate Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wyden: The Association of American Physicians \n     and Surgeons supports your efforts to protect the sanctity of \n     the patient-physician relationship with the ``Patients Right \n     to Know Act of 1996.''\n       Our association strongly supports the liberty of contract \n     and freedom of association. However, such liberty has bounds. \n     Contracts of adhesion are immoral, unjust and should be \n     unlawful. Patients are being exploited by powerful \n     organizations.\n       Patients should be able to rely upon their physicians' \n     ethics. However, today certain organizations are gaining the \n     economic power to exclude and financially destroy \n     conscientious physicians who place their obligations to the \n     patient ahead of the interests of the ``plan.'' Restrictions \n     on communication with our patients not only undermine quality \n     of care, but are a blatant violation of the Hippocratic Oath. \n     Prohibition of ``gag rules'' is a crucial step toward \n     protecting patients.\n       Contracts which restrict physicians' freedom to communicate \n     their best judgment are only one of the most egregious \n     violations of patients' rights.\n       AAPS believes Congress should consider legislation which \n     would protect patients'\n\n[[Page S10163]]\n\n     right to choice, confidentiality, the ability to privately \n     contract, and to receive full advance disclosure of the terms \n     of their insurance/health care plan in plain language. The \n     AAPS ``Patient's Bill of Rights'' which will be introduced as \n     a Congressional resolution by Rep. Linda Smith, addresses \n     those issues. We hope it will serve as a model and catalyst \n     for future legislation.\n       Information is the best prescription. Prohibition of ``gag \n     clauses'' is the first step in that direction, and we hope it \n     sets the stage for additional patient protections to come \n     from the 104th Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Jane M. Orient, M.D.,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                              American Counseling Association,\n\n                                  Alexandria, VA, August 20, 1996.\n     Hon. Ron Wyden,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wyden: I am writing on behalf of the American \n     Counseling Association (ACA), the nation's largest nonprofit \n     organization representing licensed and certified professional \n     counselors, to express our support for your legislation S. \n     2005, the Patient Communications Protection Act of 1996. As \n     behavioral healthcare providers, professional counselors \n     would be greatly helped by your legislation. However, we \n     could appreciate your consideration of a minor change in the \n     bill's definition of a ``health care provider'' from ``anyone \n     licensed under State law to provide health care services . . \n     .'' to ``anyone licensed or certified under State law to \n     provide health care services . . .''\n       Currently, 33 states--including the State of Oregon--and \n     the District of Columbia license professional counselors to \n     provide behavioral healthcare services to their residents. In \n     eight other states--including Arizona, Kentucky, Maryland, \n     New Hampshire, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Washington, and \n     Wisconsin--professional counselors are certified, and thus \n     would not be considered ``health care providers'' under S. \n     2005. Attached for your information is a survey comparing \n     state policies regarding licensure and certification.\n       We have discussed this issue with Steve Jenning of your \n     staff, who states he saw no reason this change couldn't be \n     included in the legislation as it moves forward. Should you \n     be agreeable to this proposed change, we would be happy to \n     provide you with any assistance or further information you \n     may need. Please use Scott Barstow of our Office of \n     Government Relations as our contact on this issue, at (703) \n     823-9800 x234.\n       Thank you for your time and consideration. We look forward \n     to working with you on behavioral healthcare issues and other \n     areas of mutual concern.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Gail Robinson,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                            American Chiropractic Association,\n\n                                     Arlington, VA, July 30, 1996.\n     Hon. Ron Wyden,\n     Russell Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wyden: Yesterday your office contacted the ACA \n     seeking endorsement for a bill you are drafting to prohibit \n     health insurance plans from restricting or limiting \n     communication between health providers and patients about \n     treatment options and procedures. This practice is most often \n     employed by managed care plans through what are called ``gag \n     rules.'' The ACA has endorsed legislation in the House, H.R. \n     2976, that would prohibit these gag rules, and we commend you \n     for your efforts to eliminate this unfair practice.\n       However, in the materials your staff provided us \n     (attached), it appeared that your proposal would limit the \n     effect of the bill to only those communications between \n     medical doctors and health plan participants. Thus, health \n     plans technically would be permitted to continue to employ \n     ``gag rules'' on communications between non-M.D. health \n     providers and their patients enrolled in managed care plans.\n       Such language concerns the ACA, since as you are aware, \n     doctors of chiropractic are not M.D.s, but rather are fully \n     licensed health care providers so recognized in every state. \n     It is our belief that any legislative proposal to prohibit \n     the establishment of ``gag rules'' in managed care plans \n     should apply to all providers licensed or otherwise \n     recognized by a state authority. Since hundreds of millions \n     of consumers utilize non-M.D. health professionals every \n     year, we believe your proposal needs to be broadened.\n       Therefore, before endorsing your bill, ACA would strongly \n     urge you to expand its definition of health provider to mean \n     any health professional licensed, certified or registered in \n     a state to provide health care services. This would extend \n     the sensible protections your legislation offers to those \n     patients who utilize the services of health professionals who \n     are not M.D.s.\n       ACA appreciates and acknowledges your past efforts on \n     behalf of the chiropractic profession and the tens of \n     millions of patients who visit doctors of chiropractic every \n     year. We hope that you will see fit to make the modifications \n     that we have respectfully submitted in this letter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Garrett F. Cuneo,\n                                         Executive Vice President.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, let me also, in closing, quote briefly from \na few of these endorsements.\n  The Association of American Physicians writes:\n\n       Restrictions on communication with our patients not only \n     undermine quality of care, but [constitutes] a blatant \n     violation of the Hippocratic oath. Prohibition of ``gag \n     rules'' is a crucial step toward protecting patients.\n\n  The Center for Patient Advocacy writes:\n\n       It has become common for insurers to incorporate clauses or \n     policies into providers' contracts that restrict their \n     ability to communicate with their patients. Such gag clauses \n     seriously threaten the quality of care for American patients.\n\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by saying that my part of the country \nwas involved in the pioneering work in the managed care area. I have \nseen in my community--we have perhaps the highest concentration of \nmanaged Medicare in the country, with almost 50 percent of the older \npeople in managed care--that it is possible to offer good quality \nmanaged care services.\n  What has concerned me is that there has been a pattern documented of \nmanaged care plans cutting corners and, unfortunately, imposing these \ngag clauses which get in the way of the doctor-patient relationship and \nthe patient having the kind of information that a patient needs in \norder to make their own decisions about their health care.\n  I don't think that is what the health care future of our country is \nall about. As I talk to patients, and I have sought to work in this \narea since my days with the elderly before being elected to Congress, I \nfind that patients today hunger for information. I suspect in the years \nahead, you are going to have medical patients in our country at their \ncomputer looking at the Internet to get information about medical \nservices, and it seems to contradict the future of American health care \nto have these gag rules which would cut off essential information in \nmanaged care plans between providers and plans and their patients.\n  Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues will support this \nlegislation. It has received bipartisan support on both sides of the \nHill. I hope this will receive a unanimous vote here in the Senate \ntoday.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, one of the most dramatic changes in the \nAmerican health care system in recent years has been the growth of \nmanaged care plans such as health maintenance organizations, preferred \nprovider organizations, point of service plans, and other types of \nnetwork plans. Today, more than half of all Americans with private \ninsurance are enrolled in such plans, and 70 percent of covered \nemployees in businesses with more than 10 employees are enrolled in \nmanaged care. Between 1990 and 1995 alone, the proportion of Blue Cross \nand Blue Shield enrollees participating in managed care plans \nskyrocketed from just one in five to almost half. Even conventional \nfee-for-service plans have increasingly adopted features of managed \ncare, such as ongoing medical review and case management.\n  In many ways, this is a positive development. Managed care offers the \nopportunity to extend the best medical practice to all medical \npractice. It emphasizes helping people to stay healthy, rather than \nsimply caring for them when they become sick. It helps provide more \ncoordinated and more effective care for people with multiple medical \nneeds. It offers a needed antidote to the incentives in fee-for-service \nmedicine to provide unnecessary care--incentives that have contributed \na great deal to the high cost of care in recent years.\n  In fact, in 1973, Congress enacted the first Federal legislation to \nencourage HMO's, in recognition of these potential benefits for \nimproving the quality of care.\n  At its best, managed care fulfills these goals. Numerous studies have \nfound that managed care compares favorably to fee-for-service medicine \non a variety of quality measures, including use of preventive care, \nearly diagnosis of some conditions, and patient satisfaction. Many \nHMO's--including a number based in Massachusetts--have made vigorous \nefforts to improve the quality of care, gather and use systematic data \nto improve clinical decision-making, and assure an appropriate mix of \nprimary and specialty care.\n  But the same financial incentives that can lead HMO's and other \nmanaged care providers to practice more\n\n[[Page S10164]]\n\ncost-effective medicine also can lead to under-treatment or \ninappropriate restrictions on specialty care, expensive treatments, and \nnew treatments. As Dr. Raymond Scalettar, speaking on behalf of the \nJoint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations, \nrecently testified,\n\n       The relative comfort with which the fee-for-service sector \n     has ordered and provided health care services has been \n     replaced with strict priorities for limiting the volume of \n     services, especially expensive specialty services, whenever \n     possible . . . [T]hese realities are legitimate causes for \n     concern, because no one can predict the precise point at \n     which overall cost-cutting and quality care intersect. The \n     American public wants to be assured that managed care is a \n     good value, and that they will receive the quality of care \n     they expect regardless of age, type of disorder, existence of \n     a chronic condition or other potential basis for \n     discrimination.\n\n  In recent months a spate of critical articles in the press has \nsuggested that too many managed care plans place their bottom line \nahead of their patients' well-being--and are pressuring physicians in \ntheir networks to do the same. These abuses include failure to inform \npatients of particular treatment options; excessive barriers to reduce \nreferrals to specialists for evaluation and treatment; unwillingness to \norder appropriate diagnostic tests; and reluctance to pay for \npotentially life-saving treatment. In some cases, these failures have \nhad tragic consequences.\n  For example, David and Joyce Ching spent 12 weeks trying \nunsuccessfully to obtain a referral to a specialist from their primary \ncare physician or gatekeeper in the MetLife HMO Plan. Not until David \nrefused to leave the office of the gatekeeper physician was his wife \nreferred to a specialist. Within 24 hours of her visit to a specialist, \nJoyce was diagnosed with cancer. She died 15 months later.\n  Alan and Christy DeMeurers had a similarly frustrating experience \nwith their HMO. An HMO-provided oncologist recommended--in violation of \nthe HMO rules--that Christy obtain a bone marrow transplant and made \nthe necessary referral. The DeMeurers spent months trying to get this \ntreatment. Not only did the HMO seek to deny the treatment, it \nattempted to deny the DeMeurers information about the treatment itself. \nBy going outside the HMO plan, the DeMeurers were finally able to get \nanswers to their questions about the treatment, and Christy was finally \nable to get the treatment recommended by her original oncologist.\n  In the long run, the most effective means of assuring quality in \nmanaged care is for the industry itself to make sure that quality is \nalways a top priority. I am encouraged by the industry's recent \ndevelopment of a ``philosophy of care'' that sets out ethical \nprinciples for its members, by the growing trend toward accreditation, \nand by the increasingly widespread use of standardized quality \nassessment measures. But I also believe that basic Federal regulations \nto assure that every plan meets at least minimum standards is \nnecessary.\n  With this amendment, the Senate has a chance to go firmly on record \nagainst a truly flagrant practice--the use of ``gag rules'' to keep \nphysicians from informing patients of all their treatment options and \nmaking their best professional recommendations. Gag rules take a number \nof forms. They include:\n  Forbidding a physician to discuss treatment options not covered by \nthe insurance plan or prior to consultation with officers of the plan;\n  Forbidding the referral of patients to specialists or facilities not \nparticipating in the plan.\n  So-called ``non-disparagement clauses'' in contracts, which are \ndesigned to keep network physicians from urging patients to switch to \nanother plan, but which are also used to threaten physicians who \nrecommend therapies the plan refuses to cover; rules forbidding \nphysicians to inform patients of financial incentives or utilization \nmanagement rules that could lead to denial of appropriate treatment; \ndenying information to patients that a physician has been de-selected \nfrom a plan.\n  The amendment we are offering today targets the most abusive type of \ngag rule: those that forbid physicians to discuss all treatment options \nwith the patient and make the best possible professional \nrecommendation, even if that recommendation is for a noncovered service \nor could be construed to disparage the plan for not covering it. Our \namendment forbids plans from ``prohibiting or restricting any medical \ncommunication'' with a patient ``with respect to the patient's physical \nor mental condition or treatment options.''\n  This is a basic rule which everyone endorses in theory, but which has \nbeen violated in practice. The standards of the Joint Commission on \nAccreditation of Health Care Organizations require that ``Physicians \ncannot be restricted from sharing treatment options with their \npatients, whether or not the options are covered by the plan.''\n  As Dr. John Ludden of the Harvard Community Health Plan, testifying \nfor the American Association of Health Plans has said, The AAHP firmly \nbelieves that there should be open communications between health \nprofessionals and their patients about health status, medical \nconditions, and treatment options.''\n  Legislation similar to this amendment recently passed the House \nCommerce Committee on a unanimous bi-partisan vote. President Clinton \nhas strongly endorsed the proposal. The congressional session is \ndrawing to close. Today, the Senate has the opportunity to act to \nprotect patients across the country from these abusive gag rules. I \nurge the Senate to approve this amendment.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I looked at this amendment, as has the \nchairman. It is similar to an amendment offered by the Senator from \nNorth Carolina. We are having some review done on it. It is likely that \nwe might be willing to accept the amendment. If the Senator would be \nwilling to wait for a bit until we can get that language reviewed to \nmake sure there are no problems with it, it is likely we will be able \nto accept it, as we did the Senator from North Carolina's amendment.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, we have not had a chance to really study \nthe Wyden amendment yet. We have just had a quick opportunity to review \nthe Senator's amendment. We need to look at it more closely, and we \nhave some other people doing it. There are some other committees this \ncould have tremendous impact on. We do not know what CBO will say about \nthis, if anything. It might need to be scored, what the cost is, if \nany. We just started into the bill. We have a little time, I believe. I \nwas wondering if the Senator from Oregon would set it aside and let us \nlook at it.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Let me first say to my friend, this is not an issue \ninvolving the Congressional Budget Office.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Sure. That is good.\n  Mr. WYDEN. This is simply a matter of patients and managed care \norganizations not being subjected to these gag rules which keep them \nfrom having information. But I think that the request that the Senator \nfrom Alabama and the Senator from Nebraska makes is a reasonable one. I \nsaw the thrashing we were going through at the beginning in the effort \nto work out a number of these amendments on a bipartisan basis. So I am \nhappy to hold off a bit in terms of a vote to work further with the \nSenator from Nebraska and the Senator from Alabama.\n  Let me say, also, that I have noted that what the Senator from North \nCarolina has indicated he was interested in as well is quite similar to \nwhat I have sought to do. If anything, it just corroborates the \nproposition that we are discussing here today that there is bipartisan \ninterest on both sides of Capitol Hill in this matter with the growth \nof managed care in our country.\n  This is an issue that millions of consumers care about that I think, \nfor those of us who believe in managed care, has great potential. It is \nabsolutely critical at this time to lock in these consumer protections \nand restrict these gag rules. From my previous experience in working \nwith the Senator from Alabama, I know that he will pursue this in good \nfaith. I ask that we have the vote a bit later and have an opportunity \nto consult further with the Senators from Nebraska and Alabama. I will \nbe happy to yield.\n  Mr. SHELBY. If the Senator from Oregon will just yield briefly, this \nwould give us a chance for both my staff and the staff of the Senator \nfrom Nebraska to look at this amendment and see what the significance \nof it is. We will be glad to get back with the Senator. Is that OK?\n\n[[Page S10165]]\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Yes.\n  Mr. KERREY. If I could comment on the substance as well. I think both \nthe Senator from Oregon and the Senator from North Carolina identified \na very important problem in the current health care system. He is quite \nright. It is one thing to say to a patient, I am not going to pay for a \nprocedure; it is quite another to say you cannot talk amongst one \nanother, or I am going to be prohibited from telling you about a \nprocedure that you may say you want.\n  We are moving into an environment, not just on the private-sector \nside, but, also, in many of the Government programs in Medicare. Many \nof the States are using managed care with Medicaid as well. I think the \nSenator from Oregon has identified a very, very important consumer \nproblem.\n  It is far better for us to give the consumer more information than \nthey need, far better for us to make certain that the consumer, the \npatient, is well-informed of what the choices are, as opposed to on the \nbasis of being concerned they might ask for something that I am going \nto say no to if I am running the managed care program. It is far better \nto give them the information, it seems to me, than to deny it to them.\n  So my hope is we will be able to clear both this and the amendment of \nthe Senator from North Carolina, subject to no serious problems being \nraised.\n  Mr. WYDEN. If the Senator from Nebraska will allow me to reclaim my \ntime, let me just say I think that both of you have indicated your \ndesire to work on this. I very much appreciate your comments.\n  I say to Senator Kerrey, I know of your interest in this health care \nissue and the fact that it has been longstanding. Let us say that for \npurposes of working on this in a bipartisan way, I will not request \nthat the vote be taken right now and look forward to voting a little \nbit later today on this when the staffs have had a chance to work with \nit further.\n  Mr. KERREY. Right.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \ncommittee amendments be temporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I have a number of amendments I will offer \nthat are either technical in nature or necessary to change the bill \nbecause of events which have occurred since the bill was reported or \nare of a noncontroversial nature. All of these amendments, I \nunderstand, have been cleared with Senator Kerrey's staff.\n  Mr. KERREY. They have been cleared. We have no problem with the \namendments.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5209\n\n              (Purpose: Technical correction to H.R. 3756)\n\n  Mr. SHELBY.

In \nprinting the bill, the GPO failed to line type the figure in the House-\npassed bill. This amendment does this. It has been cleared on both \nsides of the aisle.\n  Mr. KERREY. We have no objection.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment is not a germane amendment \nto this appropriations bill. I assume notice will be made of that, so I\n\n[[Page S10169]]\n\nimmediately agree this is not germane to this legislation.\n  However, this is, perhaps, the only remaining opportunity to offer \nsuch an amendment. I offered it about a year ago, and the Senate had a \nvote on it. It was a 52 to 47 vote. It deals with a provision in our \ntax law which encourages and provides incentives to U.S. companies that \nmove jobs overseas from this country to their foreign factories \noperating in tax havens.\n  I have believed for some long while that we have an obligation in \nCongress to decide that we will change our Tax Code sufficiently so we \nwill not be providing incentives to ship U.S. manufacturing jobs \noverseas.\n  I offered this amendment last year, almost a year ago now, and, as I \nindicated, the vote on it was on a vote to table, and it was 52 to 47. \nI recognize this is controversial, but I also maintain it is critically \nimportant. I also do not prefer to offer a nongermane amendment to this \nparticular appropriations bill. I have great respect for the Senator \nfrom Alabama and the Senator from Nebraska. They want to get this bill \ndone, and I understand that. I don't intend to hold them up forever on \nthis, but I would like to have a discussion about this and have a vote \non it. I know there are a couple of others who want to speak about this \namendment as well.\n\n  Let me try to briefly describe what this amendment would do. Before I \ndo that, let me say again to those who will point out that this is \nnongermane, I admit that, and I assert that we have faced nongermane \namendments from both sides of the aisle in the past year or two here in \nCongress. We have recently seen an amendment dealing with a gas tax \nrepeal on a White House travel bill. So we have seen a whole range of \nnongermane amendments. While I agree with others that that is not the \npreferable way to do business, this is the last opportunity to offer \nsuch an amendment.\n  Let me talk for a moment about the specifics. On July 8, this year, \nthe Boston Globe had an article that was entitled ``Tax Code Gives \nCompanies a Lift,'' and I would like to read a few paragraphs of it \nbecause it was a fascinating, lengthy article written by Aaron Zitner \nof the Boston Globe. The first paragraph describes what has long \nconcerned me and persuaded me previously, and now again, to offer an \namendment of the type I am offering today. It reads in the Globe:\n\n       When Robert M. Silva's job moved to Singapore two years \n     ago, his company flew him overseas so he could train his \n     replacement. Then the company closed its North Reading \n     factory [in Massachusetts], laid off Silva and 119 co-workers \n     and began importing from its Asian plant the medical products \n     once made in Massachusetts.\n       Moving jobs to Singapore had obvious advantages for Baxter \n     International Inc. Taxes are low, and Silva's $26,000 salary \n     was far higher than what the company pays his replacement.\n       But Baxter reaped another reward for moving overseas: a tax \n     break, courtesy of the United States Government. In the name \n     of boosting U.S. business, the Tax Code offers a special \n     benefit to companies that move jobs offshore. . . .\n       It is one of many tax breaks that ripple perversely through \n     the economy--favoring multinationals over small firms, \n     favoring investors over average taxpayers and favoring \n     foreign workers over those at home.\n\n  Those are the first paragraphs of a lengthy and very interesting \narticle in the Boston Globe. This paragraph talks about a man named \nRobert Silva. I have never met him, and I don't ever expect to meet \nhim. He is one of many Americans who discovered that his job no longer \nexists in this country; it exists in Singapore. He discovered he was \nsent to Singapore to train his replacement. He is a taxpayer, like \nothers, who pays taxes to our Government for a lot of things that he no \ndoubt supports. But I will bet you that Mr. Silva, like many others, \ndoes not support a provision in our Tax Code that actually rewards \nthose who would move U.S. jobs overseas.\n  Now, what is this reward, and what is the amendment I am proposing? \nThe amendment I am proposing is not to repeal all of something called \ndeferral. That is not my proposal. The Senate actually voted once to \nrepeal deferral many years ago. It just did not go beyond the Senate. \nBut the Senate has already acted to repeal something called deferral. \nWhat is deferral? That means that if you are an American manufacturing \ncompany producing overseas, you make an income there, and you generally \ndon't have to report it and pay taxes on it in this country. You may \ndefer that tax obligation until and unless you repatriate the income to \nour country. That is a special tax break called deferral. You can defer \nany taxes you would have owed to this country on income you made in a \nplant outside of this country.\n  As I indicated, the Senate in 1975 voted to repeal all of the \ndeferral tax break. Of course, it was a different day, a different \ndebate. It was very controversial then. In 1987, the House of \nRepresentatives voted to repeal a small part of deferral. In fact, it \nis exactly the part that I am proposing that we now repeal. The House \nof Representatives passed this provision, which I now offer the Senate, \nin 1987. The provision says that those U.S. companies who establish a \nmanufacturing plant overseas, move their U.S. jobs overseas to tax \nhavens, and then ship their products back into this country will lose \nthe deferral on their tax break--the tax break called deferral--that \namount of income attributable to the goods they move back into our \ncountry. It is a very small slice of this issue called deferral, but it \nwould close that, because that which now exists is to say to a U.S. \ncompany, close your manufacturing plant in Boston or Bismarck or Los \nAngeles and then move it overseas to a tax haven and the American \ntaxpayer will make a deal with you. If you do that, we will give you a \ntax break. What is that tax break worth? It is worth $2.2 billion in 7 \nyears. That is how much is paid to companies who locate their \nmanufacturing jobs in other countries as opposed to this country.\n\n  Now, I don't know of anyone who really can stand up and say, boy, \nthis makes a lot of sense. It is an affirmative policy on our part to \nreward the export of American jobs. I don't know of anyone who is \nproposing that. If there are people who propose that, I would very much \nlike them to come to the floor of the Senate and see if we can begin \ndebating it, because I hope we will have some discussion. A year ago, \nwhen I offered this amendment, we were told that some hearings might be \nheld and that this is not the time, the place, nor the way, and I \nunderstood all that. I did not agree with it. But as is usually the \ncase, a year passes and not much happens. I wanted to offer this a \nmonth or two ago and wasn't able to do that, given the parliamentary \ncircumstances. So now I am required, if I am to offer it at all in this \nsession of Congress, to offer it today on this piece of legislation.\n  I would like to go over a couple of charts. Lest anyone thinks this \nis something that is irrelevant and not important, I would like to go \nover a few charts to describe why I think this is important. First of \nall, I would like to talk about manufacturing jobs in this country. The \ntrend line on manufacturing jobs is dismal. The trend line is that we \nare a country with fewer and fewer manufacturing jobs, and \nmanufacturing jobs, traditionally, have been the good jobs that pay \ngood income with good benefits. But you see what is happening.\n  Since 1979, we have lost about 3 million good-paying manufacturing \njobs in this country. We continue to see manufacturing jobs move \nelsewhere, and I know people say, ``Well, yes, but we have more service \njobs,'' and this and that and the other. The fact is that getting a job \nat minimum wage, working for some discount store on the edge of a city, \nis not a replacement for good manufacturing jobs that traditionally \nhave paid good income in this country. This is what is happening to \nmanufacturing jobs in our country. That is a ominous trend. Part of \nthat is because those manufacturing jobs are being exported. Exported \nhow? Well, for a lot of reasons, one of which is that we actually \nencourage it in our Tax Code.\n  Next is ``Employment by Foreign Manufacturing Affiliates of United \nStates Companies''--U.S. firms and their employment. Here is what is \nhappening to manufacturing employment in the United States. That is the \nred line. You see what is happening to that. That is going down.\n  U.S. companies manufacturing abroad, what is happening to their \nemployment? That is going up. Those lines show clearly what is \nhappening on manufacturing employment by U.S. corporations in Asia and \nLatin America, the location of most low wage and tax haven countries.\n\n[[Page S10170]]\n\n  ``Employment in Foreign Manufacturing Affiliates.'' You can see what \nis happening over the years. That employment continues to increase. \nAgain, this is manufacturing and manufacturing jobs are traditionally \nthe best source of jobs or the best income and the most secure.\n  ``Employment by U.S. Firms in Foreign Tax Havens.'' You will see \nIreland, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, Singapore. Singapore, 74,700 \nfirms. I am not suggesting that a United States company should not be \nable to have a foreign affiliate and manufacture in Singapore. A United \nStates company might well want to establish an affiliate in Singapore \nin order to manufacture there to compete in Korea. I am not suggesting \nthat is inappropriate. I am not suggesting we change that. I am saying \nthat if a United States company decides it wants to manufacture in \nSingapore for the purpose of serving the United States market, the \ncompany that manufactures in the United States to serve the United \nStates market is put at a substantial disadvantage. Why? Because at \nleast in part we have provided in our Tax Code a reward for those who \nleft which translates into a penalty for those who stayed.\n  ``Growth of Manufacturing Employment.'' You can see what is happening \nagain, in the number of countries where manufacturing jobs have been \nmoving with robust growth and what is happening in the United States. \nThat is not, it seems to me, what we should aspire to have happen in \nour country.\n  ``Growth of Imports of Manufactured Products.'' Once again, the line \nshows that we have a steady upward trend of growth of imports from \nmanufactured products. The moment I say this some will say, ``Well, he \nwants to stop the imports.'' This is not the case. This is not, on the \none hand, a debate between those who want free and open and \nunrestricted trade and those, on the other hand, who are protectionist, \nxeno- phobic stooges who do not understand what is happening in the \nworld. That is the way it is characterized. That is a lot of baloney. \nWhat this is is a narrow question of whether or not we ought to have in \nour Tax Code that provision which provides a significant incentive to \nsay to a U.S. manufacturer, ``We will make you a deal: Move your jobs \noverseas and we will give you tax relief. Compete after you move \noverseas against a domestic company that stayed in the United States \nand will be at a disadvantage because we gave you a tax advantage and \ndid not give the company that stayed here a tax advantage.''\n  That, it seems to me, is exactly the wrong message we want to be \nsending to American manufacturers.\n  Well, I do not know that I need to provide more evidence that \nmanufacturing jobs are leaving this country. It is, I suppose, \ndifficult to discuss this with a great deal of success at a time when \nthose who receive these benefits are the largest enterprises in our \ncountry, literally in many cases the largest enterprises in the world, \nspending an enormous amount of time lobbying to keep what they now \nhave, preventing someone from taking away the benefits they now have. \nThere are not people walking around the streets carrying placards \ntelling us that we have to shut this tax loophole because almost no one \nknows it exists.\n  Mr. Silva, who has lost his job in Massachusetts, may not know it \nexists, but it contributed to his losing his job. A woman named Carolyn \nRichard probably does not know it exists. She is a woman married with \none child, a 10th grade education, one of 500 people who worked in a \nFruit of the Loom factory, 8-hour days, stitching shoulder joints and \nhemming T-shirts. She, with a lot of others, worked hard. They liked \ntheir jobs, did well. But they cannot compete against others who will \nwork for a dollar a day, a dollar an hour, and so companies that would \nemploy Carolyn Richard decide they will close their American plant \nbecause they can make that product elsewhere less expensively.\n  I admit there are several things that persuade companies to do this, \none of which is a tax break. Several others include being able to pole \nvault over an entire range of knotty little problems in this country \nthat we served 75 years debating--should there be child labor \nprotection laws? Should there be safety in the workplace? If so, what \nshould those standards be? Should we prevent the dumping of chemicals \nand effluents into the air and water by manufacturing plants? We spent \n75 years debating that and came to some conclusions about it, and we \nhave child labor laws; we have worker safety protection issues; we have \nminimum wages; we have provisions that you cannot dump chemicals into \nour water; you cannot dump effluents into the airshed that pollute this \ncountry.\n  So that is what costs money, and some are able to pole vault over all \nof those issues by saying: I do not have to pay the minimum wage; I can \nhire a 14-year old and pay them 14 cents an hour and work them 14 hours \na day; I can dump chemicals into the stream; I can dump pollution into \nthe airshed; I do not have to care about OSHA inspectors, safe work \nplace; I do not have to care about any of those things and save money \nbecause I can move this plant overseas. Besides, when I am done doing \nthat, I can claim a tax break because the American taxpayers will pay \nme and others who do it $2.2 billion in 7 years if I will just consider \nmoving my American jobs elsewhere.\n  There is at the moment a wonderful series that I would commend to my \ncolleagues being done in the Philadelphia Inquirer by fellows named \nDonald Barlett and James Steele. They have done a substantial amount of \neconomic work. They have won the Pulitzer Prize, a couple Pulitzer \nPrizes for their reporting, and they have now published 3 of an \nexpected 10 pieces dealing with these issues--trade, tax preferences. \nWhat is happening to an endangered label, they say. ``Made in the \nU.S.A.'' ``An Endangered Label: `Made in the U.S.A.' ''\n  Product after product once made or grown in the United States now \ncomes from abroad and one of the biggest losers in this influx is small \nbusiness.\n  From one of their articles I wanted to read a couple of paragraphs \nthat I think summarize part of this issue for me.\n\n       Unlike multinational corporations that have closed \n     factories in the United States and shifted the production \n     abroad to take advantage of cheap labor, small companies \n     seldom have that option. It is these businesses, employing a \n     few to a dozen workers, that are being squeezed out. \n     Individually, they barely register a blip on the economic \n     indicators. Taken together, they provide a livelihood for \n     millions.\n       Small businesses have scant access to people in Congress \n     who write the laws and little influence in the White House. \n     They rarely receive favorable hearings from regulatory \n     authorities. With few exceptions, their appeals for help go \n     unheard when imports of competing products from low wage \n     countries begin flooding in.\n\n  Mr. President, Mr. Glover, chief counsel from the Small Business \nAdministration's Office of Advocacy, said it pretty well. He was \nspeaking of part of this amendment. He talked about the legislative \noffering that I have proposed, ``encouraging small and mid-sized \ndomestic businesses by reducing the competitive advantage a business \nmight receive by moving its operations overseas.''\n  ``We recognize,'' he said, ``the fact of life that some businesses \nmay move their production operations to a foreign nation for reasons of \nmarket access, materials availability or a variety of other concerns.''\n  And I recognize that as well.\n  He also said, ``We also know that domestic small businesses, having \nneither the resources nor the expertise for such a move, should be \nassured that their globe-trotting, multinational competitors will not \nbe provided tax advantages as well. Eliminating the deferrals for a \nU.S. business which has closed its domestic production and moved abroad \nand which now seeks to sell those same products domestically will help \nsmall businesses to be competitive and at least give them a sense of \nfair treatment.''\n  Mr. President, I could go on at some length because this is a very \ncontroversial issue. Not long ago, a couple of people who worked for an \norganization that has been put together and funded by the largest \ncompanies in this country, which benefit from this tax break, put \ntogether a piece in one of the tax publications here in town. It was \njust a scathing attack of this proposal of mine. It described all that \nis wrong with it and why the current system is wonderful and why what I \nam proposing is so awful.\n  A response to that was recently done by the Congressional Research \nService, prepared by its senior specialist in economic policy, Jane \nGravelle. It was\n\n[[Page S10171]]\n\npublished recently, and it debunks all of the hollow issues that were \nraised about this legislation.\n  This is not rocket science, no matter what those who come to the \nfloor may say. This is not complicated. It is not even highly technical \nin its application. The question that we ought to address as Members of \nthe Senate, at the time when this country is losing more and more \nmanufacturing jobs, is this: Do we want to continue in our Tax Code to \nsubsidize the exodus of American jobs overseas, by saying to U.S. \ncompanies, ``If you put U.S. jobs overseas rather than here at home we \nwill give you a tax break\"? ``If you have a plant here at home, shut \nthe door, get rid of the workers, move it overseas, and the American \ntaxpayer will say thank you by giving you a check.''\n  If you believe that makes sense and if you believe there is any room \nin this country where you can stand up and describe that as a sensible \npublic policy, then you ought to vote against what I am proposing. But \nif you, like most people, think that our Tax Code at least ought to be \nneutral on the question of where you locate jobs--and it probably ought \nto be more than neutral--we ought to tip it on the side of saying, if \nyou create jobs here, we will provide incentives for you. We ought to \nturn it around. Instead of providing incentives for those who ship jobs \nout of our country, we ought to create incentives for those who create \njobs in this country.\n  We are told this is a global economy and some Members of the Senate \nand the House simply lack the capability of understanding the new \nrealities of the global economy. I do not know whether they refer to me \nwhen they say that, or the Senator from South Carolina. I do not know \nwho it is who does not understand all this global economy. I confess to \ngrowing up in a town of 300 people, attending a high school with a \nclass of 9. I graduated in a senior class of 9. They did not teach us, \nnecessarily, higher math in our high school, but we got reasonably good \ntraining. They taught us to think a little bit, use a little judgment, \nhave a little common sense.\n  I could go back to Regent, ND, tonight, perhaps hold a meeting in the \nRegent town hall, and most of the folks in Regent would come, because \nit is a small town. There is probably not a lot going on there this \nevening. Regent was a town where there probably was not much going on \nwhen I was a student there. It is a wonderful community, small but \nwonderful. If we could get all the folks there in the Regent Center \ntonight, we could talk to them about what do they think we ought to do \non tax policy. Do you think we ought to encourage some jobs that exist \nin North Dakota or in Colorado, New Hampshire, Rhode Island--do you \nthink we ought to encourage those jobs to move elsewhere, just leave \nour country? Take a manufacturing job and send it elsewhere? Make \nshoes, shirts, belts and television sets and cars elsewhere? Or would \nit be better if you could find a way to try to keep most of those jobs \nhere?\n  If we could get all the folks there in Regent and talk to them, they \nmight raise the question of the global economy. They might say, ``Isn't \nthe global economy kind of an inevitable circumstance nowadays, where \nwe are competing against those workers who live in Sri Lanka, in \nBangladesh, in Malaysia, in Singapore?'' Yes, it is, absolutely. That \nis the reality. We are competing against those people and that is \nprecisely why we are losing manufacturing jobs. We should have to \ncompete with virtually everyone in the world, providing the competition \nis fair.\n\n  I would ask this. Is it fair to ask a worker in Alabama, Colorado, \nSouth Carolina, or North Dakota to compete against someone who makes 14 \ncents an hour? Can we compete against someone who makes 14 cents an \nhour? Should we compete? Is it necessary to be required to compete \nagainst someone who makes 14 cents an hour? I can tell you about some \npeople who do make 14 cents an hour working 11 hours a day, 6 days a \nweek. I can tell you about them. How about making 14 cents an hour at \nage 14? Working 14 hours a day? I can tell you about some of them.\n  So, if the answer to the question is no, we should not have to \ncompete against that, then the question is, what do we do? We not only \ncreate a circumstance in our country where we say you are going to \ncompete against it, but we say if you will simply take the opportunity \nto access low wages elsewhere, we will give you a tax break.\n  Folks in my hometown would, I think, find that fairly dumb. I do not \nknow how else you describe that. I think they would say that is a \npretty dumb policy. What kind of minds conspired together to figure out \nthat we ought to have a tax break if we boot jobs out of our country? \nWhat kind of high-minded people? Tell me where they got their \neducation. What kind of high-minded people is it who believe it makes \nsense for us to create tax policy that has the consequence of weakening \nour country and weakening the job base that has been the very \nfoundation for economic growth in America?\n  Economic growth in this country is not economic growth based on \ntarget discount stores on the edge of our cities, paying minimum wage. \nIn fact, I went through one recently with my little daughter, trying to \nfind a bathing suit. Do you know, I could not find an employee. I \nwalked around forever trying to find somebody who worked there. They \nhave a store and, at least to my knowledge, no discernible employees.\n  I finally found somebody to take my money. But is that a substitute? \nAre those jobs the substitute for good manufacturing jobs? Of course \nnot. So the question is, should we decide to focus a bit on this \nquestion? We will have people come and say, ``No, no, you should not \nfocus on it. This is irrelevant, it is extraneous, and besides you have \nit all wrong. This tax break is not really a tax break; those who you \nsay get it do not get it, and if they do get it, it really doesn't \nmatter.'' There are always three or four stages of denial here in this \nChamber.\n  But some of us think this is important. The global economy is a \nreality. I am not suggesting we put up walls and keep products out. I \nam not suggesting that we tie the hands of American corporations. I am \nsuggesting that we decide, on behalf of our country, that rather than \nprovide incentives to those who would move jobs outside of our country, \nwe consider providing incentives to those who would create jobs inside \nof our country, and that is the central question before us.\n  So, I have a couple of other things I want to say, but I know the \nSenator from South Carolina wishes to speak on this. I, at this point, \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I will be as brief as I possibly can. I \nwill not take long. This is a subject that really deserves several days \nof debate.\n  But, in a capsule, we are going to bring it right to a head, I think, \nin the next couple of hours, in that Pat Choate, the author of ``Agents \nOf Influence,'' has been selected as the Vice Presidential candidate by \nRoss Perot, in this so-called Reform Party.\n  Mr. Choate was the vice president in charge of policy at TRW. When he \npublished this book, which factually has never been challenged, he, of \ncourse, was relieved of his post as vice president of TRW and has been \nout as a consultant to industry.\n  There is no question that finally, finally, in this election, trade \nand jobs will really come into focus, as the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Dakota is bringing right here.\n  Let me hasten to add, I support, of course, our Democratic ticket of \nClinton-Gore and will continue to support them. I have tried to work--\nwith respect, unsuccessfully, of course--on NAFTA and GATT to change \nour trade policy and save us from these two flawed agreements. But we \nare going to have to try to do our dead level best to bring them into \nthe real world of trade and jobs, and I am confident that the selection \nof Mr. Choate will really bring it front and center.\n  There is no question, don't put this gentleman in a debate with any \nof the persons mentioned here, and he is far, far more informed. They \ndo not have to bring up the case of Smoot-Hawley and think you are \ngoing to show a picture and rattle this gentleman.\n  Let me first commend my distinguished colleague from North Dakota. He \nhas been very erudite in this particular matter, because he feels \nkeenly about the two really great issues facing our Nation.\n\n[[Page S10172]]\n\n  One, of course, is trying to get this Congress to pay the bills. And \nyou heard earlier today the distinguished Senator from North Carolina \nholler, ``Up, up and away, the debt.'' The national debt has gone to \nsome $5.2 trillion. I remember well when President Reagan came to \noffice, it wasn't even $1 trillion.\n  We had 38 Presidents of the United States, Republican and Democrat, \n200 years of history, and never a trillion-dollar debt, with the cost \nof all the wars--Revolutionary, 1812--right on up--Civil War, Spanish \nAmerican, World War I, II, Korea, Vietnam, with the cost of all the \nwars, we had not gotten to a trillion-dollar debt.\n  Now, without the cost of a war, in 15 years we have gone to $5.2 \ntrillion. And, as a result, we are raising taxes a billion dollars a \nday. I use that expression, ``raising taxes a billion dollars a day,'' \nadvisedly for the simple reason is, Mr. President, you have to pay the \ninterest costs. They say there are two things in life unavoidable: \ndeath and taxes. Make it a third: interest costs on the national debt. \nWe have to pay that. Republicans and Democrats vote every time to pay \nthe interest costs on the national debt.\n  So that is a billion a day for nothing. That is not for schools. That \nis not for defense. That is not for education or housing or the \nenvironment. You don't get anything for that. You are just paying for \nthe past profligacies of these Congresses. That is problem No. 1.\n  Problem No. 2 is barely mentioned, and I speak advisedly about jobs, \nbecause I have been in the game. I didn't come here as a neophyte. We \ncan start off 37 years ago. When I took office, we had an agriculture \nState. When I left, we had an industrial State.\n  Anybody connected with the history of our great State of South \nCarolina will tell you the technical training program that we \ninstituted is a big attraction for industrial investment and expansion, \nperiod, for South Carolina, New Hampshire, or anywhere else. I offered \nGovernor Sununu in the Presidential race in the early eighties to come \nup there and institute my technical training, but New Hampshire wanted \nto leave it to the industries.\n  I talked to my friends at Wang, in, Nashua. I said, I don't see how \nyou expect any expansion except to run away from the taxes in Boston, \ncoming up Highway 128, or whatever it is, to get out of the taxes in \nthat beautiful State of New Hampshire, which everyone will agree is one \nof the most beautiful in the entire Nation.\n  But be that as it may, we are not just talking philosophically as an \neconomist or anything else, we are talking business sense. I have \nworked firsthand with the chairmen of the boards, the vice chairmen, \ncome on down to No. 6 man who really has to get the operation in the \nblack. That is the gentleman or lady that counts. And when you give \nthem a spread sheet and you tell them the hourly wages and how it is \ngoing to come out, when they break ground, when the plant will be \ncomplete, you can get in operation in 7 months or a year or less, \nwhatever it is, you are beginning to talk sense, and that is the way we \nwork at it.\n  Right to the point, our poor friends in Alabama went totally \noverboard. In Alabama, they paid over $300 million to get Mercedes \nBenz. I was in that competition. I will never forget meeting with the \nMercedes executives. I carried them down to South Carolina to Bosch, \nand at Bosch, I showed them where they not only were making the fuel \ninjectors, but they were making the antilock brakes for the Mercedes \nBenz. They were making the antilock brakes for the Toyota, for all Ford \ncars and all General Motors cars.\n\n  I showed them a good little country boy from Dorchester County who \nhad been trained in our technical training system, sent to Stuttgart \nand learned the German apprenticeship system and was instructing in \nCharleston, SC, the German apprentice system.\n  The man from Mercedes said, ``This is what we want. We are looking \nfor a port. We are looking for the skills.'' But the great executives \nback in Germany were looking for money, so we lost out on that one.\n  I only introduce that because these rat-a-tat talks about ``I'm for \njobs, I'm for jobs,'' they don't know anything about the retaining, \nanything about the work in trying to get the job there, keep the job \nthere and get the expansion, which we are doing in South Carolina.\n  Having said that, Mr. President, I notice my distinguished friend had \nto talk almost defensively. He said, ``Wait a minute, I'm not trying to \nput up a wall or anything else.'' It is very unfortunate I have to do \nthe same thing. I am speaking defensively trying to qualify as you \nmight a witness in a case, because this is the real case of the United \nStates of America and nobody wants to try it, Republican or Democrat. \nOh, no, they want to ignore it.\n  Let me go right to the heart of the matter. Yes, in the cold war, we \nhad to sacrifice our industrial backbone in order to spread capitalism \nand bring about freedom in the Pacific rim and we used the Marshall \nplan to rebuild Europe, and it worked. Nobody is complaining about that \nsacrifice.\n  I used to testify back in the fifties before the old International \nTrade Commission--International Tariff it was called at that particular \ntime. They said, ``Governor, what do you expect these emerging \ncountries to make, the airplanes and the computers?'' Let them make the \nclothing and the shoes. That is why 86 percent of the shoes on this \nfloor are imported; 66 percent, two-thirds of the clothing you are \nlooking at is imported.\n  So I said, ``Yes, you have to give the lesser skilled jobs to the \nemerging countries,'' but we have done that. As my friend, Senator \nDole, says, ``Been there, done that.'' So all right, it worked.\n  Now we are into a global competition, and who is making the computers \nand who is making the airplanes? Our competitors. So don't come now \nwith this argument about we are rebuilding the world. We have to \nrebuild the United States. Our standard of living has gone out of the \nwindow.\n  You cannot be a world power--let's talk security and national \ndefense--you cannot be a world power unless you are a manufacturing \npower. Ten years ago, we had 26 percent of our work force in \nmanufacturing. We almost had half at the end of the war. That is what \nwon the war.\n  I spent 3 years overseas in World War II. Yes, we had brave soldiers. \nThese people are talking about the veterans' record. But Rosie the \nRiveter won World War II. We inundated them. I can see me now saying, \n``Send those planes. Keep sending them.'' They kept shooting them down, \nbut we had more. Building No. 1 down in Marietta, GA, was spitting out \nfive B-29's a day.\n  Rosie the Riveter, our industrial backbone, won World War II, and we \nare losing world war III, the economic war, because instead of now \ngoing from half to 26 percent 10 years ago, today we are down to 13 \npercent.\n  That up east Harvard group would give that lecture, ``small is \nbeautiful, service economy,'' all these here nonsensical arguments. And \nwe are going to the poorhouse. That is why real wages have dropped 20 \npercent in the last 20 years, for the simple reason that the big \nmultinationals have increased their profits by moving offshore.\n  Mr. President, we are competing with ourselves. Mark it down. I am \nnot worried about Japan. I am not here to bash Japan. I am here to bash \nme, us, you, the Congress, the silly policy. What we have in \nmanufacturing is the cost of labor is 30 percent of volume. And we know \nit is a given. We had many witnesses testify to that in our particular \nhearings, that you can save as much as 20 percent of volume of sales by \nmoving offshore to a low-wage country.\n  Take a company, a manufacturer with $500 million in sales, they can \nkeep the head office, the sales force here in America; but they can \nmove their manufacturing offshore and make $100 million at 20 percent \nor they can continue to work their own people and go bankrupt, because \nthat is the competition. Do not talk about the global competition. I am \ntalking about the fellow next door that has already moved.\n  When you come up here, they dance around hollering, ``retrain, \nretrain, retrain.'' I want to say a word about that to get it on the \nrecord, because we know about training. We do not have to wait on \nWashington to get us industrial expansion in South Carolina.\n  But Oneita Mills closed recently in South Carolina. We had 487 jobs \nmaking these T-shirts. We got that 35 years ago, a beautiful little \nplant, wonderful\n\n[[Page S10173]]\n\nworkers. The average age there was 47 years of age, Mr. President. \nRetrain them. Do it Secretary Reich's way, the Secretary of Labor. Go \nahead and retrain them; and tomorrow morning give me 487 expert \ncomputer operators. Are you going to hire the 47-year-old computer \noperator or the 20- or 21-year-old computer operator? To ask the \nquestion is to answer it. You are not going to take on the health \ncosts, the retirement costs of the 47-year-old.\n  You can keep on retraining them. They are out in this little rural \ntown, scavenging, trying to make enough money, where their husbands \nprobably were in the tobacco allotment. They want to cut that out. \nTogether they work and save enough money to send the boy to Clemson. I \nam seeing it happening, and I am coming around here hearing ``skills, \nskills.'' We have skills. Do not give me that. I have skills coming out \nof my ear.\n  And do not give me any of these other arguments they are talking \nabout, product liability, and all of these other silly--why do you \nthink we have Hoffmann La Roche and BMW. And go right on down. And we \nhave now 50 Japanese plants. I have almost 100 German plants, a bunch \nof British plants. Michelin--the French--they just announced another \nexpansion. I remember calling on them in Paris in 1961. Now they are \ngoing up to 11,600 employees, Senator, with their North American \nheadquarters in Greenville, SC. I got Bowater; I have got their North \nAmerican plant in Greenville, S.C. So let us get on with what the \nSenator from North Dakota wants to talk about, and that is, these \nfreebies that are being given out to continue a policy that was well-\nconceived in order to spread capitalism and defeat communism in the \ncold war. We have won that war.\n  Now we look around, and we have sacrificed the working people of \nAmerica, and our standard of living. And the job is for you and I to be \nrealistic and start building it back up. And do not come--I can hear it \nnow, because I can tell you, Senator, once they chose Pat Choate, you \nare going to find the multinationals, they are going to come down here \non your necks and heads around here, ``free trade, free trade, \nprotectionism, protectionism, protectionism.''\n  Let me plead guilty. I am a protectionist. We have the Army to \nprotect us against the enemies from without. We have the FBI to protect \nus from the enemies within. We have Social Security to protect us from \nthe ravages of old age, Medicare to protect us in ill health. The \nfundamentals of government, that is what we are up here for.\n\n  I remember when Ronald Reagan was sworn in in the rotunda. He raised \nhis hand to preserve, protect, and defend. And when we came back down \nhere on the Senate floor and started talking about it, he said, ``Oh, \nno, we don't want to be protectionist.'' You darn right I want to \nprotect our industrial backbone, our standard of living, and the jobs \nof America. And I want a competitive trade policy. We are not \ncompeting. We have been taken over by a fifth column within the ranks \nin this land of ours.\n  Remember, we heard this same argument about comparative advantage and \nfree trade from David Ricardo in the earliest, earliest of days. Or the \nBrits, once we got our freedom, they said, ``Now, just you little \nfledgling nation, the United States of America, you trade back with the \nmother country with what you produce best, and we will trade back with \nwhat we produce best,'' the doctrine of comparative advantage, free \ntrade, free trade, free trade. And you know what Alexander Hamilton \nsaid? He wrote it in a little booklet, ``Reports on Manufacturers.'' \nGet a copy of it. There is one left. It is on guard over there at the \nLibrary of Congress where I hope to be tonight because they have a \nwonderful reading going on over there. But this is even again more \nimportant.\n  And in the ``Reports on Manufacturers,'' Alexander Hamilton told the \nBrits in one line, ``Bug off. We are not going to remain your colony. \nWe are not going to continue to ship our agricultural products, our \ntimber, our iron, our coal, and bring in your manufactured products. \nYou have to be a nation State. You have to have a preeminence in \nmanufacturing.''\n  The second bill, Mr. President, on July 4, 1789, that actually passed \nthis Congress was a protectionist bill, setting a 50-percent tariff on \n60 some articles going on down the list. And we built this United \nStates of America, this economic giant with protectionism.\n  Abraham Lincoln, when he was going to get the transcontinental \nrailroad--that same type of crowd is buzzing around us here tonight; \nand they will be around tomorrow; and they will say, go ahead and let \nus have free trade, free trade--they told President Lincoln that we \nshould get the steel from England. He said no. He would build our own \nsteel mills. When they got through, they had not only the \ntranscontinental railroad, but they had their own steal capacity.\n  And so it was in the Depression, in the darkest days. Franklin \nRoosevelt came in with his competitive free trade under Cordell Hull. \nAnd Dwight David Eisenhower, in 1955, put quotas on imported oil \nbecause we had to sort of build up our capacity. And we have done that \nfrom time to time. And now is a time again when we survey the horizon, \nand start talking as realists. And quit giving us these symbolic \nbaloneys, malarkeys such as Smoot-Hawley.\n  Mr. President, right to the point, I ask unanimous consent--I am \ntrying to save time here--I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record the record made by our distinguished former colleague, \nSenator John Heinz of Pennsylvania entitled ``The Myth of Smoot-\nHawley'' back in 1983.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        The Myth of Smoot-Hawley\n\n       Mr. Heinz. Mr. President, every time someone in the \n     administration or the Congress gives a speech about a more \n     aggressive trade policy or the need to confront our trading \n     partners with their subsidies, barriers to import and other \n     unfair practices, others, often in the academic community or \n     in the Congress immediately react with speeches on the return \n     of Smoot-Hawley and the dark days of blatant protectionism. \n     ``Smoot-Hawley,'' for those uninitiated in this arcane field, \n     is the Tariff Act of 1930 (Public Law 71-361) which among \n     other things imposed significant increases on a large number \n     of items in the Tariff Schedules. The act has also been, for \n     a number of years, the basis of our countervailling duty law \n     and a number of other provisions relating to unfair trade \n     practices, a fact that tends to be ignored when people talk \n     about the evils of Smoot-Hawley.\n       A return to Smoot-Hawley, of course, is intended to mean a \n     return to depression, unemployment, poverty, misery, and even \n     war, all of which apparently were directly caused by this \n     awful piece of legislation. Smoot-Hawley has thus become a \n     code word for protectionism, and in turn a code word for \n     depression and major economic disaster. Those who sometimes \n     wonder at the ability of Congress to change the country's \n     direction through legislation must marvel at the sea change \n     in our economy apparently wrought by this single bill in \n     1930.\n       Historians and economists, who usually view these things \n     objectively, realize that the truth is a good deal more \n     complicated, that the causes of the Depression were far \n     deeper, and that the link between high tariffs and economic \n     disaster is much more tenuous than is implied by this \n     simplistic linkage. Now, however, someone has dared to \n     explode this myth publicly through an economic analysis of \n     the actual tariff increases in the act and their effects in \n     the early years of the Depression. The study points out that \n     the increases in question affected only 231 million dollars' \n     worth of products in the second half of 1930, significantly \n     less than 1 percent of world trade; that in 1930-32 duty-free \n     imports into the United States dropped at virtually the same \n     percentage rate as dutiable imports; and that a 13.5 percent \n     drop in GNP in 1930 can hardly be blamed on a single piece of \n     legislation that was not even enacted until midyear.\n       This, of course, in not to suggest that high tariffs are \n     good or that Smoot-Hawley was a wise piece of legislation. It \n     was not. But it was also clearly not responsible for all the \n     ills of the 1930's that are habitually blamed on it by those \n     who fancy themselves defenders of free trade. While I believe \n     this study does have some policy implications, which I may \n     want to discuss at some future time, one of the most useful \n     things it may do is help us all clean up our rhetoric and \n     reflect a more sophisticated--and accurate--view of economic \n     history.\n       Mr. President, I ask that the study, by Don Bedell of \n     Bedell Associates, be printed in the Record.\n       The study follows:\n\n\n                                            Bedell Associates,\n\n                                   Palm Desert, Calif., April 1983\n\n   Tariffs Miscast as Villain in Bearing Blame for Great Depression--\n                        Smoot/Hawley Exonerated\n\n                         (By Donald W. Bedell)\n\n\n             smoot/hawley, depression and world revolution\n\n       It has recently become fashionable for media reporters, \n     editorial writers here and\n\n[[Page S10174]]\n\n     abroad, economists, Members of Congress, members of foreign \n     governments, UN organizations and a wide variety of scholars \n     to express the conviction that the United States, by the \n     single act of causing the Tariff Act of 1930 to become law \n     (Public Law 361 of the 71st Congress) plunged the world into \n     an economic depression, may well have prolonged it, led to \n     Hitler and World War II.\n       Smoot/Hawley lifted import tariffs into the U.S. for a \n     cross section of products beginning mid-year 1930, or more \n     than 8 months following the 1929 financial collapse. Many \n     observers are tempted simply repeat ``free trade'' economic \n     doctrine by claiming that this relatively insignificant \n     statute contained an inherent trigger mechanism which upset a \n     neatly functioning world trading system based squarely on the \n     theory of comparative economics, and which propelled the \n     world into a cataclysm of unmeasurable proportions.\n       We believe that sound policy development in international \n     trade must be based solidly on facts as opposed to \n     suspicious, political or national bias, or ``off-the-cuff'' \n     impressions 50 to 60 years later of how certain events may \n     have occurred.\n       When pertinent economic, statistical and trade data are \n     carefully examined will they show, on the basis of \n     preponderance of fact, that passage of the Act did in fact \n     trigger or prolong the Great Depression of the Thirties, that \n     it had nothing to do with the Great Depression, or that it \n     represented a minor response of a desperate nation to a giant \n     world-wide economic collapse already underway?\n       It should be recalled that by the time Smoot/Hawley was \n     passed 6 months had elapsed of 1930 and 8 months had gone by \n     since the economic collapse in October, 1929. Manufacturing \n     plants were already absorbing losses, agriculture surpluses \n     began to accumulate, the spectre of homes being foreclosed \n     appeared, and unemployment showed ominous signs of a \n     precipitous rise.\n       The country was stunned, as was the rest of the world. All \n     nations sought very elusive solutions. Even by 1932, and the \n     Roosevelt election, improvisation and experiment described \n     government response and the technique of the New Deal, in the \n     words of Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. in a New York Times article \n     on April 10, 1983. President Roosevelt himself is quoted in \n     the article as saying in the 1932 campaign, ``It is common \n     sense to take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it \n     frankly and try another. But above all, try something.''\n       The facts are that, rightly or wrongly, there were no major \n     Roosevelt Administration initiatives regarding foreign trade \n     until well into his Administration; thus clearly suggesting \n     that initiatives in that sector were not thought to be any \n     more important than the Hoover Administration thought them. \n     However, when all the numbers are examined we believe \n     neither. President Hoover nor President Roosevelt can be \n     faulted for placing international trade's role in world \n     economy near the end of a long list of sectors of the economy \n     that had caused chaos and suffering and therefore needed \n     major corrective legislation.\n       How important was international trade to the U.S.? How \n     important was U.S. trade to its partners in the Twenties and \n     Thirties?\n       In 1919, 66% of U.S. imports were duty free, or $2.9 \n     Billion of a total of $4.3 Billion. Exports amounted to $5.2 \n     Billion in that year making a total trade number of $9.6 \n     Billion or about 14% of the world's total.

When account is taken of the fact \n     that only 33%, or $1.5 Billion, of U.S. imports was in the \n     Dutiable category, the entire impact of Smoot/Hawley has to \n     be focused on the $1.5 Billion number which is barely 1.5% of \n     U.S. GNP and 4% of world imports.\n       What was the impact? In dollars Dutiable imports fell by \n     $462 Million, or from $1.5 Billion to $1.0 Billion, during \n     1930. It's difficult to determine how much of that small \n     number occurred in the second half of 1930 but the \n     probability is that it was less than 50%. In any case, the \n     total impact of Smoot/Hawley in 1930 was limited to a \n     ``damage'' number of $231 Million; spread over several \n     hundred products and several hundred countries.\n       A further analysis of imports into the U.S. discloses that \n     all European countries accounted for 30% or $1.3 Billion in \n     1929 divided as follows: U.K. at $330 Million or 7\\1/2\\%, \n     France at $171 Million or 3.9%, Germany at $255 Million or \n     5.9%, and some 15 other nations accounting for $578 Million \n     or 13.1% for an average of 1%.\n       These numbers suggest that U.S. imports were spread broadly \n     over a great array of products and countries, so that any \n     tariff action would by definition have only a quite modest \n     impact in any given year or could be projected to have any \n     important cumulative effect.\n       This same phenomenon is apparent for Asian countries which \n     accounted for 29% of U.S. imports divided as follows: China \n     at 3.8%, Japan at $432 Million and 9.8% and with some 20 \n     other countries sharing in 15% or less than 1% on average.\n       Australia's share was 1.3% and all African countries sold \n     2.5% of U.S. imports.\n       Western Hemisphere countries provided some 37% of U.S. \n     imports with Canada at 11.4%, Cuba at 4.7%, Mexico at 2.7%, \n     Brazil at 4.7% and all others accounting for 13.3% or about \n     1% each.\n       The conclusion appears inescapable on the basis of these \n     numbers; a potential adverse impact of $231 Million spread \n     over the great array of imported products which were \n     available in 1929 could not realistically have had any \n     measurable impact on America's trading partners.\n       Meanwhile, the Gross National Product (GNP) in the United \n     States had dropped an unprecedented 13.5% in 1930 alone, from \n     $103.4 Billion in 1929 to $89 Billion by the end of 1930. It \n     is unrealistic to expect that a shift in U.S. international \n     imports of just 1.6% of U.S. GNP in 1930, for example ($231 \n     Million or $14.4 Billion) could be viewed as establishing a \n     ``precedent'' for America's trading partners to follow, or \n     represented a ``model'' to follow.\n       Even more to the point an impact of just 1.6% could not \n     reasonably be expected to have any measurable effect on the \n     economic health of America's trading partners.\n       Note should be taken of the claim by those who repeat the \n     Smoot/Hawley ``villain'' theory that it set off a ``chain'' \n     reaction around the world. While there is some evidence that \n     certain of America's trading partners retaliated against the \n     U.S. there can be no reliance placed on the assertion that \n     those same trading partners retaliated against each other by \n     way of showing anger and frustration with the U.S. Self-\n     interest alone would dictate otherwise, common sense would \n     intercede on the side of avoidance of ``shooting oneself in \n     the foot,'' and the facts disclose that world trade declined \n     by 18% by the end of 1930 while U.S. trade declined by some \n     10% more or 28%. U.S. foreign trade continued to decline by \n     10% more through 1931, or 53% versus 43% for worldwide trade, \n     but U.S. share of world trade declined by only 18% from 14% \n     to 11.3% by the end of 1931.\n       Reference was made earlier to the Duty Free category of \n     U.S. imports. What is especially significant about those \n     import numbers is the fact that they dropped in dollars by an \n     almost identical percentage as did Dutiable goods through \n     1931 and beyond: Duty Free imports declined by 29% in 1930 \n     versus 27% for Dutiable goods, and by the end of 1931 the \n     numbers were 52% versus 51% respectively.\n       The only rational explanation for this phenomenon is that \n     Americans were buying less and prices were falling. No basis \n     exists for any claim that Smoot/Hawley had a distinctively \n     devastating effect on imports beyond and separate from the \n     economic impact of the economic collapse in 1929.\n       Based on the numbers examined so far, Smoot/Hawley is \n     clearly a mis-cast villain. Further, the numbers suggest the \n     clear possibility that when compared to the enormity of the \n     developing international economic crisis Smoot/Hawley had \n     only a minimal impact and international trade was a victim of \n     the Great Depression.\n       This possibility will become clear when the course of the \n     Gross National Product (GNP) during 1929-1933 is examined and \n     when price behaviour world-wide is reviewed, and when \n     particular Tariff Schedules of Manufacturers outlined in the \n     legislation are analyzed.\n       Before getting to that point another curious aspect of the \n     ``villain'' theory is worthy of note. Without careful \n     recollection it is tempting to view a period of our history \n     some 50-60 years ago in terms of our present world. Such a \n     superficial view not only makes no contribution to \n     constructive policy-making. It overlooks several vital \n     considerations which characterized the Twenties and Thirties:\n       1. The international trading system of the Twenties bears \n     no relation to the interdependent world of the Eighties \n     commercially, industrially and financially in size or \n     complexity.\n       2. No effective international organization existed, similar \n     to the General Agreement for Tariffs and Trade (GATT) for \n     example for resolution of disputes. There were no trade \n     ``leaders'' among the world's nations in part because most \n     mercantile nations felt more comfortable without dispute \n     settlement bodies.\n       3. Except for a few critical products foreign trade was not \n     generally viewed in the ``economy-critical'' context as \n     currently in the U.S. As indicated earlier neither President \n     Hoover nor President Roosevelt viewed foreign trade as \n     crucial to the economy in general or recovery in particular.\n       4. U.S. foreign trade was relatively an amorphous \n     phenomenon quite unlike the highly structured system of the \n     Eighties; characterized largely then by ``caveat emptor'' and \n     a broadly laissez-faire philosophy generally unacceptable \n     presently.\n       These characteristics, together with the fact that 66 \n     percent of U.S. imports were Duty Free in 1929 and beyond, \n     placed overall international trade for Americans in the \n     Twenties and Thirties on a very low level of priority \n     especially against the backdrop of world-wide depression. \n     Americans in the\n\n[[Page S10175]]\n\n     Twenties and Thirties could no more visualize the world of \n     the Eighties than we in the Eighties can legitimately hold \n     them responsible for failure by viewing their world in other \n     than the most pragmatic and realistic way given those \n     circumstances.\n       For those Americans then, and for us now, the numbers \n     remain the same. On the basis of sheer order of magnitude of \n     the numbers illustrated so far, the ``villain'' theory often \n     attributed to Smoot/Hawley is an incorrect reading of history \n     and a misunderstanding of the basic and incontrovertible law \n     of cause and effect.\n       It should also now be recalled that, despite heroic efforts \n     by U.S. policy-makers its GNP continued to slump year-by-year \n     and reached a total of just $55.4 billion in 1933 for a total \n     decline from 1929 levels of 46 percent. The financial \n     collapse of October, 1920 had indeed left its mark.\n       By 1933 the 1929 collapse had prompted formation in the \n     U.S. of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, Federal Home \n     Loan Bank Board, brought in a Democrat President with a \n     program to take control of banking, provide credit to \n     property owners and corporations in financial difficulties, \n     relief to farmers, regulation and stimulation of business, \n     new labor laws and social security legislation.\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ Beard, Charles and Mary, New Basic History of the United \n     States.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       So concerned were American citizens about domestic economic \n     affairs, including the Roosevelt Administration and the \n     Congress, that scant attention was paid to the solitary \n     figure of Secretary of State Cordell Hull. He, alone among \n     the Cabinet, was convinced that international trade had \n     material relevance to lifting the country back from \n     depression. His efforts to liberalize trade in general and to \n     find markets abroad for U.S. products in particular from \n     among representatives of economically stricken Europe, Asia \n     and Latin America were abruptly ended by the President and \n     the 1933 London Economic Conference collapsed without result.\n       The Secretary did manage to make modest contributions to \n     eventual trade recovery through the Most Favored Nation (MFN) \n     concept. But it would be left for the United States at the \n     end of World War II to undertake an economic and political \n     role of leadership in the world; a role which in the Twenties \n     and Thirties Americans in and out of government felt no need \n     to assume, and did not assume. Evidence that conditions in \n     the trade world would have been better, or even different, \n     had the U.S. attempted some leadership role cannot \n     responsibly be assembled. Changing the course of past history \n     has always been less fruitful than applying perceptively \n     history's lessons.\n       The most frequently used members thrown out about Smoot/\n     Hawley's impact by those who believe in the ``villain'' \n     theory are those which clearly establish that U.S. dollar \n     decline in foreign trade plummeted by 66 percent by the end \n     of 1933 from 1929 levels, $9.6 billion to $3.2 billion \n     annually.\n       Much is made of the co-incidence that world-wide trade also \n     sank about 66 percent for the period.

Even the data already presented suggest the \n     relative irrelevance of the tariff-raising Act on a strictly \n     trade numbers basis. When we examine the role of a world-wide \n     price decline in the trade figures for almost every product \n     made or commodity grown the ``villain'' Smoot/Hawley's impact \n     will not be measurable.\n       It may be relevant to note here that the world's trading \n     ``system'' paid as little attention to America's revival of \n     foreign trade beginning in 1934 as it did to American trade \n     policy in the early Thirties. From 1934 through 1939 U.S. \n     foreign trade rose in dollars by 80% compared to world-wide \n     growth of 15%. Imports grew by 68% and exports climbed by a \n     stunning 93%. U.S. GNP by 1939 had developed to $91 billion, \n     to within 88% of its 1929 level.\n       Perhaps this suggests that America's trading partners were \n     more vulnerable to an economic collapse and thus much less \n     resilient than was the U.S. In any case the international \n     trade decline beginning as a result of the 1929 economic \n     collapse, and the subsequent return by the U.S. beginning in \n     1934 appear clearly to have been wholly unrelated to Smoot/\n     Hawley.\n       As we begin to analyze certain specific Schedules appearing \n     in the Tariff Act of 1930 it should be noted that sharp \n     erosion of prices world-wide caused dollar volumes in trade \n     statistics to drop rather more than unit-volume thus \n     emphasizing the decline value. In addition, it must be \n     remembered that as the Great Depression wore on, people \n     simply bought less of everything increasing further price \n     pressure downward. All this wholly apart from Smoot/Hawley.\n       When considering specific Schedules, No. 5 which includes \n     Sugar, Molasses, and Manufactures Of, maple sugar cane, \n     sirups, adonite, dulcite, galactose, inulin, lactose and \n     sugar candy. Between 1929 and 1933 import volume into the \n     U.S. declined by about 40% in dollars. In price on a world \n     basis producers suffered a stunning 60% drop. Volume of sugar \n     imports declined by only 42% into the U.S. in tons. All these \n     changes lend no credibility to the ``villain'' theory unless \n     one assumes, erroneously, that the world price of sugar was \n     so delicately balanced that a 28% drop in sugar imports by \n     tons into the U.S. in 1930 destroyed the price structure and \n     that the decline was caused by tariffs and not at least \n     shared by decreased purchases by consumers in the U.S. and \n     around the world.\n       Schedule 4 describes Wood and Manufactures Of, timber hewn, \n     maple, brier root, cedar from Spain, wood veneer, hubs for \n     wheels, casks, boxes, reed and rattan, tooth-picks, porch \n     furniture, blinds and clothes pins among a great variety of \n     product categories. Dollar imports into the U.S. slipped by \n     52% from 1929 to 1933. By applying our own GNP as a \n     reasonable index of prices both at home and overseas, unit \n     volume decreased only 6% since GNP had dropped by 46% in \n     1933. The world-wide price decline did not help profitability \n     of wood product makers, but to tie that modest decline in \n     volume to a law affecting only 6\\1/2\\% of U.S. imports in \n     1929 puts great stress on credibility, in terms of harm done \n     to any one country or group of countries.\n       Schedule 9, Cotton Manufactures, a decline of 54% in \n     dollars is registered for the period, against a drop of 46% \n     in price as reflected in the GNP number. On the assumption \n     that U.S. GNP constituted a rough comparison to world prices, \n     and the fact that U.S. imports of these products was \n     infinitesimal, Smoot/Hawley was irrelevant. Further, the \n     price of raw cotton in the world plunged 50% from 1929 to \n     1933. U.S. growers had to suffer the consequences of that low \n     price but the price itself was set by world market prices, \n     and was totally unaffected by any tariff action by the U.S.\n       Schedule 12 deals with Silk Manufactures, a category which \n     decreased by some 60% in dollars. While the decrease amounted \n     to 14% more than the GNP drop, volume of product remained \n     nearly the same during the period. Assigning responsibility \n     to Smoot/Hawley for this very large decrease in price \n     beginning in 1930 stretches credibility beyond the breaking \n     point.\n       Several additional examples of price behaviour are \n     relevant.\n       One is Schedule 2 products which include brick and tile. \n     Another is Schedule 3 iron and steel products. One \n     outstanding casualty of the financial collapse in October, \n     1929 was the Gross Private Investment number. From $16.2 \n     Billion annually in 1939 by 1933 it has fallen by 91% to just \n     $1.4 Billion. No tariff policy, in all candor, could have so \n     devastated an industry as did the economic collapse of 1929. \n     For all intents and purposes construction came to a halt and \n     markets for glass, brick and steel products with it.\n       Another example of price degradation world-wide completely \n     unrelated to tariff policy is Petroleum products. By 1933 \n     these products had decreased in world price by 82% but Smott/\n     Hawley had no Petroleum Schedule. The world market place set \n     the price.\n       Another example of price erosion in world market is \n     contained in the history of exported cotton goods from the \n     United States. Between 1929 and 1933 the volume of exported \n     goods actually increased by 13.5% while the dollar value \n     dropped 48%. This result was wholly unrelated to the tariff \n     policy of any country.\n       While these examples do not include all Schedules of Smoot/\n     Hawley they clearly suggest that overwhelming economic and \n     financial forces were at work affecting supply and demand and \n     hence on prices of all products and commodities and that \n     these forces simply obscured any measurable impact the Tariff \n     Act of 1930 might possibly have had under conditions of \n     several years earlier.\n       To assert otherwise puts on those proponents of the Smoot/\n     Hawley ``villian'' theory a formidable challenge to explain \n     the following questions:\n       1. What was the nature of the ``trigger'' mechanism in the \n     Act that set off the alleged domino phenomenon in 1930 that \n     began or prolonged the Great Depression when implementation \n     of the Act did not begin until mid-year?\n       2. In what ways was the size and nature of U.S. foreign \n     trade in 1929 so significant and critical to the world \n     economy's health that a less than 4% swing in U.S. imports \n     could be termed a crushing and devastating blow?\n       3. On the basis of what economic theory can the Act be said \n     to have caused a GNP drop of an astounding drop of 13.5% in \n     1930 when the Act was only passed in mid-1930? DId the entire \n     decline take place in the second half of 1930? Did world-wide \n     trade begin its decline of some $13 Billion only in the \n     second half of 1930?\n       4. Does the fact that duty free imports into the U.S. \n     dropped in 1930 and 1931 and in 1932 at the same percentage \n     rate as dutiable imports support the view that Smoot/Hawley \n     was the cause of the decline in U.S. imports?\n       4. Is the fact that world wide trade declined less rapidly \n     than did U.S. foreign trade prove the assertion that American \n     trading partners retaliated against each other as well as \n     against the U.S. because and subsequently held the U.S. \n     accountable for starting an international trade war?\n       5. Was the international trading system of the Twenties so \n     delicately balanced that a\n\n[[Page S10176]]\n\n     single hastily drawn tariff increase bill affecting just $231 \n     Million of dutiable products in the second half of 1930 began \n     a chain reaction that scuttled the entire system? Percentage-\n     wise $231 Million is but 0.65% of all of 1929 world-wide \n     trade and just half that of world-wide imports.\n       The preponderance of history and facts of economic life in \n     the international area make an affirmative response by the \n     ``villain'' proponents an intolerable burden.\n       It must be said that the U.S. does offer a tempting target \n     for Americans who incessantly cry ``mea culpa'' over all the \n     world's problems, and for many among our trading partners to \n     explain their problems in terms of perceived American \n     inability to solve those problems.\n       In the world of the Eighties U.S. has indeed very serious \n     and perhaps grave responsibility to assume leadership in \n     international trade and finance, and in politics as well.\n       On the record, the United States has met that challenge \n     beginning shortly after World War II.\n       The U.S. role in structuring the United Nations, the \n     General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the \n     International Monetary Fund, the Bretton Woods and Dumbarton \n     Oaks Conference on monetary policy, the World Bank and \n     various Regional Development Banks, for example, is a record \n     unparalleled in the history of mankind.\n       But in the Twenties and Thirties there was no acknowledged \n     leader in International affairs. On the contrary, evidence \n     abounds that most nations preferred the centuries-old \n     patterns of international trade which emphasized pure \n     competition free from interference by any effective \n     international supervisory body such as GATT.\n       Even in the Eighties examples abound of trading nations \n     succumbing to nationalistic tendencies and ignoring signed \n     trade agreements. Yet the United States continues as the \n     bulwark in trade liberalization proposals within the GATT. It \n     does so not because it could not defend itself against any \n     kind of retaliation in a worst case scenario but because no \n     other nation is strong enough to support them successfully \n     without the United States.\n       The basic rules of GATT are primarily for all those \n     countries who can't protect themselves in the world of the \n     Eighties and beyond without rule of conduct and discipline.\n       The attempt to assign responsibility to the U.S. in the \n     Thirties for passing the Smoot/Hawley tariff act and thus set \n     off a chain reaction of international depression and war is, \n     on the basis of a prepondance of fact, a serious mis-reading \n     of history, a repeal of the basic concept of cause and effect \n     and a disregard for the principle of proportion of numbers.\n       It may constitute a fascinating theory for political \n     mischief-making but it is a cruel hoax on all those \n     responsible for developing new and imaginative measures \n     designed to liberalize international trade.\n       Such constructive development and growth is severely \n     impeded by perpetuating what is no more than a symbolic \n     economic myth.\n       Nothing is less worthwhile than attempting to re-write \n     history, not learning from it. Nothing is more worthwhile \n     than making careful and perceptive and objective analysis in \n     the hope that it may lead to an improved and liberalized \n     international trading system.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. One, Smoot-Hawley, Mr. President, was passed 8 months \nafter the crash. It could not have caused the crash we had that \noccurred in 1929. Smoot-Hawley was June 1930.\n  It only affected one-third of the trade. As is stated here, Alan \nWilliam Wolff, in ``Improving United States Trade Policy,'' ``Smoot-\nHawley was only half of that which had been put into effect by the \nFordney-McCumber Tariff Act of 1922. Even after enactment of Smoot-\nHawley, two-thirds of all U.S. imports, in value, entered the United \nStates duty-free.''\n  A statement, also, by the distinguished professor of economics at \nMIT, Paul Krugman, who just recently had an article, and we will get to \nthat--I did not realize this was coming up --in the London Economist \nrelative to monetary policy. He stated, in ``The Age of Diminished \nExpectations,'' ``In popular arguments against protectionism, the usual \nwarning is that protectionism threatens our jobs--the Smoot-Hawley \ntariff of 1931, we are told, caused the Depression, and history can \nrepeat itself.''\n\n       The claim that protectionism caused the Depression is \n     nonsense; the claim that future protectionism will lead to a \n     repeat performance is equally nonsensical.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, within 3 years in 1933 we had a plus balance of \ntrade. Trade at that time was only about 1 percent of our GNP. It is up \nto about 17 percent to 18 percent. It was not a factor, really, but \nthat is the false history that these politicians run around and they \nwill call the Senator from North Dakota ``Smoot,'' and they will call \nthe Senator from South Carolina ``Hawley.'' There they are on the floor \nagain. They are trying to get in protectionism and start a depression.\n  Mr. President, when they get to trade deficits, I have another \narticle that we want to have printed in the Record, because they all \ntalk, ``exports, exports, exports.'' They never want to talk about \nimports.\n  I want to have printed in the Record the merchandise trade deficits \nsince 1979, and I ask unanimous consent to have it printed in the \nRecord at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                  Merchandise trade deficit since 1979\n\n\n                                                                Billion\n1979..............................................................$27.6\n1980...............................................................25.5\n1981...............................................................28.0\n1982...............................................................36.0\n1983...............................................................67.1\n1984..............................................................112.5\n1985..............................................................122.2\n1986..............................................................145.1\n1987..............................................................159.6\n1988..............................................................127.0\n1989..............................................................115.0\n1990..............................................................109.0\n1991...............................................................73.8\n1992...............................................................96.1\n1993..............................................................132.6\n1994..............................................................166.1\n1995................................................................174\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it shows we lost 1.5 trillion bucks in \ndeficits. That means more imports than exports. I could get into the \nargument about exports creating 20,000 jobs. The Department of Commerce \nfinally revised that just 6 weeks ago. It is only 14,000 jobs. The \nexports are not the reason.\n  I am quoting from Business Week, September 2, just 8 days ago:\n\n       Indeed, exports are not the reason for the second quarter \n     deterioration in the trade deficit. That blame goes to \n     imports. Exports dipped 0.3 percent in June to $69.7 billion, \n     but much of the decline reflected a drop in the volatile \n     aircraft shipments. For the quarter, total exports rose at a \n     7.3 percent annual rate, up from 2.6 percent in the first \n     quarter.\n       So far, the dollar's recent strength has not forced \n     exporters to raise prices. Export prices fell 0.5 percent in \n     July and, excluding farm products and the soaring cost of \n     grain prices, are down 1.6 percent from a year ago. That plus \n     improving economies in Mexico and Canada should continue to \n     lift exports in coming months.\n       The story for imports is much less encouraging for growth. \n     Despite a 3.3 percent drop in imports in June, goods and \n     services from abroad in the second quarter still soared at a \n     13.9 percent annual rate, up from an already rapid 11.7 \n     percent gain in the first.\n\n  Rather than get into the whole article, every time I get to this \nparticular part of the debate they all want to talk exports, exports, \nand that is more or less like the octopus squirting oil on the troubled \nwaters and escaping in its own dark mist. Exports are not our problem; \nthey are our opportunity, and we have every office in the Lord's world \nworking with exports. I work with the Export Council and gave out the \nawards in my own backyard just this past month. But the truth is that \nit is imports and it is the deficit of $1.5 trillion in the last 12 to \n13 years.\n  Now, Mr. President, the competition, that is what we really want to \ntalk about. The competition is our sales. I remember these folks coming \nto me in the early days now that we have been in this game for at least \n35 years, and the export job creation myth--I use a figure in the \ndebate I got from the Department of Commerce of 41 percent back in \n1978, 41 percent of the imports in the United States were U.S. \ncompanies that moved their manufacturing offshore, and bringing it back \nin, the finished product. It was 41 percent then, and since that there \nhas been a deluge. But if you go over there, they give you the 41 \npercent.\n  I have been like a detective trying to get the truth out of that \ncrowd, but they are controlled. They are controlled on this particular \nscore, particularly when you make these joint ventures. You cannot go \ninto China. You cannot go into Japan. You cannot go into Indonesia \nunless you make a joint venture, and that part you have 49 and they \nhave 50 percent, and that part of your manufacturing, the 49 percent, \nis not counted in the figures. That is why we do not realize how we \nhave gone from some 26 percent in manufacturing 10 years ago down to 13 \npercent.\n  However, 50 percent of the U.S. exports come from 100 companies, 80 \npercent from 250 companies, a very small part. Our distinguished \ncolleague from North Dakota is talking about small\n\n[[Page S10177]]\n\nbusiness. These are the same companies, now, that have been the largest \ndownsizers.\n  Did you hear that right? Those are the ones who were talking about \ndownsizing. General Electric in 1985 had 243,000 jobs; in 1995, they \nare down to 150,000. IBM shaved 132,000 jobs in the last 10 years; it \nnow employs more people abroad than at home. Abroad is 116,000. We have \na foreign company--Mr. President, IBM is not a United States company \nany longer. They have more workers overseas, 116,000 and 111,000 here. \nIntel reduced U.S. employment last year 22,000, down to 17,000. General \nMotors in 1985 had 559,000 and are down to 314,000 last year.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at this point \nanother emphasis on this measure, and that is by William Greider on \nAugust 8, 1996, in the Rolling Stone, ``How the taxpayer-funded Export-\nImport Bank helps ship the jobs overseas.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            The Ex-Im Files\n\n\n  how the taxpayer-funded export-import bank helps ship jobs overseas\n\n                          (By William Greider)\n\n       Washington, D.C.--As the Nation's salesman in chief, Bill \n     Clinton looks like a smashing success. When Clinton came to \n     office, his long-term strategy for restoring American \n     prosperity had many facets, but the core of the plan could be \n     summarized in one word: exports. The U.S. economy would boom \n     or stagnate, it was assumed, depending on how American goods \n     fared in global markets. So the president mobilized the \n     government in pursuit of sales.\n       Flying squads of Cabinet officers, sometimes accompanied by \n     corporate CEOs, were dispatched to forage for buyers in \n     foreign capitals from Beijing to Jakarta. The Commerce \n     Department targeted 10 nations--India, Mexico and Brazil \n     among them--as the ``big emerging markets.'' Trade \n     negotiators hammered on Japan and China to buy more American \n     stuff. And two new agreements were completed--GATT and \n     NAFTA--to reduce foreign tariffs.\n       U.S. industrial exports have soared in the Clinton years, \n     from $396 billion during the recessionary trough of 1992 to \n     around $520 billion last year. And as this administration has \n     said time and again, more exports means more jobs--usually \n     good jobs with higher wages. In his fierce commitment to \n     trade, Clinton is not much different from Ronald Reagan, who \n     (notwithstanding his laissezfaire pretensions) also played \n     hardball on trade deals and, in some cases, intervened with \n     more effective results. George Bush, too, bargained on behalf \n     of corporate interests and played globe-trotting salesman. \n     Promoting exports and foreign investment is not a new idea; \n     it has enjoyed a bipartisan political consensus for decades.\n       What does seem to be new in American politics are the \n     thickening doubts among citizens and a rising chorus of \n     critics, informed and uninformed, who question Washington's \n     assumptions about exports. The conventional strategy, the \n     critics argue, may help the multinational companies turn \n     profits, but does it really serve American workers and the \n     broad public interest? The new realities of globalized \n     production play havoc with the old logic of exports-equal-\n     jobs. Sometimes it is the jobs that are exported, too.\n       This contradiction, usually covered up with platitudes and \n     doublespeak in political debate, becomes powerfully clear \n     when you look closely at the dealings of an obscure federal \n     agency located just across Lafayette Park from the White \n     House: the U.S. Export-Import Bank with only 440 civil \n     servants and a budget of less than $1 billion--small change \n     as Washington bureaucracies go.\n       Yet America's most important multinational corporations \n     devote solicitous attention to the Ex-Im Bank. Their \n     lobbyists shepherd its appropriation through Congress every \n     year and defend the agency against occasional attacks. \n     Why? The Ex-Im Bank provides U.S. corporations with \n     hundreds of millions of dollars each year in financial \n     grease that smooths their trade deals in the new global \n     economy.\n       This year, Ex-Im will pump our $744 million in taxpayer \n     subsidies to America's export producers, financing the below-\n     market loans and loan guarantees that help U.S. companies \n     sell aircraft, telecommunications equipment, electric power \n     turbines and other products--sometimes even entire \n     factories--to foreign markets. Since the biggest subsidies \n     always go to the largest corporations, skeptics in Congress \n     sometimes refer to Ex-Im as the Bank of Boeing. It might as \n     well be called the Bank of General Electric--or AT, IBM, \n     Caterpillar or other leading producers. Ex-Im's senior \n     officers call these firms ``the customers.''\n       But the banker-bureaucrats at Ex-Im see their main mission \n     as fostering American employment. ``Our motto is, Jobs \n     through exports,'' says James C. Cruse, vice president for \n     policy planning, ``Exports are not the end in itself, so we \n     don't care about the company and the company profits.'' That \n     was indeed the purpose when the bank was chartered as a \n     federal agency back in 1945 and the reason it has always \n     enjoyed broad support, including that of organized labor.\n       At this moment, the tiny agency is under intense pressure \n     from influential U.S. multinationals to change the rules of \n     the game. Specifically, the companies want taxpayer money to \n     subsidize the sale of products that aren't actually \n     manufactured in America. They want subsidies for products \n     that are not really U.S. exports, since companies ship them \n     from their factories abroad to buyers in other foreign \n     countries. If the rules aren't changed, the exporters warn, \n     they will lose major deals in the fierce global competition \n     and may be compelled to move still more of their production \n     offshore.\n       ``Global competitiveness, multinational sourcing and the \n     deindustrialization of the U.S.'' wrote Cruse in a policy \n     memo for the bank,'' were the three most common factors that \n     exporters cited as reasons to revise Ex-Im Bank's foreign \n     content policy. . . . U.S. companies need multisourcing to be \n     able to compete with foreign companies. Foreign buyers are \n     becoming more sophisticated and they are expressing certain \n     preferences for a particular item to be sourced foreign . . . \n     [and] U.S. suppliers may not always exist for a particular \n     good.''\n       In plainer language, foreign is usually cheaper--often \n     because the wages are much lower--and sometimes better. As \n     U.S. producers have begun to buy more hardware and machinery \n     overseas, the capacity to make the same components in the \n     United States has diminished or even disappeared. What the \n     companies want in Cruse's bureaucratic parlance, is ``broadly \n     based support for foreign-sourced components.''\n       As the complaints from American firms swelled in the last \n     few years, Ex-Im officials agreed to convene the Foreign \n     Content Policy Review Group to explore how the U.S. financing \n     rules might be relaxed. The review group's members include 11 \n     major exporters (General Electric, AT, Boeing, Caterpillar, \n     Raytheon, McDonnell Douglas and others) plus several labor \n     representatives from the AFL-CIO and the machinists' and \n     textile-workers' unions.\n       The Ex-Im Bank must decide who wins and who loses--a \n     fundamental argument over what is in the national \n     interest, give globalized business. The review group \n     discussions are couched in polite police talk, but they \n     speak directly to the economic anxieties of Americans. If \n     young workers worried about their livelihood could hear \n     what these powerful American companies are saying in \n     private, there would be many more sleepless nights in \n     manufacturing towns across this Nation. The information \n     below is taken from confidential Ex-Im Bank members that \n     were recently leaked to me. What these executives have to \n     say is not reassuring, but it's at least a more accurate \n     vision of the future than anything you are likely to hear \n     from this year's political candidates.\n       A decade ago the rule was simple: Ex-Im would not \n     underwrite any trade package that was not 100 percent U.S.-\n     made. Then and now Ex-Im scrutinizes the content of very \n     large export projects, item by item. to establish the \n     national origin of subcomponents. Any subcomponents produced \n     offshore must be shipped back to American factories to be \n     incorporated into the final assembly. If Caterpillar sells 10 \n     earthmoving machines to Indonesia all 10 of them have to come \n     out of a U.S. factory to get a U.S. subsidy, even if the \n     axles or engines were made abroad.\n       By the late 1980s, however, as major manufacturers pursued \n     globalization strategies that moved more of their production \n     offshore. Ex-Im, with labor approval opened the door. In 1987 \n     it agreed to finance deals with 15 percent foreign inside \n     content. Partial financing would also be provided for export \n     deals that involved at least 50 percent U.S. content.\n       Now the multinationals are back at the table again, \n     demanding still more latitude. The bank's rules, they \n     complain, have created a bureaucratic snarl that threatens \n     U.S. sales. These regulations are oblivious to the \n     complexities of modern trade which multinationals routinely \n     ``export'' and ``import'' huge volumes of goods internally--\n     that is among their own fur-flung subsidiaries or foreign \n     joint ventures.\n       The flavor of the company complaints is revealed in Ex-Im \n     Bank minutes of the review group's first meeting last \n     year, where various company managers sounded off about the \n     new global realities. David Wallbaum, from Caterpillar, \n     urged the bank to be ``more flexible in supporting foreign \n     content,'' according to the minutes, General Electric's \n     Selig S. Merber said GE needs ``access [to] worldwide \n     pricing.'' Merber proposed that instead of insisting on \n     American content item by item, Ex-Im look only at the U.S. \n     aggregate.\n       Lisa DeSoto of Fluor Daniel, one of America's largest \n     construction engineering firms, suggested in a follow-up memo \n     that Ex-Im subsidize ``procurement from the NAFTA \n     countries,'' Mexico and Canada as if the goods were from the \n     U.S.\n       But it was Angel Torres, a representative for AT, who \n     spoke more bluntly than the others, AT's foreign content \n     has grown in the last 10 years because the U.S. is becoming a \n     ``service-oriented society,'' Torres said, according to the \n     minutes. ``AT's priority,'' he declared, ``is to increase \n     the allowable percentage of foreign content.''\n       When I rang up these corporate managers and some others to \n     ask them to elaborate on their views, all of them ducked my \n     questions. The one exception was David L. Thornton, a manager \n     from Boeing, whose newest jetliner, the 777, actually \n     involves 30\n\n[[Page S10178]]\n\n     percent foreign content in the manufacturing process (mostly \n     from Japan). It still qualifies for full Ex-Im financing. \n     Thornton explained, because Boeing's original investment in \n     research and development also counts in the sales price. \n     ``Our general view of 75 percent is we can live with it for \n     the time being,'' Thornton said, ``but over time it probably \n     won't be adequate.''\n       The labor-union representatives, not surprisingly, choked \n     at the ominous implications of such comments--especially the \n     matter-of-fact references to America's de-industrialization. \n     Corporate leaders and politicians, after all, have been \n     celebrating the ``comeback'' of American manufacturing in the \n     1990s. Exports are booming, and U.S. competitiveness has \n     supposedly been restored, thanks to the corporate \n     restructurings and downsizings. Stock prices are rising, and \n     shareholders are happy again.\n       The private corporate view is not so cheery for the \n     employees. A memo from one multinational corporation (its \n     identity whited-out by Ex-Im bureaucrats) made it sound like \n     the demise of American manufacturing is already inevitable. \n     ``We believe the current policy does not reflect the de-\n     industrialization of the U.S. economy and the rise of the \n     Western European and Asian capabilities to produce high-tech \n     quality equipment . . .'' the memo states. ``Location is no \n     longer important in the competitive equation, and where the \n     suppliers of components will be [is] wherever the competitive \n     advantage lies.''\n       The more that labor heard from the companies, the more \n     hostile it became to any revision. ``We have been \n     presented with no credible evidence that current bank \n     policies have cost companies sales, thereby reducing U.S. \n     employment,'' the labor representatives fired back in a \n     jointly signed letter in April. ``While we understand that \n     global corporations might prefer fewer restrictions--even \n     the provision of financing regardless of the effect on \n     jobs in the United States--that desire simply ignores the \n     very purpose of extending taxpayer-based credit.''\n       If Ex-Im agrees to finance more foreign content, the labor \n     reps asked, won't that simply encourage the multinationals to \n     move still more U.S. jobs overseas, thus accelerating \n     deindustrialization? When I put this question to Ex-Im \n     officials and corporate spokesmen, their answer was a limp \n     assurance that this isn't what the bank or the companies have \n     in mind.\n       But can anyone trust these assurances? The massive \n     corporate layoffs have sown general suspicions of the \n     companies' national loyalties, and the ``outsourcing'' of \n     high-wage jobs has already boiled up as a strike issue in \n     major labor-management confrontations. The United Auto \n     Workers shut down General Motors earlier this year over that \n     question. The UAW lost a long, bitter strike at Caterpillar \n     when it demanded wage cutbacks, threatening to relocate \n     production if the union didn't yield. The International \n     Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers closed down \n     Boeing's assembly lines for two months last fall, demanding a \n     stronger guarantee of job security as Boeing globalizes more \n     of its supplier base.\n       ``Ex-Im financing is corporate welfare with a fig leaf of \n     U.S. jobs, and now they want to take away the fig leaf,'' \n     says Mark A. Anderson, director of the AFL' task force on \n     trade. ``They want to be able to ship stuff from Indonesia to \n     China and use U.S. financing, I said to them, `You're nuts. \n     If you go ahead with this, you're going to be eaten alive in \n     Congress.'''\n       George J. Kourpiss, president of the machinists' union \n     whose members make aircraft at Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, \n     and jet engines at GE and Pratt & Whitney, put it more \n     starkly: ``The American people aren't financing that bank to \n     take work away from us. If the foreign content gets bigger, \n     then we're using the bank to destroy ourselves.''\n\n\n                             exports--Jobs\n\n       According to the government's dubious rule of thumb, each \n     $1 billion in new exports generates 16,000 jobs. By that \n     measure, Bill Clinton's traveling salesmen brought home 2 \n     million good jobs. So why is there not greater celebration? \n     The first, most-obvious explanation is imports. Foreign \n     imports soared, too, albeit at a slower rate of growth, and \n     so America's trade deficit with other nationals actually \n     doubled in size under Clinton, despite his aggressive \n     corporate strategy. Thus a critic might apply the \n     government's own equation to Clinton's trade deficit and \n     argue that there was actually a net loss of 11 million \n     good jobs.\n       Bickering over the trade arithmetic, however, does not get \n     to the heart of what's happening and what really bothers \n     people: the specter of continued downsizing among the \n     nation's leading industrial firms. In fact, globalization has \n     created a disturbing anomaly. U.S. exports multiply robustly, \n     yet meanwhile the largest multinationals that do most of the \n     exporting are shrinking dramatically as employers. It's \n     important to note that about half of U.S. manufacturing \n     exports comes from only 100 companies, and 80 percent from \n     some 250 firms, according to Ex-Im's executive vice \n     president, Allan I. Mendelowitz. The top 15 exporters--names \n     like GM, GE, Boeing, IBM--account for nearly one quarter of \n     all U.S. manufactured exports. Yet these same firms are \n     shedding American employers in alarming dimensions. The 15 \n     largest export producers with few exceptions have steadily \n     reduced their U.S. work forces during the past 10 years--some \n     of them quite drastically--even though their export sales \n     nearly doubled.\n       GE is a prime example because the company is widely \n     emulated in business circles for its tough-minded corporate \n     strategies. In 1985, GE employed 243,000 Americans and 10 \n     years later, only 150,000. GE became stronger, then Executive \n     Vice President Frank P. Doyle said. But, he conceded. We did \n     a lot of violence to the expectations of the American work \n     force.\n       So, too, did GM, the top U.S. exporter in dollar volume \n     (though the auto companies are not big users of Ex-IM \n     financing). GM has shrunk in U.S. work force from 559,000 to \n     314,000. IBM shed more than half of its U.S. workers during \n     the past decade (about 132,000 people). By 1995, Big Blue had \n     become a truly global firm--with more employees abroad than \n     at home (116,000 to 111,000). Even Intel, a thriving \n     semiconductor maker, shrank U.S. employment last year from \n     22,000 to 17,000. Motorola has grown, but its work force is \n     now only 56 percent American.\n       The top exporters that increased their U.S. employment \n     didn't begin to offset the losses. The bottom line tells the \n     story. The government's great substitute for America's major \n     multinational corporations has not been reciprocated, at \n     least not for American workers. The contradiction is not \n     quite as stark as the statistics make it appear, because \n     the job shrinkage is more complicated than simply shipping \n     jobs offshore. Some companies eliminated masses of \n     employees both at home and abroad. Others, like Boeing, \n     reduced payrolls primarily because global demand weakened \n     in their sectors. Some jobs were wiped out by labor-saving \n     technologies and reorganizations. But virtually all of \n     these companies offloaded major elements of production to \n     lower-cost independent suppliers, both in the U.S. and \n     overseas. If the jobs did not disappear, the wages were \n     downsized.\n       This dislocation poses an important question, which \n     American politicians have not addressed. Does the success of \n     America's multinationals translate into general prosperity \n     for the country or merely for the companies and their \n     shareholders? The question is a killer for politicians--\n     liberals and conservatives alike--because it challenges three \n     generations of conventional wisdom. That's why most Democrats \n     or Republicans never ask it.\n       When these facts are mentioned, the exporters retreat to a \n     few trusty justifications. First there is the ``half a loaf'' \n     argument. Yes, it is unfortunately true that companies must \n     disperse an increasing share of the production jobs abroad, \n     either to reduce costs or to appease the foreign customers. \n     But if this were not done, there might be no export sales at \n     all and, thus, no jobs for Americans. Next, there is the \n     ``me, too'' argument. All of the other advanced industrial \n     nations have export banks that provide financing subsidies to \n     their multinationals. The export banks in Europe do allow \n     greater foreign content than the U.S.--but only if the goods \n     originate from an allied nation in the European community. \n     France supports German goods and vice versa, just as Michigan \n     supports California. The U.S. Ex-Im Bank, as Mendelowitz has \n     pointed out, actually provides greater risk protection and \n     generally charges lower premiums.\n       Japan's Ex-Im bank is indeed more flexible than America's, \n     but Japan's industrial system also operates on a very \n     different principle; major Japanese corporations take \n     responsibility for their employees. That understanding \n     creates a mutual trust that allows both the government and \n     the firms to pursue more sophisticated globalization \n     strategies. Japanese jobs are regularly eliminated when \n     Japan's manufacturing is relocated offshore in Asia or in \n     Europe (and sometimes in the U.S.), but the companies find \n     new jobs for displaced employees and only rarely, \n     reluctantly, lay off anyone.\n       ``The situation that our companies see,'' Ex-Im's Cruse \n     explains, ``is that Japan is willing to finance as much as 50 \n     percent foreign content, and [the companies] say to us, \n     ``You're not competitive.'' But an important difference is \n     that the Japanese government doesn't have to worry about the \n     workers because the Japanese companies worry about them. . . \n     . If GE subcontracts work to Indonesia, it tends to lay off a \n     line of workers back in the U.S.''\n\n\n                            bait and switch\n\n       In April 1994, AT announced a $150 trillion joint venture \n     with China's Qingdao Telecommunications to build two new \n     factories, in the Shandong province and in the city of \n     Chengdu, in the Sichuan province, that will manufacture the \n     high-capacity 5ESS switch, the heart of AT's advanced \n     telephone systems. AT's chairman, Robert Allen, said that \n     it will more than double its Chinese work force over the next \n     two or three years.\n       Five months later, in September, the Ex-Im Bank in \n     Washington approved the first of $87.6 million in loan \n     guarantees to underwrite AT's export sales to China--\n     switching equipment that will modernize the phone systems in \n     Qingdao and several other cities. AT won the contract in \n     head-to-head competition with Canada's Northern Telecom, \n     Germany's Siemens and France's Alcatel Alsthom. The Clinton \n     administration celebrated another big win for the home team.\n       But who actually won in this deal? A Telecom Publishing \n     Group article provided a different version of what AT's \n     victory meant for the United States. ``While some equipment \n     for AT's network projects in China will be built in this \n     country,'' the article reported, ``the Chinese are demanding\n\n[[Page S10179]]\n\n     that eventually the bulk of the equipment in their system be \n     built in their country, the carrier [AT] said.''\n       An AT public-affairs vice president, Christopher Padilla, \n     denies this, but then Padilla also denies that AT is \n     prodding the Ex-Im Bank to relax its foreign-content rules. \n     Further, he assures me that despite their proximity, there \n     was no explicit quid pro quo and no connection between the \n     two transactions, the taxpayer-financed export sales and \n     AT's agreement to build new factories in China.\n       ``It's a reality of the marketplace,'' Padilla says. ``If \n     we tried to pursue a strategy of just making everything in \n     Oklahoma City''--where the 5ESS switch is now manufactured--\n     ``we wouldn't have any market share at all.''\n       The White House also led cheers for Boeing because Boeing \n     was also stomping its competitors in the Chinese market. In \n     1994 alone, Boeing sold 21 737s and seven 757s to various \n     Chinese airlines and obtained nearly $1 billion in Ex-Im \n     loans to finance the deals. When President Clinton hailed the \n     news, he did not mention that Boeing had agreed to consign \n     selected elements of its production work to Chinese \n     factories. The state-owned aircraft company at Xian, for \n     instance began making tail sections for the 737, work that is \n     normally done at Boeing's plant in Wichita, Kan. The first \n     order for Xian was for 100 sets, but that was just the \n     beginning. In March 1996, a China news agency boasted that \n     Boeing had agreed to buy 1,500 tail sections from Chinese \n     factories, both for the 737 and the 757. The deal was \n     described as ``the biggest contract in the history of China's \n     aviation industry.''\n       Unlike AT and some others, Boeing is relatively \n     straightforward about acknowledging that it's trading away \n     jobs and technology for foreign sales. China intends to build \n     its own world-class aircraft industry, and Boeing helps by \n     giving China a piece of the action, relocating high-wage \n     production jobs from America to low-wage China, as well as \n     relocating some elements of the advanced technology that made \n     Boeing the world leader in commercial aircraft. Boeing has \n     told its suppliers to do the same. Northrop Grumman, in \n     Texas, is sharing production of 757 tail sections with \n     Chengdu Aircraft, in China.\n       ``What we've done with China,'' says Lawrence W. Clarkson, \n     Boeing's vice president for international development, \n     ``we've done for the same reason we did it with Japan--to \n     gain market access.'' The two transactions--the export sales \n     and job transfers--are legally separate but typically \n     negotiated in tandem, Clarkson explains. China always insists \n     upon a written acknowledgement of the job commitment in the \n     export sales contract--the same sale to China submitted to \n     the Ex-Im Bank for its financial assistance.\n       Until recently, the Ex-Im Bank's operative policy on this \n     issue could be described as ``don't ask, don't tell'': The \n     bank officials didn't ask the companies if they were off-\n     loading jobs, and the companies didn't tell them. When I \n     asked various Ex-Im managers if they knew about AT's new \n     switch factories in China before they approved AT's export \n     financing their answer was no. What about companies like \n     Boeing doing similar deals?\n       ``Yes, we're aware of that,'' Cruse says. It's not that the \n     companies tell us, but it's not hard to read the \n     newspapers.''\n       After prodding from labor officials, the bank last year \n     began requiring exports to reveal whether they dispersed U.S. \n     jobs or technology in connection with the Ex-Im-financed \n     sales. But the federal agency still approves these deals \n     without weighing the potential impact on future \n     employment. In fact, Ex-Im still pretends that the export \n     sales and corporate decisions to relocate jobs are \n     unrelated transactions, though every company knows \n     otherwise.\n       The practice of swapping jobs for sales is widespread in \n     global trade--deals are negotiated in secrecy because such \n     practices ostensibly violate trade rules. But everyone knows \n     the game, and most everyone plays it. If Boeing doesn't swap \n     jobs for Chinese sales, then its European competitor Airbus \n     will. If AT doesn't move its switch manufacturing to China, \n     then Siemens or Alcatel will (in fact, Alcatel already has). \n     The cliche at Boeing is ``60 percent of something is better \n     than 100 percent of nothing.''\n       The trouble is that nothing may be what many American \n     workers wind up with anyway--especially if China eventually \n     becomes a world-class aircraft producers itself. Officials at \n     the Communications Workers of America, which represents AT \n     workers, recall that Ma Bell once made all its home \n     telephones in the U.S. and now makes none here.\n       Is the same migration under way now for the high-tech \n     switches? The AT spokesman insists not. Anyway, he adds the \n     assurance that the most valuable input in these switches is \n     the software, not the hardware from the factories, and the \n     design work is still American. This may reassure the techies, \n     but it's not much comfort to those who work on the assembly \n     lines. Besides, AT plans to open a branch of Bell \n     Laboratories in China.\n       The dilemma facing American multinationals is quite real, \n     but the question remains: Why should American taxpayers \n     subsidize export deals contingent on increased foreign \n     production, or even offloading portions of the American \n     industrial base? Americans are told repeatedly that they \n     cannot exercise any influence over these global firms, but \n     that claim is mistaken. The Ex-Im Bank is an important choke \n     point in the bottom line of these multinationals. Americans \n     should demand that the subsidies be turned off, at least for \n     the largest companies, until the multinationals are willing \n     to provide concrete commitments to their work forces.\n       The gut issue is not about economics but about national \n     loyalty and mutual trust. ``Every meeting we have in the \n     union, we open it with the pledge of allegiance,'' machinists \n     union president George Kouepias muses, ``Maybe the companies \n     should start doing that at their board meetings.''\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Now, Mr. President, that gives a general feel for the \namendment that I cosponsored with the Senator from North Dakota, just a \nminuscule part, but it will start maybe in the other direction the \nconscience and the awareness and the understanding of us as Senators \nabout this important particular problem.\n  We are giving deferrals of $2.2 billion over 7 years to companies \nusing your taxpayer money and my taxpayer money. Talking about the \ndeficit, using our taxpayer money to get them out of the country, to \nlose the jobs. We have a financial gimmick, the Eximbank; they call it \nthe ``bank of Boeing'', to, by gosh, move the jobs over there.\n  Now they have taken over in Europe, and you watch, in China, they are \ndemanding now and they have in the Record the particular article that \nwe had about the number of tail assemblies being manufactured for the \n27 747 planes ordered by the People's Republic of China. We have now \norders over there to manufacture in China over 1,000 planes. So, \ngradually the value to the economy of these exports is being \ndiminished. We are losing, losing, losing, and we act like we are happy \nabout it, running around here competing with ourselves over 60 percent \nof exports and imports being U.S.-generated.\n  I don't blame the Chinese, the Japanese, and all for the ignorance or \nthe lack of awareness on the part of the Government of the United \nStates and its policy. I would ride a free train. I do blame--the \nagents of influence, Senator. They got 100 Washington law firms, paid \n$113 million to represent one country--Japan. Do you know what it is \nfor the 100 Senators and the 435 House Members? Mr. President, $71.3 \nmillion. The people of Japan, by way of pay, are represented better in \nWashington than the people of the United States. When are we going to \nwake up? When are we going to sober up? When are we going to compete? \nYou will get a little flavor of it in an hour when they announce that \nVice President fellow, because he will run all over the country and run \na touchdown. I am telling you right now you are going to see an \n``O.J.'' going around running touchdowns economically when this fellow \ngets started because he knows the subject.\n  This is a serious amendment to bring the attention of the U.S. Senate \nto this all-important problem of losing our standard of living and \njobs. Let's quit financing it, let's stop subsidizing it, let's stop \nbankrolling it, and let's stop using that symbolic nonsense of free \ntrade and protectionism. We have to come here and start protecting our \nindustrial backbone. Your security as a nation is like a three-legged \nstool. One leg is the values of a nation. We sacrificed to feed the \nhungry in Somalia. We sacrificed to build democracy in Haiti. We \nsacrificed to try to build peace in Bosnia. Unquestioned. The second \nleg, Mr. President, is that of military strength. Unquestioned. The \nthird leg, economic strength, is fractured. Our stool of the United \nStates is about to topple because what we are talking about is family \nvalues and homosexual marriages and all kind of them silly things \ncoming around here like we in Congress can control these things, and \nour duty and responsibility to pay the bill goes wanting. Our duty and \nresponsibility is to develop, in a bipartisan fashion, a competitive \ntrade policy because that is what we are into. Europe is protectionist. \nThey enforce their laws. In 1980, we had a $4 billion deficit in the \nbalance of textile trade, and Europe had it. They enforced their \nparticular trade laws and they are down to less than $1 billion, and we \nare up to a $36 billion deficit in the balance on textile trade. So the \nSenator from New Hampshire has to know where his textile industry has \ngone. I thank the distinguished colleagues. I thank, particularly, the \nSenator from North Dakota.\n\n[[Page S10180]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the amendment by my \ncolleague, the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. President, we must balance the budget. We cannot set our sights \nlower than that goal. Earlier in this session of Congress, I introduced \na bill which would cut wasteful and unnecessary spending by $90 billion \nover 7 years. This spring, I worked with my distinguished colleague \nfrom Arizona [Senator McCain], to reduce spending programs, subsidies, \nand corporate welfare by $60 billion over 6 years. And most recently, I \nintroduced the Family Income and Economic Security Act--a 20-point \nprogram to provide education, job, income and retirement security for \nAmericans while eliminating wasteful spending and costly, \ncounterproductive subsidies and giveaways. This provision is an \nintegral part of that 20-point plan.\n  Mr. President, it is clear that all sectors of our society must \ncontribute to the effort of deficit reduction. That includes the \nprivate business sector.\n  The Dorgan-Kerry amendment would close a noxious loophole in our Tax \nCode which is costing the American taxpayers $2.2 billion over 7 years. \nAnd, Mr. President, what adds insult to injury is the fact the current \ntax law also encourages domestic manufacturers to move their plants \noverseas. The Senator from North Dakota is quite correct in calling \nthis loophole the job export subsidy. This is clearly something the \nAmerican taxpayers and our national economy cannot afford.\n  This is not just a hypothetical situation. I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record a compelling article from the Boston Globe \nwhich describes the effect of this loophole on Massachusetts companies \nand their workers.\n  Mr. President, if we are to remain a competitive Nation, we must do \nall we can to eliminate our budget deficit, reduce our national debt, \nmaintain robust economic growth, and encourage manufacturers to retain \nhigh-wage jobs on our shores. This amendment moves us in that direction \nand I encourage our colleagues to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Boston Globe, July 8, 1996]\n\n                    Tax Code Gives Companies A Lift\n\n                           (By Aaron Zitner)\n\n       Washington.--When Robert M. Silva's job moved to Singapore \n     two years ago, his company flew him overseas so he could \n     train his replacement. Then the company closed its North \n     Reading factory, laid off Silva and 119 co-workers and began \n     importing from its Asian plant medical products once made in \n     Massachusetts.\n       Moving jobs to Singapore had obvious advantages for Baxter \n     International Inc. Taxes are low, and Silva's $26,000 salary \n     was far higher than what the company pays his replacement.\n       But Baxter reaped another reward for moving overseas: a tax \n     break, courtesy of the United States government. In the name \n     of boosting US business, the tax code offers a special \n     benefit to companies that move jobs offshore, a gift also \n     accepted by Massachusetts employers such as Stratus Computer \n     Inc. of Marlborough (500 layoffs last year), Augat Inc. of \n     Mansfield (260 layoffs) and the Shrewsbury division of \n     Quantum Corp. (85 layoffs), among others.\n       It is one of many tax breaks that ripple perversely through \n     the economy--favoring multinationals over small firms, \n     investors over average taxpayers and foreign workers over \n     those at home.\n       The federal government gives up about $70 billion each year \n     through corporate tax breaks, enough to cover the IRS bill \n     for every Massachusetts resident two times over. Corporate \n     tax breaks carry a lower political profile than direct \n     subsidies to businesses for programs such as the one that \n     helps McDonald's Corp. sell Chicken McNuggets overseas. But \n     they cost about as much. For a nation trying to balance its \n     budget and pay for social services tax benefits to businesses \n     are a gold mine.\n       ``The tax code is a major source of corporate welfare,'' \n     says US Rep. Lane Evans, an Illinois Democrat. ``Not only \n     that, but we are using our tax dollars in a way that hurts \n     our own economy. It drains our treasury. It forces average \n     Americans to bear a larger share of the tax burden.''\n       The Clinton administration says that closing some tax \n     breaks may force companies to raise prices and lose \n     customers, and therefore pay less taxes. ``There are two \n     sides to every part of this,'' says Leslie Samuels, until \n     recently the Treasury Department's tax policy chief. ``If \n     you're thinking that there's hundreds of billions of dollars, \n     it's not there.''\n       Republican lawmakers have actually moved to widen some tax \n     breaks. A 1993 law, for example, narrowed the provision that \n     benefited Baxter International, Stratus and Augut, but a GOP \n     bill scheduled for debate on the Senate floor today would \n     fully restore the loophole.\n       Other lawmakers and analysts disagree with that approach. \n     At a time when Medicare, Medicaid and other social welfare \n     programs are being curtailed, they say, many tax policies \n     which explicitly benefit corporations cannot be justified. \n     These critics argue:\n       The US should not give tax breaks for breaking the law. For \n     example, after testing faulty medical products on unwitting \n     hospital patients, C.R. Bard Inc. paid $61 million in \n     penalties in 1993. But the pain was tempered by the tax code, \n     which allowed Bard to take half the fine as a tax deduction.\n       Tax breaks to boost exports are not worth the cost. \n     Companies naturally will try to sell their products overseas, \n     so export incentives worth at least $7 billion a year are a \n     waste of money.\n       Too many companies pay no taxes at all. Nearly 60 percent \n     of US-controlled corporations and 74 percent of foreign \n     companies doing business here paid no federal tax in 1991, \n     the last year figures were available. Critics say the US is \n     not tough enough on companies that use illegal accounting \n     maneuvers to shift profits to low-tax nations. The amount \n     lost to the Treasury each year: as much as $40 billion over \n     and above the $70 billion in legal tax breaks.\n       Congress must stop the bidding war among the states for \n     jobs, in which companies win ever-greater tax breaks to \n     relocate. It should not let states use federal tax dollars \n     when ``poaching'' jobs from other states. Labor Secretary \n     Robert Reich calls it ``one of the most egregious forms of \n     corporate welfare.''\n       Congress and the Clinton administration have cut some tax \n     concessions to businesses. They curtailed deductions for \n     meals, sports tickets and country club dues, raising $3 \n     billion a year in tax revenue. They also banned write-offs \n     for ``excessive'' executive salaries, those over $1 million, \n     raising $70 million annually. And they have worked out a \n     deal--not yet final--to phase out a tax break for companies \n     that build plants in Puerto Rico, which costs $2.6 billion a \n     year in tax revenue.\n       But as a presidential candidate, Clinton promised more. He \n     vowed to make foreign companies, widely accused of \n     underpaying US taxes, pay $45 billion more over four years. \n     Clinton has taken steps in this direction, but Treasury \n     officials cannot show how much money has been gained. \n     Moreover, the president has done little to fulfill another \n     promise in his 232-page campaign platform, called ``Putting \n     People First,'' to ``end tax breaks for American companies \n     that shut down their plants here and ship American jobs \n     overseas.''\n\n\n                           incentive to leave\n\n       Just ask Robert Silva.\n       A 33-year-old father of two, Silva spent six years at the \n     C.R. Bard plant in North Reading. He assembled and tested \n     infusion pumps, devices that allow patients to receive \n     regular injections without a nurse or traditional needle.\n       In 1993, the Bard unit was bought by Illinois-based Baxter. \n     ``They promised us the world. Then they moved the plant to \n     Singapore after telling us they wouldn't,'' says Silva of \n     Nashua. About 130 people lost their jobs. ``It was quite the \n     shock. People were in tears that day.''\n       One incentive for Baxter's move, critics say, was a tax \n     break known as the ``runaway plant loophole,'' which accounts \n     for $1.7 billion each year in lost tax revenue. Here's how it \n     works:\n       The US taxes the worldwide profits of American companies. A \n     million dollars earned in Ireland, for example, will be taxed \n     at the US rate of 35 percent, minus the 10 percent tax the \n     company must pay to the Irish government.\n       But Baxter, or any other company, is not required to pay \n     the US tax bill unless it moves the money home to give to \n     shareholders or to reinvest in the business here. As long as \n     the money remains overseas--invested in foreign plants or \n     banks--Baxter will pay only a small tax to Singapore. That is \n     a total $191 million tax on its overseas profits over the \n     years that the company has no intention of paying.\n       ``The tax code literally says, `Move your plant overseas \n     and we'll give you a tax break,' '' says Sen. Byron Dorgan, a \n     North Dakota Democrat.\n       The ``runaway plant loophole'' also has saved millions of \n     dollars for Stratus, Quantum, Digital Equipment Corp. of \n     Maynard and many others that have moved New England jobs \n     overseas while deferring US taxes on overseas profits.\n       ``Closing it would discourage further investment in growing \n     our business,'' said Mark Fredrickson, a spokesman for EMC \n     Corp. of Hopkinton, a computer equipment maker that has \n     accumulated $388 million in untaxed overseas profits over the \n     years. ``It helps our profitability and helps secure the \n     local jobs we have. The bigger we become, the more people \n     have to be employed her eat corporate headquarters.''\n       Many companies take advantage of two other tax breaks \n     designed to encourage exports. By creating a ``foreign sales \n     corporation,'' which often exists only on paper, a firm can \n     claim a tax exemption on some of its export sales. For \n     example, Zoom Telephonics Inc. of Mansfield said recently it \n     lowered its tax rate by selling more products through its \n     foreign sales corporation. These tax rules, created in 1971 \n     and refined in 1984, cost the government $1.5 billion a year.\n\n[[Page S10181]]\n\n       The US Treasury also forfeits $3.6 billion annually through \n     the ``title passage loophole,'' as Sen. Edward M. Kennedy has \n     dubbed it, which allows companies to claim that some US sales \n     were actually made on foreign soil. Companies do this because \n     they sometimes have foreign tax credits they cannot use \n     unless they show more foreign income.\n\n\n                        a break for lawbreakers\n\n       While the tax code causes pain for some US workers, it \n     provides comfort to some companies that break the law.\n       Last year, for example, three former executives of C. R. \n     Bard Inc. were convicted of conspiring to conceal flaws in \n     medical catheters manufactured in Billerica and Haverhill. \n     Two deaths allegedly were linked to the catheters, and \n     prosecutors said the faulty devices caused 21 emergency \n     surgeries. Bard's $61 million legal settlement with the \n     government was the largest ever for violations of Food and \n     Drug Administration rules.\n       But the tax code cushioned the New Jersey-based company. \n     Half of the settlement--$30.5 million--could be used as a tax \n     write-off against earnings. That was the amount Bard paid to \n     settle civil charges. The money was meant to reimburse the \n     Medicare program for buying catheters that should not have \n     been on the market. ``When they earned the money they should \n     not have earned from the catheters, they paid taxes on it. So \n     when they give up those earnings, they should get the taxes \n     back,'' said Michael Loucks, the assistant US attorney who \n     prosecuted Bard.\n       After agreeing last year to pay the second-largest amount \n     ever in a health-care fraud case--$161 million--Caremark \n     International Inc. plans to take a $110 million charge \n     against earnings, on top of a write-off to cover its legal \n     costs.\n       Tax law prevents companies from deducting criminal \n     penalties, avoiding an incentive to commit criminal acts. \n     Loucks said Bard did not negotiate with the Justice \n     Department over what portion of the settlement would be a \n     civil penalty, and therefore tax-deductible. But some \n     companies try to. ``Part of the reason companies would rather \n     do civil settlements is because they are deductible,'' he \n     said.\n\n\n                          zero-tax accounting\n\n       Some companies have gone beyond shielding profits from \n     taxes. By stretching or even breaking U.S. accounting rules, \n     they pay no tax at all. Their goal is to shift profits out of \n     the country into low-tax nations like Bermuda, Ireland or \n     Hong Kong. Their tool is the accounting ledger, and critics \n     of the tax code say it is effective.\n       International Business Machines Corp., for example, paid \n     virtually no tax in 1987, despite $25 billion in U.S. sales. \n     Sen. Kennedy says IBM shifted an undue amount of its \n     worldwide research costs onto its U.S. operation. That raised \n     its American expenses, he says, and lowered its profits. IBM \n     says its accounting practices are legal, but will not comment \n     further.\n       Similarly, Nissan Motor Corp. of Japan overcharged its U.S. \n     subsidiary for cars, the IRS charged several years ago, \n     lowering its U.S. profits and tax bill. Nissan agreed to pay \n     the IRS $160 million, one of several settlements with the \n     agency the automaker signed between 1987 and 1993.\n       Both U.S. and foreign companies cut their taxes by profit \n     shifting, but many lawmakers and tax analysts believe the \n     practice is particularly widespread among foreign companies. \n     More than 70 percent of foreign firms paid no tax each year \n     between 1987 and 1991, the IRS reports, compared to about 60 \n     percent of U.S. companies. Clearly, some paid no tax because \n     they did not make a profit, but many lawmakers believe others \n     are illegally shifting profits overseas.\n       Estimates on the tax revenue loss range from $10 billion to \n     $40 billion a year. Treasury officials say the figure will \n     decrease over time because of tighter regulations created \n     under the Clinton administration.\n       Will the new rules raise the $45 billion that Clinton said \n     he would draw from foreign companies over four years? ``It \n     would be nice to say, `Here's what's going to happen,' but I \n     don't think anyone in the trenches can reliably say that,'' \n     said Samuels, the former Treasury tax policy chief.\n       One group of lawmakers says the transfer-pricing system \n     must be scrapped. In its place, they propose a formula \n     similar to what the states use now to determine what portion \n     of a company's profits can be taxed. The formula bases the \n     tax on what portion of a company's sales, property and \n     personnel are in each state.\n       The Treasury Department, under pressure from Sen. Dorgan, \n     is holding a conference this year to consider how such a \n     formula might be created.\n\n\n                          a $143 million jolt\n\n       Every year, the US government spends $143 million to help \n     generate electricity and run recreation programs for \n     Tennessee and six neighboring states. Now 63 years old, the \n     Tennessee Valley Authority keeps the region's electricity \n     rates low.\n       By contrast, electric rates in Massachusetts are high. And \n     that is a key reason Lexington-based Raytheon Co. last year \n     threatened to take 15,000 jobs out of state unless it won $40 \n     million in tax and electric rate relief. Had it left, \n     Raytheon's likely new home would have been in Tennessee. In \n     other words, says US Rep. Martin T. Meehan, a Lowell \n     Democrat, Washington collected tax dollars from \n     Massachusetts, then sent them to Tennessee, effectively \n     helping to lure Massachusetts jobs.\n       Now, Fidelity Investments of Boston and the mutual fund \n     industry, as well as life insurance companies, are demanding \n     similar tax relief. Increasingly, other states find \n     themselves being forced to offer tax breaks to businesses \n     that threaten to leave town.\n       ``This is one of the most egregious forms of corporate \n     welfare, because the company essentially holds the state up \n     to ransom,'' Labor Secretary Reich says. ``It's bad, because \n     it's a zero-sum game. No new jobs are created. . . . From the \n     national standpoint, this is money that is subsidizing \n     companies with no net benefit whatsoever.''\n       Furthermore, tax breaks don't always save jobs. Raytheon \n     this year is trying to buy out 4,400 workers whose jobs the \n     tax relief intended to save. In 1993, Digital Equipment Corp. \n     angered Boston officials when it closed its Roxbury factory \n     and laid off 190 workers after taking $7 million from the \n     city in financing, tax cuts and other subsidies.\n       Now, some are calling for the federal government to step \n     in. Last year, Massachusetts delegates to an annual small \n     business conference at the White House urged the president to \n     ban the use of federal money in interstate bidding wars.\n       Congress could tax businesses on the value of the \n     incentives they receive from states, or it could deny federal \n     funding to states that get into bidding wars. It also could \n     bar states from using federal grant money or government-\n     backed loans in incentive packages.\n       Massachusetts at times has used federal dollars to lure \n     businesses. Springfield, for example, this year beat out \n     sites in six other states to be the home of a new customer \n     service center for First Notice Systems of Medford, which \n     could employ as many as 900 people. As an incentive, the city \n     offered federal funds to train company workers. It also \n     borrowed money from the federal government and used the cash, \n     in essence, to give First Notice a low-interest loan for \n     building renovations.\n\n\n                           corporate darlings\n\n       Businesses like the tax breaks because, unlike spending \n     programs and direct subsidies, they are outside the federal \n     budget and therefore not subject to Revenue Service for tax \n     rebates on weapons programs that date to the early 1980s. The \n     IRS says the tax credits are not deserved, since the Pentagon \n     paid for the weapons research and usually covers the costs \n     even of failed weapons programs. But the companies have won \n     an early round in the courts, arguing that the Pentagon paid \n     for the weapons, not the research that produced them. The tax \n     refunds could total billions of dollars.\n       Each tax break is a choice, favoring one group of taxpayers \n     over another. Export rules, for example, favor exporters over \n     companies that sell in the US. The ``runaway plant loophole'' \n     favors companies that hire foreign workers over companies \n     that strive for the ``Made in the USA'' label.\n       Most broadly, corporate tax breaks generally favor wealthy \n     Americans over the less-well off. Tax benefits are designed \n     to help businesses create jobs, but when corporations win a \n     tax break it is the owners of the company who gain most.\n       Last December, with Republicans and Democrats deadlocked \n     over a plan to end a 21-day shutdown of the federal \n     government, 91 corporate chief executives signed a two-page \n     newspaper advertisement that urged Congress to balance the \n     budget. ``Without a balanced budget, the party's over. No \n     matter which party you're in,'' the ad said.\n       Seven of the CEOs were from companies that take advantage \n     of a major tax break for purchasing new equipment, which \n     costs the US $26 billion a year. Exxon saved $760 million \n     because of the so-called accelerated depreciation rules, \n     according to calculations by the Center for the Study of \n     Responsive Law, a Washington-based Ralph Nader group. Ford \n     Motor Co., Chrysler Corp., DuPont and others that signed the \n     ad saved hundreds of millions dollars more.\n       General Motors is a major recipient of federal technology \n     grants. Kodak claimed $37 million in export and manufacturing \n     tax credits last year. In 1994, IBM paid no US taxes on $11 \n     billion in profits it earned overseas, while the US Labor \n     Department reported that 1,755 IBM jobs were moved abroad.\n       ``How can you demand that the budget be balanced when \n     you're taking tax breaks like this?'' asked Janice Shields, a \n     former accounting professor now with the watchdog group. \n     ``These things save the companies from going into debt, but \n     it's causing the country to do that.''\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the jobs export \nsubsidy amendment. This amendment will help to end the exodus of U.S. \nmanufacturing industry overseas by eliminating a provision in the tax \nlaw that encourages and rewards that exodus.\n  How does the Dorgan amendment do this? It ends the tax deferral on \nprofits of overseas U.S. companies who move plants to foreign tax \nhavens then ship products back to the United States for sale.\n  This amendment eliminates a tax subsidy that is unfair to America's \nworkers, that is unfair to taxpayers, and that is unfair to domestic \ncompanies.\n  Current law provides an incentive to move. We are actually rewarding \ncompanies for killing U.S. jobs. That\n\n[[Page S10182]]\n\nmakes absolutely no sense. How can this Congress say it is for working \nfamilies when we reward multinational firms who move their jobs \noverseas?\n  Since 1979, our country has lost 3 million good-paying manufacturing \njobs. This tax break is one reason why. We can't afford to lose one \nmore job, and that's why we need this amendment.\n  Current law costs the American taxpayer. The Joint Economic Committee \nestimates this subsidy will result in $2.26 billion over 7 years in \nlost revenues. If we are serious about giving taxpayers a break, and in \nreducing our deficit, this is one tax subsidy we just can't afford.\n  Current law actually puts companies that remain in the United States \nat a competitive disadvantage. We don't reward the good guys. We don't \nprovide a tax break for them for keeping jobs here at home. Instead we \nmake it harder for them to compete by giving an edge to those who move \njobs overseas. This amendment will help create a level playing field so \nthe ``good guys'' have a fair chance to compete.\n  It's important to understand what this amendment does not do. It does \nnot hinder U.S. companies that produce abroad from competing with \nforeign firms in foreign markets. It does not burden companies with a \nnew tax. It simply eliminates the special tax treatment given to \noverseas U.S. companies.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It's good for \nAmerica's workers. It's good for the taxpayers. It's good for America's \ndomestic companies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I am going to talk here for a bit until we \ncan get a final group of amendments, which we would like to offer. Both \nthe chairman and I have agreed to those. We should be able to get that \nlist put together soon. One is an amendment that I and about 10 or 12 \nother Senators offered, having to do with reorganization of the IRS. \nThe language of the amendment says:\n\n       The Internal Revenue Service is prohibited from expending \n     funds for field office reorganization until the National \n     Commission of Restructuring the IRS has had an opportunity to \n     issue the final report.\n\n  The chairman has agreed to accept that language into this bill. Let \nme be clear that my intent is to change it when we get into conference. \nThe idea is not to postpone this until after the final commission \nreport. That, to me, would be an inappropriate thing for us to do.\n  What is appropriate is to ask the Treasury Department to come up with \na justification on customer service, a justification on cost-\neffectiveness, and a number of other areas, which they currently have \nnot done. They are talking about actually doing a reduction of force of \nabout 2,300 at a time. For example, they are also proposing to fire \nanother 14 or 15 upper-echelon executives. Some other questions have \nbeen raised by a number of Members. That is what this amendment is \nattempting to do.\n  It will be my intent to modify that language once we get to \nconference.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \ncommittee amendments be temporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 5225 through 5232, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I send a group of amendments to the desk, \nen bloc, and ask for their immediate consideration.\n  The amendments are as follows: One is for myself to extend the pilot \nprogram authority provided by the GMRA until December 31, 1999; one for \nSenator Stevens to clarify section 645 of the bill; one for Senator \nMikulski regarding closure of an alley in the District of Columbia for \nconstruction of a Federal building; one for Senators Mack and Graham to \ntransfer a property for animal research; one for Senator D'Amato to \nprovide criminal sanctions for fictitious financial instruments; one \nfor Senator Gregg regarding distribution of Federal employees' names; \none for Senator Kohl, a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, regarding IRS \ntelephone service; one for Senator Kerrey regarding the IRS \nreorganization.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Shelby] proposes amendments \n     numbered 5225 through 5232, en bloc.\n\n  Mr. SHELBY.

Mr. President, I would like to commend the distinguished \nchairman and ranking minority member of the Treasury Appropriations \nSubcommittee. Thanks to their efforts, we have reached an agreement to \ninclude my amendment into this important legislation. This amendment \nincorporates the text of S. 1009, the Financial Instruments Anti-Fraud \nAct. This bill has bipartisan support and has been cosponsored by \nSenators Lieberman, Grassley, Johnston, Bryan, Bond, and Frahm.\n  Mr. President, over the past several years, innovative criminals have \nexploited a loophole in Federal anti-counterfeiting laws. These laws do \nnot specifically criminalize the production or passing of a phony \ncheck, bond or security if is not a copy of an actual financial \ninstrument. Criminals are now making and passing completely fictitious \nfinancial instruments. These instruments may involve, for example, a \nbank, an asset or a security that does not even exist.\n  Under existing Federal and State law, in order to prosecute a \ncriminal who produces or passes a completely fictitious instrument, the \ncriminal must use the wires or mails, or deposit the instrument in a \nbank. These laws simply do not prohibit the making and passing of \nfictitious financial instruments.\n  The International Chamber of Commerce estimates that frauds involving \nfictitious financial instruments cost investors around the world $10 \nmillion per day. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency reports \nthat in the first 6 months of 1996, con artists have attempted to pass \nmore than $3 billion in fictitious instruments in the United States.\n  In many cases, criminals who are caught attempting to perpetrate \nthese frauds cannot be prosecuted. That is wrong. This loophole must be \nclosed.\n  On July 17, the Banking Committee held hearings on this issue. \nCharitable institutions such as the Salvation Army and the National \nCouncil of Churches of Christ testified that they lost millions of \ndollars in these scams. The committee also heard testimony from a \nprivate institution in North Carolina that paid out on a fictitious \nfinancial instrument.\n  Mr. President, there is another sinister side to these frauds. \nAntigovernment groups use fictitious financial instruments to commit \neconomic terrorism against Government agencies, private businesses, and \nindividuals. Prior to their 81-day siege, the Montana Freemen passed \nfictitious instruments called comptroller warrants. The Freeman used \nthese instruments to stockpile food, water, gasoline, and even \nvehicles.\n  This past April, a California woman, Elizabeth Broderick, was \narrested for mail fraud and conspiracy for passing comptroller warrants \nto banks, automobile dealers, bail bondsmen and even the IRS. Ms. \nBroderick, who calls herself the Lien Queen, has held seminars on how \nto produce and pass phony checks, charging her students $125 each. \nFederal authorities monitored the Lein Queen's activities for several \nyears. They finally were able to arrest her only after she slipped and \nused the mails to send some of her phony checks.\n  Fictitious instruments are an important source of funds for \nantigovernment groups. The Lien Queen attempted to pass more than $124 \nmillion in phony checks. LeRoy Schweitzer, the founder of the Montana \nFreemen, successfully passed more than $85 million in phony notes, \nnetting more than $670,000 in profits.\n  Armed antigovernment groups such as the Freemen use fictitious \ninstruments to undermine the banking and monetary systems of the United \nStates. These groups believe that the Federal Government has declared \nwar on its citizens, and that Federal institutions such as the Federal \nReserve must be destroyed.\n  My amendment would close this loophole. The amendment would give \nFederal agents the tools necessary to prevent millions of dollars in \nlosses to banks, mutual funds, and individuals.\n  Under this amendment, criminals found guilty of trafficking in \nfictitious financial instruments would face up to 25 years in prison.\n  Mr. President, the Banking Committee has worked closely with the \nTreasury Department and the Secret Service to develop this legislation. \nI would like to thank my colleagues who are cosponsors of the bill and \nthe floor managers. Federal law enforcement officials need this weapon \nto combat this new brand of financial fraud and to protect our \nfinancial institutions.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 5230\n\n    (Purpose: To prohibit distribution of federal employee personal \n             information without consent of the individual)\n\n       On page 135, after line 4, add the following new section:\n       Sec.  . None of the funds appropriated by this Act may be \n     used by an agency to provide a Federal employee's home \n     address except when it is made known to the Federal official \n     having authority to obligate or expend such funds that the \n     employee has authorized such disclosure or that such \n     disclosure has been ordered by a court of competent \n     jurisdiction.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, earlier this year the Vice-President of the \nUnited States, Albert Gore, directed the Office of Personnel Management \n[OPM] to make available to the Federal Employees' Union the home \naddresses of all Federal employees regardless of their affiliation with \nthe Federal Employee Union. The Administration claims this is just a \nstep to enable the unions to communicate with employees in an \nemergency.\n  Subsequently, on March 8, 1996, OPM published in the Federal Register \na notice of proposed rulemaking which raises considerable privacy \nconcerns and in my opinion severely undermines the Privacy Act of 1974. \nCiting as its reason for the new rulemaking--the confusion and turmoil \ncaused by the Government shutdowns--OPM proposed permitting Federal \nagencies to release employee addresses to recognized Federal labor \norganizations. This notice went on to state that, ``OPM has determined \nthat the most current home addresses of OPM employees are contained in \nthe payroll system records.\n\n[[Page S10184]]\n\n Because this system is updated for changes annually by OPM employees \nand is automated, it is the most efficient, as well as the most \naccurate, mechanism for releasing this information.''\n  What perplexes me is that if the Federal Employee Union is interested \nin obtaining the addresses of all Federal employees, the union itself \nshould ask for the addresses. The idea of mandating the availability of \nFederal employee addresses is outrageous and a direct violation of the \nPrivacy Act of 1974. The Federal Government cannot and should not make \navailable to the Federal labor unions the addresses of all Federal \nemployees regardless of their union or non-union affiliation. This \nwould not be permitted under my amendment.\n  My amendment is a simple one. It states that no Federal funds will be \nmade available to the OPM or any other Federal Government agency to \nprovide Federal Government employee addresses to anyone unless \nauthorized by that given employee or ordered by a court of competent \njurisdiction.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a July 28, 1996 Washington Post article, \nand a subsequent letter to the editor appearing in the Washington Post \non August 12, 1996, be printed in the record following my remarks.\n  I want to thank the chairman and ranking member for making my \namendment part of their managers' amendment and I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 28, 1996]\n\n                       The Era of Job Insecurity\n\n                            (By Mike Causey)\n\n       If you think the words ``Uncle Sam'' still mean total job \n     security, chances are you have been out of touch for a while.\n       In the past, about 33 percent of the people who hired on \n     with government made it to retirement. Turnover was low \n     compared with many private companies. But the image of the \n     government as a rock-steady employer may be gone with the \n     wind.\n       Even the Internal Revenue Service--one of the government's \n     few moneymaking operations and an agency that has detailed \n     plans to keep trucking AFTER a major nuclear attack--is \n     having layoffs.\n       The Defense Department is shrinking rapidly. The once-\n     glamorous National Aeronautics and Space Administration is \n     getting smaller, and congressional Republicans still want to \n     see the Commerce Department disappear altogether.\n       Working for the government today is a little like being in \n     a big crowd at an outdoor rock concert during a violent \n     electrical storm: Some people won't even get wet, or know it \n     if they do. Others will get wet but won't get hurt. But a few \n     may end up on the receiving end of a bolt of lightening. \n     Welcome to ``stable'' federal employment, 1996 style.\n       Several things have combined to make government service \n     less binding. They include the new retirement system (with \n     its portable 401(k), which doesn't lock employees into a \n     pension plan); the end of the Cold War; the new emphasis on \n     deficit reduction and the adoption of ``reengineering'' as a \n     form of New Age religion.\n       Federal unions have taken reengineering in stride. They are \n     supporting President Clinton for reelection, even though he \n     is campaigning on his success in eliminating 231,000 federal \n     jobs. It could have been worse, and it will be if Republican \n     Robert J. Dole is elected, unions tell members.\n       Unions soon will be able to reach members (and nonmembers) \n     at home, thanks to a White House order telling agencies to \n     give their employees' home addresses to unions. This isn't a \n     political payoff, both sides say, but a way to allow \n     unions to communicate with employees during emergencies. \n     House Republicans are furious, contending that the \n     arrangement violates the privacy rights of federal \n     workers.\n       In the meantime, congressional Republicans have shut down \n     two styles of buyouts, which, for want of better terms, might \n     be called the ``Golden Handshakes'' and ``Zombie Buyouts.''\n       Golden Handshakes involved paying retirement-age workers as \n     much as $25,000 to retire. Zombie Buyouts are so named \n     because some agencies revived the program (which legally died \n     last year) to offer another chance at buyouts to employees \n     this year.\n       Members of Congress think some agencies milked buyouts when \n     they offered employees as much as $25,000 to leave and then \n     paid them big-buck bonuses to delay their departure. Those \n     employees got bonuses and buyouts.\n       Because of concerns about past buyouts, future buyouts in \n     non-Defense agencies will be selective and closely monitored.\n       In parts of the IRS, one in every four employees is facing \n     layoff. That includes about 2,000 workers in the Washington \n     area. The IRS has asked for limited buyout authority, and the \n     Senate is working on allowing the agency to give buyouts to \n     early retirees. But the IRS has determined that nobody who is \n     eligible for either regular or early retirement will get a \n     buyout, even if Congress approves them for early retirees.\n       The Agency for International Development also is seeking \n     limited buyout authority. Rep. Benjamin A. Gilman (R-N.Y.) is \n     pushing the plan. It would allow AID to pay severance of as \n     much as $25,000 to as many as 100 workers--none of them \n     eligible to retire--who agree to resign. Normally employees \n     who resign can't get severance. The plan, supported by the \n     White House and congressional leaders, would let AID--and \n     maybe other agencies--have what amounts to buyouts without \n     offering buyouts. It also sends a message to retirement-age \n     workers that the era of buyouts, for them, may be gone.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                       [From the Washington Post]\n\n               Safeguard the Privacy of Federal Employees\n\n       As the concerned wife of a federal employee, I implore The \n     Post: Please tell me that Mike Causey misspoke in his July 28 \n     column ``The Era of Job Insecurity'' [Metro]. Mr. Causey \n     reported that the Clinton administration has ordered federal \n     agencies to give the home addresses of their employees, \n     including nonmembers, to federal unions. The unions and the \n     Clinton people claim this is just a step to enable the unions \n     to communicate with employees in emergencies.\n       While government employees' names, grades and salaries are \n     matters of public record, until now, their home addresses \n     have not been publicly available.\n       How are the unions going to ensure that some disgruntled \n     person with access to the lists of home addresses--someone \n     who is currently undergoing a tax audit, for example--doesn't \n     start sending threatening letters to the home of the auditor \n     who is assigned to her case? Or what if she decides to drop \n     by the auditor's home for a personal confrontation?\n       I have no doubt that agencies will try to withhold the \n     addresses of some of their employees--FBI agents, IRS \n     criminal investigators, etc.--because they might be harassed \n     at home. One has to wonder, through, why a secretary at the \n     FBI or a personnel staffer at the National Archives shouldn't \n     be entitled to the same respect for her privacy. \n     Additionally, many federal workers are married to other \n     federal employees. What happens when the FBI secretary is \n     married to an FBI agent? How does the FBI manage to give the \n     union the secretary's home address without also handing over \n     the home address of the agent?\n       It's true that we give our addresses out to our friends, \n     associates and businesses, such as bank and department \n     stores, all the time. But that choice is ours, and we freely \n     assume any risks attached to the release of our addresses. \n     Additionally, we can limit the amount of information we \n     provide to any particular person or institution. The public \n     library has my home address, but it has no information on \n     what either my husband or I do for a living. The same is true \n     of various museums and charities. No one who comes across our \n     address on a membership renewal form has any reason to \n     associate us with the government, unless we choose for them \n     to have that information.\n       Having been both a tax law specialist in the disclosure \n     function at IRS and a personnel staffer with that agency, I \n     am somewhat familiar with the obligation of federal agencies \n     to safeguard information they collect. I'm curious as to \n     whether any privacy considerations come into play here. My \n     own gut reaction is that federal agencies have no business \n     handing over the addresses of their employees to unions or to \n     anyone else who asks for them.\n       Regina F.

It is further the sense of the Congress that the \n     Internal Revenue Service should establish performance goals, \n     operating standards, and management practices which ensures \n     such an increase in customer service.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 5232\n\n       On page 26 after line 9 add the following new section:\n       The Internal Revenue Service is prohibited from expending \n     funds for the field office reorganization plan until the \n     National Commission on Restructuring the Internal Revenue \n     Service has had an opportunity to issue their final report.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this amendment would disallow funds for \nthe Internal Revenue Service to execute their field office \nreorganization plan until the National Commission on Restructuring the \nIRS has had an opportunity to issue its final report.\n  The amendment addresses the recent proposal by the IRS to downsize \nthe offices of its headquarters and those in\n\n[[Page S10185]]\n\nthe field. Recently, the IRS announced that it will cut back 3,300 \nemployees at sites around the country and hire 1,400 new employees to \ndo the same work at another location. While this Congress has routinely \nsupported initiatives to eliminate unnecessary positions at Federal \nagencies, I worry that this recent decision at the IRS will do nothing \nto aid taxpayers in America and may reduce the level of customer \nservice taxpayers deserve.\n  The IRS formulated this plan, without regard to final decisions on \nfiscal year 1997 spending levels, in order to consolidate the \nadministrative operations of their field offices. Because these offices \nare to remain open, there does not seem to be a reason for rehiring \n1,400 people to perform the jobs that are capably being done in the \nfield. In my own State of North Dakota, our taxpayers will lose many \npeople who provide front-line services such as a public affairs \nofficer, a taxpayer education coordinator, and several others who \nprovide the critical liaison between the taxpayer and the IRS. I fail \nto see how shifting these positions to larger metropolitan areas will \nincrease the efficiency of work already being done.\n  Mr. President, I receive many letters every year from concerned North \nDakotans who have exhausted several hours and days attempting to reach \nrepresentatives of the IRS. Their complaints have only intensified over \nthe years. This recent decision by the IRS will only worsen an already \ntenuous relation between taxpayers and the IRS.\n  This amendment prevents the IRS from taking these actions in their \nfield offices until the National Commission to Restructure the Internal \nRevenue Service has had a chance to report back to Congress on the \ntroubles facing the IRS and their possible solutions. Until the \nCongress has had a chance to evaluate and propose solutions to many of \nthe predicaments at the IRS, it does not make sense to frustrate \ntaxpayers with a pointless restructuring plan which does nothing to \nbetter serve their needs. I ask my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I ask unanimous consent that these amendments be \nconsidered and agreed to, en bloc, and that accompanying statements be \nplaced at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 5225 through 5232), en bloc, were agreed to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KERREY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n          WESTERN STATES HIGH INTENSITY DRUG TRAFFICKING AREA\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to join my \ndistinguished colleagues from the West in recognizing the alarming rise \nin drug trafficking plaguing our region of the country. Included in the \ncommittee report to accompany this measure, there is language giving \nconsideration for this problem, with special consideration for the \nState of Colorado. The committee further directed the Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy to evaluate the drug problem in the Rocky \nMountain region and elsewhere, and report its findings back to the \ncommittee.\n  Would the Senator from Alabama yield a few moments at this time to \nenter into a brief colloquy?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I would be happy to yield to the Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank the Senator from Alabama.\n  As chairman of the subcommittee with jurisdiction, the Senator from \nAlabama is aware of the drug problem facing the entire country.\n  I would like to point out the efforts of the Rocky Mountain Division \nof the Drug Enforcement Agency. In cooperation with numerous State and \nlocal law enforcement agencies, DEA has presented a proposal to the \nOffice of National Drug Control Policy to have the region identified as \na high intensity drug trafficking area. For example, at the Treasury, \nPostal and Government Operations Subcommittee hearing of June 26, the \nONDCP Director, General McCaffrey, cited the drug smuggling problem in \nDenver, CO. Thorough investigations by law enforcement personnel \nindicate that the trafficking problem centered in Denver impacts not \nonly the neighboring States of Utah and Wyoming, but also the rest of \nthe Nation. In addition, evidence suggests that Denver serves as a \ntransshipment point between Los Angeles, Mexico, and the east coast.\n  Based upon the actions taken by the appropriate law enforcement \nagencies in the Rocky Mountain region, as well as the advanced stage of \ntheir pending request to be identified as a high intensity drug \ntrafficking area, I take this opportunity to request that the Senator \ncontinue to work with me to address this matter.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I look forward to working with the Senator on this \nmatter. I know how important combating the drug trafficking problem is \nto the communities in the Rocky Mountain region.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank the distinguished Senator from Alabama for his \nconsideration and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to commend my esteemed colleague \nfrom Colorado, Senator Campbell, for his vision and hard work on the \ndrug trafficking problem in the Rocky Mountain region. I join him today \nin supporting the committee's focus on the unfortunate, growing tragedy \nin our region.\n  The Rocky Mountain region contains three important States. My home \nState of Utah, Colorado, the home State for my colleague, Senator \nCampbell, and the State of Wyoming. It is important that the DEA and \nother Federal and State drug enforcement officers be able to accomplish \ntheir important tasks in each of these States, and the citizens of each \none will benefit greatly from this project. It clearly is appropriate \nto this Senator that the Office of National Drug Control Policy should \ndesignate the States of Utah, Colorado, and Wyoming for increased \nassistance in the fight against drug traffickers.\n  Again, I want to thank my colleagues Senators Shelby and Kerrey for \ntheir leadership and hard work on this important legislation. I yield \nthe floor.\n\n\n             gang resistance education and training program\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Would the distinguished chairman of the Treasury-Postal \nAppropriations Subcommittee yield to a question?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I would be happy to yield to my friend, the Senator from \nIowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I fully agree with the statement in the committee's \nreport that the Gang Resistance Education and Training [GREAT] Program \nhas proven to be highly successful. It is my understanding that the \ncommittee has provided funding for an expansion of the GREAT Program. \nIs my understanding correct?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I thank the Senator from Iowa for his support of this \nworthwhile program. It has proven to be very successful and very \npopular with State and local law enforcement authorities. The Senator \nis correct. The committee has provided funds for an expansion of the \nGREAT Program.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The Sioux City, IA, police department was one of the \nfirst agencies in my State to do a pilot GREAT Program in a public \nschool environment. Because of their participation in the GREAT \nProgram, this school in Sioux City went from a high-risk school to \nbeing recognized as one of Iowa's First In the Nation in Education \n[FINE] schools this past year. This is a significant and very important \nturnaround. I would urge my friend, the Senator from Alabama, to give \nserious consideration to adding Sioux City to the GREAT Program during \nthe conference on this bill.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I can assure the Senator from Iowa that we will give \nSioux City every consideration during the conference on this \nappropriations bill.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Senator for his assurance.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, as I understand it, we are going to go out \nrelatively soon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/10/senate-section/article/S10155-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10185-S10190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        PRAISING THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT ADMINISTRATION\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I wanted to say a word of praise for \nJames Lee Witt of the Federal Emergency Management Administration. I \nwas highly critical back during Hugo,\n\n[[Page S10186]]\n\nat the time we had that hurricane in 1989, and justifiably so. What I \ndid is go down at that particular time, on September 21, the next \nmorning, with Senator Thurmond, and we reviewed the tremendous damage \ndone to our air base, our naval base, the outer islands, the homes and \neverything, and realizing without electricity, communications, and \notherwise, I could not do any good.\n  I flew back late that Friday evening and early Saturday morning, I \ngot on the phone to FEMA, and I outlined the needs of generators, food, \nwater, tents, and at personal insistence, Mr. Morris, then the FEMA \nDirector, said, ``Senator, you don't understand the procedure.'' I \nsaid, ``What procedure?'' He says, ``You know you are supposed to get \nthe mayor to advertise, and if he can't find two contractors to do the \njob, to satisfy the needs, then he bucks the request up to the Governor \nand the Governor does a similar thing; he surveys and gets two \nrefusals, and then they come to Washington.'' I said, ``Are you \nserious?'' He said, ``Of course.'' I said, ``You are crazy,'' and I \nhung up and called General Gray of the Marine Corps, who was out at \nthat time on the Army-Navy golf course. I said, ``General, the ox is in \nthe ditch,'' and I outlined it. He said, ``Don't worry, we will get it \nin there.'' We have Parris Island located in the particular hurricane \npath down there. When I got down there the next day or day and a half, \nI ran into Gen. Ernest Troy Cook, who is a lieutenant general in charge \nof Quantico in the line of command. He motioned to me to be rather \nquiet. I said, ``What is the matter?'' He said, ``They have a procedure \nwhere I am not supposed to be helping, but it is obvious that the \ngeneral called me, General Gray, and I am going to continue to do it.'' \nBut go easy on this FEMA fellow because he is trying to hold up \neverything I am trying to do. They were trying to cancel help. Here, \ntoday, we find Director James Lee Witt is down in North Carolina going \nover the needs of all the people down there.\n  He was down there on Friday morning in South Carolina and in North \nCarolina when Senator Thurmond and I went there. I have a brochure \nhere, the pertinent parts of which I will include, and I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record to show you how organized and \norchestrated he was.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Federal Emergency Management Agency, Emergency Support Team, FEMA \n      Headquarters, Emergency Information and Coordination Center\n\n\n hurricane fran situation report no. 2--reporting period: 7 a.m. edt, \n           september 5, 1996 to 7 a.m. edt september 6, 1996\n\n                             1. Background\n\n       The National Weather Service advises that FRAN is still a \n     large and dangerous hurricane as it continues to move inland. \n     It has not strengthened during the past 24 hours and is \n     expected to weaken over land. It appears to be in a state of \n     development where tropical storm-force winds have spread out \n     laterally.\n       The eye of Hurricane FRAN passed over Cape Fear, North \n     Carolina, during late evening September 5. Hurricane-force \n     winds spread inland up to 100 miles from the coast and \n     tropical-force winds extended over water up to 290 miles. \n     Power outages, flooded streets and flapping roofs were \n     reported from south of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, to north \n     of Topsail Beach, North Carolina. The storm accounted for \n     nine confirmed deaths.\n       Hurricane warnings remain in effect through the night from \n     Cape Fear, North Carolina, to the North Carolina-Virginia \n     border including Pamlico and Albermarle Sounds. A tropical \n     storm warning continues in effect from north of the North \n     Carolina-Virginia border to Chincoteague, Virginia, including \n     the Greater Hamptons Roads Area. A tropical storm warning is \n     also in effect for the lower Chesapeake Bay.\n       All other hurricane warnings and watches were discontinued \n     at 11:00 p.m. September 5.\n       A high wind warning and tornado watch are in effect for the \n     interior sections of northeast North Carolina. A high wind \n     watch is also in effect for parts of east-central Virginia \n     late September 5 and all day September 6.\n       The U.S. Weather Service advises that officials need to \n     continue preparedness actions in northeastern northeast North \n     Carolina and east-central Virginia.\n\n                          2. Current situation\n\n       FEMA Headquarters: The Emergency Support Team (EST) \n     continued Level One operations (full staffing).\n       Regional Activity: The Atlanta Regional Operations Center \n     (ROC) remains operational at Level 3 activation. Regional \n     ESFs #1 through #12 will support ROC operations 24-hours per \n     day until further notice.\n       The Emergency Response Team--Advance Element (ERT-A) is in \n     position at the Georgia EOC. Regional Emergency Support \n     Functions #2, #3, #5, #6, #7, #8, #10, #12 and the designated \n     1st US Army DCO/DCE provided representation for the ERT-A at \n     the Georgia EOC beginning at 10:00 a.m. EDT on September 5.\n       The Advance Element of the ERT-N Red Team arrived in \n     Columbia, South Carolina, on September 5. Team members \n     operated in an Alternate Emergency Operations Center. Because \n     of the change in the storm's track, the Advance Element of \n     the ERT-N Red Team is preparing to relocate to Raleigh, North \n     Carolina on September 6.\n       Federal Coordinating Officer Lacy Suiter is leading an \n     advance team to Raleigh to work with Region IV ERT-A on \n     redeployment of the remainder of the Advance Element. The \n     advance contingent consists of 16 personnel representing the \n     following organizations or groups: Community Relations; \n     Public Affairs; Congressional Affairs; Information and \n     Planning; Operations; Logistics; Finance and Administration.\n       The remainder of the group will relocate to Raleigh by \n     charter air on September 6. Prior to leaving South Carolina, \n     the group will transition its responsibilities to Region VI \n     ERT-A.\n       Seven Operations Sections personnel deployed with the ERT-N \n     Red Team Advance Element to the Alternate EOC. They have \n     begun coordinating with their counterparts in the Region IV \n     Regional Operations Center and the State EOC.\n       The Operations Section Chief and an Operations Officer went \n     to Raleigh with the advance group from the ERT-N Red Team \n     Advance Element.\n       Thirteen representatives from Emergency Support Functions \n     #1, #3, #4, #6, #7 and #8 arrived at the Interim EOC and \n     received briefings and workspace. South Carolina had \n     requested one representative from each support function to \n     work in the State EOC. The temporary address is 300 Gervais \n     Street.\n       The Region IV ROC has provided Mission Assignment \n     Activation Letters and taskings to Federal agency \n     representatives at the ROC and mailed originals to agency \n     offices. Two National Field Assessment Teams (FAsT) have been \n     activated, and the East Team members arrived in Columbia, \n     South Carolina, on September 5.\n       Region IV State Liaison are:\n       Florida: Annette Harrell at 904-413-9969 (fax 904-488-1016)\n       Georgia: John Johnson at 404-624-7000 (fax 404-624-7205)\n       South Carolina: Steve Brown at 803-734-8020 (fax 803-734-\n     8062)\n       North Carolina: Bobby Clark at 919-733-3718 (fax 919-733-\n     5406)\n\n                          4. Weather forecast\n\n       The official forecast moves the track farther inland. The \n     anticipated path will take FRAN over central Virginia, the \n     eastern panhandle of West Virginia, west central Maryland and \n     central Pennsylvania. The hurricane is predicted to weaken \n     gradually over land. Speed is about 16 m.p.h. Hurricane-force \n     winds will continue to spread inland up to 100 miles.\n       In addition to the heavy winds, heavy rainfall is likely, \n     particularly over higher terrain. Rainfalls of 5 to 10 \n     inches, sometimes locally even higher, are expected along the \n     FRANs path. Heavy rains are expected to cause significant \n     inland flooding over the next few days, especially in the \n     mountainous areas of NC, VA, WV, MD, and central PA\n\n            5. Severity of impact on political jurisdictions\n\n                       A. Jurisdictions Affected\n\n       (1) Florida: No evacuations have occurred.\n       (2) Georgia: Voluntary evacuations took place in coastal \n     counties. Chatham County officials ordered evacuation of the \n     coastal islands, manufactured homes and low-lying areas.\n       (3) South Carolina: Governor David Beasley issued an \n     evacuation order at 2:40 p.m. EDT September 4 for those parts \n     of Georgetown and Horry Counties east of US 17 and for all \n     barrier islands, beachfront properties, low-lying areas and \n     all property bordering waterways in Jasper, Beaufort, \n     Colleton and Charleston Counties. The city of Mullins is \n     reported to be without power.\n       (4) North Carolina: Voluntary evacuation occurred for beach \n     communities in the Cape Fear region. Bald Head Island \n     residents were ordered to evacuate. The city of Raleigh is \n     reported to be without power.\n\n                        6. Status of declaration\n\n       On September 4 Georgia Governor Zell Miller declared a \n     state of emergency in Camden, Glynn, McIntosh, Liberty, \n     Bryan, Chatham, Charlton, Brantley, Wayne, Long and Effingham \n     Counties.\n       South Carolina Governor David Beasley declared a statewide \n     emergency on September 4 and the following day requested from \n     the President a major disaster declaration for the State. On \n     September 5 North Carolina Governor James Hunt also declared \n     a state of emergency and then requested from the President a \n     major disaster declaration for the State. Both requests for a \n     Presidential declaration went through FEMA Region IV Director \n     Kenneth D. Hutchison.\n\n                    7. Status of Federal operations\n\n       EST mitigation activities continue in full force. Staff has \n     completed the following actions: Identified communities in \n     South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia and \n     Maryland that are not participating in the National Flood \n     Insurance Program\n\n[[Page S10187]]\n\n     (NFIP); alerted the FEMA Map Service Center of anticipated \n     map shipments during the coming weekend; established which \n     publications are available for distribution in the post-\n     disaster environment.\n       Staff is working on the following items: Assisting the GIS \n     Hub in assuring the delivery of available digital maps for \n     the anticipated affected States; determining communities that \n     the NFIP has not yet mapped or that are still using a \n     converted Flood Hazard Boundary Map. (In either case, this \n     reflects no updating since 1980.)\n       A FEMA Region IV mitigation staff person will meet with the \n     ERT-A Red Team Deputy Field Coordinating Officer before going \n     to North Carolina and South Carolina. A FEMA Region III \n     mitigation official is on alert for deployment to Virginia \n     and other States in Region III.\n       The FEMA Mobile Emergency Response support (MERS) \n     Detachment from Thomasville, GA, deployed five Field \n     Assessment Team (FAsT) vehicles and six MERS Support Element \n     (MSE) personnel to Columbia, SC, to support National FAsT-A. \n     Additionally, the Thomasville MERS has deployed 30 vehicles \n     and 41 personnel to Warner-Robins AFB near Macon, GA, to \n     await direction following landfall of Hurricane FRAN.\n       The Maynard, MA, MERS Detachment spent the night near \n     Richmond, VA, enroute to Raleigh, NC. Maynard MERS has \n     deployed 19 vehicles and 22 personnel. The Denton MERS \n     deployed 5 FAsT vehicles and 6 MSE personnel to Raleigh, via \n     U.S. Air Force C-17 aircraft to support National FAsT-B.\n       The Mobile Air Transportable Telecommunications System \n     (MATTS) has deployed one truck and two personnel with two \n     ground satellite terminal systems to Columbia, SC, in support \n     of the FEMA Recovery Channel. In addition, the remainder of \n     the Denton MERS Detachment and the MATTS continue on alert.\n       Tentatively, plans call for the State of South Carolina to \n     transport the National FAsT Team and members of two State \n     Assessment Teams with a limited complement of FAsT equipment \n     and supplies to the anticipated impact areas along the coast. \n     The three teams will merge into two units and work as \n     Federal/State teams.\n       Staff from Mt. Weather are enroute to the Carolinas with a \n     full complement of communications and support equipment. \n     Arrival is anticipated to be during the morning of September \n     6. The equipment includes: 5 vehicles (2 cargo vans, 1 \n     passenger van, 1 Bronco and 1 Explorer); 2 satellite \n     downlink/uplink dishes (1 viedo, 1 digital); 1 G3 PBX with \n     300 phones; 1 data router; miscellaneous equipment for the \n     Advance ERT-N Team (16 VHF radios, 1 VHF repeater, 6 \n     satellite telephones and some cellular phones).\n       The FEMA National Hurricane Center Liaison Team is in the \n     National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida and continues to \n     provide FEMA Headquarters with storm updates.\n       FEMA is identifying and preparing to ship numerous Initial \n     Response Resources (IRR) to support hurricane response \n     efforts. These resources include tarpaulins, plastic \n     sheeting, tents, cots, sleeping bags, blankets, emergency \n     portable generators, flashlights and portable radios.\n       A. Information and Planning Section (ESF #5) began \n     operations on Wednesday, September 5, and has been supporting \n     two daily situation status briefings, as well as preparing \n     daily situation reports, population maps of the affected \n     areas and predicted hurricane tracks.\n\n                    (1) Defense coordinating element\n\n       The Department of Defense Liaison indicated that three \n     mobilization points have been identified depending on where \n     the hurricane hits. If FRAN makes landfall south of \n     Charleston, South Carolina, the Base Support Installation \n     (BSI) will be Fort Stewart, near Savannah, Georgia. If the \n     hurricane makes landfall south of Camp Lejeune, South \n     Carolina, the BSI will be Fort Jackson, Columbia, South \n     Carolina. If the storm makes landfall north of Camp Lejeune, \n     the BSI will be Fort Bragg, Fayetteville, North Carolina. \n     Each BSI must be habitable.\n       After landfall, but prior to a Presidential Declaration, \n     DOD will be ready to provide support under Section 403(C) of \n     the Stafford Act. The DoD Director of Military Support will \n     coordinate such support. It will consist of air transport for \n     various kinds of response and support teams, \n     telecommunications systems and other needed materiel.\n\n                     (2) Operations support branch\n\n       a. ESF #1 (Transportation). A temporary Crisis Management \n     Center is operational on a limited basis tracking the \n     hurricane. A small watch team was on duty during the night. A \n     complete augmentation cadre from all operating \n     administrations will be activated September 6.\n       Federal Aviation Administration Crisis Response Working \n     Groups are active. Two mobile communications teams are on \n     standby. One team will support GSA regional operations and \n     the other FAA response and reconstitution efforts.\n       All air facilities within 75 miles of the coast line in the \n     storm watch area are at the highest level of preparedness. \n     Facilities in Florida and Georgia are back on routine status. \n     Facilities in Virginia are at Readiness Level Alpha.\n       The Federal Railway Administration is working with the \n     railroads to assess their storm preparedness. FRA \n     headquarters emergency staff will check with FRA Region III \n     to determine specific impacts on CSXT and Norfolk Southern \n     operations. Both carriers have experience with such storms \n     and have emergency plans in place.\n       RESPA/OPS has contacted State pipeline safety offices in \n     the Carolinas, Florida and Georgia to coordinate preparations \n     for the storm. The OPS Eastern Region Office will monitor \n     conditions in this area if we begin to experience flooding.\n       The Coast Guard districts along the east coast are in the \n     highest readiness condition possible. The Coast Guard has \n     received from the Secretary of Transportation involuntary \n     recall authority for reservists.\n       Hurricane FRAN has had the following impacts on \n     transportation.\n       The following North Carolina airports were closed: New \n     Hanover International, Wilmington, Myrtle Beach \n     International; Guard Strand, Myrtle Beach; Beaufort County; \n     Hilton Head; and Fayetteville Regional/Grannis Field.\n       Effective September 5 AMTRAK suspended operations on trains \n     81/91 and 82/92 (Silver Star) and trains 97 and 98 (Silver \n     Meteor), both New York to Florida trains. These suspensions \n     will last at least through September 6.\n       The U.S. Coast Guard Captain of the Port closed these \n     ports: Charleston and Georgetown, South Carolina and \n     Wilmington, North Carolina.\n       b. ESF #2 (Communications). Georgia Emergency Management \n     Agency has arranged with AT for a representative in the \n     EOC.\n       GTE Mobile NET is staging backup equipment at Raleigh/\n     Durham, North Carolina. GTE Telephone Operations in Myrtle \n     Beach and Georgetown also has equipment at the closed Myrtle \n     Beach AFB it can activate if the base becomes a Disaster \n     Field Office (DFO) site.\n       The FEMA/Mount Weather Emergency Assistance Center (MWEAC) \n     Communications Resource Manager has been given area points of \n     contact for GTE and BELLCORE.\n       c. ESF #7 (Resource Support). The General Services \n     Administration EOC became active at 7:00 a.m. EDT Wednesday. \n     Its counterpart ESF #7 did the same.\n       GSA Region IV has deployed a number of personnel to the \n     ROC, to the ERT-A or to other units. In addition other \n     personnel are on stand-by. ESF 7 is contributing to the \n     Federal response in the following ways: Determining sources \n     for and costs of obtaining 40 shower units and 600 portable \n     toilets with cleaning service for North and South Carolina; \n     procuring the identified initial response resources on the \n     commercial market; deploying the ERT-A for each state; \n     contracting for two 53-foot trailers each day to move FEMA-\n     help initial response resources to the disaster area.\n       Operational goals for the next 24-hour period include the \n     following: Continue to assist in deploying the initial \n     response resources to the affected States; continue to locate \n     additional resources; determine the location of the disaster \n     Field Offices and mobilization points; recover and restore \n     General Services Administration and Federal operations in the \n     disaster area; provide protection for all federally-owned or \n     leased facilities.\n       GSA Region III is arranging to provide 9 drivers and \n     tractors (rated at 80,000 lbs. gross weight) to move \n     preloaded refrigerated trailers filled with an assortment of \n     IRR items from the Regional Emergency Inventory Center at \n     Fort Gillem, Atlanta, Georgia. In addition, Region III is \n     arranging to provide drivers, tractors and trailers to load \n     and move 768 rolls of plastic sheeting from Thomasville, \n     Georgia, to Fort Gillem.\n       Region III staff has contacted 29 vendors in the Georgia, \n     North Carolina and South Carolina areas, and 25 of the \n     vendors stated that they will be moving their equipment out \n     of the affected areas until after the storm subsidies. Once \n     damages have been assessed, the vendors would be willing to \n     assist. Four of the vendors are looking for drivers and \n     trucks to handle this request. Sheila Madison will be on duty \n     at 6 a.m. EDT September 6 to handle this problem.\n\n                   (3) Infrastructure support branch\n\n       The Infrastructure Support Branch continues to monitor all \n     activities of ESF #3, #12, and the FEMA Infrastructure \n     Officer. An action tracking updates shows that 50 generators \n     are being moved from Fort Stewart to Fort Jackson and 50 \n     more from Jacksonville, FL. These moves are to anticipate \n     requests from North Carolina.\n       The Infrastructure Teams for ERT-N Red Team arrived in \n     Atlanta, GA, late on September 6 and is scheduled to deploy \n     Friday morning to Raleigh, NC. And the ERT-N Red Team will \n     deploy to Raleigh, from Columbia SC.\n       As Hurricane FRAN came ashore and moved slowly north, there \n     are no damage data or impact assessment at this time. \n     Preliminary damage assessment teams are scheduled to be in \n     the field once daylight arrives.\n       a. ESF #3 (Public Works & Engineering). During the past 24 \n     hours the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) continued \n     preparations for individual and multi-state response. Two \n     backup divisions were alerted and their EOCs activated to \n     Level 1. ESF Representatives are enroute to Columbia, South \n     Carolina, and Atlanta, Georgia, with a September 6 arrival \n     anticipated.\n       Fifty generators are being moved from Jacksonville, \n     Florida, to Ft. Jackson, South Carolina and an additional 50 \n     from Ft. Stewart to Ft. Jackson. They will remain there\n\n[[Page S10188]]\n\n     until FEMA decides on their use. Also, 25,000 liters of water \n     were moved to Ft. Gillem, Atlanta, Georgia. They will remain \n     there until FEMA decides their use.\n       During the next 24 hours USACE will spend a FAsT \n     representative to Columbia, South Carolina. Contingency \n     planning will focus on the following activities: Identify \n     backup command structures and hand-off procedures for smooth \n     transition from division to division and district to \n     district; identify possible displacement locations for the \n     district; be prepared to relocate or deploy generators, if \n     needed; be prepared to respond to multi-sate disaster \n     requirements; coordinate the transfer of water and ice \n     obtained through the Atlanta Council of Government to Fort \n     Jackson, South Carolina.\n       b. ESF #12 (Energy). Coordination with the Nuclear \n     Regulatory Commission is taking place.\n\n                       (4) Human services branch\n\n       a. The Human Services Section of the ERT-N Red Team Advance \n     Element established contact with the Region IV ROC and Region \n     IV ERT-A in Raleigh. Arrangements are complete to start \n     preliminary damage assessment activities. The Small Business \n     Administration will participate in this process in both \n     states. Initial contacts with ESF-6, the National \n     Teleregistration Center and the National Processing Service \n     Center have occurred. When the President approves a disaster \n     declaration for a State, the 1-800 number for national \n     teleregistration will be released to the public.\n       b. ESF #11 (Food).

Mr. President, we know that you have to get generators \naround at the fast food places. People do not have power. They are not \npreparing meals. You are working trying to get the mud out of the house \nand trying to stop the roof from leaking.\n  So, if you can get a hamburger, fine. Incidentally, we also found \nthat we needed food stamps for 10 days to be honored and redeemed at \nthe fast food places. We needed a supply company. People volunteered \nall around the country, and it started flowing in. And we were afraid \nthat the perishables would spoil.\n  So, Gen. Colin Powell sent me a supply company from Georgia up to \nCharleston so we could handle it. All of these kinds of things we \nworked on, and finally came to the floor with the holdup by the mayor. \nThat occurred, and the letter came from FEMA that the Governor had to \ntake care of 25 percent of the cost, and the Governor bucked 13 percent \nof the 25 percent to the mayor. The mayor said, ``Wait a minute. If I \nhave to pay 13 percent of all costs for all of these troops and help \nand companies, what have you, I will have to raise taxes. After \neverybody is taken care of and happy, I will be out of office.'' So, \nmore or less there was a freeze of the balance.\n  When we got on the floor here in the U.S. Senate with Alan Simpson on \nthe other side of the aisle, after day 8, 9, and finally day 15, we \ncleared that because we had the law in the Pennsylvania case where they \npay 100 percent. James Lee Witt was there 100 percent with all of the \nunits of government and joining hands and doing an outstanding job.\n  So having criticized FEMA, I think it is only noteworthy here and \ndeserved that I should say that we properly praise him.\n\n[[Page S10190]]\n\n  I thank the distinguished leaders of this bill for yielding me the \ntime.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/10/senate-section/article/S10185-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TREASURY, POSTAL SERVICE, AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                                  1997\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nJeffords, Dorgan, Conrad, Inouye, Harkin, Leahy, Thurmond, Akaka, and \nDaschle be added as cosponsors of the IRS reorganization amendment that \nI offered earlier.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, we are about to go out here pretty soon. I \nwant to talk a couple of minutes prior to that. Whenever we get ready \nto propound the UC to come back in tomorrow, I will cease and desist \nand pick it up again tomorrow.\n  I indicated earlier my support for the administration's selection of \nGeneral McCaffrey to be the drug czar, the head of OMDCP. Indeed, I \nmust say that I believe that some of that change can be attributed to \nlast year Senator Shelby and I objected to the funding of the OMDCP \noffice. That is when Dr. Brown was still there. We objected. We didn't \nsee much progress. Change was made, and Senator Shelby and I support \nGeneral McCaffrey and his position.\n  There are three things that I think we need to focus on. One is you \nhave to reduce the number of young people that are starting to use \ndrugs to zero. That is only going to occur with the President leading.\n  A lot of people made fun of Ronald Reagan and Nancy Reagan when they \ndid this, ``Just say no.'' But the fact is it works. Kids do not know \ngray. They do not know in between. It is either yes or no, hot or cold, \nblack or white. You have to say ``no'' over and over. Otherwise they \nwill start. So that is issue No 1.\n  You can see one of the reasons that we were concerned last year. You \ncan see that of all the problems that we have--I do not know if you can \nsee it on this pretty small thing compared to what we normally put up \ndown here: marijuana, LSD, inhalants. In Nebraska we had a young man \nrecently who was killed as a result of consumption of methamphetamine. \nEvery State in the country is now seeing a substantial increase in \nmethamphetamine. It is a drug more dangerous than cocaine because of \nits impact upon the body, more difficult to detect, and we are seeing \nincreased consumption. That is why people are concerned. In spite of \nsome success in other areas, we are not willing to battle it when it \ncomes to youth.\n  This is another little chart that shows alcohol and marijuana use in \nNebraska in 1993 through 1995. It is up.\n  I just do not think there is any other workable solution than the \nPresident of the United States on national television saying to the \nyouth of America, ``Just say no.'' Over and over and over, we saw in \nthe entertainment industry the bad guys who are the ones who smoked, \ndrank, and did drugs--not the good guys. You have to send a message out \nthere that these drugs are dangerous, and say to young people, ``Just \ndo not do them.''\n  Second, the big area is in the area of interdiction and reducing the \namount of drugs coming in. Senator Shelby has been on our committee \ntaking a big lead in making sure that our law enforcement people have \nthe resources they need to knock those drugs down.\n  The third area that I would like to call a little bit of attention to \nis the area of hardcore drug users. I am going to go through a couple \nof charts very quickly just so people understand how we spend our $15 \nbillion. This little thing you probably can't see. That is the drug \nczar up there; $137 million; Justice spent $7 billion; HHS, $2.3 \nbillion; Treasury, $1.1 billion; even Veterans' Affairs spent $1 \nbillion; Defense $800 million; Education $658 million. That is the \nproportion. The pie is put together something like that.\n  But one of the most interesting, and I think telling, facts for an \nawful lot of us trying to figure out what to do, tell the kids ``no,'' \nand give the law enforcement people the resources. There is almost \nuniversal agreement on that.\n  But one of the most difficult problems is this fact. This is how much \nevery single year since 1987, and this is how far this goes back--10 \nyears. You can actually track it all the way back if you want to. We \nhave been spending more and more, with a different mix of expenditures; \ndifferent sort of combinations; one year a little more interdiction; \none year maybe prevention, and treatment--all of this different mix of \nefforts. The number of hardcore drug users stayed the same at about 2.7 \nmillion. It is a very important fact.\n  I do not have an answer to it. I do not really know myself what we \nneed to be doing with hardcore drug users. I had some experience in it. \nI was trained in pharmacy prior to getting a preinduction notice from \nmy draft board and signing up for the world's hardest, most powerful \nNavy. I was trained in that. I was a patient in a hospital. My roommate \nwas addicted to Dilantin from serious burns. So I got some experience \nwith addiction.\n  It seems to me that just in general terms the solution lies somewhere \nout there in the market. The solution I would love to see would be the \nPresident--because he is the guy in the pulpit--saying to the \npharmaceutical companies, ``Look. You sell about $80 billion of over-\nthe-counter and prescription drugs every single year to 260 million \nAmericans, plus or minus a few millions. That is $80 billion a year.'' \nThe Senator from South Carolina was talking about jobs in America. The \npharmaceutical industry is one of the most important employers in the \nUnited States. These 2.7 million hardcore drug users spend $60 billion \na year to feed their drug habit. That is a lot of money, as I see it. \nIt is almost three-fourths of all the money that is being spent on \nlegal drugs by Americans through pharmaceutical companies. I believe \nthe pharmaceutical companies know a lot about addiction. It is an \naddiction. They know a lot about addiction. They have done research on \nit. They have had experience all the way for the last 30 years. I know \nthat when I was practicing pharmacy in 1965 our No. 1 moving \npharmaceutical in the store in Lincoln where I worked was Dexedrine. \nThey then said that Dexedrine was not habit forming. We now know it is \nvery seriously addictive, and we have restricted access to it.\n  I would put a challenge to it. There must be some better solution to \nwhat we have right now. Again, I have not reached any conclusion. I am \nnot talking about legalization. I am not talking about basically \nthrowing open the door and letting people have at it. But I know that \nwhen something is constant, when a number remains relatively constant, \nwe ought to pay attention to it. I pay attention to gravity. I pay \nattention to things that stay the same no matter what I do. And the \nnumber of hardcore drug users in the United States of America has \nstayed the same regardless of what we have done.\n  I think it deserves some additional attention by any Member who is \ntrying to figure out how to make this $15 billion-plus expenditure that \nwe make every single year work so that we can say that we are getting \nthe job done.\n  Again, I want to repeat. When it comes to kids, it has to be, ``Just \nsay no.''\n  It has to be from parents. It has to be from political leaders, and \nthe most important political leader is the President of the United \nStates. When it comes to interdiction, you just have to play hardball \nwith these guys. They are bad guys. They have to be dealt with very \nfirmly. You have to put an unwelcome sign out in the United States, in \nevery single State. You have to make sure that local law enforcement \npeople have the resources to get convictions, and on and on.\n  But as for these hardcore drug users, I have to tell you, Mr. \nPresident, I am not persuaded at all that the status quo is working. \nAll I have to offer right now is a big question mark. I have no \nanswers, which is not altogether unusual for me when it comes to these \nmore complex and difficult subjects.\n  I am through with my remarks here. We are ready to go out.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to take a moment to congratulate my \nfriend, Billy Clyde Diffie, who entered the ranks of retired persons on \nAugust 31, 1996.\n  Billy Clyde Diffie was born on March 27, 1934 in Ohatchee, AL to Carl \nand Alta Diffie. He graduated from Ohatchee High School, where he \nexcelled as a running back. He followed in his father's footsteps by \nlater taking a job at the Anniston Foundry in Anniston, AL. In July \n1959, he began a career with the Alabama Highway Department as an \nengineer assistant. Over the next three and a half decades, until his \nretirement last month, he worked his way through the engineer grades \nall the way to the rank of CE 1--civil engineer.\n  Right by his side during his long career with the Alabama Highway \nDepartment was his wife, Vera Sue, who he married on April 17, 1953. \nThey have five children, Rodney Clyde, Stanley Keith, Anthony Karl, \nPamela Rene, and Kimberly Sue. All five children graduated from \nSylacauga High School in Sylacauga, AL, where the Diffies reside in the \nFairmont Community. They have just recently purchased a second home in \nLaguna Beach, FL, just in time for his retirement. The house is located \nbetween his brother's beach house and his sister's on the other side.\n  As his children were growing up, Billy was very active in little \nleague baseball both as a parent and as an umpire. He also coached \nbaseball and football and was active in the youth program at the Marble \nCity Baptist Church.\n  I congratulate and commend Billy Clyde Diffie on his outstanding \ncareer and wish him all the best for a happy, healthy retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/10/senate-section/article/S10191-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 5:56 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House agrees \nto the concurrent resolution (H.

A bill to amend title II of the Trade Act of 1974 to clarify \nthe definition of domestic industry and to include certain agricultural \nproducts for purposes of providing relief from injury caused by import \ncompetition, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               The Agricultural Trade Reform Act of 1996\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today \nto give agricultural producers, including potato producers, some \nimportant and badly needed new tools for combating injurious increases \nin imports from foreign countries.\n  The Trade Act of 1974 contains provisions that permit U.S. industries \nto\n\n[[Page S10193]]\n\nseek relief from serious injury caused by increased quantities of \nimports. In practice, however, it has been very difficult for many U.S. \nindustries to actually secure action under the act to remedy this kind \nof injury.\n  The ineffectiveness of the act results from some of the specific \nlanguage in the statute. Specifically, the law requires the \nInternational Trade Commission, when evaluating a petition for relief \nfrom injury, to consider whether the injury affects the entire U.S. \nindustry, or a segment of an industry located in a major geographic \narea of the U.S. whose production constitutes a substantial portion of \nthe total domestic injury. This language has been interpreted by the \nITC to mean that all or nearly all of the U.S. industry must be \nseriously injured by the imports before it can qualify for any relief.\n  Thus, if an important segment of an industry is being severely \ninjured by imports that compete directly with that segment, the \nbusinesses who comprise this portion of the industry will not have much \nrecourse--even though the industry segment in question may employ \nthousands of Americans and generate billions of dollars annually for \nthe U.S. economy. In other words, our current trade laws leave large \nsegments of an industry that serve particular regions and markets, or \nhave other distinguishing features, practically helpless in the face of \nsharp and damaging import surges.\n\n  In addition, even if large industry subdivisions could qualify for \nassistance, the timeframes under the Trade Act for expedited, or \nprovisional, relief for agricultural products are too long to respond \nin time to prevent or adequately remedy injury caused by increasing \nimports. At a minimum, 3 months must elapse before any relief can be \nprovided, irrespective of the damage that American businesses may \nsuffer during that time. And 3 months is an absolute minimum. In \nreality, it could take substantially longer to provide expedited \nrelief.\n  Mr. President, when it comes to agricultural products, the problems \nin U.S. trade law that I have described are particularly acute. Due to \ntheir perishable nature, many agricultural products cannot be \ninventoried until imports subside or the ITC grants relief--if the \nindustry is so fortunate--many months or even years later. And most \nagricultural producers, who are heavily dependent on credit each year \nto produce and sell a crop, cannot wait that long. They need assistance \nin the short term, while the injury is occurring, if they are going to \nsurvive an import surge. Also, because crops are grown during \nparticular seasons and serve specific markets related to production in \nthose growing seasons, the agricultural industry is more prone to \nsegmentation. Finally, many of the agricultural industry entities that \nwould have to file a petition for relief under the Trade Act are really \ngrower groups that do not necessarily have the financial wherewithal to \nspend millions of dollars researching, filing, and pursuing a petition \nbefore the ITC.\n  The bill that I have introduced today is designed to empower \nAmerica's agricultural producers to seek and obtain effective remedies \nfor damaging import surges. It will make the Trade Act more user \nfriendly for American businesses. Unlike the current law, which sets \ncriteria for ITC consideration that are impossible to meet and that do \nnot reflect the realities of today's industry, my bill establishes more \nuseful criteria. It permits the ITC to consider the impacts of import \nsurges on an important segment of an agricultural industry when \ndetermining whether a domestic industry has been injured by imports. \nThis segment is defined as a portion of the domestic industry located \nin a specific geographic area whose collective production constitutes a \nsignificant portion of the entire domestic industry. The ITC would also \nbe required to consider whether this segment primarily serves the \ndomestic market in the specific geographic area, and whether \nsubstantial imports are entering the area.\n\n  Rather than rely solely on an industry petition to initiate an ITC \nreview of whether provisional, or expedited, relief deserves to be \ngranted, my bill would permit the U.S. Trade Representative or the \nCongress, via a resolution, to request such review.\n  Because the time frames in the present law for considering and \nproviding provisional relief are so long that the damage from imports \ncan already be done well before a decision by the ITC is ever issued, \nthis bill would shorten the time frame for provisional relief \ndeterminations by the ITC by allowing the commission to waive, in \ncertain circumstances, the act's requirement that imports be monitored \nby the USTR for at least 90 days.\n  And, finally, the bill expands the list of agricultural products \neligible for provisional relief to include any potato product, \nincluding processed potato products. Under current law, only perishable \nagricultural products and citrus products are eligible to apply for \nexpedited relief determinations. But this narrow eligibility list \nunreasonably excludes important U.S. agribusinesses, such as our frozen \nfrench fry producers, from the expedited remedies available in the \nTrade Act.\n  Major American companies like Ore-Ida and Lamb Weston have reported \nthat U.S. companies have lost 150 million pounds of french fry sales in \nthe U.S. market to Canada in 1996 alone due to Canadian imports priced \nbelow market rates. And Canada, particularly the western provinces, has \ndramatically expanded its french fry production capacity to expand \nexports to the United States even further over the next several years. \nWithout the changes in my bill, these critical American businesses will \nhave no effective means for combating a Canadian import surge in the \nnext year.\n  For too long, American agriculture has been trying to combat \nsophisticated foreign competition with the equivalent of sticks and \nstones. My bill strengthens the position of American agricultural \nproducers in the competitive arena, and will either provide effective \nremedies for agricultural producers, or provide effective deterrents to \nthe depredations of their competitors from other countries. I hope \nother Senators with an interest in fair play for our domestic \nagricultural producers will join me in cosponsoring this important \nlegislation. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2061\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency \nPrevention Act of 1974, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n       juvenile justice and delinquency modernization act of 1996\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, noting that the occupant of the chair is \nthe chairman of the subcommittee of jurisdiction of the Judiciary \nCommittee and noting that he and others on that committee have been \nworking diligently in an effort to modernize the Juvenile Justice Act \nwhich has been on the books for a long time and obviously is in need of \nmodernization, I rise today to introduce a bill which I hope the \nsubcommittee and the Committee of the Judiciary will take into \nconsideration as they put together a modern bill. I choose to call my \nbill, which is comprehensive and is the result of some long work on my \npart and some hard work on the part of a number of people, the Juvenile \nJustice Modernization Act of 1996.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Juvenile Justice \nModernization Act of 1996, a bill to change the focus of our Federal \njuvenile crime and delinquency prevention efforts. Simply put, the \ncurrent Federal approach to juvenile crime is outdated, under-funded \nand ineffective. It fails to address today's increasingly violent \njuvenile offender, while simultaneously imposing unrealistic burdens on \nState and local governments.\n  The nature of juvenile crime has changed substantially since Congress \nfirst enacted the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act over \n20 years ago. From 1985 to 1994, the teen homicide rate increased 172 \npercent. Today, more kids use more drugs, have more guns and commit \nmore violent crimes than ever before. Violent street gangs have begun \nto supply children with the sense of belonging once provided by the \ntraditional family structure. The time has come for a greater Federal \nrole in combating violent juvenile crime, but that new role should not \ntie the hands of State and local governments nor prevent them from \nimplementing new and innovative solutions to this growing problem.\n  In July, Senator Thompson, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee's \nSubcommittee on Youth Violence, and I held a hearing in my home State \nof New Mexico to address this issue. New Mexico faces many of the same \nproblems as other States--rising youth violence, increased teen \npregnancy rates, overburdened law enforcement, judicial and corrections \nsystems and a lack of adequate funding for juvenile crime prevention \nand enforcement programs. In New Mexico alone, 43 percent of the \njuveniles in State correctional facilities had at least 10 prior \nreferrals to the juvenile system, 75 percent have a history of \ncommitting violent crime, 80 percent have a history of gang \ninvolvement, 67 percent have been truant, dropped out or expelled from \nschool, and 63 percent report weekly use of drugs or alcohol. Clearly \nmy State, like most others, faces an enormous challenge.\n  When we held our hearings, I proposed that we should increase Federal \nfunding to allow States to implement better prevention programs and law \nenforcement and prosecution policies which reflect the changing nature \nof juvenile crime. This bill increases Federal juvenile justice funding \nfrom $160 to $500 million and creates two separate $250 million block \ngrants for States.\n  The first $250 million will be available to States in much the same \nmanner as under the current Federal law. However, the bill eliminates \ntwo of the most burdensome mandates in Federal law and makes it easier \nfor States to meet the remaining ones.\n  However, we cannot simply throw money at the States and expect that \nthe problem will go away. States must be willing to try new and \ninnovative approaches and get tough on the most violent juvenile \noffenders. The second $250 million will fund incentive grants, \navailable to States which enact certain juvenile justice reforms. Many \nof the suggested reforms in the bill came from ideas raised at the \nhearings we held in New Mexico. At those hearings, we heard from a wide \nvariety of witnesses, and I want to tell you what they told us, because \nmany of them had thoughtful criticisms and solutions to the problems \nStates and localities face in dealing with juvenile crime.\n  We heard from judges, who described to us the lack of respect many \nkids have for the justice system. Children are not born with a lack of \nrespect for law and order, it is learned after numerous contacts with a \ncriminal justice system that typically imposes no penalties until the \nchild commits a heinous act of violence. As one judge so eloquently \nstated:\n\n       The initial contact with the law is a very important event \n     in a young delinquent's life * * * when that contact occurs \n     and nothing of significance occurs, as the youth perceives \n     matters, that youth has turned a corner and formed an opinion \n     about the law enforcement community.\n\n  The judges universally agreed that the No. 1 thing we need to do in \nour juvenile justice system is create a system of graduated sanctions, \nso that every delinquent act--no matter how small--has a sure, swift \nand substantial punishment. For quite some time, our juvenile courts \nhave focused too heavily on rehabilitation and not\n\n[[Page S10195]]\n\nenough on punishment. We instead need balance--we need to use \npunishment as well as treatment to re-teach kids the difference between \nright and wrong.\n  When confronted with certain penalties for bad acts, children respond \nand are less likely to re-offend in the future. This bill encourages \nStates to implement graduated sanctions programs and provides them with \nthe resources to do so.\n  We also heard from director of the Children, Youth and Families \nDepartment in New Mexico, and the superintendent of the largest \njuvenile correctional facility in the State. While both noted the need \nto hold juveniles accountable for their actions, they also indicated \nthe need to get parents involved in the process and to make sure that \njuveniles who are parents take responsibility for their children. \nAccording to one witness who has worked with delinquent kids for over \n20 years,\n\n       Two decades ago, when kids were misbehaving or out of \n     control, [she] could talk to Mom and Dad about it. Now, \n     parents have become enablers rather than good role models who \n     set limits.\n\n  My bill will encourage States to enact laws and pursue programs to \nstrengthen families in order to prevent the next generation of kids \nfrom growing up without parents and without discipline. It will require \njuveniles who have children to take financial responsibility for them \nas a condition of their parole or probation. It also will encourage \nStates to enact laws to impose civil liability on parents for the \ndestructive acts of their children and will provide more money for \nprevention programs to give families a better chance to raise their \nchildren so that they never get into trouble.\n  At our hearing, we also heard from educators and community leaders. \nThey universally noted the need to keep kids in school, and to give \nthem constructive things to do and positive role models to guide them. \nMy bill will encourage States to adopt zero-tolerance truancy policies, \nenhanced mentoring programs and to increase the availability of \neducational and recreational programs that benefit all children. It \nalso will encourage States to provide alternative classrooms and \nschools for delinquent kids, so that children who are expelled for \ndisciplinary reasons are not simply forgotten and left out of the \neducation system. The easiest way to ensure that children will become \ncriminals is to expel them from school and deny them an education. \nChildren deserve every opportunity to get an education, and my bill \nwill encourage that.\n  Finally, at our hearing we heard from the victims of violent juvenile \ncrime. Their compelling stories convinced me of the need to change the \nway we currently treat the most violent juveniles. In my State, an \ninnocent young girl was brutally attacked by a 15-year-old young man \nwho stabbed her in the neck as part of his gang initiation. The attack \nleft her paralyzed. In New Mexico, the maximum sentence the young man \ncan receive is a little over 4 years in a juvenile facility. Here is \nwhat the 18-year-old victim said about our current juvenile justice \nsystem:\n\n       The out-dated laws which exist in our legal system today \n     are nothing but a joke to juveniles. Our laws were meant for \n     juveniles who were committing crimes like truancy and \n     breaking curfews. They are not designed to deal with the \n     violent crimes that juveniles are committing today.\n\n  For any Senator who has spoken to victims of juvenile crime in their \nState, I think this comment sums up the fear and frustration felt \naround the country. Our system protects violent juvenile criminals \nrather than protecting victims. Unless a kid commits murder, our system \nusually fails to hold him accountable for his actions. That must \nchange, and this bill encourages States to adopt mandatory adult \nprosecution for juveniles over age 14 who commit serious violent \ncrimes.\n  The bill also protects victims in other ways--by giving States an \nincentive to adopt victims' rights legislation, to allow for open \naccess to juvenile court proceedings, and to require adult records, \nincluding fingerprints and photographs, be kept for violent juveniles. \nVictims and their families should have access to court proceedings, the \nright to know when a criminal has been sentenced, when he will be \nreleased, and the public has a right to be protected from future \nviolent acts through the imposition of adult sentences for adult \ncrimes. If States adopt these suggested reforms, and I think that many \nStates will, our streets will be safer and there will be fewer innocent \nvictims of violent juvenile crime.\n  Mr. President, I realize that we cannot change the juvenile justice \nsystem overnight. And I realize that this is for the most part, an \nissue which must be dealt with at the State and local level. But the \nFederal Government has a role to play and a responsibility to fulfill. \nThat responsibility is to ensure that our streets are safe by giving \nStates the resources and flexibility to implement new and innovative \nsolutions to this very serious problem. My bill provides some \nsuggestions on how we might do that.\n  I realize that time is short in this Congress, but I really believe \nthat we can no longer sweep this problem under the rug and act like the \ncurrent approach actually works. Clearly, it does not. I hope that my \ncolleagues will support my efforts along with the efforts of others, \nthat we will give our input to the committees of jurisdiction and \nultimately vote on the floor of the Senate to dramatically change the \nFederal Government's role as it pertains to youth offenders in the \nUnited States.\n\n  In summary, we will repeal the following mandates found in the \nJuvenile Justice Act:\n  Deinstitutionalization of status offenders, those juveniles who \ncommit acts that are criminal if committed by a child but not criminal \nif done by an adult. We will remove youths from adult jails and \nlockups, and we will provide flexibility to States by changing the \ncurrent law on ``sight and sound'' separation found in the Juvenile \nJustice Act into a broad principle: States must provide physical \nseparation for incarcerated juveniles and adults, but not necessarily \nsight-and-sound separation, which has been such a burden and so \nexpensive, in particular in rural and small town facilities in the \nUnited States. We need to provide for the sharing of staff in \nfacilities, not require that there be separate staff in each instance.\n  We make new findings and purposes for this entire section. Then, \nultimately, we say that our States will receive incentive grants if \nthey do the following three things:\n  Implement graduated sanctions, whereby every juvenile offender \nreceives punishment for every crime, no matter how small. Punishment \nshould be of an increasing severity, based on the nature of the crime \nand if the juvenile is a repeat offender.\n  Second, fingerprint and photography records to be kept for juveniles \n15 and under who commit felonies, and, finally, mandatory adult \nprosecution for juveniles 14 years and older who commit serious violent \ncrimes.\n  In addition to these three, without which the incentive grants will \nnot be available, we provide a long list of actions that many think are \nrequired in our States if we are ever going to get a handle on this, \nand then ask the States, as their best practices, to adopt at least \nfive of them. These reforms have been suggested by the very best people \nwho are out there in the field struggling to do something about this \nvery serious problem.\n  Mr. President, I have a section-by-section analysis and an outline \nand short table of contents of the bill. I ask unanimous consent that \nthey be printed in the Record and that the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was orderd to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2062\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Nation's juvenile justice system is in trouble--\n     facilities are dangerously overcrowded, field staff is \n     overworked, and a growing number of children are breaking the \n     law;\n       (2) a redesigned juvenile corrections program for the next \n     century should be based on 4 principles--accountability for \n     offenders and their families, restitution for victims, \n     community-based prevention, and community involvement;\n       (3) existing programs have not adequately responded to the \n     particular problems of juvenile delinquents in the 1990's;\n       (4) State and local communities, which experience directly \n     the devastating failure of the juvenile justice system, do \n     not presently have sufficient resources to deal \n     comprehensively with the problems of juvenile crime and \n     delinquency;\n       (5) limited State and local resources are being \n     unnecessarily wasted complying with overly technical Federal \n     requirements for ``sight and sound'' separation currently in \n     effect under the 1974 Act. Prohibiting the commingling of \n     adults and juvenile populations would achieve this important \n     purpose without imposing an undue burden on State and local \n     governments;\n       (6) limited State and local resources are being \n     unnecessarily wasted complying with the overly restrictive \n     Federal mandate that no juveniles be detained or confined in \n     any jail or lockup for adults. This mandate is particularly \n     burdensome for rural communities;\n       (7) the juvenile justice system should give additional \n     attention to the problem of juveniles who commit serious \n     crimes, with particular attention given to the area of \n     sentencing;\n       (8) the term ``prevention'' in the context of this Act \n     means both ensuring that families have a greater chance to \n     raise their children so that those children do not engage in \n     criminal or delinquent activities, and preventing children \n     who have engaged in those activities from becoming \n     permanently entrenched in the juvenile justice system;\n       (9) in 1992 alone, there were over 110,000 juvenile arrests \n     for violent crimes, and 16.64 times that number of juvenile \n     arrests for property and other crimes;\n       (10) in 1994, males ages 14 through 24 constituted only 8 \n     percent of the population but accounted for more than 25 \n     percent of all homicide victims and nearly half of all \n     convicted murderers;\n       (11) in a survey of 250 judges, 93 percent of those judges \n     stated that juvenile offenders should be fingerprinted, 85 \n     percent stated that juvenile criminal records should be made \n     available to adult authorities, and 40 percent stated that \n     the minimum age for facing murder charges should be 14 or 15;\n       (12) studies indicate that good parenting skills, including \n     normative development, monitoring, and discipline, clearly \n     affects whether children will become delinquent, and adequate \n     supervision of free-time activities, whereabouts, and peer \n     interaction is critical to ensure that children do not drift \n     into delinquency;\n       (13) 20 years ago, less than half of our Nation's cities \n     reported gang activity, while a generation later, reasonable \n     estimates indicate that there are now more than 500,000 gang \n     members in more than 16,000 gangs on the streets of our \n     cities, and there were more than 580,000 gang crimes in 1993;\n       (14) while the premise of adult corrections is that \n     incarceration prevents the offender from committing \n     additional crimes and punishes the offender by depriving the \n     offender of freedom, the premise of juvenile corrections and \n     this Act is that, unlike adults, children have a significant \n     potential to change and become productive, law-abiding \n     members of society if the juvenile justice system is premised \n     upon accountability, consistent imposition of sanctions and \n     graduated sanctions imposed so that every wrongful Act has a \n     penalty;\n       (15) the high incidence of delinquency in the United States \n     today results in an enormous annual cost and an immeasurable \n     loss of human life, personal security, and wasted human \n     resources; and\n       (16) juvenile delinquency constitutes a growing threat to \n     the national welfare, requiring immediate and comprehensive \n     action by the Federal Government to reduce and eliminate this \n     threat.\n                  TITLE I--REFORM OF EXISTING PROGRAMS\n\n     SEC. 101.

The annual report also \n     must contain a description of activities funded under the \n     Act, an explanation of the extent to which states comply with \n     the requirements of Section 223, a summary and evaluation of \n     each program or activity for which assistance is provided, \n     and a list and description of selected exemplary delinquency \n     prevention programs and accountability-based youth violence \n     reduction practices.\n       Section 104--Amends Section 221 of the JJ Act to \n     authorize the Administrator to make grants to states for \n     initiatives with the additional purposes of holding juveniles \n     accountable for all delinquent acts, increasing public \n     awareness of juvenile proceedings, improving juvenile court \n     and law enforcement records, including fingerprints and \n     photographs and increasing the availability of education \n     programs which benefit all juveniles.\n       Allows the Administrator to use the greater of one percent \n     of the funds made available under the Act or $10 million to \n     establish and maintain a clearinghouse to disseminate to \n     States information on juvenile delinquency, prevention, \n     treatment and control and to provide training and technical \n     assistance to States to improve their juvenile justice \n     systems.\n       Section 105--Amends Section 222 of the JJ Act and \n     creates a new formula for the allocation and distribution of \n     grants under Part B of the Act. $250 million available under \n     this section will be allocated based equally on the number of \n     juveniles in each state, the number of juveniles in the state \n     living below the poverty line and the violent crime rate of \n     the state.\n       Maintains federal funding levels by requiring that each \n     state continue to receive 0.35 percent of one-third of the \n     funds appropriated to carry out the Act. Allows the \n     Administrator and states to use the best available comparable \n     data to determine eligibility under the formula. Eliminates \n     the requirement that states use 5 percent of grant money to \n     assist state advisory groups.\n       Section 106--Amends Section 223 of the JJ Act and \n     eliminates the requirement that states update their plans \n     annually to include new programs and challenge activities. \n     Eliminates the requirement that states form juvenile \n     justice advisory groups. Eliminates the requirement that \n     75 percent of funds be used for particular programs.\n       Eliminates many of the mandates imposed upon states as \n     conditions of receiving federal funds, including \n     deinstitutionalization of status offenders and removal of \n     juveniles from adult jails and lock-ups. Requires that States \n     provide assurances that there is no commingling of or regular \n     contact between juvenile and adult offenders in the same cell \n     or community room in state facilities.\n       Section 107--Repeals several parts in title II of the JJ \n     Act. Eliminates the National Institute for Juvenile Justice \n     and Delinquency Prevention, Special Emphasis Prevention and \n     Treatment Programs, State Challenge Activities, Treatment for \n     Juvenile Offenders Who Are Victims of Child Abuse or Neglect, \n     Mentoring, Boot Camps and the White House Conference on \n     Juvenile Justice. Eliminates state incentive grants for local \n     delinquency prevention programs.\n\n\n      Title II--Incentive Grants for Accountability-Based Reforms\n\n       Section 201--Amends the JJ Act by creating a new Part C. \n     Creates a new Section 241 authorizing the Administrator to \n     award $250 million in new incentive grants for states which \n     enact certain accountability-based reforms to their juvenile \n     justice systems. States must submit applications to the \n     Administrator certifying that the State has\n\n[[Page S10200]]\n\n     enacted or implemented (or will enact or implement within one \n     year) certain laws and policies which will improve the \n     State's juvenile justice system.\n       Creates a new Section 242(a). States must enact the \n     following three reforms in order to receive 50 percent of the \n     funds available under Part C: (1) policies and programs to \n     ensure that juveniles age 14 or over who commit ``serious \n     violent crimes\" are prosecuted as adults; (2) graduated \n     sanctions, ensuring a punishment for every delinquent or \n     criminal act, and ensuring that the sanctions are of \n     increasing severity for each subsequent offense; and (3) \n     require that adult records (including fingerprints and \n     photographs) be kept for juveniles under age 15 who commit \n     ``serious violent crimes.''\n       Creates a new Section 242(b). In addition to the reforms \n     mentioned above, States must enact five of the following in \n     order to receive 100 percent of the funds available under \n     Part C: (1) victims' rights laws; (2) mandatory victim \n     restitution; (3) public access to juvenile court proceedings; \n     (4) juvenile curfews and civil parental responsibility laws \n     for serious acts committed by juveniles released to the \n     custody of their parents; (5) financial responsibility for \n     offspring and successful completion of school or vocational \n     training as a condition of parole or probation; (6) serious \n     habitual offender comprehensive action plans, a multi \n     disciplinary interagency system for the early identification, \n     control, monitoring, supervision and treatment of the most \n     serious juvenile offenders; (7) community-wide partnerships \n     involving county and municipal governments, school districts, \n     State agencies and private organizations to administer a \n     unified approach to juvenile justice; (8) zero tolerance for \n     truancy, including parental notification and mandatory make-\n     up sessions for truants; (9) alternative schools \n     or classrooms for expelled or suspended juveniles; (10) \n     jurisdiction for municipal and magistrate courts over \n     minor delinquency offenses and short-term detention \n     authority for habitual minor delinquency behavior; (11) \n     expedited prosecution procedures and prompt resolution of \n     juvenile cases; (12) eliminate ``counsel and release'' or \n     ``refer and release'' as a penalty for second offenses for \n     which juveniles are referred to a juvenile probation \n     officer; (13) ``report back orders'' whereby juveniles on \n     probation appear before the court and advise the court of \n     their progress in meeting certain goals; (14) mandatory \n     penalties for the use of a firearm during a violent crime \n     or drug felony; (15) laws making it illegal to engage in \n     criminal conduct as a member of a street gang; (16) \n     character education and training; (17) mentoring programs \n     for at-risk youth; (18) courts for juveniles charged with \n     drug offenses and community-oriented policing strategies.\n       Creates a new Section 243. Grants will be allocated \n     proportionately based on the number of residents in the State \n     under the age of 18, in accordance with the following: (1) 50 \n     percent allocated among the States which meet the \n     requirements of Section 242(a); and (2) 50 percent among the \n     States which meet the requirements of Sections 242(a) and \n     242(b).\n       Creates a new Section 244 requiring that States utilize \n     accounting, auditing and fiscal procedures prescribed by the \n     Administrator and that States ensure that funds used will \n     represent the best value for the State at the lowest cost and \n     employ the best available technology.\n       Creates a new Section 245 prohibiting States from using \n     grants to supplant existing State juvenile justice funds. \n     Allows up to 2 percent of available funds be available to the \n     Administrator for research and evaluation projects, and \n     technical assistance. Appropriated funds will carry over and \n     remain available until expended.

New ``Findings'' and ``Purposes'' sections which discuss \n     the increase and changing nature of juvenile crime.\n       2. Repeal the following mandates found in the current \n     Juvenile Justice Act:\n       (a) deinstitutionalization of ``status'' offenders--those \n     juveniles who commit acts that are criminal if committed by a \n     child but not criminal if done by an adult;\n       (b) remove youths from adult jails and lockups; and\n       3. Provide flexibility to states by changing the current \n     law ``sight and sound'' mandate found in the Juvenile Justice \n     Act into a broad principle:\n       (a) provide physical separation of incarcerated juveniles \n     and adults, but not necessarily sight and sound separation;\n       (Need to allow for the sharing of staff and facilities. \n     Rural areas should be able to keep adults and juveniles in \n     the same facility so long as they are in separate cells.)\n       Require states to provide assurances that they are adhering \n     to the principles.\n       4. More money and more flexibility for states:\n\n\n                                 Grants\n\n       Replace Justice's OJJDP with a new office within DOJ's OJP. \n     Make the new Administrator a career person who serves at the \n     pleasure of the Attorney General.\n       Increase funding from $150 million per year to $500 \n     million.\n       Use one-half ($250 million) for grants to the states for \n     prevention programs for juveniles and meeting requirements of \n     the incentive grants. Grants will be distributed \n     proportionately based on number of juveniles below age 18, \n     poverty and crime rates.\n       States could use the money to continue to fund existing \n     programs, create their own new programs or to meet the \n     requirements for the second set of grants.\n       Allow funds to be used for programs directed at all \n     juveniles not just ``at risk'' juveniles. For example, money \n     could be used to keep libraries and gyms open and staffed \n     after hours.\n       No strings other than one mandate regarding minorities and \n     retaining one current mandate, as a ``principle.''\n       States file an action plan with the Office of Juvenile \n     Crime Control and Delinquency Prevention.\n       $250 million for new incentive-based grants for states \n     which enact certain reforms (much like Truth-in-Sentencing).\n       Grants would be used for law enforcement.\n\n\n                 three strings for the incentive grants\n\n       States must certify to the Administrator that they have \n     enacted or will within one year enact laws to require that \n     they have implemented a system of:\n       1. Graduated sanctions, whereby every juvenile offender \n     receives a punishment for every crime.\n       The punishment should be of increasing severity based on \n     the nature of the crime and if the juvenile is a repeat \n     offender.\n       2. Fingerprint and photograph records to be kept for \n     juveniles 15 and under who commit felonies.\n       Records would be kept like adult records--submitted to the \n     FBI, available to law enforcement, courts and schools.\n       For non-felony crimes, records would follow juvenile as \n     long as he/she is in the juvenile system. Whether to seal \n     records would be at the discretion of the judge, but would \n     always be available for law enforcement purposes.\n       For felony crimes (regardless of whether tried as juvenile \n     or adult) records would follow juvenile into adulthood. There \n     would be no special rules allowing sealing of records just \n     because the offender is a juvenile.\n       3. Mandatory adult prosecution for juveniles 14 or over who \n     commit a ``serious violent crimes.''\n       ``Serious violent crimes'' are defined as murder, non-\n     negligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, aggravated \n     assault with a firearm, kidnaping, felony aggravated battery, \n     and vehicular homicide committed while under the influence of \n     an intoxicating liquor or controlled substance.\n       States would also have to enact at least five of the \n     following juvenile justice ``best practices'' to receive the \n     additional funds:\n       1. Provide for victims' rights including final conclusion \n     free from unreasonable delay and right to be notified of any \n     release or escape of an offender who committed a crime \n     against a particular victim.\n       2. Mandatory victim restitution.\n       3. Public access to juvenile court proceedings.\n       4. Parental responsibility laws for serious acts committed \n     by juveniles released to their parents by the court and \n     juvenile curfews.\n       5. Financial responsibility for offspring as condition for \n     parole.\n       6. Serious habitual offenders comprehensive action program. \n     If you do the crime you do the time. Among other items, it \n     establishes a system for tracking the most serious juvenile \n     offenders\n       7. Establish community-wide partnerships involving county, \n     municipal governments, school districts, appropriate state \n     agencies and non-profits to administer a unified approach \n     to delinquency.\n       8. Zero tolerance for truancy. School districts should \n     implement programs to curb truancy and implement certain and \n     swift punishments for truancy. For example, parents should be \n     advised of every absence; schools should hold Saturday \n     ``make-up'' sessions or weekends in jail or denying extra \n     curricular activities to truants.\n       9. Alternative schools or classrooms for expelled or \n     suspended juveniles. Expelled or suspended students should be \n     required to attend. Alternative schools should start earlier \n     and go later than regular school. Counseling, tutoring, \n     community service, and work oriented restitution would be \n     required during extra hours. Any juvenile who refuses to \n     attend alternative school would be subject to immediate \n     detention pending a hearing. Funding made available from the \n     state on a formula for each pupil should follow the child so \n     if the child is put into an alternative school, the state \n     funding should follow that student.\n       10. Provide municipal and magistrate courts with \n     jurisdiction over minor delinquency offenses such as truancy, \n     curfew, motor vehicle violations and graffiti. Authorize \n     Municipal and Magistrate courts short term detention \n     authority in response to persistent minor delinquent \n     behavior.\n\n[[Page S10201]]\n\n       11. Establish expedited procedures for prosecution and \n     prompt resolution of juvenile cases.\n       12. Eliminate ``counsel and release'' or ``refer and \n     release'' as a penalty for a second or subsequent offense.\n       13. Institute a system of ``report back'' orders whenever \n     juveniles are placed on probation so that after a period of \n     time (two months) the juvenile advises the judge of his/her \n     progress toward meeting certain goals.\n       14. Mandatory penalties for the use of a firearm during a \n     violent crime or drug felony.\n       15. Enact a state law making it illegal to engage in \n     criminal conduct as a member of a street gang and enact a \n     street terrorism act.\n       16. Provide Character education and training, like \n     Character Counts.\n       17. Establish mentoring programs for youth in trouble.\n       18.

Mr. President, with Monday's passing of \nbluegrass legend Bill Monroe at the age of 84, Tennessee and the world \nmourn the loss of an American musical original.\n  In a career spanning more than 60 years, Bill Monroe was the \nundisputed king and keeper of the music that he pioneered. In his \ntrademark dress suit, and white, ten-gallon hat, Bill Monroe held the \nstage before admiring audiences around the world who watched him create \nand then popularize bluegrass music.\n  Bill Monroe's music is truly American and completely original. He \ncreated bluegrass from his imagination and named it for the rolling \nhills where he was born.\n  With his band, the ``Blue Grass Boys,'' Monroe mixed the music he \nheard as a child with the blues, Irish fiddle tunes and his own energy \nto create the sound we know today.\n  Bill Monroe's bluegrass is high-powered folk music, known for the \ninstrumental mastery it demands, the high-velocity picking, tight \nharmonies, and the high, lonesome sound of the tenor lead.\n  Bill Monroe created a wonderful mix of crackling, bright sound with a \nlightning pace that instantly challenged musicians and listeners alike.\n  Bluegrass sounds like no other music before or since, and we have \nBill Monroe to thank for it.\n\n[[Page S10205]]\n\n  This musical frontiersman will be sorely missed He was a musical \nmuseum of American folk life who regularly entertained in bluegrass \nclubs and at outdoor festivals until the end of his years.\n  Though he was born in Kentucky, those of us from Tennessee proudly \nclaim Bill Monroe as one of our own. He was a fixture on the Grand Ole \nOpry, and he spent much of his time in and around Nashville when he \nwasn't out on the road, playing for the massive crowds that always came \nout to hear him.\n  Bill Monroe didn't talk much, but his feelings came out eloquently \nwhen he was behind his mandolin and in front of an audience. Songs like \n``Blue Moon of Kentucky,'' ``Uncle Pen,'' and ``Rawhide'' have already \nstood the test of time to become classics, and Bill Monroe's original \ngift comes through in each note.\n  He was born September 13, 1911 in rural western Kentucky into a \nfamily where nearly everyone played a musical instrument. The youngest \nof eight children, he went on to win numerous awards, including a \nGrammy and the National Medal of Arts for his life's achievement.\n  Almost no kind of music can be traced to the work of a single person, \nbut bluegrass is different. It will always belong to Bill Monroe. His \ncontribution to music is unequaled, and he will be greatly missed by \nall of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/10/senate-section/article/S10204-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CURIOUS CASE OF WHITE HOUSE VERSUS UNITED NATIONS\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I have already mentioned to my \ncolleagues that I think we are mishandling the matter of the election \nof the U.N. Secretary General.\n  Our inattention to the needs beyond our boarder--as well as to \npoverty here at home is not something Americans can be proud of.\n  And our failure to pay U.N. dues, our failure to join other nations \nin peacekeeping operations too frequently, our reluctance to lead when \nleadership is essential, and our negative tone toward U.N. Secretary-\nGeneral Boutros Boutros-Ghali have all been mistakes.\n  Recently Georgie Anne Geyer had a column in the Chicago Tribune \ncommenting about our handling of the Boutros-Ghali matter.\n  Georgie Anne Geyer is an experienced observer of the international \nscene; and when she comments on something like this, we should listen \ncarefully to what she says.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the article from the Chicago Tribune be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                       [From the Chicago Tribune]\n\n              Curious Case of White House versus the U.N.\n\n                        (By Georgie Anne Geyer)\n\n       New York.--The international storm brewing here began May \n     13, when U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher received \n     UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and told the \n     controversial Egyptian diplomat flatly, ``President Clinton \n     does not want to give you a second mandate.''\n       According to internal reports at the United Nations here, \n     Boutros-Ghali said, only partly in jest, ``Look, you are a \n     good lawyer: Defend my case,'' To which, Christopher \n     responded, not in jest at all, ``I am the lawyer of the \n     president of the United States and not yours.''\n       Not only was this curious case of the White House versus \n     the UN Plaza not ``rested,'' but all hell then broke loose on \n     a number of continents and in the corridors of myriad foreign \n     ministries, from Beijing to Budapest.\n       Christopher followed up the initial shock announcement by \n     putting forward the idea of a ``compromise'' by which \n     Boutros-Ghali would stay one year and then leave. (To which \n     the Egyptian diplomat responded tartly: ``is this some sort \n     of ``tip''? If so, it's not very generous.'')\n       Next, in Bonn for meeting, Boutros-Ghali received a private \n     phone call from New York warning him that an announcement \n     would come from the State Department in Washington the next \n     day that the United States no longer supported him. (And so, \n     at that point, Boutros-Ghali, who is no slouch when it comes \n     to tactics, peremptorily moved on this unique geopolitical \n     chessboard, announcing his intention to seek re-election for \n     another five-year term.)\n       On July 8, the drama moved to Africa--to the Organization \n     of African Unity meeting in Yaounde, Cameroon--where \n     Washington sent an unusually large delegation of nine senior \n     diplomats to try to sidetrack any support for the secretary-\n     general.\n       Instead, Only three of the 54 African member states voted \n     against the Egyptian UN leader, one of those being war-torn \n     Rwanda, which opposed him because of his criticism of the \n     massacres there.\n       If all of that were not enough, threats began to come out \n     of the American administration that it would use its veto in \n     the Security Council if Boutros-Ghali were backed this fall \n     by a majority in the United Nations. But this presents a \n     still further conundrum, for after the Cold War ended, \n     Security Council members agreed not to use the veto, in order \n     to free the UN from the constricting manner in which the \n     Soviet Union had used it for so many years.\n       All of this is now at a classic diplomatic impasse. From a \n     day and more of interviewing in the UN, I can say that many, \n     many foreign diplomats are mad as hell at what they perceive \n     as a repetition of historical American arrogance.\n       Floating around the United Nations now is the idea of a new \n     ``compromise'' by which the secretary-general would accept a \n     face-saving extension of his term. But that would not affect \n     the main problem of this UN very much at all.\n       The real problem is that this administration tries to \n     assert its power on matters like the choice of a secretary-\n     general but consistently refused to show any leadership on \n     the big issues facing the post-Cold War UN. If the UN has \n     been less than what it could have been in these pivotal \n     years, the primary responsibility for that failure has not \n     been Boutros-Ghali's.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/10/senate-section/article/S10205-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10205-S10206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   RETIREMENT OF REAR ADM. THOMAS F. HALL, U.S. NAVY, CHIEF OF NAVAL \n                                RESERVE\n\n Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \ndedication, public service, and patriotism of Rear Adm. Thomas F. Hall, \nU.S. Navy, Chief of Naval Reserve. Admiral Hall retires from the Navy \non October 1, after a distinguished 37-year career of service to our \nNation.\n  A native of Barnsdall, OK, Admiral Hall reported to the U.S. Naval \nAcademy in 1959, graduated in 1963 and was designated a naval aviator \nin 1964. After earning his Wings of Gold, Admiral Hall chose to join \nthe maritime patrol forces flying the new P-3 Orion. Excelling in \nflight training, he graduated No. 1 in his class, and was named the \noutstanding student. Admiral Hall continued to distinguish himself \nthroughout his flying career amassing almost 5,000 pilot hours.\n  His initial fleet assignment was with Patrol Squadron 8, flying \ncombat missions in Southeast Asia. Subsequent tours included the U.S. \nNaval Academy, as a Company Officer and Executive Assistant to the \nCommandant of Midshipmen, Patrol Squadron 23, completion of the command \nand staff course at the Naval War College, graduating with distinction, \nand assignment to the Bureau of Naval Personnel, were his billets \nincluded aviation staffs placement officer, head of air combat \nplacement, and assistant head of aviation junior officer assignment. \nAdmiral Hall returned to VP-8 as executive officer and then assumed \nduties as Commanding Officer. Admiral Hall also completed the course of \ninstruction at the National War College, again graduating with \ndistinction, and served on the staff of the Chief of Naval Operations \nwhere he served as Head of the Program Objective Memorandum Development \nsection, as Chief of Staff to Commander Fleet Air Keflavik, and as a \nfellow to the CNO's strategic studies group. In addition to command of \nVP-8, Admiral Hall has also served in command of Naval Air Station \nBermuda, the Icelandic Defense Forces, and most recently, command of \nthe Naval Reserve.\n  Since September 1992, Admiral Hall has been the Chief of Naval \nReserve, leading the Naval Reserve Force through its largest drawdown, \nwhile maintaining readiness and significantly increasing reserve \ncontributory support to the fleet. Under Admiral Hall's leadership, the \ntotal force policy became a reality--Regular Navy and Naval Reservists \nworking side-by-side, in operations worldwide, meeting the Navy's \nforward presence requirements.\n  In August 1989, Admiral Hall was promoted to Rear Admiral--lower \nhalf--and in July 1992 to his present rank of Rear Admiral--upper half. \nAdmiral Hall wears the Defense Superior Service Medal, Legion of Merit, \nMeritorious Service Medal, Meritorious Unit Commendation, and various \nunit and campaign awards, holds a masters degree in management from \nGeorge Washington University and attended Harvard University senior \nexecutives program. In July 1992, Admiral Hall was awarded the \nIcelandic Order of the Falcon, Commander's Cross with star, by the \nPresident of Iceland.\n\n[[Page S10206]]\n\n  Our Nation, his wife Barbara, and his son Tom, can be immensely proud \nof the Admiral's long and distinguished career and his service to our \ncountry. I wish Admiral Hall and his family best wishes in his \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/10/senate-section/article/S10205-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO JEROME R. VANMETER\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I want to pay tribute to a \nspecial West Virginian, Jerome R. ``Coach'' VanMeter. For more than 50 \nyears, he was a high school football and basketball coach from Beckley. \nHe is known throughout southern West Virginia as a man who not only has \nwon many high school sporting events, but also as someone who has \ntouched the lives of many young people. It is in this month of August \nthat Mr. VanMeter celebrates his 96th birthday.\n  Mr. VanMeter received numerous awards during his long tenure as a \ncoach. He was named Coach of the Year from 1948 until 1951 and was \nlater selected to the West Virginia Sports Hall of Fame in 1963. Being \none of the founders of the West Virginia High School Coaches \nAssociation is another one of Mr. VanMeter's crowning achievements. He \nwas also proud to serve on many State selections committees responsible \nfor choosing outstanding basketball and football players throughout the \nState.\n  Coach VanMeter has achieved much more than just personal awards. He \nhas coached many of his teams to great success. His football teams won \nthree state championships while his basketball teams won six. Four of \nthose six State basketball championships were won consecutively, still \na State record for the longest consecutive State basketball tournament \nwins.\n  Mr. VanMeter has not only contributed on the field and court, but has \nalso been deeply involved in community endeavors. While living in \nBeckley, he served as president of the local Kiwanis Club later \nbecoming lieutenant governor of the West Virginia District. In \naddition, Mr. VanMeter has also contributed some of his precious skills \nto the Raleigh County Education Association and the Heber Street \nMethodist Church as chairman of the board of trustees. Furthermore, he \nvolunteered his time to serve on the junior and senior chamber of \ncommerce for several years.\n  Jerome ``Coach'' VanMeter's numerous accomplishments merit notice and \npraise. His enthusiasm and concern for the many athletes he coached and \nhis commitment to his community provide a model we should all strive to \nattain.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/10/senate-section/article/S10206-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE MINNESOTA PARALYMPIANS\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nthe Minnesota athletes who competed in the 1996 Paralympic Games in \nAtlanta. Over 3,500 athletes from more than 100 nations competed in the \ngames, making it one of the world's largest sporting events. Overall \nthe United States won 157 medals, including 46 Gold Medals. I salute \neach and every one of America's athletes, but I would like to mention a \nfew of the 10 Minnesotans who participated in these important games.\n  The U.S. Paralympic cycling team won 13 medals in the road and track \nraces during this year's games. Christopher Pyrkosz of Livonia, MN, was \namong those receiving a team medal for his efforts on the U.S. team.\n  Susan Hagel of Minneapolis and Josie Johnson of Gary also took home \nBronze Medals, as part of the U.S. Paralympic women's basketball team.\n  The U.S. Paralympic judo team surprised the crowds in Atlanta with \ntheir strong showing in this year's competition. Jim Mastro of Fridley \nearned a Bronze Medal for his individual efforts.\n  Mitch Siedenfeld of Minneapolis also took home a Bronze Medal for his \nperformance of the U.S. Paralympic table tennis team.\n  The 1996 Paralympic Games in Atlanta demonstrated the independence \nand empowerment of individuals with disabilities. Dozens of records \nwere broken at this year's games, and the competition received \nconsiderable media attention around the world. The strength and \ndetermination of the Paralympic athletes is amazing, and I am sure that \nmy colleagues join me in celebrating the United States' excellent \noverall showing during this year's games.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/10/senate-section/article/S10206-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ELIOT H. BANK\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \nrecognize and honor Eliot H. Bank for his selection to receive the \nAssociation of Reconditioner's [ACR] Morris Hershson Award of Merit.\n  Eliot H. Bank was born in Chicago, IL, on March 13, 1935, to Sam & \nMollie Bank. The family moved to Detroit in 1937. Like me, Eliot still \nconsiders himself incredibly lucky to have grown up in Detroit. Through \nhis parents he gained an appreciation for many of the finer things in \nMichigan, including Hank Greenberg and the Detroit Tigers, fishing in \nthe many lakes with his father--and later his son, Coney Island hot \ndogs, the Detroit Lions, and Belle Isle. From his parents he also \nlearned the importance of public service and political activism. He was \nactive in the early years of Detroit's public television station \nchannel 56, and remains very active in many charitable organizations. \nHe also ran for local public office in 1972.\n  Eliot's career in the drum reconditioning business has been long and \nvaried. For the past 15 years, he has been executive vice president of \nColumbus Steel Drum Co. which operates one of the largest \nreconditioning plants in the world, and one which many consider to be \nthe standard of the industry.\n  A member of ACR since 1960, Eliot has held almost every post in the \nassociation, including 3 years as chairman, 20 years on the board of \ndirectors, 8 years on the executive board, and the chairmanship of \nnearly every committee. Eliot is proudest of two of his accomplishments \nduring his ACR chairmanship: Establishing new generation and finishing \nthe work of his predecessors in establishing the ACR code of operating \npractices. New generation was initiated when Eliot decided to improve \nACR's educational efforts toward the younger generation working in the \nindustry. He recognized that within this younger generation were the \nfuture industry leaders.\n  In 1981, Eliot established drum management programs at 35 major \nautomotive plants in the Midwest. This program, which continues today, \nprovides the proper disposal and recycling of empty industrial \ncontainers that contain residues of hazardous materials.\n  In 1991, Eliot was part of a team put together by the International \nConfederation of Drum Reconditioners [ICDR]. They attended the United \nNations meeting in Geneva and were successful in implementing the rules \nand regulations governing reconditioned steel drums in chapter 9 of the \nU.N. Code. From 1993 to 1996, Eliot served as chairman of the ICDR.\n  He is very proud of his family--wife, Elizabeth, an art and antiques \ndealer; daughter, Cindy Bank, Federal relations officer in Washington, \nDC, for the University of Michigan; son, Michael Bank, general manager \nof Columbus Steel Drum Co. in Columbus, OH; daughter, Katherine \nGarland, a designer in Chicago; daughter, Amy Katz, head of human \nresources, Somerset Collection, in Troy, MI; daughter-in-law, Patty \nBank; son-in-law, Larry Garland; four terrific grandchildren--Brock and \nShelby Bank and Addie and Ellery Garland; his sister and brother-in-\nlaw, Iris and Arnold Kaufman; and soon to be son-in-law, Todd Franklin.\n  I know that my Senate colleagues will join me in congratulating Eliot \nH. Bank on being awarded the Morris Hershson Award of Merit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/10/senate-section/article/S10206-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10206-S10207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HIGHER TUITION, MORE GRADE INFLATION\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, recently, Lawrence Gladieux and \nRobert Reischauer had an op-ed piece in the Washington Post that is a \nthoughtful and careful analysis of what we ought to be doing in the \nfield of education.\n  President Clinton deserves praise for being a genuine education \nPresident. He was a genuine education Governor, as Governor of \nArkansas, also.\n  President Clinton's support of direct lending in the face of strong \nopposition from the banks and the guaranty agencies marks him as no \nflash-in-the-pan gladiator who gives up easily.\n  But the wisdom of having any kind of tax cuts at this point in our \nNation's fiscal history is extremely doubtful.\n  If we want to put more money into education, as I do, we can do it \nmuch\n\n[[Page S10207]]\n\nmore wisely and prudently than through the proposals that have been \nannounced by the President, popular as they are.\n  I ask that the Gladieux and Reischauer item be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n                       [From the Washington Post]\n\n                  Higher Tuition, More Grade Inflation\n\n           (By Lawrence E. Gladieux and Robert D. Reischauer)\n\n       More than any president since Lyndon Johnson, Bill Clinton \n     has linked his presidency to strengthening and broadening \n     American education. He has argued persuasively that the \n     nation needs to increase its investment in education to spur \n     economic growth, expand opportunity and reduce growing income \n     disparities. He has certainly earned the right to try to make \n     education work for him as an issue in his reelection \n     campaign, and that's clearly what he plans to do.\n       Unfortunately, one way the president has chosen to pursue \n     his goals for education is by competing with the GOP on tax \n     cuts. The centerpiece of his education agenda--tax breaks for \n     families paying college tuition--would be bad tax policy and \n     worse education policy. While tuition tax relief may be \n     wildly popular with voters and leave Republicans speechless, \n     it won't achieve the president's worthy objectives for \n     education, won't help those most in need and will create more \n     problems than it solves.\n       Under the president's plan, families could choose to deduct \n     up to $10,000 in tuition from their taxable income or take a \n     tax credit (a direct offset against federal income tax) of \n     $1,500 for the first year of undergraduate education or \n     training. The credit would be available for a second year if \n     the student maintains a B average.\n       The vast majority of taxpayers who incur tuition expenses--\n     joint filers with incomes up to $100,000 and single filers up \n     to $70,000--would be eligible for these tax breaks. But \n     before the nation invests the $43 billion that the \n     administration says this plan will cost over the next six \n     years, the public should demand that policy makers answer \n     these questions:\n       Will tuition tax credit and deductions boost postsecondary \n     enrollment? Not significantly. Most of the benefits would go \n     to families of students who would have attended college \n     anyway. For them, it will be a windfall. That won't lift the \n     country's net investment in education or widen opportunities \n     for higher education. For families who don't have quite \n     enough to send their child to college, the tax relief may \n     come too late to make a difference. While those families \n     could adjust their payroll withholding, most won't. Thus any \n     relief would be realized in year-end tax refunds, long after \n     families needed the money to pay the tuition.\n       Will they help moderate- and low-income students who have \n     the most difficulty meeting tuition costs? A tax deduction \n     would be of no use to those without taxable income. On the \n     other hand, the proposed $1,500 tax credit--because it would \n     be ``refundable''--would benefit even students and families \n     that owe no taxes. But nearly 4 million low-income students \n     would largely be excluded from the tax credit because they \n     receive Pell Grants which, under the Clinton plan, would be \n     subtracted from their tax-credit eligibility.\n       Will the plan lead to greater federal intrusion into higher \n     education? The Internal Revenue Service would have to certify \n     the amount of tuition students actually paid, the size of \n     their Pell Grants and whether they maintained B averages. \n     This could impose complex regulatory burdens on universities \n     and further complicate the tax code. It's no wonder the \n     Treasury Department has long resisted proposals for tuition \n     tax breaks.\n       Will the program encourage still higher tuition levels and \n     more grade inflation? While the tuition spiral may be \n     moderating slightly, college price increases have averaged \n     more than twice the rate of inflation during the 1990s. With \n     the vast majority of students receiving tax relief, colleges \n     might have less incentive to hold down their tuition \n     increases. Grades, which have been rising almost as rapidly \n     as tuition, might get an extra boost too if professors \n     hesitate to deny their students the B needed to renew the tax \n     credit.\n       If more than $40 billion in new resources really can be \n     found to expand access to higher education, is this the best \n     way to invest it? A far better alternative to tuition tax \n     schemes is need-based student financial aid. The existing aid \n     program, imperfect as they may be, are a much more effective \n     way to equalize educational opportunity and increase \n     enrollment rates. More than $40 billion could go a long way \n     toward restoring the purchasing power of Pell Grants and \n     other proven programs, whose benefits inflation has eroded by \n     as much as 50 percent during the past 15 years. Unlike \n     tuition tax cuts, expanded need-based aid would not drag the \n     IRS into the process of delivering educational benefits. \n     Need-based aid also is less likely to increase inflationary \n     pressure on college prices, because such aid goes to only a \n     portion of the college-going population.\n       Economists have long argued that the tax code shouldn't be \n     used if the same objective can be met through a direct-\n     expenditure program. Tax incentives for college savings might \n     make sense; parents seem to need more encouragement to put \n     money away for their children's education. But tax relief for \n     current tuition expenditures fails the test.\n       Maybe Clinton's tuition tax-relief plan, like the \n     Republican across-the-board tax-cut proposals, can be chalked \n     up to election-year pandering that will be forgotten after \n     November. But oft-repeated campaign themes sometimes make it \n     into the policy stream. That was the case in 1992, when \n     candidate Clinton promised student-loan reform and community \n     service that, as president, he turned into constructive \n     initiatives. If reelected, Clinton again may stick with his \n     campaign mantra. This time, it's tuition tax breaks. This \n     time, he shouldn't.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/10/senate-section/article/S10206-4", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10207-S10208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE VILLAGE . . .\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, we are hearing a great deal of talk \nabout whether a family should save a child or whether a village should \nsave a child. Obviously, we all should be doing what we can to save \nchildren.\n  The morning after the Democratic convention, I picked up the Chicago \nTribune and read one person's moving story. Her name is Bunnie Reidel. \nI have never met her, but sometime I hope to have the honor of meeting \nher.\n  She tells a story that is important for all Americans to hear.\n  I ask that her story be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                 Had It Not Been for the Village . . .\n\n                           (By Bunnie Riedel)\n\n       These days the word ``village'' makes Republicans hiss and \n     sneer and makes Democrats cheer wildly. Maybe it's because \n     village has become the rallying cry for Republican-backed \n     ``parental rights'' laws. Or maybe because the word is \n     Afrocentric, as is the context from which ``It takes a \n     village to raise a child'' is lifted. I don't know. I am \n     sure, however, that parental rights proposals send chills \n     down my spine and if it hadn't been for that much-maligned \n     village, I would not be who I am today. In fact, I'd most \n     likely be dead.\n       My youth was a living hell at best. I have the distinction \n     of having had not one, but two mothers who were total \n     failures.\n       My first mother was my biological mother. She became an \n     itinerant farm worker, alcoholic, and finally, murder victim. \n     I was her 12th child and there were three more to follow me. \n     She left the Ozarks of Missouri while she was pregnant with \n     me, with my older sister at her side, stopping just long \n     enough in Tulsa to have me and then move on to California. \n     There she worked the fields, lived off the kindness of loser \n     men and drank her once attractive self into complete ruin. \n     When I was two, she became pregnant again and decided to give \n     me (not my sister or the new baby) up for adoption to her two \n     landlords. I didn't see my older sister, Debra, for another \n     20 years and I met the original 10 children (left behind in \n     Missouri) 10 years after that.\n       My second mother, Naomi, thought of herself as being \n     completely antithetical to the first and in many ways she \n     was. She provided a home, clothes, great cooking and regular \n     church attendance. I can count the number of times she hugged \n     me on one hand and count even fewer times she told me she \n     loved me. Our home looked fine from without but was a \n     nightmare within. My father died when I was 8 and Naomi \n     conveniently forgot his admonition that she was not to hit \n     me. So hit me she did. With belts, coat hangers, kicks, hair \n     and ear-pulling, Naomi was determined to beat the hell out of \n     me.\n       But more than the beatings. I'll never forget the things \n     she said: ``You'll never amount to anything.'' ``You're so \n     stupid.'' ``Sometimes I would like to kill you.'' These \n     verbal tirades were almost worse than the physical beatings \n     because they would last for hours. I'll never forget the time \n     I had a girlfriend spending the night and my mother woke me \n     up at 4 a.m. and railed on me until 7. My friend will never \n     forget it either. Even now, after 25 years, my old friend \n     mentions that episode every time we see each other.\n       For me, and for so many children like me, the village \n     became our lifesaver. I would leave the house in the morning \n     with swollen, red eyes (from crying myself to sleep the night \n     before) and find haven for a few hours a day with adults who \n     were actually kind, helpful and praised my accomplishments. \n     School was my salvation. It was the teachers I encountered at \n     public school who gave me a glimpse of what life could \n     actually be like. In that glimpse, I saw a world beyond my \n     mother's house, full of wonder and unafraid of inquiry. It \n     was a world where discipline was administered with dignity \n     and self-esteem was valued. Mrs. Nyberg, Mr. Woody, Mrs. \n     Papadakis, Mr. Pessano, Mr. McDonald and Mrs. Edwards were \n     people who broadened my horizons with ideas and information \n     that were unattainable at home. They were people who gave me \n     something to hold onto throughout those dark, ugly days and \n     none of them knew that.\n       In my neighborhood, there were other examples of caring \n     adults. My Girl Scout leader thought I had a keen, \n     interesting mind and she told me so. The German woman down \n     the street (with the six kids) taught me how to do the twist \n     and offered me graham crackers and hot chocolate. My friend's \n     aunt spent hours with me as I entered my teen years, talking \n     to me like I was really a human being.\n       I used every excuse I could to go out into the village. I \n     was active in after-school activities and clubs. I began \n     working at 13. I\n\n[[Page S10208]]\n\n     went away to church camp. I excelled in drama, journalism and \n     forensics. These are the things that kept me from drowning \n     myself in drugs or alcohol. These people and activities kept \n     me from killing myself that one awful night when I was 16 and \n     I had reached the end of my rope. These people and activities \n     gave me the courage to pack a bag and leave home at 17, two \n     weeks before I was ready to start my first semester at the \n     university my mother insisted I could not go to, even though \n     I had a scholarship and grants that completely paid my way. \n     If it hadn't been for that village . . .\n       Now, many years since Naomi's death and many miles from \n     that home that was not a home, I count on the village as a \n     parent. When my children were little, the village taught me \n     simple things that I had not learned at home; how to breast \n     feed, how to change diapers, how to teach my children to \n     read, how to discipline without violence. As my children have \n     become teenagers and I have become a single parent, the \n     village has become even more critical to my family's health \n     and well-being. There are those loving adults at our church \n     who adore my children, give them new experiences and constant \n     encouragement. There are those caring adults at their school \n     who challenge them to stretch their imaginations and use \n     their intellect. There are those adults in our neighborhood \n     who wave and smile and provide a watchful eye of protection. \n     As a single, custodial parent of children whose father is \n     3,000 miles away and rarely sees them, I count on the men in \n     the village to provide examples to my son and daughter of \n     what dedicated, responsible men look like.\n       I know firsthand that not every parent is wise, all-knowing \n     and caretaking. Sometimes it is because they did not receive \n     those things themselves as children; sometimes it is because \n     they are hopelessly lost in their own egos.\n       Making fun of a promising and true statement, that it does \n     indeed ``take a village to raise a child,'' does not change \n     bad parents into good ones, it only furthers political games \n     at the expense of children. Writing into law that a parent's \n     ``rights'' are absolute and inalienable (and thereby \n     overturning almost 2,000 state child abuse statutes), will \n     not strengthen families but lead to despair for the most \n     vulnerable members of those families.\n       The village saved my life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/10/senate-section/article/S10207-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    A CALL TO TONE DOWN THE VIOLENCE\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, during our recess Joan Beck, an \neditorial writer for the Chicago Tribune who also does a column for the \nTribune, had a column in which she calls on TV and movie executives to \nreduce the violence.\n  It is a subject that I have spent a fair amount of time on, and it is \nimportant to creating a more stable society and a brighter future for \nour children.\n  This is an area where bi-partisanship should mark our actions. I \napplaud both Bob Dole and Bill Clinton for being concerned here.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the article from The Chicago Tribune be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                    A Call To Tone Down the Violence\n\n                             (By Joan Beck)\n\n       Bob Dole's latest efforts to persuade Hollywood to tone \n     down the amount of violence in the movies got two thumbs down \n     from most of his critics. They ridiculed his taste in films. \n     They fretted about censorship. And they give him only pro \n     forma applause before ignoring what he was saying.\n       Bill Clinton last week got TV broadcasters to agree to air \n     a minimum of three hours of educational television for \n     children every week. But his critics carped about government \n     over-regulation. They argued about how to define \n     ``educational.'' And they bristled about TV executives being \n     used to further Clinton's re-election campaign.\n       But both the president and his Republican challenger are \n     right about the dangers of exposing impressionable children \n     to so much violence on TV and in the movies. The points they \n     are making shouldn't be ignored.\n       Crime statistics may be down slightly in a few urban areas. \n     But bombings, bomb threats and bomb scares are increasing. \n     Drive-by shootings are being committed by kids on bicycles to \n     young to have cars. One in every three black men in their 20s \n     are either in prison or on probation or parole--up from one \n     in four five year ago. Many urban parks and streets are \n     abandoned at night because people fear for their lives.\n       Violent behavior has multiple--and interlocking--causes, of \n     course. They include poverty, hopelessness, abuse, poor \n     parenting, illegal drugs, mental illness, alcohol, racism, \n     distorted values, gangs, the absence of violence in movies \n     and TV.\n       Of these, the easiest and quickest to change may be \n     television and movies.\n       Adults who enjoy violence as entertainment and the media \n     executives who profit from it argue there is no convincing \n     evidence to link violence in mass media to violence in real \n     life. Like tobacco company honchos, they dismiss stacks of \n     studies showing they are wrong.\n       But at the same time they claim TV does not promote violent \n     behavior, media executives assure advertisers that \n     commercials will influence millions of viewers. Their \n     marketing departments have piles of research to back them up.\n       It is tricky to pinpoint how big an effect violence on TV \n     and in the movies has on children and young people. Excessive \n     exposure to filmed violence in childhood may not erupt into \n     homicide and crime until adolescence. Other factors certainly \n     make some children more vulnerable than others to media \n     influences.\n       But the June issue of the Harvard Mental Health Letter sums \n     up persuasive evidence that does link watching violence in \n     mass media and aggressive behavior. The report is written by \n     L. Rowell Huesmann, professor of psychology and \n     communication, University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, and \n     Jessica Moise, a doctoral student at the University of \n     Michigan.\n       More than 100 laboratory studies done over the last 40 \n     years show that at least some children exposed to films of \n     dramatic violence act more aggressively afterward toward \n     inanimate objects and other youngsters, the newsletter says. \n     It adds, ``These results have been found in many countries \n     among boys and girls of all social classes, races, ages and \n     levels of intelligence.''\n       In addition, more than 50 field studies made over the last \n     20 years find that ``children who habitually watch more media \n     violence behave more aggressively and accept aggression more \n     readily as a way to solve problems.'' The connection shows up \n     regardless of age, sex, social class and previous level of \n     aggression, the author say.\n       Watching violence in the media leads to aggressive behavior \n     in five ways, the Harvard newsletter says. First, children \n     may imitate characters they see in the media, especially if \n     they are admirable and their actions are rewarded. Then they \n     tend to internalize the behavior and use it automatically in \n     their everyday lives.\n       Second, violence in the media desensitizes children to the \n     effects of violence. ``The more televised violence a child \n     watches, the more acceptable aggressive behavior becomes,'' \n     says the newsletter. It also makes children expect others to \n     act violently and therefore feel they should, too.\n       Third, seeing violence in the media helps a child justify \n     to himself his own acts of aggression and relieves any guilt \n     he might feel, freeing him to continue to behave \n     aggressively.\n       Fourth, watching violent acts on TV and in movies may \n     activate aggressive thoughts and feelings a child already has \n     or serve as a cognitive cue for later violent behavior. And \n     fifth, children who watch a lot of violence can become \n     desentized to it and the emotional and physiological \n     responses that might turn them away from it become dulled.\n       ``The studies are conclusive,'' says the Harvard \n     newsletter. ``The evidence leaves no room for doubt that \n     exposure to media violence stimulates aggression.''\n       The new V chip that lets parents cut off their children's \n     access to violent programs should help. More high quality, \n     ``educational'' shows for children on TV is a positive move. \n     And all of us who fear violence and regret the changes we are \n     making to protect ourselves--airline security checks, gated \n     communities, more police, more prisons, more restrictions on \n     ourselves about walking in the parks and on certain streets--\n     can stop supporting violence as entertainment.\n       We can cut violence on TV and in movies out of our lives \n     and help make it unprofitable for those who sell it. If \n     enough of us refuse to pay to see violent films, studios will \n     make fewer of them. If enough of us change the channel when a \n     violent TV show comes on, broadcasters will get the message.\n       Cutting back on violence as entertainment won't solve the \n     problem of violence in the real world. But it should help. \n     It's something we can do now, while we try to figure out how \n     to end poverty and keep fathers in the home and create more \n     effective schools and end drug abuse and deal with all the \n     other factors that contribute to violent crime.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/10/senate-section/article/S10208-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   JOINT MEETING OF THE TWO HOUSES--ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER OF \n                                IRELAND\n\n  Mr. SHELBY.

DAM SAFETY PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``National Dam Safety Program Act of 1996''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Dams are an essential part of the national \n     infrastructure. Dams fail from time to time with catastrophic \n     results; thus, dam safety is a vital public concern.\n       (2) Dam failures have caused, and can cause in the future, \n     enormous loss of life, injury, destruction of property, and \n     economic and social disruption.\n       (3) Some dams are at or near the end of their structural, \n     useful, or operational life. With respect to future dam \n     failures, the loss, destruction, and disruption can be \n     substantially reduced through the development and \n     implementation of dam safety hazard reduction measures, \n     including--\n       (A) improved design and construction standards and \n     practices supported by a national dam performance resource \n     bank;\n       (B) safe operations and maintenance procedures;\n       (C) early warning systems;\n       (D) coordinated emergency preparedness plans; and\n       (E) public awareness and involvement programs.\n       (4) Dam safety problems persist nationwide. The diversity \n     in Federal and State dam safety programs calls for national \n     leadership in a cooperative effort involving Federal and \n     State governments and the private sector. An expertly staffed \n     and adequately financed dam safety hazard reduction program, \n     based on Federal, State, local, and private research, \n     planning, decisionmaking, and contributions, would reduce the \n     risk of such loss, destruction, and disruption from dam \n     failure by an amount far greater than the cost of such \n     program.\n       (5) There is a fundamental need for a national dam safety \n     program and the need will continue. An effective national \n     program in dam safety hazards reduction will require input \n     from and review by Federal and non-Federal experts in dams \n     design, construction, operation, and maintenance and in the \n     practical application of dam failure hazards reduction \n     measures. At the present time, there is no national dam \n     safety program.\n       (6) The coordinating authority for national leadership is \n     provided through the Federal Emergency Management Agency's \n     (hereinafter in this section referred to as ``FEMA'') dam \n     safety program through Executive Order 12148 in coordination \n     with appropriate Federal agencies and the States.\n       (7) While FEMA's dam safety program shall continue as a \n     proper Federal undertaking and shall provide the foundation \n     for a National Dam Safety Program, statutory authority to \n     meet increasing needs and to discharge Federal \n     responsibilities in national dam safety is needed.\n       (8) Statutory authority will strengthen FEMA's leadership \n     role, will codify the national dam safety program, and will \n     authorize the Director of FEMA (hereinafter in this section \n     referred to as the ``Director'') to communicate directly with \n     Congress on authorizations and appropriations and to build \n     upon the hazard reduction aspects of national dam safety.\n       (c) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this section to reduce \n     the risks to life and property from dam failure in the United \n     States through the establishment and maintenance of an \n     effective national dam safety program which will bring \n     together the Federal and non-Federal communities' expertise \n     and resources to achieve national dam safety hazard \n     reduction. It is not the intent of this section to preempt \n     any other Federal or State authorities nor is the intent of \n     this section to mandate State participation in the grant \n     assistance program to be established under this section.\n       (d) Definitions.--In this section, the following \n     definitions apply:\n       (1) Federal agency.--The term ``Federal agency'' means any \n     Federal agency that designs, finances, constructs, owns, \n     operates, maintains, or regulates the construction, \n     operation, or maintenance of any dam.\n       (2) Non-federal agency.--The term ``non-Federal agency'' \n     means any State agency that has regulatory authority over the \n     safety of non-Federal dams.\n       (3) Federal guidelines for dam safety.--The term ``Federal \n     Guidelines for Dam Safety'' refers to a FEMA publication \n     number 93, dated June 1979, which defines management \n     practices for dam safety at all Federal agencies.\n       (4) Program.--The term ``program'' means the national dam \n     safety program established under subsection (e).\n       (5) Dam.--The term ``dam'' means any artificial barrier \n     with the ability to impound water, wastewater, or liquid-\n     borne materials for the purpose of storage or control of \n     water which is--\n       (A) 25 feet or more in height from (i) the natural bed of \n     the stream or watercourse measured at the downstream toe of \n     the barrier, or (ii) from the lowest elevation of the outside \n     limit of the barrier if the barrier is not across a stream \n     channel or watercourse, to the maximum water storage \n     elevation; or\n       (B) has an impounding capacity for maximum storage \n     elevation of 50 acre-feet or more.\n\n     Such term does not include any such barrier which is not \n     greater than 6 feet in height regardless of storage capacity \n     or which has a storage capacity at maximum water storage \n     elevation not greater than 15 acre-feet regardless of height, \n     unless such barrier, due to its location or other physical \n     characteristics, is likely to pose a significant threat to \n     human life or property in the event of its failure. Such term \n     does not include a levee.\n       (6) Hazard reduction.--The term ``hazard reduction'' means \n     those efforts utilized to reduce the potential consequences \n     of dam failure to life and property.\n       (7) State.--The term ``State'' means each of the 50 States \n     of the United States, the District of Columbia, the \n     Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, \n     American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \n     Islands, and any other territory or possession of the United \n     States.\n       (8) Participating state.--The term ``participating State'' \n     means any State that elects to participate in the grant \n     assistance program established under this Act.\n       (9) United states.--The term ``United States'' means, when \n     used in a geographical sense, all of the States.\n       (10) Model state dam safety program.--The term ``Model \n     State Dam Safety Program'' refers to a document, published by \n     FEMA (No. 123, dated April 1987) and its amendments, \n     developed by State dam safety officials, which acts as a \n     guideline to State dam safety agencies for establishing a dam \n     safety regulatory program or improving an already-established \n     program.\n       (e) National Dam Safety Program.--\n       (1) Authority.--The Director, in consultation with \n     appropriate Federal agencies, State dam safety agencies, and \n     the National Dam Safety Review Board established by paragraph \n     (5)(C), shall establish and maintain, in accordance with the \n     provisions and policies of this Act, a coordinated national \n     dam safety program.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Finance \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. 1918, and \nfurther that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1918) to amend trade laws and related provisions \n     to clarify the designation of normal trade relations.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. 1918, \nlegislation aimed at bringing a modicum of clarity to our trade laws. \nThis bill, cosponsored by all 20 members of the Senate Committee on \nFinance, would replace the term ``most-favored-nation'' with a more \ndirect, more accurate, less muddled phrase to describe the basis of our \ntrade policy.\n  Since the 18th century, American trade policy has been one of \nnondiscrimination: the vast majority of our trading partners receive \ntreatment equal to all others. Not most-favored treatment, but normal \ntreatment. And hence, we propose the term ``normal trade relations'' in \nthe hopes that it will lessen the confusion when we discuss trade \nmatters.\n  At the root of the problem is that we continue to use a term that \nfirst appeared at the end of the 17th century--``most-favored-\nnation''--in our treaties and agreements, in our trade laws and \nexecutive orders, a term that, even then, was a misnomer.\n  There is, Mr. President, no single most favored nation. As noted in a \n1919 report to the Congress by the United States Tariff Commission \n(known today as the U.S. International Trade Commission):\n\n       It is neither the purpose nor the effect of the most-\n     favored-nation clause to establish a ``most favored nation;'' \n     on the contrary its use implies the intention that the \n     maximum of advantages which either of the parties to a treaty \n     has extended or shall extend to any third State--for the \n     moment the ``most-favored''--shall be given or be made \n     accessible to the other party.''\n\n  That is, the most favored nation is not the nation with which we are \nnegotiating, but rather a third nation altogether that happens to \nbenefit from the lowest tariffs or smallest trade barriers with respect \nto some particular product. The most-favored-nation principle means \nmerely that we will grant to the country with which we are negotiating \nthe same terms that we give to that third country, for the moment the \nmost favored.\n  Little wonder, then, that the term, though used for more than two \ncenturies, has increasingly caused public confusion. And yet we must \nhave a term to describe our normal trade relations for the simple \nreason that there is still in law a very unfavorable tariff--that is, \nthe Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, the last tariff schedule enacted \nline-by-line by the Congress, producing the highest tariff rates, \noverall, in our history.\n  In response to the disaster that followed, the Roosevelt \nadministration negotiated a series of trade agreements--agreements with \nindividual countries as well as multilateral agreements negotiated \nunder the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. These \nagreements brought down our tariffs, as they brought down tariffs \nworldwide.\n  These are the tariffs that we call our most-favored-nation tariff \nrates, which, in fact, apply to the vast majority of our trading \npartners. They are thus the norm, and not in any way more favorable \nthan the tariffs that apply to nearly all other countries.\n  Nor are they, in fact, the lowest tariff rates the United States \napplies. We have free trade arrangements with Canada, Israel, and \nMexico. We grant other tariff preferences to developing countries under \nthe Generalized System of Preferences, to Caribbean nations under the \nCaribbean Basin Initiative and to Andean countries under the Andean \nTrade Preferences Act. The tariff rates under all of these regimes are \nlower than the most-favored-nation rates referred to in our laws and \ntreaties. Hence the confusion, and hence the need to change the \nterminology to clarify that our most-favored-nation\n\n[[Page S10240]]\n\ntariff rates represent, in fact, our normal trade relations.\n  Mr. President, this legislation in no way intends to alter our \nfundamental international obligations. The term ``most-favored-nation'' \nhas a long history of application and interpretation, and that will \nstand. This legislation is not intended as a substantive change in our \ntrade policy. Rather, it is intended only as a change in nomenclature \nwith the sole purpose of making our trade policy more comprehensible.\n  Mr. President, it is rare that legislation before the Senate has the \ncosponsorship of the entire membership of the committee of \njurisdiction. That is the case with S. 1918, which strikes a bipartisan \nblow for clarity in our trade laws.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I ask unanimous consent the bill be deemed read a third \ntime, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that \nany statements relating to the bill be placed at the appropriate place \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1918) was deemed read for a third time and passed, as \nfollows:\n\n                                S. 1918\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since the 18th century, the principle of \n     nondiscrimination among countries with which the United \n     States has trade relations, commonly referred to as ``most-\n     favored-nation'' treatment, has been a cornerstone of United \n     States trade policy.\n       (2) Although the principle remains firmly in place as a \n     fundamental concept in United States trade relations, the \n     term ``most-favored-nation'' is a misnomer which has led to \n     public misunderstanding.\n       (3) It is neither the purpose nor the effect of the most-\n     favored-nation principle to treat any country as ``most \n     favored''. To the contrary, the principle reflects the \n     intention to confer on a country the same trade benefits that \n     are conferred on any other country, that is, the intention \n     not to discriminate among trading partners.\n       (4) The term ``normal trade relations'' is a more accurate \n     description of the principle of nondiscrimination as it \n     applies to the tariffs applicable generally to imports from \n     United States trading partners, that is, the general rates of \n     duty set forth in column 1 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule \n     of the United States.\n       (b) Policy.--It is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) the language used in the United States laws, treaties, \n     agreements, executive orders, directives, and regulations \n     should more clearly and accurately reflect the underlying \n     principles of United States trade policy; and\n       (2) accordingly, the term ``normal trade relations'' \n     should, where appropriate, be substituted for the term \n     ``most-favored-nation''.\n\n     SEC 2. CHANGE IN TERMINOLOGY.\n\n       (a) Trade Expansion Act of 1962.--The heading for section \n     251 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. 1881) is \n     amended to read as follows: ``NORMAL TRADE RELATIONS''.\n       (b) Trade Act of 1974.--(1) Section 402 of the Trade Act of \n     1974 (19 U.S.C. 2432) is amended by striking ``(most-favored-\n     nation treatment)'' each place it appears and inserting \n     ``(normal trade relations)''.\n       (2) Section 601(9) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. \n     2481(9)) is amended by striking ``most-favored-nation \n     treatment'' and inserting ``trade treatment based on normal \n     trade relations (known under international law as most-\n     favored-nation treatment)''.\n       (c) CFTA.--Section 302(a)(3)(C) of the United States Canada \n     Free-Trade Agreement Implementation Act of 1988 (19 U.S.C. \n     2112 note) is amended by striking ``the most-favored-\n     nation rate of duty'' each place it appears and inserting \n     ``the general subcolumn of the column 1 rate of duty set \n     forth in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United \n     States''.\n       (d) NAFTA.--Section 202(n) of the North American Free Trade \n     Agreement Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 3332(n)) is amended \n     by striking ``most-favored-nation''.\n       (e) SEED Act.--Section 2(c)(11) of the Support for East \n     European Democracy (SEED) Act of 1989 (22 U.S.C. 5401 \n     (c)(11)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``(commonly referred to as `most favored \n     nation status')'', and\n       (2) by striking ``Most Favored Nation Trade Status'' in the \n     heading and inserting ``Normal Trade Relations''.\n       (f) United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992.--Section \n     103(4) of the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 (22 \n     U.S.C. 5713(4)) is amended by striking ``(commonly referred \n     to as most-favored-nation status')''.\n\n     SEC. 3.

(SONNY) MONTGOMERY DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS MEDICAL CENTER\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. 1669, \nand the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1669) to name the Department of Veterans Affairs \n     medical center in Jackson, Mississippi, as the ``G. V. \n     (Sonny) Montgomery Department of Veterans Affairs Medical \n     Center.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am privileged to have introduced S. 1669, \nalong with Senator Thad Cochran, to name the VA medical center in \nJackson, MS, in honor of our friend and colleague, Representative Sonny \nMontgomery. A companion bill, H.R. 3253, was introduced by \nRepresentative Mike Parker, and it has already passed the House.\n  As many of you know, Congressman Montgomery is retiring at the end of \nhis current term after 30 illustrious years in the House. He has had a \ndistinguished career and served under seven Presidents. ``Mr. \nVeteran,'' as many of us have affectionately called Sonny, led efforts \nto obtain Cabinet-level status for the Department of Veterans Affairs. \nHe introduced and guided to passage a peacetime GI education bill which \nprovides incentives for both recruitment and retention of qualified \nyoung men and women for the Armed Forces. This landmark legislation \nbears his name as the Montgomery GI bill.\n   Congressman Montgomery has strongly championed the State Veterans \nAffairs nursing homes. He has done yeoman's service for veterans as \nchairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee and as a distinguished \nmember of the House National Security Committee. Veterans throughout \nthe Nation have benefited greatly from the outstanding resources \nprovided by VA facilities established and improved under Sonny's watch. \nIn particular, veterans from Mississippi, and neighboring States, are \nwell served by the Veterans Benefits Administration Southern Area \nOffice, the VA Regional Office, and two VA medical centers made \npossible by the chairman's able hand.\n  The VA medical center in Jackson definitely needs an official name. \nOthers have distinguished names such as the Sam Rayburn VA, the Jerry \nPettis VA, and the James Haley Veterans Hospital. Unquestionably, \nRepresentative Sonny Montgomery, Congress' ``Mr. Veteran,'' truly is \nwell-deserving of having the Jackson VA Medical Center named in his \nhonor.\n  It is very appropriate that this legislation comes before us now \nbecause of several events that are occurring to pay tribute to Sonny. \nRepresentative Montgomery is being honored this week by his colleagues \non the House Veterans' Affairs Committee for his dedicated service. \nAlso, Mississippi State University, the chairman's alma mater, is \nhosting a benefit dinner for him. Proceeds from this benefit will \nestablish the Sonny Montgomery Scholars Program at MSU. Furthermore, \nHouse colleagues have made arrangements to plant a magnolia tree on the \nsoutheast corner of the Capitol Grounds as a living testimony of \nSonny's many years of service and outstanding achievements.\n  Mr. President, Sonny is one of the most outstanding, revered, and \nbeloved Members of Congress. Veterans' Affairs Committee Chairman Alan \nSimpson is a cosponsor of S. 1669, and strongly supports this measure. \nI urge my colleagues to join with me in this fitting tribute to our \nfriend and colleague, Representative G.V. (Sonny) Montgomery.\n\n[[Page S10241]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na ``Dear Colleague'' letter dated May 9, 1996.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                               Russell Senate Office Building,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 9, 1996.\n       Dear Colleague: I am privileged to have recently introduced \n     S. 1669, along with Sen.

Sonny Montgomery, Congress' ``Mr. Veteran'' truly is \n     well-deserving of having the Jackson VA Medical Center named \n     in his honor.\n       I would appreciate your joining me in support of S. 1669. \n     Please call Ney Williams of my staff at 224-4553 to \n     cosponsor. Thank you for your consideration, and with kind \n     regards, I am\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                       Trent Lott.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague in \nhonoring our friend, the gentleman from Mississippi, Sonny Montgomery, \nwho is retiring from the House of Representatives at the end of this \nCongress. We have joined in sponsoring this bill to name the VA medical \ncenter in Jackson, MS, the G.V. (Sonny) Montgomery Department of \nVeterans Affairs Medical Center. Throughout his career, as a senior \nmember of the House National Security Committee and as chairman of the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee, Sonny has demonstrated genuine concern for \nthe health, education, and well-being of our Nation's veterans. He \nfirmly believes that we should treat veterans with dignity and \ncompassion, and he has worked hard as chairman of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee to enact programs and provide facilities to meet that \nobligation.\n  Sonny's concern for and attention to the men and women of our Armed \nForces is firmly rooted in his own experiences, having served in the \nArmy and Army National Guard for a total of 38 years. Sonny served in \nWorld War II and during the Korean War. As a dedicated member of the \nMississippi Army National Guard, he was promoted to the rank of major \ngeneral before his retirement in 1981.\n\n  Sonny's political career began as a member of the Mississippi State \nSenate from Lauderdale County. He served with distinction for 10 years, \nfrom 1956-1966. In 1966, he ran for and won the seat in Congress from \nthe Third District of Mississippi. Sonny has proven to be a very \ncapable, productive, and popular Representative. He was overwhelmingly \nreelected each term since the 90th Congress.\n  During that 30-year period of service he has earned the reputation of \na champion of national defense and veterans' issues, and he often is \nreferred to by his colleagues as ``Mr. Veteran'' or ``Mr. National \nGuard.''\n  When Sonny was elected to Congress in 1966, American soldiers were \nfighting in the war in Vietnam. He demonstrated his concern for those \nwho were involved in that dangerous and deadly region by spending \nChristmas each year in Vietnam with the soldiers.\n  On these trips, Sonny would carry blank cards with him and when he \nran into young soldiers from Mississippi, he would ask them to write \nthe names and addresses of their families on these cards. When Sonny \nreturned home he would take the time to call each soldier's family to \nlet them know that he had seen their son or daughter and relay any \nstories or news that might interest them. Today, people still thank \nSonny for these phone calls.\n  In 1975 he was appointed chairman of the House Select Committee on \nMissing Persons in Southeast Asia. In 1977, President Carter named him \nto the Woodstock Commission, which traveled to Hanoi to investigate \nfurther, those Americans missing in action. More recently, Sonny was a \nmember of the delegation that brought back the first returned remains \nof United States personnel missing in North Korea during the Korean \nwar.\n  Sonny Montgomery stands as an example of a true patriot, and for this \nhe has been recognized by his colleagues many times. In 1984, the \nSpeaker of the House asked that he lead the House contingent to the \ncommemoration of the 40th Anniversary of the D-day Invasion at \nNormandy, a particularly appropriate designation because Sonny fought \nin the European theater during this war. In 1988, when the reciting of \nthe Pledge of Allegiance was instituted as daily practice by the House \nof Representatives, Sonny was asked by the Speaker to be the first \nMember to lead this body in the Pledge.\n  Throughout our time together as members of our State's congressional \ndelegation, I have had the opportunity to observe Sonny in many \nsituations. A most recent instance was during the last round of base \nclosure and realignment. Two of the bases in his district were \nconsidered for closure, one of which had been on the closure list in \ntwo previous rounds. Sonny was most persuasive and successful in \nconvincing the Base Closure Commission that Naval Air Station Meridian \nand Columbus Air Force Base are essential to the pilot training in both \nof those services. Sonny was willing to do everything he could to keep \nthese bases open. Today, these bases remain open, largely due to the \nefforts of Sonny Montgomery.\n\n  As a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee, now named \nthe National Security Committee, Sonny Montgomery has been a tremendous \ninfluence on our national defense policy. He has consistently supported \nthe maintenance of a strong force.\n  Sonny was one of seven Democrats who in early 1994 paid a visit to \nPresident Clinton to insist on increased defense spending by his \nadministration, particularly in the area of military pay, and to urge \nhim to reduce nondefense spending by the Department of Defense. Sonny \nhas always considered the protection of our freedom to be the highest \npriority of our Government, and he has done his best to ensure our \nnational security.\n  Because of Sonny Montgomery, the National Guard and Reserves are \ndifferent services than they were 25 years ago. As a member of the \nMississippi Army National Guard Sonny saw untapped potential in the \nGuard and Reserve forces, and as a senior member of the National \nSecurity Committee, he has strengthened our reserve component forces in \nsignificant ways. Over and over again, Sonny insisted that in order for \nthe Guard and Reserves to be truly ready reserve forces, they must have \nfirst-line equipment, top facilities, and more serious training. As we \nsaw in the gulf war, our Guard and Reserves have now been transformed \ninto an essential component of our total forces. In addition, Sonny has \nalways emphasized the need to keep the missions of each Guard unit \nrelevant.\n  Recently, Sonny negotiated with officials at the Pentagon in order to \nreassign the duties of a National Guard battalion in east Mississippi, \nwhich might have been considered for closure. Instead, this battalion \nwill be the first Guard unit in the Nation to be equipped with and \ntrain on the high-technology Avenger air defense system, a key weapon \nin Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. Our active forces will be \nbetter supported by contributions from National Guard units in the \nfuture because of Sonny Montgomery.\n  Another high priority for him has been the recruitment and retention \nof soldiers; and out of this concern came\n\n[[Page S10242]]\n\nthe GI bill which bears his name. Sonny considers this legislation to \nbe his greatest accomplishment. Under the Montgomery GI bill, active \nduty, National Guard, and Reserve personnel are entitled to educational \nassistance benefits which would enable them to pursue their educational \ngoals while serving our country. Since being passed into law in 1985, \napproximately 2 million military personnel have participated in the \nprogram, and over 550,000 have already attended schools with its \nassistance. The Montgomery GI bill has significantly improved \nrecruiting efforts for all of the services, and it has provided much-\nneeded training to veterans and retirees preparing to enter the work \nforce.\n\n  In addition to protecting our national security, Sonny has \nconsistently sought proper recognition and benefits for veterans. In \nthe 100th Congress, Sonny fought to have the Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs elevated to a Cabinet-level position. When Sonny saw a need to \nimprove the review of veterans' claims, he sponsored a bill to \nestablish the Court of Veterans' Appeals in order to ensure the \ncomplete judicial review of each claim. Within a month, this bill was \nsigned into law, and right away veterans saw needed changes in the \nclaims process. Also, he has worked to streamline the services offered \nat regional service centers and hospitals, aiming toward providing, in \neffect, one-stop shopping for our veterans.\n  During the last Congress, Sonny authored legislation to extend \ncompensation to our most recent veterans, those who fought in the \nPersian Gulf war. The Veterans' Persian Gulf War Benefits Act, now law, \nrequires the VA to give priority to veterans suffering from undiagnosed \nillnesses after their service in the Persian Gulf region. The bill also \nestablished new research and outreach programs to further the \nidentification of this disease. This legislation is just another \ndemonstration of his belief that we have a moral obligation to care for \nand compensate those who have suffered disabling injuries during their \nservice to our country.\n  While in the Army and for his efforts in service to military \npersonnel and veterans of our country, Sonny has received many awards, \nincluding the Legion of Merit, Meritorious Service Medal, Combat \nInfantry Badge, Army Commendation Medal, a Bronze Star for Valor, and \nMississippi Magnolia Cross Award, and the Harry S. Truman Award, which \nis the highest award given by the National Guard Association of the \nUnited States. In addition, he has been recognized by the American Red \nCross, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Reserve Officers Association \nof the United States, and AMVETS of World War II. He is past president \nof the Mississippi National Guard Association, and he remains an active \nmember of the American Legion and VFW Post 79 in Meridian, MS. \nVeterans' organizations across the country are saddened to see Sonny \nretire.\n  Above all of Sonny's legislative accomplishments, he must be \nrecognized and appreciated for his patience, congeniality, and \ncompassion. Having maintained so many friendships in both parties, \nSonny has often been called to be a mediator. He has been on good terms \nwith Republican and Democrat leaders in Congress and Presidents of both \nparties throughout four decades, and his friendship with former \nPresident Bush goes back to their days as freshmen in the House. His \npeers regard him as a respected friend, who is wholly dedicated to his \npurpose in office. A small example of his loyalty is evidenced by the \nnumber of hours he has logged in the Speaker's chair, a duty many \nconsider drudgery, but something that Sonny has viewed as an \nopportunity to serve his fellow Members.\n  I will miss his good counsel and true friendship. Mississippi's Third \nDistrict and the entire Nation will miss his strong leadership and \nclear vision. Members like Sonny are rare, and his leaving signals the \nend of an era for southern Democrats, and the House of Representatives \nas well.\n  I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator Lott, in offering S. 1669, \na bill to name the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in \nJackson, MS, for Sonny Montgomery, and I urge all of my colleagues to \nsupport the renaming of this facility.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, in reflecting on my own lifetime of \npublic service, I can think of no one whose sincere dedication to \nveterans, combined with the ability to transform that dedication into a \nconcrete reality, exceeds that of my old and dear friend G.V. ``Sonny'' \nMontgomery.\n  We all know why the Montgomery GI bill carries Sonny Montgomery's \nname. It's not just an honor, it is a clear depiction of reality. What \nsome Members of this body may not realize is that Sonny Montgomery's \ninterests and everlasting impact extend far beyond the veterans' \neducation benefit that carries his name.\n  There is no path down which a veteran may travel that hasn't been \nscouted first and smoothed and improved by the Congressman from \nMississippi, Sonny Montgomery.\n  There is no benefit provided to our veterans by a grateful nation \nthat does not bear the imprint of the longtime chairman, and now \nranking minority member, of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, \nSonny Montgomery.\n  The rules of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs limit \nproposals to name VA facilities to the names of individuals who are \ndeceased. As we consider the measure before us today, some may wonder \nwhat has occurred to amend that standard.\n  If such a person were to exist, I could assume that they do not know \nthe stirring 30-year record of service and legislation written by Sonny \nMontgomery. If such a question is raised, I will only say to the \ninquirer that exceptional service calls for exceptional action and that \nsuch an action also calls for an exception to the rule. This is such a \ntime. A rule that would prohibit application of the name G.V. Sonny \nMontgomery to the VA Medical Center in Jackson, MS, is a rule begging \nto be temporarily laid aside--in sheer gratitude from us all.\n  In fact, Sonny Montgomery is the dominant presence in the world of \nveterans' affairs and the genial and generous shadow he casts extends \nfar beyond the boundaries of the State of Mississippi. An honor limited \nonly to his native State of Mississippi is an honor quite inadequate to \ndescribe his full legacy.\n  In reflecting on the full and honest career and commitment of the \nsenior Congressman from Mississippi, I conclude that if honors truly \nreflected accomplishment, we would likely have to name the whole \nshooting match of the Department of Veterans Affairs after Sonny \nMontgomery.\n  When Sonny Montgomery leaves us in the Congress and returns to his \nbeloved home as a private citizen he will leave behind an unmatched \nlegacy of unselfish commitment and service. He will leave behind shoes \nthat it would take a giant to fill. The only way that veterans may not \nbenefit in the future from the career of Sonny Montgomery will be if \nthe height of the bar he set is up there so high that those who follow \nhim may be discouraged by the fact that it will be so difficult to \nequal, much less exceed, his remarkable record. Sonny Montgomery will \nserve as an example to generations of all legislators to come. I am so \nvery proud to join in supporting legislation to recognize an example, \nand a career, and a wonderful, never tiring, ever focused, lovely, \nkind, incomparable man, by ensuring that the VA Medical Center in \nJackson, MS, will forever carry the name that his actions have made \nsynonymous with love of veterans: G.V. Sonny Montgomery.\n  I love him. He has saved my skin a time or two. He is my true friend. \nGod bless him.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I ask unanimous consent the bill be deemed read a third \ntime and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and \nthat any statements relating to the bill appear at this point in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1669) was deemed read for a third time and passed, as \nfollows:\n\n                                S. 1669\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
