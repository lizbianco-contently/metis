The Senate will resume consideration of \nSenate Concurrent Resolution 13.\n  The clerk will report the pending business.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 13) setting forth the \n     congressional budget for the United States Government for the \n     fiscal years 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the concurrent resolution.\n\n       Pending:\n       (1) Harkin-Bumpers amendment No. 1126, to reduce \n     unnecessary military spending, holding military spending to a \n     freeze in overall spending over 7 years protecting readiness \n     and modernization activities and shifting the savings to \n     education and job training, restoring a portion of the \n     reductions proposed for those programs in the resolution.\n       (2) Feingold-Hollings amendment No. 1127, to strike the \n     budget surplus allowance provision (Section 204) from the \n     resolution to eliminate the use of the fiscal dividend for \n     further tax cuts.\n       (3) Snowe amendment No. 1128, to increase funding for \n     mandatory spending in function 500 (Education).\n       (4) Bumpers amendment No. 1130, to strike the proposed \n     change in the budget process rules which would permit the \n     scoring of revenue derived from the sale of federal assets.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1128\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I would ask my chairman of the committee if \nit would be in order for me at this time to yield 10 minutes off the \nbill in opposition to the Snowe amendment to the Senator from \nMassachusetts?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  How much time remains on the Snowe amendment?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Senator Snowe has 67 minutes; the \nopposition has 35 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would prefer to yield 10 minutes off the opposition \nto the amendment. Is that what the Senator wanted?\n  Mr. EXON. The Senator from Ohio wants 10 minutes.\n  I would start out today by saying to all the Senators that we are \nextremely strapped for time. Five minutes here, ten minutes there, \nunder ordinary circumstances would be in order. I think we have about \nwhat--4 hours maximum left? How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Three hours and 45 minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, 3 hours and 45 minutes, with about 70 \namendments. We will have to extremely limit our time. I think that the \nrequests--may I suggest that we yield 8 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts and 8 minutes to the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And 8 minutes to the senior Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I might ask if I could have 4 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me see how the opposition goes. I have none for \nmyself at this point. Then I will see.\n  I yield 8 minutes to Senator Kennedy, 8 minutes to the junior Senator \nfrom Ohio, and 8 minutes to the senior Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield myself 8 minutes.\n  Mr. President, one of the most important aspects of the whole budget \nresolution is what it does in the areas of higher education, as well as \neducation generally.\n  I took a few moments of the Senate's time just 3 days ago to outline \nwhere I thought we were on the whole issue of education in this \ncountry. We take pride in our higher education system. Of the top 149 \nuniversities worldwide, 127 of them are here in the United States. Our \nsystem works well. We provide superb higher education in this country. \nIf there is a basic problem, it is the cost of higher education. We \nhave tried to address this problem at the Federal level.\n  Our Federal education policies have been worked out in a bipartisan \nway over the period of years since the early 1960's when a judgment was \nmade that it was in the national interest to support higher education.\n  Individual contributions, private sector contributions, and Federal \nassistance have created the world's best education system. Together, we \nsupport educational opportunities for our Nation's citizens, and at the \nsame time, [[Page S7282]] we support the outstanding research that is \ngoing on in places like the NIH, the National Science Foundation, and \nother research agencies. Our system is working, and it is working well.\n  The charts we reviewed a few days ago in this Chamber show that \nproviding higher education to our citizens contributes to this country \nimmeasurably. The clearest example of this was the cold war GI bill \nwhich returned $8 for every $1 that was invested in education. \nInvestments in education continue to be an investment in our country.\n  Now, the Budget Act that is before the Senate today effectively cuts \n$65 billion from education, $30 billion of it out of higher education, \nand the remainder out of other education support programs over the \nperiod of the next 7 years.\n  That is a one-third cut in higher education. The suggestion by \nmembers of the Budget Committee that these cuts are not going to touch \nthe Pell grants, that we are going to hold them harmless, is basically \nhogwash. Even when we hold the Pell grants harmless, we see a 40-\npercent reduction in what has been a lifeline for young people to go on \nto higher education.\n  Mr. President, 70 percent of all the young people in my State need \nsome kind of assistance to go to the fine schools and colleges, the 4-\nyear colleges and the 2-year colleges in my State. And 75 percent of \nthat assistance comes from Federal support to higher education.\n  What is amazing to me is that after we have had this dramatic cut, \nand the Senate has rejected the efforts by Senator Harkin, Senator \nHollings, and others, to restore education funding, we now have this \namendment that restores a meager 10 percent of the proposed reduction \nin Federal support to higher education.\n  The explanation about how we are going to avoid instructions to the \nLabor and Human Resources Committee that will be charged with going \nahead with these cuts is enormously interesting to me.\n  We had a debate here on the floor of the U.S. Senate about how we \nought to eliminate home equity--farm home equity and home equity of \nyoung people--in our calculations of student assistance eligibility. \nWhy? Because the value of the farms have gone up over the period of \nrecent years. That has been true in the heartland of this Nation, just \nas it has been true in the increased value of homes as a result of \ninflation that students have nothing to do with. Including home equity \nin calculations for student aid eliminated the sons and daughters of \nworking families whose principal problem is the value of their farm \nwent up or their home went up.\n  A second debate we had here on the floor of the U.S. Senate, \nsupported by Republicans as well, was to give young people a few months \nafter they get out of college to find a job.\n  We wanted to make sure that they were not going to have to repay \ntheir loans for a short period of months--and we are talking a few \nmonths--after they graduate, when they are trying to find a job. That \ndecision had the support of Republicans and Democrats alike. Now we are \nfinding out that this grace period will be gone as well. Students are \ngoing to be penalized again.\n  I do not know how it is in other parts of the country, but I can tell \nyou the job market in my State is not flourishing for young people who \nare graduating from college. They are able to get jobs, but it takes \nthem a little while and their salaries to begin are low. Now the \nRepublicans want to penalize them for that.\n  If you want to talk about a figleaf over a problem, the Snowe \namendment is just that. This is a 10-percent restoration from the \nbudget cut. Some will say, given the fact we have been voted down and \nvoted down and voted down, we ought to grab this, because it is the \nonly thing we are going to get. The fact of the matter is, this \namendment proposes to find offsets from travel, bonuses, and other \nagencies, but these are not binding instructions. The appropriators \ndecide on those instructions. There is nothing to guarantee that \neducation will be off limits.\n  So on the one hand, the Snowe amendment may restore some benefit to \nthose who need Stafford loans, but you are taking money away from the \nsons and daughters of working families who need the help and assistance \nprovided in a title I program or a school-to-work program. There are no \nguarantees here that you are not going to just put it back in one part \nof education and sacrifice another part.\n  So we should be thankful for any kind of restoration of funds to \neducation. But I must say to the parents who are watching this debate \nthat what they ought to understand is that we are going to see a one-\nthird cut in the area of education, a $65 billion loss over the period \nof the next 7 years. The effect of this amendment, if it is successful, \nwill be a restoration of $6 billion of those funds.\n  The Senator from Connecticut, myself, the Senator from Minnesota, and \nothers will be offering, at an appropriate time, a very modest \namendment to restore $28 billion, not the full amount, but just $28 \nbillion, with offsets from corporate welfare and tax provisions.\n  It is extraordinary to me that once again we talk about educating \nchildren in this country, but the Budget Committee could only find $20 \nbillion out of $4 trillion reductions in tax expenditures to turn to \nthis important venture. We could have gotten the $60 billion. You would \nhave thought they could find the billionaires' tax cuts where you find \nbillionaires turning into Benedict Arnolds, where they make fortunes, \nhundreds of millions and billions of dollars, and then give up their \ncitizenship and go overseas and avoid any kind of taxes. You would have \nthought they could find----\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself another minute.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has no more time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yielded myself 8 minutes and I was given 10, I \nbelieve.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is incorrect. The time of the Senator \nhas expired.\n  Senator DeWine.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today in very strong opposition to \nthe amendment of my friend, the Senator from Maine. This amendment, \nfrankly, will hurt the very people it purports to help, our young \nchildren.\n  The Snowe amendment would support programs that are, in fact, \nmeritorious. But it would do so with an offset that would cause serious \nharm to the future of U.S. competitiveness in a very important high-\ntechnology industry. It would do so with an offset that would cause \nserious harm to U.S. competitiveness in an increasingly tough and \ncompetitive world. The offset assumes a reduction of $1.124 billion in \naeronautic research and development.\n  Let me explain the real world consequences this cut would have, and \nespecially what it would do to some very important programs at NASA.\n  One of the programs has to do with the advanced subsonic technology. \nThis program addresses future technology needs covering the whole \nspectrum of subsonic aviation, from commercial jets to small aircraft.\n  First of all, this program has already perfected techniques for \ndetecting and evaluating corrosion and cracks in aircraft. These \ntechniques have now become a part of the industry. If we make this cut, \nthe cut proposed in the Snowe amendment, our future ability to increase \nair safety will be seriously impaired.\n  Second, our ability to decrease the harmful environmental effects of \naircraft will also be seriously impaired. To remain globally \ncompetitive, U.S. aviation has to stay ahead of international \nenvironmental standards. Thanks in part to the advanced subsonic \ntechnology program, we are doing that today. It would be wrong to lose \nour competitive edge in this area.\n  Third, our ability to improve satellite air traffic control would \nalso be seriously hurt by a cut in this program.\n  All of these areas--aircraft safety, the environment, air traffic \ncontrol--are legitimate concerns of the Federal Government and have \nbeen an area where the Federal Government has been involved for \ndecades. In these areas, NASA is engaging in high-risk research that \nindividual companies simply cannot and will not undertake.\n  Furthermore, Federal investment in this technology has important \nroots in the history of our country, as I will explain in a few \nmoments. NASA's role, really, is to develop high-risk, high- \n[[Page S7283]] payoff, precompetitive technologies so they can then be \npassed along to private industry. This is something that only NASA can \ndo. And this investment is essential to the future of the U.S. aircraft \nindustry. The continuing growth of U.S. market share depends on our \nability to ensure that aircraft are safe, cost effective, and able to \ncomply with ever more stringent environmental regulations.\n  There is a long history of Government involvement in basic, \nprecompetitive research. Back in 1917, the United States established \nthe National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics to engage in basic \nprecompetitive research. The NACA was a precursor of NASA and did the \nsame kind of forward-looking work that would be cut under this \namendment.\n  Earlier this month we, of course, celebrated the 50th anniversary of \nthe end of World War II. Every single airplane that helped win that war \nwas made possible by NACA's testing facilities. No single corporation \nhad enough money to be able to invest in the kind of wind tunnels that \nwere used to test these planes. NACA's Ames facility did have those \nresources. No single corporation had the resources to do the basic \nresearch on how wings should be shaped. NACA did have the resources.\n  For almost eight decades, NACA, and its successor agency, today's \nNASA, have been making the kind of investment in America's aviation \nknowledge base that no corporation could possibly match. Every single \nplane in America today has NASA's technology somewhere in it. The \nlittle piece of wing that juts out perpendicular from the wing tip--\nknown as a winglet--was designed by NASA. The winglet increases the \nfuel efficiency of an airplane by 5 percent, and that 5 percent can \nmake a big difference in making U.S. planes competitive.\n  Just this week the Boeing 777 was unveiled. Major components in that \nplane were designed some 15 years ago in NASA's laboratories, not with \na view toward the product line of any particular corporation, but \nbecause, over the long run, the long term, America needs that \ntechnology know-how.\n  Another research project threatened by this amendment is NASA's high-\nspeed research program. Before investing the roughly $20 billion that \nmight be necessary to develop a high-speed civil transport aircraft, \nprivate companies need to know whether such a plane could be built in \ncompliance with environmental and safety standards.\n  If we allow the United States to fall behind in the quest for this \ntechnological breakthrough, the U.S. share of the long-range global \naircraft market could drop below 50 percent. It would be a horrible \nblow to the trade deficit, to high-technology jobs, and to something in \nmany respects even more important, our national sense that America is \nleading the world in the future of high technology.\n  America's ascent to the role of global superpower was made possible \nin large part by the ability of America's aviation pioneers to invest \nin the future.\n  Education--so ably advocated by my good friend from Maine--has to do \nwith preparing our children for the challenges of the future. This \nprogram--the program that would be cut by this amendment--is building \nthat future. I think cutting this program would be a very shortsighted \nmeasure--and the losers would be our children.\n  Tens of thousands of American children can grow up to work in high-\ntechnology aviation jobs--if we do not foreclose that option by making \nshortsighted decisions today.\n  In aviation, there is a truly global market. Over the next 15 to 20 \nyears, the global demand is expected to be between $800 billion and $1 \ntrillion.\n  A recent study by DRI/McGraw-Hill estimates that a 1-percent gain in \nU.S. market share creates 9,000 new jobs--and $120 million in Federal \nrevenues--each year.\n  Aviation already contributes over $25 billion a year to the U.S. \nbalance of trade. That's more than any other U.S. manufacturing \nindustry.\n  And aviation already generates almost a million high-quality jobs in \nthis country.\n  If we allow this cut to go forward, we will fall behind in our effort \nto develop technologies that will keep America on top of this global \nmarket.\n  I think we should continue to invest in a high-technology future for \nthis country.\n  I think NASDA's research on aviation plays a fundamental and \nirreplaceable role in that process.\n  That is why I will be voting ``no'' on the amendment proposed by the \nSenator from Maine. To vote ``no'' on this amendment is to say ``yes'' \nto a high-technology future for Amercia's children.\n  I will conclude by summarizing as follows: We hear a lot of talk on \nthis floor about making sure our children have good jobs, high-paying \njobs, high-technology jobs, and they should not be confined, as some \npeople on both sides of the aisle have said, to flipping hamburgers. \nThis type of research gives these good high-paying jobs to our \nchildren.\n  I urge, therefore, a ``no'' vote on the Snowe amendment. I urge a \nvote for our future.\n  I see my time is almost expired. I see my friend and colleague from \nOhio, who has a tremendous amount of experience in this area, has risen \nto speak and will be speaking in just a moment. I look forward to \nlistening to his comments.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I regret we have such a short time here \nthis morning to deal with this.\n  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment proposed by \nSenators Snowe, Abraham, Grassley, Brown, Kassebaum, Cohen, Lott, and \nChafee.\n  I support the goal of the amendment--to provide increased funds for \nhigher education. My record is clear and unequivocal on education \nfunding. These funds must be increased, but not in the way proposed by \nthe proponents of this amendment.\n  I do not know that there has been an education bill which I voted \nagainst since I have been in the Senate for over 20 years. My record is \nvery clear in that regard.\n  I want to speak about the offsets that are required here that would \nprovide the money for this particular amendment. I would like to speak \nabout two of the offsets that the amendment identifies and discuss the \nimpact which these cuts would have on our economy and our Federal \nworkers.\n  First, the amendment would zero out two important NASA programs. This \nNation has gotten to be what it is because we put more into research, \nand the inquiry into the unknown, into pushing back the frontiers of \nscience, and then we develop the industry and the business once that \nhas occurred. That has been the hallmark of America. We have been the \nenvy of the world in doing that; the envy of the world.\n  So these programs in our R are seed-corn type programs that whole \nindustries benefit from. We have seen in the past money spent at NASA \nin aeronautical research which in particular had led to the development \nof an aircraft industry in this country that has been leading in \nexports second only to farming, to agricultural products, in years \npast.\n  Dan Goldin, the Administrator of NASA, was given aid by the \nadministration, and was tasked to downsize some, and he went ahead and \ndid it. He did it, and he has a program in NASA, a 5-year budget, which \nwas about $122 billion in fiscal 1993. The 1996 request is now $82 \nbillion for the next 5 years. So they have been cut by one-third in \njust 2 years.\n  NASA has stepped up to the plate to reduce bureaucracy and improve \nthe way it does business. These programs are the R or seed-corn type \nprograms which many of my colleagues have heard me speak about in the \npast. This amendment would zero out NASA's High-Speed Research Program, \nand NASA's Advanced Subsonic Technology Program.\n  Before I talk about these specific programs, I would like to observe \nthat NASA has already absorbed more than its share of budget cuts. A \ncouple of figures will illustrate what I am talking about. In fiscal \nyear 1993, NASA's 5-year budget request was about $122 billion. The \nfiscal year 1996 request is now $82 billion for the next 5 years. NASA \nhas been cut by one-third in just over 2 years.\n  Dan Goldin's leadership of the agency is currently going through a \npainful process of reducing its budget by $5 billion over the next 5 \nyears. Mr. Goldin [[Page S7284]] believes that this can be achieved \nwithout eliminating programs. He has a tough row to hoe to achieve this\n and he just cannot do it if we impose another cut like this on his \nbudget over there.\n\n  These programs are valuable. They are not something that we just pick \nup and lay down as a whim. Further cuts in NASA's budget will simply \nresult in the elimination of current programs.\n  And Mr. President, I suggest that, if this amendment is approved, the \nfuture of NASA's three aeronautic research centers--Lewis Research \nCenter, Ames Research Center, and Langley Research Center will be in \njeopardy.\n  Now, let me talk about the High-Speed Research Program first. The \ngoal of this program is to help develop the technologies industry needs \nto design and build an environmentally compatible and economically \ncompetitive high-speed civil jet transport for the 21st century. The \ntechnology developments are to reach an appropriate stage of maturity \nto enable an industry decision on aircraft production by 2001.\n  Mr. President, the technologies currently needed to develop such a \ntransport are beyond the state of the art. NASA estimates that industry \nwill need to invest more than $20 billion to bring such a transport to \nmarket. A $20 billion industry just with this one development alone; \n$20 billion we are talking about, and we are talking about cutting back \nthe research that will make that possible.\n  Studies have identified a substantial market for a future supersonic \nairliner to meet rapidly growing demand for long-haul travel, \nparticularly across the Pacific.\n  Those that have been to the Southeast Asian area recently know how \nthat area is really expanding economically. Over the period from 2005 \nto 2015, this market could support 500 to 1,000 aircraft, creating a \nmultibillion sales opportunity for its producers. Such an aircraft will \nbe essential for capturing the valuable long-haul Pacific rim market.\n  As currently envisioned an HSCT aircraft should be designed to carry \n300 passengers at Mach 2.4 on transoceanic routes over distances up to \n6,000 nautical miles at fares comparable to subsonic transports.\n  Now let me talk about the Advanced Subsonic Technology Program.\n  The goal of NASA's Advanced Subsonic Technology program is to \ndevelop, in cooperation with the FAA and the U.S. aeronautics industry, \nhigh-payoff technologies to enable a safe, highly productive global air \ntransportation system that includes a new generation of environmentally \ncompatible, economical U.S. subsonic aircraft. Some of the technologies \nand issues being studied and developed in this program include:\n  First, fly-by-light/power-by-wire: a fully digital aircraft control \nsystem which would be substantially lighter, more reliable and \nefficient than current control systems.\n  Here is one that ought to get the attention of every single person \nwho is hearing my voice, and every single person in this Chamber: Aging \naircraft. My colleague from Ohio mentioned that a moment ago.\n  Second, aging aircraft: To develop new ways of inspecting aircraft to \ndetermine their airworthiness.\n  When you see a black storm cloud on the horizon the next time you are \ntaking off out of Washington National or Dulles in a 727 aircraft over \n20 years old, I think you would be interested in this kind of research \nNASA wants to do.\n  New approaches are being developed to determine the residual strength \nin airframes using advanced nondestructive technologies. It might be \nworth thinking about this program the next time you are sitting in a \n727 that's 20 years old waiting to take off on a cross-country flight.\n  Third, noise reduction: This program is developing technologies to \nreduce aircraft noise by 10 decibels or more by the year 2000.\n  Fourth, terminal area productivity: Technologies, chiefly involving \nair traffic control, that can improve the efficiency of operations on \nthe ground at busy airports.\n  Fifth, integrated wing design: New concepts, design methodologies, \nmodel fabrication and test techniques are being developed to provide \nindustry an integrated capability to achieve increased aircraft \nperformance at lower cost.\n  Sixth, propulsion: Technologies to improve fuel efficiency of future \ncommercial engines by at least 8 percent and reduce nitrogen oxides by \n70 percent over current technology.\n  These are only some of the technologies being developed under the \nprogram which the amendment's propents would completely gut.\n  It is a truly shortsighted amendment that would eliminate these \nimportant applied technology programs.\n  Mr. President, it is no secret that aerospace business is a \ngovernment-private sector partnership. Historically our government has \nfunded aeronautics R, and industry has taken this basic technology \nand developed aircraft that have dominated the world market. Over the \nlast decade or so, other governments have gotten into the act. \nCurrently, the U.S. market share is about 65 percent, down from about \n91 percent in the 1960's.\n  We had 91 percent of the world's commercial aircraft market in the \n1960's. We are now being competed with more vigorously than we have \never been in the past.\n  Cutting these two important programs will not help us regain this \nmarket share--quite the opposite. We will be sending a signal that the \nU.S. aircraft industry will be less competitive. I do not want to see \nthat happen.\n  In summary, the advanced subsonic technology: meets future technology \nneeds for next generation aircraft; enables NASA to develo high-risk, \nhigh-payoff, precompetitive technology to prove feasibility so that \nindustry may complete development and apply technology to specific \nproducts; will result in accomplishments in noise prediction codes for \nquieter engines, non-destructive evaluation techniques for detecting \ncorrosion, cracks and disbonds; analytical tools to understand aircraft \nwake vortices for safe landings; and assists in preserving 1 million \nU.S. high quality jobs and $25 to $30 billion in annual positive \nbalance of trade for U.S. aviation.\n  How can we possibly take a chance on knocking something like that \ndown?\n  The High-Speed Research Program will: enable NASA to develop early, \nhigh-risk technology for future environmentally compatible, \neconomically competitive high-speed civil transport aircraft \n(technologies needed are beyond state of the art); industry will take \nNASA technology and invest $20 billion to actually develop aircraft; \nand if the United States is first to market, the U.S. market share \ncould grow to 80 percent, achieve $200 billion in sales, and create \n140,000 new U.S. jobs.\n  Thank you Mr. President. I urge my colleagues to vote against the \nSnowe-Abraham amendment.\n  I think, while I support the goal of getting more money for \neducation, I certainly do not support taking it out of these forward-\nlooking research programs that have served us so well in the past, and \nwill in the future.\n                          impact on nasa lewis\n\n  NASA's zero-based review announced last week will have a significant \nimpact on Lewis Research Center outside of Cleveland, OH. Lewis will be \ngiven primary responsibility for aeronautics research, especially \naeropropulsion research. Other programs would be shifted away from \nLewis, including work on expendable launch vehicles.\n  Mr. President, if the proposal by the Senator from Maine is accepted, \nI think it could be the death knell for Lewis Research Center. I use \nthese words carefully. But when an agency like NASA is downsizing, and \nthe chief mission of a given facility is eliminated--and this amendment \nwould eliminate high-speed research and advanced subsonic technology \nresearch, which will be Lewis' bread and butter--then I think my words \nare accurate.\n  If Lewis closes, the impact on my State will be significant. \nAccording to NASA, Ohio has the second largest number of aeronautics \njobs in the country, behind California. This is due primarily to NASA \nLewis, Wright Patterson, the Ohio Aerospace Institute, and Ohio's \nuniversity system. Anchoring these jobs is Lewis. It attracts world \nclass scientists and engineers to world class facilities.\n  Did the Senator from Maine and her cosponsors consider this impact \nwhen they put together their amendment? I do not think so. \n[[Page S7285]] \n  Mr. President, Lewis employs directly about 4,500 people. About one-\nthird of these are in some way connected to aeronautics research. But \nthe multiplier effect is significant. The people employed at Lewis \nattract other businesses, or help form new ventures and stimulating the \neconomy. Gutting these two programs would have a serious impact on this \ndynamic system.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that several relevant \ndocuments be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Office of \n           the Administrator,\n                                      Washington, DC, May 8, 1995.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Domenici: I am writing to express NASA's \n     strong objection to the recommendation by the Congressional \n     Budget Office (CBO) in its February 1995 Report to the House \n     and Senate Committees on the Budget, ``Reducing the Deficit: \n     Spending and Revenue Options,'' to eliminate NASA's Advanced \n     Subsonic Technology and High Speed Research programs. I \n     request that this recommendation not be included in \n     assumptions supporting the Committee's forthcoming FY 1996 \n     Budget Resolution.\n       In making its recommendation, CBO contends that these \n     programs develop technologies which should be developed by \n     the private sector, namely large aircraft companies. The \n     aeronautics program conducted by NASA and its predecessor, \n     the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics, has, since \n     1917, developed a wide range of precompetitive technologies \n     to address safety, environmental, and aviation system \n     capacity issues, as well as aircraft performance. The \n     research and technology results, used by other U.S. \n     Government or commercial entities, directly benefit air \n     travellers and the general public while contributing to U.S. \n     economic strength and national security. NASA's role is to \n     develop high-risk, high-payoff technologies to a point where \n     feasibility is proven and transfer those to FAA, DOD and U.S. \n     industry. It is up to U.S. companies to make the substantial \n     investments to validate the technologies and incorporate them \n     into specific products and systems. Individual companies \n     simply cannot undertake the high-risk research and technology \n     development NASA does; investments are unrecoverable and \n     often beyond the capability of a single company.\n       Estimates for global aircraft market demand over the next \n     15 to 20 years range from $800 billion to $1 trillion. \n     However, this market could be much smaller if it is \n     constrained by safety and system capacity and/or an inability \n     to meet more stringent environmental standards. Part of \n     NASA's aeronautics research addresses these issues, i.e., to \n     ensure the largest possible market for which U.S. companies \n     will compete. U.S. companies currently hold about two-thirds \n     of the global market; their primary competitor, Airbus \n     Industries, is aiming to capture a full half of the market in \n     the next 10 years. A recent study by DRI/McGraw-Hill \n     estimates that a 1 percent gain in U.S. market share \n     generates 9,000 jobs (40 percent in aerospace and 60 percent \n     in supporting industries), $360 million in sales, and $120 \n     million in\n      Federal tax revenue each year. Aviation contributes between \n     $25 and $30 billion annually to the U.S. balance of trade, \n     the largest of any U.S. manufacturing industry.\n       I believe CBO is inaccurate in stating ``the benefits from \n     the R supported by the NASA programs in question fall \n     almost exclusively to aircraft manufacturers, their \n     suppliers, and airlines.'' These enabling advances provide \n     the basic tools for U.S. industrial innovation. While NASA \n     R contributes to a stronger U.S. aviation industry, the \n     benefits are broader. Terminating these important technology \n     programs would have repercussions far beyond the short-term \n     profitability of U.S. aircraft manufacturers and airline \n     operators. Joint NASA-FAA efforts to safely increase the \n     capacity of the airspace system, eliminating costly and \n     unproductive delays, would end. Technologies to ensure that \n     the aging aircraft fleet remains safe and cost-effective \n     would not be developed. U.S. efforts to develop rational \n     positions on proposed international environmental regulations \n     governing airline operations would be severely hampered, and \n     new technologies to meet increasingly stringent environmental \n     requirements would not be developed. The Nation's only \n     precompetitive technology development for general aviation, \n     commuter, and civil tiltrotor aircraft would end.\n       NASA understands the continued budget pressures facing the \n     Nation. In fact, NASA has led the Federal Government by \n     reducing its outyear budget by 30 percent since 1993 and is \n     engaged in a major effort to identify an additional $5 \n     billion in reductions between FY 1997 and FY 2000. We shall \n     continue to seek efficiencies and streamline our processes to \n     ensure that the Nation has the best possible civil \n     aeronautics and space program, conducting cutting-edge \n     research and technology which will lead the United States \n     into the 21st century.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Daniel S. Goldin,\n     Administrator.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n    Response to CBO Recommendation To Eliminate NASA's Support for \n                   Producers of Commercial Airliners\n\n       CBO criticizes NASA's Advanced Subsonic Technology (AST) \n     Program's goal of maintaining current U.S. market share in \n     subsonic aircraft.\n       Aviation generates almost one million high quality jobs in \n     the U.S. and contributes between $25 and $30 billion annually \n     to the U.S. balance of trade--the largest of any U.S. \n     manufacturing industry.\n       U.S. aircraft and engine manufacturers must compete \n     effectively on both cost and technical capability with \n     government-subsidized foreign competition. Airbus already \n     claims more than one-third of the commercial aircraft market; \n     their goal is 50% by 2005.\n       The AST program addresses future technology needs not only \n     in next-generation subsonic aircraft, including small general \n     aviation aircraft and civil tiltrotor as well as large \n     transports, but also for safety and capacity of the evolving \n     airspace system and environmental concerns.\n       NASA's role is to develop high-risk, high-payoff \n     precompetitive technologies to a point where feasibility is \n     proven and transfer those to FAA, DOD and U.S. industry. \n     Industry picks up the technologies, and with its own \n     resources continues development, performs systems-oriented \n     research and applies them to specific products.\n       CBO criticizes NASA's role in High Speed Research (HSR).\n       The technologies required for an environmentally \n     compatible, economically viable High Speed Civil Transport \n     (HSCT) aircraft are beyond today's state-of-the-art. Before \n     industry can decide whether to invest the roughly $20 billion \n     required to develop an HSCT, some level of confidence must be \n     established that it could meet noise and emissions standards \n     and that airlines could operate it profitably. The HSR \n     program was designed to develop precompetitive technologies \n     to eliminate the highest technology risks for a future HSCT, \n     ensuring U.S. leadership.\n       The first to market a successful HSCT stands to gain $200 \n     billion in sales and 140,000 new jobs.\n       CBO criticizes NASA's work in technologies that will allow \n     the continued operation of aging jet aircraft.\n       25% of planes flying today are more than 20 years old, \n     beginning to exceed their design life. The trend is to fly \n     aircraft 30 years or more; as airlines continue to operate on \n     the edge of profitability they cannot afford new aircraft. It \n     is essential that these aging aircraft remain safe.\n       CBO contends that ``the benefits from the R supported by \n     the NASA programs in question fall almost exclusively to \n     aircraft manufacturers, their suppliers, and airlines.''\n       A recent study by DRI/McGraw-Hill estimates that a 1% gain \n     in U.S. market share will generate 9,000 jobs (40% in \n     aerospace and 60% in supporting industries), $360 million in \n     sales and $120 million in Federal tax revenue each year.\n       NASA's programs address critical issues of safety, airspace \n     system capacity, and environmental aspects of flight which \n     benefit air travellers and the general public.\n       CBO contends that noise and atmospheric pollutants \n     generated by air travel are unpaid ``costs'' that travellers \n     impose on the public at large and therefore air travellers \n     should pay the full cost, including R for aircraft.\n       Air travel is global, not national, just as the aircraft \n     market is global. Airline operators will buy the best \n     aircraft at the best price. If U.S. manufacturers were to \n     incorporate the price of meeting international, government-\n     established environmental regulations into their products \n     they would quickly go out of business competing against \n     government-subsidized competition.\n                      advanced subsonic technology\n\n       National investment in high-risk, high-payoff technologies \n     will help ensure continued U.S. leadership in aviation, which \n     brings significant economic and national security benefits to \n     the Nation. Aviation generates almost one million high \n     quality jobs in the U.S. and contributes between $25 and $30 \n     billion annually to the U.S. balance of trade--the largest of \n     any U.S. manufacturing industry.\n       NASA addresses a broad range of advanced technology needs \n     for both civil and military aviation. The Advanced Subsonic \n     Technology (AST) program specifically addresses future \n     technology needs in next-generation subsonic aircraft (from \n     large commercial jets to small general aviation aircraft) and \n     the evolving airspace system. NASA's role is to develop high-\n     risk, high-payoff precompetitive technologies to a point \n     where feasibility is proven and transfer those to FAA, DOD \n     and U.S. industry. Industry picks up the technologies, and \n     with its own resources continues development, performs \n     systems-oriented research and applies them to specific \n     products.\n       Recent accomplishments in the AST program include:\n       The first integrated engine noise prediction code was \n     delivered to industry for use in designing quieter engines to \n     meet future noise standards.\n       Nondestructive evaluation techniques for detecting \n     corrosion, cracks and disbonds in aircraft have been licensed \n     to industry to help keep the aging aircraft fleet \n     safe. [[Page S7286]] \n       Tropospheric climatology data has been collected, to assist \n     in understanding long-term changes in nitrogen oxides in the \n     lower atmosphere caused by aircraft.\n       Analytical tools to understand aircraft wake vortices are \n     being developed, which will contribute to revised safe \n     aircraft landing separation standards.\n       An experimental database is improving understanding the \n     relative acoustic and aerodynamic benefits of different rotor \n     configurations for future civil tiltrotors.\n       FY 1995 Budget: $125.8 million.\n       FY 1996 Budget: $188.4 million.\n       Possible impact of significant reduction/termination:\n       Efforts to develop technologies to increase the capacity of \n     the airspace system, increasing safety and expanding the \n     aircraft market, would be severely curtailed. Weather and \n     capacity delays cost airline operators $3.5 billion a year, \n     and cause untold hours of unproductive time for the \n     travelling public.\n       Technologies to ensure that the aging aircraft fleet (25% \n     of planes flying today are more than 20 years old) remains \n     safe and cost-effective would not be developed.\n       U.S. efforts to develop rational positions on proposed \n     international environmental regulations would be hampered by \n     not developing better understanding of aircraft noise and \n     pollution effects and technologies to minimize those effects.\n       The only technology development efforts in the U.S. for \n     general aviation, commuter and civil tiltrotor aircraft would \n     be terminated.\n       The ability of U.S. aircraft and engine manufacturers to \n     compete effectively on both cost and technical capability \n     with government-subsidized foreign competition would be \n     seriously hampered. Airbus already claims more than one-third \n     of the commercial aircraft market, and their goal is one-half \n     by 2005.\n\n\n                          high speed research\n\n       NASA's High Speed Research (HSR) Program is performing the \n     early, high-risk technology development for an \n     environmentally compatible, economically competitive high \n     speed civil transport (HSCT) aircraft. Such a plane would fly \n     at more than twice the speed of sound and carry 300 \n     passengers over 5000 nautical miles at fares close to today's \n     subsonic aircraft (747, DC-10, etc.). Before industry can \n     decide whether to make the roughly $20 billion investment to \n     develop an HSCT, some level of confidence must be established \n     that it could meet international noise and emissions \n     standards, and that airline operators would be able to \n     operate it profitably. The technologies to achieve this are \n     beyond today's state-of-the-art. The HSR program was designed \n     to eliminate the highest risks and ensure U.S. leadership in \n     this important arena.\n       Recent accomplishments:\n       Completed research campaign in the South Pacific to \n     characterize the stratosphere for incorporation in \n     atmospheric simulation models which will be used to determine \n     the potential impact of future HSCT aircraft.\n       Achieved test goal for low-emission engine combustors \n     (NOX level of 5g/kg fuel burned--the Concorde emissions \n     index is 20g/kg)\n       Demonstrated a process to fabricate up to 10 feet per \n     minute of fiber/resin composite material suitable for high \n     temperature use, making the essential use of these materials \n     for an HSCT affordable.\n       FY 1995 Budget: $221.3 million.\n       FY 1996 Budget: $245.5 million.\n       Possible impact of significant reduction/termination:\n       Interim assessment of atmospheric effects of a supersonic \n     aircraft fleet would not be completed. This assessment is to \n     support work by the International Civil Aviation Organization \n     (ICAO) on setting an HSCT emissions standard.\n       Engine noise reduction tests and analysis to determine \n     whether an HSCT could comply with strict international noise \n     standards (Annex 16, Chapter 3 set by ICAO) would be stopped.\n       The U.S. share of the global long-range aircraft market \n     could drop to under 50%, if technology development is stopped \n     and Europe is first to market with a successful HSCT. This \n     would result in larger trade deficits and the loss of \n     hundreds of thousands of high-skill, high-wage jobs. If the \n     U.S. is first to market, the U.S. market share could grow to \n     nearly 80%, and crate $200 billion sales and 140,000 new \n     jobs.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n    FISCAL YEAR 1996 ESTIMATED TOTAL AERONAUTICS EMPLOYMENT BY STATE    \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                     Total      Funding \n   OA rank                   State                employment  (millions)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n 1..........

Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from New Mexico has \n13 minutes, and the Senator from Maine has 17 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Might I ask the distinguished Senator from Maine, does \nshe need all 17 minutes? We are trying to expedite things.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if we might reach this agreement. I understand \nthere is one second-degree amendment contemplated. I assume that we \ncould enter into a unanimous-consent agreement about that.\n  Let me ask Senator Snowe, could she get by with 10 minutes?\n  Ms. SNOWE. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I could use 10 minutes. Then we could move to a second-\ndegree amendment by Senator Dodd for 5 minutes on a side.\n  Mr. EXON. First, the second-degree amendment by Mr. Dodd, as I \nunderstand it, is the same second-degree amendment being considered by \nthe Senator from Minnesota, and also the Senator from Massachusetts. Is \nthat correct? We are talking about one second-degree amendment?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes.\n  Mr. EXON. Certainly, we would agree. We will need about 2 minutes for \nthe negotiations that are going on. I think we are pretty close to \nmaking an arrangement along the lines that you outlined.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am going to get somebody to come to the floor, but I \nleave this suggestion. I must attend a meeting on the final wrap-up on \nthis bill now, but we would be willing to have 5 minutes on a side on \nthe Dodd amendment, which I have seen, which essentially is a change on \nthe tax side of the equation, and spend the tax money in two ways, part \nof it on entitlement programs for education and part on discretionary, \nand we would take 5 minutes on our side on that, 10 minutes each here. \nThen I would authorize somebody to enter into that agreement in my \nbehalf in my absence.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield, I wonder if I might get a \ncouple of minutes on the Snowe amendment itself. Is that a possibility? \nOf the time you have?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I cannot hold the Senator to this, but \nif the Senator will talk about the Snowe amendment and not about \neducation in general, that would be fine. The Senator wants to speak \nagainst that amendment?\n  Mr. DODD. I do.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If I am going to give the Senator time against it, I \nwant him to be against it.\n  Mr. DODD. I intend to be against the Snowe amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And the Senator will speak against it?\n  Mr. DODD. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. All right, I yield Senator Dodd 2 minutes of my time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I wonder if my colleague from New Mexico, upon \ncondition that I speak against the Snowe amendment, would grant me \ntime?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will give the Senator 2 minutes of my time.\n  How much did I give the Senator?\n  Mr. DODD. The Senator did not.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I give the Senator 2 minutes of my time. Each Senator \ngets 2 minutes in opposition and that will keep 6 for me, and then \nSenator Snowe has the full 10 minutes to speak to the Senator's \namendment.\n  Mr. EXON. Is that in the form of a unanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator said he needed some time. Is he willing to \ndo that?\n  Mr. EXON. That is agreeable to those on this side.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let us give it a try.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, and I do not intend to \nobject, will the result of that proposal ensure that we will have an \nopportunity to vote on the Dodd amendment in a timely way?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Sure. We will not amend it. We do not guarantee that \nsomebody will not table it, but we will have a vote on it and we will \nagree to stack it in the normal way that we are doing the others.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. So it would be treated as a second-degree amendment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Exactly.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. In that particular order.\n  [[Page S7287]]\n  \n  Mr. DOMENICI. Correct.\n  Let us try this, Mr. President. First of all, I am going to yield 2 \nminutes in opposition to the Snowe amendment to Senator Dodd, 2 minutes \nto Senator Wellstone, and I reserve the remainder for myself.\n  The total amount of time that is going to be used on the Snowe \namendment--and we yield back whatever other time we have--is 10 minutes \nby Senator Snowe and a total of 10 minutes in opposition, of which 4 \nhave just been allocated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me move on then to a unanimous-consent request. \nThere will only be one second-degree amendment. It shall be an \namendment offered by Senator Dodd which has been described here and \npresented to the Senator from New Mexico. There will be 5 minutes on a \nside, 5 minutes by Senator Dodd, 5 minutes in opposition, either by \nmyself or Senator Snowe. We will then proceed to an amendment by \nSenator Hatfield immediately after that. And when the time has expired \non the second-degree amendment--there shall be no other second-degree \namendments--we will then stack the second-degree amendment pursuant to \nthe previous understanding, that the leader will arrange the order and \nthere will be a vote on or about the Dodd amendment in the stacked \norder.\n  Mr. EXON. I certainly do not object. I would just simply wish to \nexpand this in order to move things along. We are prepared to consider \ntime agreements now on both the Hatfield amendment and the amendment \nfollowing that to be offered by Senator Boxer.\n  Is the Senator from New Mexico in a position to talk about time \nagreements on the Hatfield amendment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am going to a meeting right now at which I think the \nSenator will be in attendance, and I will seek some relief on time.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise this morning to express my objection \nto the Snowe-Abraham amendment. This amendment proposes to restore some \n$6.3 billion in education, specifically to reduce the Labor Committee's \ninstruction by this amount in an effort to stave off severe cuts in \nstudent loans.\n  Let me at the outset say I appreciate the fact that there is at least \nsome recognition of the fact we ought to be trying to restore some of \nthese critical funds in education.\n  Education has always been an issue that has transcended politics in \nmany ways. There has been a deep commitment historically to it on both \nsides of the aisle, and yet the Budget Committee proposal that is \nbefore us, even with the Snowe-Abraham amendment, offers education too \nlittle too late, I would say, Mr. President.\n  It is too little in that it offers students an umbrella in the midst \nof the hurricane they face with this budget proposal, even if this \namendment were to be adopted. It will provide some protection but it is \nthe thinnest of fig leaves in that the committee will still have to \neliminate $7.5 billion from student loan programs.\n  I have been through a number of reconciliations on the Labor \nCommittee and make no mistake about it--there is only one place you can \nfind $7.5 billion, and that is in student loans. There is no other \nplace within our committee's jurisdiction. And so we will be faced with \nlooking ways to cut loans for working-class families, middle-class \nfamilies many who do not qualify for Pell grants, do not have the \npersonal affluence, and yet long for the better life that higher \neducation can offer their children. And these will be the Americans who \nbear the brunt of these cuts.\n  Now, these cuts may take many forms. It could come from the \nelimination of the in-school interest subsidy which can amount to \nadditional costs of as much as $4,000 for a working family in this \ncountry; it could come through increased fees, through the elimination \nof the 6-month grace period, or an increase in the interest on student \nloans or any combination of those, again all money out of students' \npockets. The bottom line is students and families are going to pay \ndearly as a result of what is in this budget, even if we adopt the \nSnowe-Abraham amendment.\n  This amendment is also too late, Mr. President, because the amendment \nonly addresses the end of the education pipeline, higher education. Our \nworld class higher education sector is in no way secure if our efforts \nin college preparation, elementary and secondary schools, Head Start \nand other areas are going to be severely undercut.\n  This amendment is sort of the double whammy for these critical \ndiscretionary programs. Not only does it not address the cuts proposed \nin these programs, it also further cuts into discretionary programs to \noffset the reduction it makes on the mandatory side.\n  Mr. President, we will offer a second degree amendment as an \nalternative which offsets $28 billion in cuts in education with very \nspecific plugging of corporate loopholes which we can identify \nspecifically, which Mr. Kasich on the House side identified as areas \nthat should be looked at in the effort to balance our Federal budget.\n  So I would urge rejection of this amendment, with all due respect. We \nwill have a substitute that will allow for this body to vote on truly \nwhether or not they want to see these working-class families in this \ncountry get a break when it comes to education.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, last year in Minnesota over 14,000 \nstudents received assistance from the Federal Stafford Loan Program--\n14,000 students.\n  I just rise to speak in opposition to the Snowe amendment and say \nthat I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the Dodd amendment.\n  Mr. President, this is, indeed, too little too late. What we are \nfaced with right now are some really draconian cuts that will do \nirreparable harm to higher education in America. In the second-degree \namendment we are going to introduce, we focus on corporate welfare or \ntax expenditures.\n  Mr. President, I would far prefer for some of the oil companies, some \nof the large pharmaceutical or insurance companies or large financial \ninstitutions to be tightening their belts and to be a part of the \nsacrifice than I would go forward with deep cuts in financial \nassistance for higher education.\n  I cannot think of a more important middle-class issue as a former \ncollege professor than this issue.\n  I do not have time, but if I had time I could recite story after \nstory after story after story of students who have written letters to \nme and made phone calls saying for God sake, please do not deny us the \nopportunity to have an affordable higher education. No matter how you \ncut it, that is what these cuts are all about. I do not even have a \nchance in the 2 minutes to talk about earlier education which is, of \ncourse, equally important.\n  These cuts in higher education are myopic. These cuts are profoundly \nmistaken for our country. These cuts will have an accrual effect on \nstudents all across the across the nation from Ohio to Minnesota, and \nthe Snowe amendment in that respect is really just a little bit more \nthan symbolic--too little, too late. We can do much, much better in how \nwe sort out our priorities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. How much time is remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine has 10 minutes. The \nopposition now has 6.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair. I would yield such time as the \nSenator from Maine may need on the available time.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Senator from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I found quite interesting the debate that has been offered \nhere today on my amendment.\n  First of all, just to recap my amendment, it is to restore $6.3 \nbillion in the education account. And, yes, we do provide specific \noffsets. That should be no [[Page S7288]] surprise if you are \nattempting to provide a credible alternative.\n  And that is why I am somewhat confused by the debate here this \nmorning, because I heard from the Senator from Ohio that my offsets are \nbinding but then we heard from the Senator from Massachusetts that they \nare not binding.\n  Well, I think we all understand the true nature of the budget process \nin the Congress. No, the instructions in the budget resolution are not \nbinding. But if you are attempting to provide real numbers to \ndemonstrate that they are credible, then it is responsible to recommend \nsome specific offsets.\n  It is also true the committees do not have to follow those \ninstructions. I understand that and the cosponsors of this amendment \nunderstand that. But we want to make sure that everybody understands \nthat there is a way to reach those numbers. That is what is important.\n  The second issue is whether or not you live in a fiscal fantasy land. \nThe difference between the amendment that I am offering here today with \nthe cosponsors of this amendment and those who oppose it is we support \na balanced budget. If you support a balanced budget, you have to make \nsome choices. If you do not support a balanced budget, you do not have \nto make any choices. You can spend in an unlimited fashion.\n  The amendment that they will be offering will recommend reducing \ncorporate welfare and tax loopholes. You cannot object to that. But \nexactly how are we going to reach that goal? They do not specify. No, \nthey do not want to specify, because they do not want to receive any \nopposition to those specific offsets, just as they do not support a \nbalanced budget because they do not want to make any real choices as to \nhow we get there. So that is the difference.\n  My amendment is a credible amendment. It restores specific funding \nfor specific issues with respect to student loan assistance. Yes, I \nwould like to do more. But there are those on my side saying, ``You are \ndoing too much,'' and then I hear from the other side of the aisle who \nsay, ``No, you are not doing enough.'' Well, I think my amendment is \nsomewhere in the middle. Hopefully, we will do more in the final \nanalysis.\n  The amendments that have been offered to restore funding for \neducation have used the illusory dividend. Well, that is just gimmickry \nat this point. That dividend may come down at the end of this process \nwhen reconciliation is in place. That does not give adequate \ninstructions to the committee. It is not money that they can use right \nnow and everybody knows it.\n  So if we really want to restore funding to education, if we really \nwant to address the home and farm equity issue so that it is not used \nto determine one's income eligibility for student loans, if we want to \nkeep the origination fee at 3 percent, if we want to have an adequate \ngrace period, then you support the Snowe amendment.\n  And, I should add who the cosponsors are of my amendment: Senator \nKassebaum, Senator Lott, Senator Cohen, Senator Abraham, Senator Brown, \nSenator Grassley, Senator Chafee, and Senator Kempthorne.\n  In fact, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Kempthorne from Idaho \nas a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. How much time is remaining on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 6 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I yield 6 minutes to my friend from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. President, last night, when we were watching the discussion take \nplace, a comment was made by the Senator from Wyoming that the debate \nis getting redundant on this budget; that we have heard about every \nargument there is to hear and now we are working on repetition to try \nto drive it in.\n  It occurred to me that it sounded very much like the debate that we \nhad on the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. At that time, \npeople were standing up and saying, ``Well, give us the details. Give \nus the details. Where do you want to make cuts? What do you want to do \nwith Medicare and Social Security,'' and all the contentious items that \nwe can so easily demagog?\n  I can suggest right now we have the details. But I wanted to take a \ncouple of minutes this morning to share one thing with you, and that is \nwe know pretty much how it is going to come out. We know who is going \nto vote for it and who is going to vote against it. And we know why.\n  First of all, the argument has been used that there are cuts. We have \ntalked about this over and over again. They are not cuts in the \nMedicare system. We are talking about a growth factor that is built in. \nAnd the same thing is true with all the other areas that people are \nvery much concerned with.\n  What we are trying to do is take this one last golden opportunity \nthat we have--this is it, our chance to fulfill that obligation that \nthe American people gave to us back on November 8 with a mandate. The \nNo. 1 mandate was to balance the budget. This is an opportunity to do \nit. The House has already done theirs. All we have to do is do it here. \nI think the votes are here to do it.\n  But I have heard people stand up, such as one Senator the other day, \nand say every Senator wants to balance the budget. I suggest, Mr. \nPresident, that is not true. I suggest that they want people to think \nthey want to balance the budget, but what it gets down to is they are \nbasically traditional big spenders and big taxers and they want the \nstatus quo. They want to keep Government going as it has been going.\n  To demonstrate this, I am going to tell you, Mr. President, who is \ngoing to be voting against this. The same people who will be voting \nagainst it today are the ones that voted for and are the right-to-know \nsupporters. These are the ones that did not want a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution.\n  So during that debate, I characterized who these people are who do \nnot want a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution and today do \nnot want a balanced budget. I suggest to you they are the ones that can \nbe identified with a voting behavior of taxing and spending.\n  And I use as my examples the tax bill of 1993, the tax bill that was \na Clinton bill that some people are touting as the great deficit \nreduction bill. In fact, it did not reduce any programs. All it did was \nincrease taxes, the largest tax increase in history--$267 billion. That \nis not what the American people wanted. It was an increase in taxes on \nall segments of society, a Social Security tax increase for thousands \nof Social Security recipients. It was a 70-percent increase. Yet, these \nindividuals who will vote today against this balanced budget are the \nones who voted for that tax increase.\n  Then along came the Clinton stimulus program. It was characterized by \na Democrat in this body as the largest single spending increase in the \nhistory of public finance in America or anywhere in the world. Such \nthings as the $2.5 billion for swimming pools, parking lots, ice rink \nwarming huts, alpine ski lifts, and other pork barrel projects; $1 \nbillion for summer jobs, $1.1 billion for AIDS treatment and food \ndistribution, on and on and on, all these spending increases that \nsupposedly were going to stimulate the economy.\n  So I characterized those individuals who voted for those two bills \nand also who are rated as big spenders. There are a number of \ncorporations that rate big spenders. The main one is the National \nTaxpayers Union. So I looked at those individuals who cosponsored the \nRight To Know Act which was the one to demolish, to do away with, the \nbalanced budget amendment and stop our effort for a balanced budget.\n  I found, of all the 41 cosponsors, all 41 voted yes on the biggest \nspending bill in the history of this body. And all 41 of those \nindividuals had a National Taxpayer Union rating of D or F.\n  So, Mr. President, I think that we have had a lot of debate on this. \nBut when it gets right down to it, the bottom line is this: Those \nindividuals who are trying to hold on to the past, those \n[[Page S7289]] who are trying with white knuckles to hold on to the \nstatus quo, those who did not hear the mandate that was so loud and \nclear on November 8, 1994, are going to be voting for big spending, big \ngovernment, tax increases, spending increases and vote against the \nbalanced budget that we have up before us today.\n  I believe it will pass, because those individuals who are for the \nstatus quo are now in a minority.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. How much time is remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-two seconds in opposition; and 6\\1/2\\ \nminutes for the Senator from Maine.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Six-and-a-half minutes remaining for the Senator from \nMaine?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six-and-a-half minutes remaining.\n  Ms. SNOWE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, since I have a few remaining moments on my \namendment, I think it is important to restate the case of how essential \nit is to restore funding to education, and the difference in the \namendments that are being offered this morning is a difference between \nbeing able to realistically restore funding to education or not, \nbecause you will hear from the other side in presenting an amendment \nthat there will not really be any specific offsets. While it is true \nthat my offsets are not binding on the committee, at least we are being \nresponsible in the approach that we are taking.\n  I think this amendment is critical because it does provide $6.3 \nbillion. It will be protecting some very serious student loan \nassistance programs, and I want to make sure that the low- and middle-\nincome families are not affected by any changes in the student loan \nprograms.\n  I also want to ensure that the Labor and Human Resources Committee \nhas the ability to protect the student loan assistance programs in the \nway that we have recommended in this amendment, so that they will not \nfeel compelled to include home and farm equity in determining one's \nincome eligibility, they will not feel compelled to raise the \norigination fee from 3 to 5 percent, and they will not feel compelled \nto eliminate an adequate grace period.\n  I know there are some who are opposed to the offsets, but the \ncommittees are the ones who are ultimately responsible for the way in \nwhich we provide the restoration of funds. They have the options to \npursue other courses.\n  The fact of the matter is, we have to take a responsible course by \nrecommending ways in which we can reach our goals as identified in this \namendment.\n  I think that it is very, very important that we restore some of the \nfunding in the education accounts. It is something that I argued within \nthe Budget Committee during the time in which we were assembling this \nresolution. I wish it were more, but I also understand the delicate \nbalance in crafting this budget resolution to reach the historic goal \nof balancing the budget by the year 2002.\n  I wish that we could identify other areas and perhaps that will \nultimately develop in the process. Maybe the dividend down the road, \nbut that dividend is not here today, and I think everybody should \nunderstand that. The dividend is not available to be used because it is \nnot there yet. We have to pass a balanced budget plan and \nreconciliation has to become law for the Congressional Budget Office to \nscore a potential dividend. That will materialize over 7 years, so that \nis not money that can be used by the Appropriations Committee or \nconsidered by the authorization committees as they develop their \nprogrammatic changes.\n  So it does not make sense and it is gimmickry to suggest that we are \ngoing to use an illusory estimate. So if you hear about amendments, as \nwe will hear from others this morning, about restoring funding by using \nthis dividend, it means nothing because it is not available and it is \nnot there yet.\n  So if you support restoring $6.3 billion in education and doing it in \na responsible way, then I hope you will support the Snowe amendment \nthat is cosponsored by 10 Members of the Senate.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, the Dodd second-degree amendment is, in \neffect, an increase in taxes and I am opposed to any increase in tax.\n  However, I am also opposed to the Snowe amendment.\n  Let me begin by stating that I am a strong supporter of educational \nfunding. I am firmly opposed to the drastic cuts in educational \nprograms and funding which is outlined in the House \nresolution. I believe that these cuts, while well-\nintentioned, are shortsighted. Such cuts ignore the long-term benefits \nof preparing America's children to assume their position in the world \nmarket, and for that reason I oppose those cuts.\n  By the same token, however, I believe that Senator Snowe's amendment \nis shortsighted. I believe that we, as guardians of our children's \nfuture, are charged with the moral obligation to not only educate our \nchildren but also to insure that there will be jobs available for them \nto assume once they have been educated. To ignore either is \nirresponsible.\n  Now let us take a look at what is on the table. The High-Speed \nResearch Program was designed to develop precompetitive technologies \nfor high-speed civil transport aircraft. Once developed, the technology \nis transferred to the Federal Aviation Administration, the Department \nof Defense, and U.S. industry. It is estimated that the first \norganization to market such an aircraft stands to gain $200 billion in \nsales and 140,000 new jobs. In short, this program accomplishes three \ngoals that are vital to the United States' financial solvency: First, \nit increases new jobs, which increases the country's tax base; second, \nit generates sales for U.S. industry, which increases the country's \nGNP, and, in so doing, increases the country's tax base; and third, it \ninsures the United States' continued leadership in this field, thus \nforecasting future revenues.\n  Likewise, the Advanced Subsonic Technology Program generates \nsubstantial long-term revenue benefits. This program is designed to \nprotect the United States' market share in subsonic aircraft, an area \nwhich generates almost a million high quality jobs in the United States \nand contributes between $25 and $30 billion annually to the U.S. trade \nbalance--which, incidentally is the largest of any U.S. manufacturing \nindustry. These programs are moneymakers, and to eliminate them for any \nreason is fiscally irresponsible.\n  This is particularly true under the present circumstances, where the \nchairman's budget adequately addresses the concerns raised by Senator \nSnowe. Senator Snowe's amendment seeks to restore $6.3 billion over 7 \nyears for undergraduate loans--$1.124 billion of this from the \ntermination of the NASA programs.\n  However, the chairman's resolution protects undergraduate student \nloans. Under Chairman Domenici's resolution, interest on loans for \nundergraduate education does not accrue until graduation. So, for all \nstudents who enter the work force immediately after college, nothing \nhas changed. With regard to individuals who choose to pursue graduate \nor professional coursework, interest would not accrue on their college \ndebt until they complete this coursework. Chairman Domenici's \nresolution does change the present student loan program with respect to \ndeferring interest payments accruing upon graduate and professional \ncoursework. However, this burden is lessened by the chairman's budget \nby preserving the benefits of capped interest rates on student loans, \nfederal guarantees, opportunities to defer payments in case of economic \nhardship, and Federal fellowship programs targeted specifically toward \ngraduate students.\n  The Snowe amendment ignores the long-term impact that terminating \nthese programs would have upon the U.S. balance of trade, the GNP and \nits consequent U.S. Treasury implication, and the generation of jobs in \nAmerica. Consequently, I oppose this amendment, and urge my fellow \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n                           Amendment No. 1128\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by Senator Snowe and others that [[Page S7290]] would reduce \nfunding for NASA's Aeronautics Program by $1.1 billion over the next 5 \nyears. The $1.1 billion reduction proposed in the Snowe amendment for \nAeronautics is in addition to the $800 million reduction proposed for \nNASA's Aeronautics Program that is included in the chairman's mark.\n  The effect of the Snowe amendment would be to eliminate NASA's \nAdvanced Subsonic Technology Development and High-Speed Research \nprograms which make up the core of NASA's Aeronautics program.\n  Mr. President, the aeronautics industry contributes over 1 million \nhigh quality jobs to the U.S. economy and generates $20 to $30 billion \nin exports each year. But U.S. aircraft and engine manufacturers must \ncompete on both cost and technical capability against government-\nsubsidized foreign competition.\n  The European Airbus Consortium already claims more than one-third of \nthe commercial aircraft market, a market once dominated by U.S. \nmanufacturers. The goal of Airbus is to control 50 percent of the \nglobal market by the year 2005.\n  I do not intend to let the Europeans accomplish their goal, Mr. \nPresident. That is why, when I was chair of the VA-HUD Appropriations \nSubcommittee, I pushed NASA to expand their research and technology \nefforts in aeronautics.\n  NASA's Advanced Subsonic Technology program specifically addresses \nfuture technology needs in next-generation subsonic aircraft--from \nlarge commercial jets to small general aviation aircraft--and the \nevolving airspace system. NASA's role is to develop high-risk, high-\npayoff pre-competitive technologies to prove technical feasibility and \nthen transfer these new technologies to the FAA, DOD, and U.S. \nindustry.\n  Elimination of the Advanced Subsonic Technology program would \nterminate NASA's efforts to develop technologies to increase the \ncapacity of the airspace system, to ensure that the existing aging \naircraft fleet remains safe and cost-effective, and that the \ntechnologies needed for U.S. industry to meet international \nenvironmental, noise, and pollution regulations are available.\n  Mr. President, the Snowe amendment would also wipe out NASA's High \nSpeed Research program which is conducting the early, high-risk \ntechnology development needed for an environmentally compatible and \neconomically competitive high speed civil transport (HSCT). The goal of \nthis program is develop a plane that would fly at more than twice the \nspeed of sound and carry 300 passengers over 5,000 nautical miles at \nfares competitive with existing subsonic aircraft.\n  Mr. President, the stakes associated with the development of the HSCT \nare enormous. If the Europeans are the first to market an HSCT, it will \ncost the U.S. larger trade deficits and the loss of hundreds of \nthousands of high-skilled, high-wage jobs. If the U.S. wins this race, \nthe U.S. market share for commercial aircraft could grow to nearly 80 \npercent, and create $200 billion in sales and 140,000 new jobs.\n  Mr. President, I happen to believe that the best social program is a \njob, and that job creation in America must be linked to our \nmanufacturing base. Manufacturing in the new economy of a post-cold war \nera will require high technology and competitiveness in the global \nmarketplace.\n  America's future in manufacturing begins and ends with aeronautics. \nCommercial aviation is one of the few areas of manufacturing where the \nU.S. continues to export more than we import, and where we are able to \nprovide high-skilled, high quality jobs for American workers.\n  Mr. President, I do not intend to let our commercial aviation \nindustry go the way of the VCR, the automobile, or the textile \nindustry. I intend to fight to keep the U.S. aeronautics industry \ncompetitive so that we preserve the jobs we have and the job \nopportunities needed for the 21st century.\n  The Snowe amendment would reduce funding for NASA's Aeronautics \nProgram by two-thirds over the next 5 years. The amendment is \nshortsighted and threatens our ability to develop a manufacturing \nstrategy for this Nation.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment offered by my \ndistinguished colleague from Maine, Senator Snowe. I, too, am concerned \nabout the deep cuts--$14.6 billion over 7 years--in the William D. Ford \nFederal Direct Loan and Federal Family Education Loan Programs which \nmake it possible for many of our young people to pursue a higher \neducation.\n  However, I cannot support an amendment to restore funding for \nmandatory programs, such as the $6.3 billion for these student loan \nprograms, by cutting nonmilitary discretionary programs by an equal \namount. In other words, it would not cut military spending at all, even \nthough it is the only area of the discretionary budget that will not be \ncut under this budget resolution. Not only is this robbing Peter to pay \nPaul, it violates the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 which prohibits \noffsetting tax cuts or mandatory program expansions with cuts in \ndiscretionary programs.\n  In addition, it is not growth in nonmilitary discretionary programs \nwhich is driving up the Federal deficit. This spending has been at a \nhard freeze or below since 1993. The budget resolution before us would \ncut nonmilitary discretionary programs nearly $200 billion below a \nfreeze over the next 7 years. Meanwhile, mandatory programs and tax \nexpenditures will continue to grow--the latter with no restraint at all \nunder this budget resolution.\n  No one understands the value of a higher education better than I, but \nI cannot support this amendment which would set an unacceptable \nprecedent for funding mandatory programs with nonmilitary discretionary \nprogram cuts.\n  Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, I offer this substitute amendment to the \nSnowe-Abraham amendment on behalf of myself and Senators Harkin, \nHollings, Kennedy, Jeffords, Pell, Wellstone, and Simon.\n  As I understand it, there are now 5 minutes to be allocated on either \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I offer this amendment which will restore \n$28 billion to our education programs. This is substantially less than \nthe amendment that was offered yesterday by several of my colleagues, \nbut this amendment would reduce the committee's instruction and, \nthereby, the cuts in student loans by $12 billion and restore $16 \nbillion in discretionary cuts in education.\n  This amendment is also deficit neutral. While certainly in these \nresolutions it is ultimately up to the committees of jurisdiction as to \nwhere specifically they will make their cuts, I offset this $28 billion \nand suggest specifically four areas within the Tax Code that would \nprovide up to $65.7 billion in revenues currently lost through \ncorporate tax loopholes.\n  These areas were identified in a list of corporate tax loopholes \ncompiled by the chairman of the Budget Committee on the House side, Mr. \nKasich from Ohio. Let me identify them specifically.\n  You can pick $28 billion out of the $65.7 billion they would garner. \nThe issue is choosing between these tax loopholes or investing in the \neducation of children in this country who need higher education and \ncount on the Federal investment in critical elementary and secondary \nprograms.\n  One is the expatriate billionaire tax loophole. Closing this loophole \ngenerates $2.1 billion. Those are people who leave the country, fly out \nof America to avoid their taxes. That is $2.1 billion. So that is part \nof the choice: Helping out those people or children and students in \nthis country who need an education.\n  The second is $26 billion. This currently shields foreign source \nincome of U.S. firms from U.S. taxes, which should apply to that \nincome. This change alone generates $26 billion. If you do not want to \ntake all $26 billion, you can reduce that somewhat, since I offer a \ntotal of $65 billion in offsets. I understand it may be important to \nsome firms, but we are making tough choices around here. So you have to \nask yourself on this one: Should we modify that tax loophole to some \ndegree to help pay for the education needs of America? That is my \nsecond tax loophole.\n  My third permits U.S. exporters to exempt a portion of their export \nincome from U.S. taxation--the House Budget Committee's figures suggest \nthat this would generate an additional $10.9 billion. Again, you do not \nhave to take all of it here, since there is the other part of the total \n$65 billion. But can't we take some of that money and try and restore \nthese funds for the educational needs of America?\n  And last, Mr. President, the one that provides $26.3 billion is one \nthat interacts with the foreign tax credit provisions in a way that can \neffectively exempt a portion of a firm's export income from U.S. \ntaxation. It is called the inventory property sales source rule \nexemption. The title is vague to me, but there is what Mr. Kasich said \nit does.\n  So $26.3 billion, $10.9 billion, $26.4 billion and $2.1 billion--that \nis $65.7 billion. I would like to get just $28 billion out of that $65 \nbillion to try and shield students and families from the crushing blow \nof these education cuts--and preserve their access to higher education \nand continue our partnerships with schools and communities across this \ncountry in elementary and secondary education.\n  That is the choice: Whether you want to keep these tax loopholes or \nrestore the $28 billion. We all make tough decisions.\n  Again, this is Mr. Kasich's list, this is not my list. These are the \nprovisions he suggested that we ought to be looking at as a way to try \nto deal with deficit reduction. My amendment allows us to take these \nsteps while simultaneously making the kinds of investments families \nacross America need--$12 billion to protect the student loan program \nand $16 billion to support critical discretionary programs like Pell \ngrants, title I, and Head Start. Families and students need that kind \nof help.\n  Mr. President, this is an investment we must make in our future. Last \nCongress was hailed as the education Congress. We passed legislation \nlowering student loan costs, Head Start legislation that was to move us \nto fully funding all eligible children, the Goals 2000 legislation \noffering vital federal support to local efforts to improve our schools.\n  With this budget, we back away from our commitment. At this rate we \nwill need to rename that last act if we are being honest with the \nAmerican people. [[Page S7292]] Why do we not call it Goals 3000 \nbecause, obviously, if we continue with the cuts proposed here we are \nnever going to reach our goals, Goals 2000 becomes an absolute mirage. \nIt does not exist. As this resolution is, we move the goal posts \nfurther down the road and make our education deficit that much larger.\n  So here is the choice: Billionaire tax loophole and some modification \nof the treatment of export income or critical investments in education.\n  Mr. President, I strongly urge that my colleagues support us in this \nsubstitute amendment. This gives this body the opportunity to \ndemonstrate that the educational needs of America are just as \nimportant--just as important--as the export income or the billionaire \ntax loophole. The issue is, do you want to defend these interest, or do \nyou want to defend families who are out there making investments in \ntheir children's educations.\n Investments which fundamentally contribute to the economic security of \nthis Nation in the 21st century. To turn our backs on the educational \nneeds of these children and their families I think would be a great \ntragedy.\n\n  The health of a nation depends upon many things. Fiscal \nresponsibility is clearly one of them, but also an educated society, a \nwell-prepared society. There are families that are out there telling \ntheir children to stay in school and study hard and do their homework, \nand go to college. We break a contract with them when those loans are \nnot there or at such a high cost that they cannot avoid them. Fifty \npercent of all students in higher education today receive some form of \nassistance--one out of every two. Yet, here we are slashing $14 billion \nout of these programs while we shield expatriot billionaires from their \ntaxes and protect export income. We urge you to support our substitute.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nMaine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, here we go again. I hope that Members of \nthe Senate will oppose this amendment. It is another generic amendment. \nYou did not hear any specifics, other than the $6.3 billion and the $28 \nbillion that would be necessary under this amendment through corporate \nwelfare reductions and tax loopholes. While we all might agree with \nthat goal, there is no specificity. It conveniently lacks specificity \nbecause they do not want to offend anybody. But that is not the \nresponsible budgetary approach. That is why the Snowe-Abraham amendment \nis a credible approach in restoring $6.3 billion in education.\n  If you want to make sure that those funds are restored, then you must \nsupport the Snowe-Abraham amendment.\n  The amendment that is before us now, offered by the Senator from \nConnecticut, is illusory. It does not offer any instructions. It leaves \npotential instructions to the appropriate committees to determine how \nthey reach the $28 billion. Unfortunately, that has been the process, \nnot only here on the floor of the Senate but also in the Budget \nCommittee. There were a number of Members who offered amendments to \nincrease spending--the accumulation of spending of more than $500 \nbillion and $77 billion in tax increases --but no corresponding \namendments to reduce Federal spending, which is the goal of this budget \nresolution, and it is also a goal to reach a balanced budget.\n  Yes, we remember offsets. But at least we are in a position to say to \nthe committee that this is the way in which you can arrive at these \nnumbers. Do you want to make a decision about eliminating aircraft in \nthe executive branch or raising funds for education? I think the choice \nis an easy one, and that is what this amendment is all about.\n  So I hope that Members of the Senate will oppose the Dodd amendment \nbecause it is not credible, because it does not offer responsible \nrecommendations as to how to arrive at $28 billion worth of changes and \nat the same time do what we think is important by raising funds for \neducation. The Snowe-Abraham amendment reaches that goal to provide the \nmuch-needed, very valuable school loan assistance programs to low- and \nmiddle-income families all across America.\n  So I urge the support of the Snowe-Abraham amendment in opposition to \nthe Dodd amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n                           amendment no. 1131\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I see a compromise. I see a way for the \nbipartisanship to return on education. It is a painful compromise on \nboth sides, but we must pursue the art of the possible.\n  Mr. President, I tried 2 days ago, with my colleague from Iowa, \nSenator Harkin, to make substantial progress toward restoring the cuts \nto education in this budget resolution with an amendment to restore $40 \nbillion. That amendment was narrowly defeated. Yesterday, my colleague \nfrom Nebraska, Senator Exon attempted to restore $30 billion to \neducation, as part of a package. That amendment narrowly failed.\n  Today, the Republican Senators from Maine and Ohio, Senator Snowe and \nSenator DeWine have offered a $6.3 billion restoration to student loan \ncuts.\n  We are making progress. Republicans have admitted that there is a \nreal problem in this budget in that it severely cuts education.\n  But Mr. President, $6.3 billion for student loans still leaves \nstudents paying billions more, essentially to provide tax cuts \nelsewhere. More importantly, we should not merely restore part of the \ncollege student aid cuts while accepting the 33 percent cuts in this \nbudget resolution to the programs that serve children. This budget \nresolution cuts the 6 million children served under title I for the \ndisadvantaged to 4 million. It cuts services for over 5 million \ndisabled children served under the Individuals With Disabilities \nEducation Act by $5 billion. If it is wrong, economically, to cut \nstudent aid to provide tax cuts, as my Republican colleagues seem to \nconcede, then it is certainly wrong to pass these huge cuts to \neducation for younger children.\n  The means of bipartisan compromise is the Dodd amendment. It is a \ncompromise that both sides can strain to reach. It restores a total of \n$28 billion. It does not fully restore the cuts to children's programs. \nIt still reduces the number of children served, while we know that the \nnumber of children will rise. And, it fully--not partially--relieves \ncollege students of their part of cuts in student loans.\n  Mr. President, this amendment can help us rebuild the bipartisan \nconsensus that education is a priority. We should not cut disadvantaged \nand disabled children, and it is economically foolish to do so. I know \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle believe this, and I urge all \nSenators to support this amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Do I have 3 minutes remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I was searching in my mind for what Yogi \nBerra might say about this, but I cannot quite come up with it. ``Deja \nvu all over again,'' yes; that sounds right. See, we just got behind \nus, we thought, the idea that the way to balance the budget was to \nraise taxes. We thought we had finished that off and that maybe so long \nas we were attempting to balance the budget by restraining Government, \nsince the first effort 2 years ago to balance the budget relied heavily \non tax increases and did not work and the deficit is still going up, we \nthought we ought to restrain Government in a very serious way. And the \nfirst real serious opportunity on the other side to change this budget \nresolution significantly is to raise taxes $25 billion for a good \ncause.\n  Now, frankly, Mr. President, I believe the American people understand \nthat the time has come to balance the budget by reining in Government, \nhaving less Government, redefining it, doing it better, doing it more \nefficiently. All of the arguments about what is happening to programs \nthat we have in existence assumes that those programs are the only way \nto help Americans; that the only way to help education is the exact \narray of Federal programs that we have right now. And anybody that \nsuggests you might do it for less, or do it a different way, of course, \nthey are against education, or they are against highways, or they are \nagainst whatever it is.\n  So essentially, nobody should misunderstand this amendment, \nregardless of the rhetoric about loopholes and the like. The budget \nresolution does three things with reference to taxes, it either lowers \nor increases them or it leaves [[Page S7293]] them the same. \nEssentially, this will increase taxes. I do not believe we should adopt \nit. At the appropriate time, I will move to table it. I will not do it \nnow because obviously it will be stacked. I hope we will defeat it. It \nclearly would be one of the amendments that this budget resolution \nshould not carry with it as we go to conference with the House.\n  I yield back any remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nOregon is now recognized.\n                           Amendment No. 1132\n\n (Purpose: To restore funds cut from the National Institutes of Health)\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

If the chairman will yield, I have conferred with the \nother side, and I understand there are no second-degree amendments. \nPerhaps Senator Hatfield would like to handle it differently if there \nare not going to be any second-degree amendments.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I have no preference. Parliamentary inquiry. I am \ntrying to get to the real part of the amendment, which is to restore \nthe money to the NIH by offsets in all the other accounts, with the \nexception of defense. The one I have sent to the desk includes defense. \nThat is my personal preference, but the votes are not there. So I am \ntrying to protect the essence of the real amendment, which I want to \ndebate, which is my second-degree amendment that excludes defense.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I am told that a second-degree amendment is \nnot in order until all time has been expired on the first degree.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Could the Senator not withdraw the first amendment and \noffer the second amendment at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I yield to the request of the chairman, and I withdraw \nmy first amendment on the assumption that I will be able to debate with \nmy time allocation on the amendment that I want to bring to a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  The amendment (No. 1132) was withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1133\n\n (Purpose: To restore funds cut from the National Institutes of Health)\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Hatfield], for himself and Mr. \n     Jeffords, Mr. Specter, Mrs. Kassebaum, and Mr. D'Amato \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1133.\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 33, line 19, increase the amount by $1,000,000,000.\n       On page 33, line 20, increase the amount by $430,000,000.\n       On page 34, line 2, increase the amount by $1,000,000,000.\n       On page 34, line 3, increase the amount by $920,000,000.\n       On page 34, line 9, increase the amount by $1,000,000,000.\n       On page 34, line 10, increase the amount by $1,000,000,000.\n       On page 34, line 16, increase the amount by $1,000,000,000.\n       On page 34, line 17, increase the amount by $1,000,000,000.\n       On page 34, line 23, increase the amount by $1,000,000,000.\n       On page 34, line 24, increase the amount by $1,000,000,000.\n       On page 35, line 5, increase the amount by $1,000,000,000.\n       On page 35, line 6, increase the amount by \n     $1,000,000,000.

Will the Senator yield for a unanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that no second-\ndegree amendments be in order to the Hatfield amendment that is \npending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator \nD'Amato as a cosponsor on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I now understand I have a 2-hour, \nequally divided time allocation to consider this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I would like to yield 1 minute to the Senator from New \nYork to make a statement on this amendment.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise to support and am pleased to join \nas a cosponsor of Senator Hatfield's amendment.\n  We are talking about making cuts in order to balance our budget and \nprovide a better future for coming generations. Yet I believe we have \nto be very careful about how we make those cuts and where.\n  In the amendment that has been put forth, Senator Hatfield would \nrestore $7 billion of the $7.7 billion that would otherwise come out of \nthe National Institutes of Health.\n  I have to say, representing as I do New York, and Long Island in \nparticular, we are being ravaged by an epidemic of cancer, breast \ncancer in particular. Breast cancer rates in the Long Island counties \nof Nassau and Suffolk rank first and fourth highest respectively among \nthe 116 largest U.S. counties.\n  We cannot afford to reduce the funding for this vital research that \nprovides at least a glimmer of hope for achieving the necessary \nbreakthroughs to deal with the ravages of cancer, and breast cancer in \nparticular.\n  The amendment of Senator Hatfield will go a long way toward holding \ncitizens harmless in this area. There would be a slight reduction of \nabout 1 percent. Far better that 1 percent reduction than one that \nmight reach as much as 15 to 16 percent. That, I believe, would not be \nthe kind of investment in the future that we are attempting to bring \nabout as we work to make a better future for all Americans, those whom \nwe are protecting now and future generations.\n  I believe that is why this amendment is important and why it makes \nsense. I strongly urge its support. I thank the Senator for raising \nthis very important issue.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I thank the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of Senator Specter of \nPennsylvania and Senator Kassebaum of Kansas. There will be other \ncosponsors that we will add as we go along.\n  Mr. President, fundamentally, what we are facing here is a prelude to \ndisaster as it relates to medical research and medical science in this \ncountry.\n  We are really, in this session of the Congress, being offered three \npossibilities, three options. Each one of the three options has the \nsame ending result.\n  We have the President's budget. The President's budget, if we vote \nthis line--my visual aid supporting chart for 1996--the President \nraises the NIH appropriation budget proposal by 4.1 percent. Like so \nmany things in politics, it is a shell game. You see it and then you do \nnot see it. You think you have it, and then you do not have it.\n  After the first year of 1996 of raising this up by 4.1 percent, then \nthe President's budget says--look at that drop. By the year 2000, we \nwill take $1 billion away from medical research in this country. This \namendment is bipartisan. The President is offering to demolish our \nmedical research infrastructure on a slow-water-drip system.\n  Then we have the House resolution. The House resolution says, ``Well, \nby 1996, next year, we want to drop it 5 percent,'' and then we steady \nincome out here whereby we again find the end result of a dramatic \nreduction in the budget for the NIH.\n  Not to be outdone by the White House, not to be outdone by the House \nof Representatives, the Senate budget resolution that is pending before \nthe Senate today said, ``Oh, we will make a quicker death. We are going \nto say take $1 billion out between 1995 and 1996.'' In fact, in excess \nof $1 billion. By the time we get to 2000 we will have taken $7.7 \nbillion out of the medical research of this country that leads to cures \nand leads to better treatment of disease.\n  That is it, simply straightforward. I cannot believe that the body of \nthe U.S. Senate can ignore the fact that the only thing the American \npeople have said is raise our taxes if necessary, and we will tell \nMembers by a 30 percent margin that dollars expended for medical \nresearch should be the top priority of our country. This is not one \npolitician speaking to another politician. This is the voice of the \npeople saying, ``We want to increase medical research.'' We have had \npolls show they would pay another $1 per week on their medical premiums \nin order for it to be earmarked for medical research. We have had polls \nshow they would take another $1 per week in their income tax if it \ncould be earmarked for medical research.\n  Somehow the political establishment of the executive branch, led by \nthe President, and the congressional branches, led by the two House and \nSenate budget resolution committees, do not hear that.\n  Now, I am not going to get into a lot of detail except to say we are \nmaking tremendous progress in warring against many diseases. It was \nonly half a dozen years ago we had a handful of dollars dedicated to \nAlzheimer's research.\n  I have a personal interest in Alzheimer's. I watched my father die \nfrom Alzheimer's. I can say it is as difficult for the family as it is \ndifficult for the victim. It is difficult for all those around him or \nher. I will not go into the gory details because most people around \nhere have seen that kind of deadly disease attack and destroy people.\n  Mr. President, we could not even diagnose Alzheimer's short of an \nautopsy a few years ago. Now we have built it over the years to about \n$210 million of research money dedicated to Alzheimer's. We have made \nbreakthrough after breakthrough, both in gene analysis and \nidentification, as well as treatment and diagnosis.\n  When we say to the medical structure of this country, take $1 billion \nout of the $11.3 billion--10 percent--in 1 year, it is like in this \ncountry when we shut down the sawmill for a lack of logs and lose our \nchief sawyer, that company does not reassemble that team that makes \nthat mill work a month later when a supply is received, or 2 months \nlater.\n  When the company begins to build the infrastructure of medical \nresearch, and once it is there, the company does not rebuild it because \nmaybe 2 years down the road they decided they made a mistake.\n  We have had the decade of the brain. Mr. President, 5 years have \npassed and a major part of that 5 years is building 130 scientists into \nan infrastructure in this country. Now it at a point where the payoff \ncomes, we are about ready to start dismantling.\n  Now, let me get a point of contrast. We have literally thousands of \ndiseases in this country on which no research--no research--is being \nconducted, thousands of diseases in which there is no \n[[Page S7295]] national registry to even know how many people have the \ndisease or where they are located. No registry. They are called orphan \ndiseases. Thousands of them.\n  The most important factor that is missing is no hope. No hope. We \nhave been trying to attack that gradually by serendipity, meeting a \nyoung man in a wheelchair 15 years of age with EB, epidermolysis \nbullosa. At that point, no registry. At that point, no research money. \nIt is like leprosy. They lose their fingers. It is a pigmentation \nproblem. Sores break out all over their bodies. They cannot handle even \nthis kind of artificial light, let alone sunlight.\n And they die at a very early age. This young man was so impressive \nwith his eloquence, we wheeled him right into the Committee on \nAppropriations and we made a line item. If I ever had a reason to fight \na line item veto, the whole concept of vetoing a line item--this was to \nget a line item in the appropriations that year to start a registry, \nstarting a research project for EB, and giving hope for those people. \nThat is not the way to run it, just because I met someone like that. \nThere are thousands of them out there all over this country.\n\n  I want to also say there is a point of reference and comparison. This \nsame budget resolution calls for a $800 million increase in research in \nnuclear weaponry. Yes, $800 million increase and they are calling for a \n$1 billion cut in medical research. Oh, we have to protect our bombs \nbut we cannot really protect our people. I am saying this is a value of \npeople over bombs. I would like to have included the military research \ndollars. The 18 months of military research in this country leading us \nto be more efficient--we say at defending our country, but at the same \ntime, cluster bombs in order to increase the capacity to destroy life--\nis the equivalent of 95 years of medical research in the NIH; 18 \nmonths. That is a real value.\n  But I do not have the votes. So we still have this power of the \nmilitary that says, ``Do not include us in any reductions. We only can \nhandle increases. Reduce the medical research programs.''\n  All this does is to face reality that we exclude the military, that \nsacrosanct military. We are going to exclude it. But at the same time \nwe are going to reshuffle all of the other accounts and say, by putting \nthe priority on medical research, the others are going to be reduced 5 \npercent.\n  I enjoyed a little personal therapy by those last few statements. Now \nwe get back to the reality of saying we have to reach this kind of \nagreement. I am happy to say I think, even though I would like to have \na broader base, I am willing to settle for the narrower base in order \nto save the medical structure, research structure of this country.\n  I hope some of my colleagues realize we have had a colleague recently \ndiagnosed with Parkinson's, Senator Claiborne Pell. Do you realize we \nare spending this year $26 million for Parkinson's research--$26 \nmillion. You say that is a lot of money--yes, it is a lot of money. We \nare spending over $1 billion for heart; $2 billion for AIDS; another $1 \nbillion-plus for cancer, as we should, and I helped to fight for every \none of those dollars, and I would defend every one of those dollars. \nAll I am saying is, for Parkinson's, $26 million.\n  Take a 16- to 20-percent decrease on $26 million for Parkinson's and \nyou have a bigger impact than taking a 16- to 20-percent reduction, \nsay, on cancer or heart, which is in excess--almost $2 billion each. So \nit is disproportionate in its impact. And I think this would then give \nus an opportunity to keep our commitment to the sick and those who have \nno hope for cure.\n  If my friends are not interested in the humanitarian aspect of \nreducing suffering and putting the value on human life--and quality \nlife, not just quantitative life--I hope we would support this because \nI am convinced it is the answer. If you are not impressed with that \nfactor, then look at the cost. We have saved billions of dollars per \nyear in what we have been able to accomplish in medical research with \nTB. Now we are having a revival of TB. We have Zaire and the Ebola \nproblem over there, that is a threat to this country. Every time we \nused to want to get an increase in military spending we could say, \n``The Russians are coming,'' and, boy, everybody would jack up another \n$1 million. I want to tell you, ``The viruses are coming.'' They are \nhere. And we better get ready for that warfare because we need this \nkind of weaponry to fight it.\n  Mr. EXON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Yes. I will be very happy to. But first of all may I \nyield to my cosponsor, who has not had an opportunity to make an \nopening statement and then I will be happy to yield for questions.\n  Mr. EXON. Certainly.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I yield at this time to Senator Specter, whatever time \nhe needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague, the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, for yielding time to me. I \ncompliment him for his leadership generally, and especially on this \namendment for his very spirited and eloquent articulation of the \nreasons for this amendment.\n  I am pleased to join Senator Hatfield as a cosponsor, along with \nSenator Kassebaum, Senator Mack, and there may be others who will join \nin cosponsoring this very, very important amendment.\n  Senator Hatfield has added the name of Senator Kennedy to the list as \noriginal cosponsor here, along with Senator Jeffords.\n  The consideration of this budget resolution is very important to \nAmerica. It is the toughest series of votes which I have seen in my \n14\\1/2\\ years in the U.S. Senate. It has been very carefully crafted by \nthe Budget Committee, under the leadership of Senator Domenici, who has \ngreat respect in this body on all counts. We have seen a series of \namendments defeated so far on the budget resolution, many of which I \nwould have liked to have voted for. But we have to make some really \nextremely tough choices which I think we are making. I believe this is \na historic time for the U.S. Government to balance the budget.\n  Substantial efforts were made following the election of President \nReagan in 1981, when we considered a budget resolution some 14 years \nago, but there was not the political will at that time to balance the \nbudget. We did not have Republican control of the House of \nRepresentatives, with, candidly, the political determination to balance \nthe budget.\n  That time is now. In order to balance the budget we have had to turn \ndown some requests on amendments which I think were very, very \nattractive. It was very, very difficult to vote against the amendment \nwhich offered additional funding for education because I am very much \nconcerned about the cuts in this budget resolution on education. I am \nvery much concerned about the cuts in this budget on Medicare and \nMedicaid. And I have heard from constituents about the devastating \nimpact of what the Medicare cuts will do in closing hospitals, and not \nmarginal hospitals but hospitals which are very important across this \ncountry, providing very vital services for the people of America.\n  But it seems to me if we are going to move to a balanced budget we \nare going to have to have belt tightening all across the board. I \npersonally would very much have liked to have voted for the amendment \nyesterday on a tax cut. Who would not like to have a tax cut in \nAmerica? But the difficulty with the amendment was present in the \nadditional cuts which would have been present for other very important \nitems, and also in the direction of the tax cuts not being directed \nwith sufficient depth and specificity at the lower income groups and \nraising the concern about too much of a tax cut for wealthier Americans \nat a time when we are going to be cutting very many important programs \nwhich impact across the board, and many on the poor.\n  The amount offered yesterday on increasing national defense was a \nvery attractive amendment. But there again the difficulty is that it \nwould have resulted in cuts in other programs and added to the deficit.\n  I think that in the amendment which we are now considering, to have a \nrestoration of part of the budget cut on the National Institutes of \nHealth, that we are going to have the strong bipartisan support which \nwas not present to increase funding or restore funding for education, \nor the bipartisan support [[Page S7296]] which was necessary to restore \nfunding for Medicare and Medicaid. I believe that we have this \nbipartisan support because of the unique importance of what the \nNational Institutes of Health does for America.\n  In the 14\\1/2\\ years that I have been on the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, which \nI now chair, we have maintained an increasing amount of funding year by \nyear, notwithstanding proposed budget cuts virtually every year from \nthe administration, and it has been a bipartisan effort, once under the \nchairmanship of Senator Weicker, then under the chairmanship of Senator \nLawton Chiles, then under the chairmanship of Senator Tom Harkin, and \nnow with my chairmanship.\n  We had a hearing last Thursday attended by the distinguished chairman \nof the full committee, where we heard of the devastating impact of what \nthese budget cuts would do to medical research in the United States.\n  There is not time enough to go through the entire array of very \npowerful arguments and very powerful considerations. But let me start \nwith a few.\n  At the present time, the National Institutes of Health funds less \nthan 1 in 4 grant applications. If funding were cut by 10 percent, that \ngrant rate might decrease to as much as 1 in 10. There would be a \ndrastic reduction in clinical trials to initiate promising new \ntreatments leaving the application of research findings for the \npatients on an untested basis.\n  There would be a cataclysmic consequence with over 80 percent of the \nNIH budget being cut with support from colleges, universities, medical \nschools, and research institutes throughout the country.\n  We are on the brink of having extraordinary advances in medical \nresearch on gene therapy on a whole range of very, very devastating \nillnesses in America.\n  Let me name just a few. Last year the National Institutes of Health \ndiscovered a breast cancer susceptibility gene, and the NIH is now \nclosing in on the gene which causes breast cancer, which would be \nreally a remarkable achievement on a terrifying disease which strikes 1 \nof 9 women in America.\n  The problems on heart disease, cardiovascular disease, which is still \nthe number one killer of both men and women, causing 43 percent of all \ndeaths each year; delaying the onset of heart disease by 5 years, which \nis right around the corner, would save almost $70 billion annually.\n  When we take a look at the kind of economic savings which come from \nthis research from NIH, it is really remarkable.\n  Alzheimer's disease, such an overwhelming emotional problem in \nAmerica today for those who suffer from Alzheimer's and their families; \nthe medical research is on the brink of decreasing the incidence by \nhalf, which would mean an annual cost saving of some $50 billion.\n  Alcoholism, the No. 1 drug problem in the United States, is on the \nverge of significant advances, if not a cure, with the savings of some \n$100 billion a year.\n  Osteoporosis leads to 1.5 million fractures each year, affecting \n140,000 people, and with the potential for saving of some $5 billion.\n  I know the time is short, Mr. President.\n  So I shall not go on with the list of really remarkable achievements \nwhich have been made and are right around the corner.\n  But I will say, chairing the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human \nServices, and Education, and having been on the Appropriations \nCommittee for 14\\1/2\\ years, that there is no more important funding \nitem in the budget to restore, and we are not restoring it all, but to \nrestore the amount proposed in the pending amendment.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. EXON. Will the chairman yield for a question?\n  The question I have for my great friend and colleague I want to \npreface by saying the chairman knows of my fondness for him and the \nmany years that we have worked. I have never seen a finer presentation, \nI say to my friend from Oregon. I do not disagree with a single thing \nhe has said. I think he said it all very, very well.\n  I cannot think of a more important amendment that will pass. I think \nthis amendment will pass. I know of no objection to it on this side. I \njust checked with Senator Domenici. He knows of no objection on his \nside of the aisle. I think the case has been adequately made.\n  I have a list of 23 Democratic Senators, and heaven knows how many on \nthat side of the aisle, that have other important matters, and we run \nout of time at noon today on the amendment. I am just wondering, since \nI think there seems to be near unanimous support for the amendment, if \nthere is any way that we can cut down some of the time to allow some of \nthese other Senators a chance to offer their amendments. Because of the \ntime constraints, because I would not want to see any of our colleagues \nhave a heart attack or apoplexy for fear that they are not able to talk \non their amendment, I am just wondering, my question is can we get some \ntime agreement if we would agree to yield back our whole hour of the \ntime? I know of no opposition on this side. Could we get an agreement \nto cut down the remaining 50 minutes or so that the chairman has? I \nthink he has made his case very well.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I would be very happy to work out an \narrangement. I have a list here of about a dozen Senators who have \nasked for a few minutes to express themselves on this amendment. Once I \nfulfill that obligation to my colleagues, I will be very happy to \nconsider that.\n  Mr. EXON. I will simply add there have been Senators coming to me \nwanting 10 to 20 minutes. I have cut them most down to 1 or 2 minutes.\n  If I might courteously suggest that if we had some time constraints, \nI believe everything good can be said about this amendment in a minute \nif people choose their words very carefully.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I have a list. My other chief cosponsors are Senator \nKassebaum, Senator Boxer, Senator Kennedy, Senator Mack, and others. As \nsoon as we complete those, I would be very happy to consider yielding \nback the time.\n  I would like at this time to yield to the Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I would ask for a couple of minutes. I \ncertainly appreciate the time constraints.\n  I think every Senator in the Chamber is a supporter of the National \nInstitutes of Health and recognizes the importance of the work done \nthere.\n  I myself am a strong supporter of the importance of continuing basic \nresearch.\n  I think Senator Hatfield, who has initiated this amendment, has \nspoken eloquently of the importance of those needs. Senator Specter has \nspoken as well.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senators Hatfield and \nSpecter and eight other cosponsors in offering an amendment to the \nfiscal year 1996 budget resolution which is designed to protect funding \nfor the National Institutes of Health. Our amendment, which adds $1 \nbillion annually to budget function 550, is intended to restore the 10-\npercent reduction in NIH funding assumed by the Budget Committee. In \norder to assure the health of our citizens--through continued support \nof our nation's biomedical research--I urge my colleagues to join with \nus in supporting this amendment.\n  To offset the additional NIH funding, our amendment would reduce \nspending in various discretionary accounts by 0.58 percent. The budget \nfunctions which would be excluded from these reductions are: defense; \ninternational affairs; education, training, and employment; income \nsecurity; Medicare; Social Security; and net interest.\n  NIH-supported biomedical research has a proud history of scientific \nbreakthroughs. Many of my colleagues will remember the iron lungs which \nonce ventilated individuals after their bodies had been ravaged by the \npolio virus. Because of biomedical research, we no longer face the \nthreat of this disease. In fact, experts at the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention now predict that the polio virus could soon be \neradicated from this planet.\n  The vitality of these efforts is maintained today. For example, \nthrough the human genome project, scientists have \n[[Page S7297]] identified a gene linked to breast cancer. Using this \ninformation, health care providers may one day decrease the burden of \nthis disease, which now attacks one in nine women.\n  I am concerned about the detrimental impact of the NIH reductions \nassumed by the Budget Committee. I believe, that biomedical research \nadvancement--and breakthroughs--could slow dramatically.\n  The committee, in its report on this resolution, lays out a \nthoughtful argument in support of this budget reduction. As noted in \nthe report, it is true that the NIH has seen a real budget growth over \nthe last decade. In real terms, after adjusting for biomedical research \ninflation, the budget for 1993 was 47 percent greater than it was a \ndecade earlier. It is also true that private sector contributions to \nbiomedical research have increased.\n  At the same time, I do not believe it is wise to propose reductions \nbased on this recent growth in NIH funding. These reductions will leave \nmany biomedical researchers and their advancements stranded. In many \nareas, scientists are on the verge of amazing discoveries. Because the \naverage length of an NIH award is nearly 4 years, cuts of this \nmagnitude will require an adjustment period. We need to consider ways \nto ensure that promising research receives new funding, while we honor \nexisting research commitments.\n  Mr. President, the $1 billion which this amendment would add back to \nthe NIH allows for a smooth transition. Even with this add-back, real \nfunding for NIH will decrease over the next 7 years. In fact, if we \nassume a 5 percent annual biomedical research inflation, maintaining \nNIH funding at its 1995 level would still result in a real funding \nreduction of nearly 5 percent in the first year and 35 percent 7 years \nfrom now.\n  As chairman of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, I am \ncommitted to working with the National Institutes of Health and our \nNation's biomedical researchers to find ways to adjust to our current \nbudget limitations. However, accomplishing this goal will require \nthoughtful consideration and careful deliberation.\n  As the Labor Committee begins to consider the reauthorization of the \nNational Institutes of Health, I welcome the suggestions of my \ncolleagues. I intend to examine organizational and structural changes \nat the NIH which could lead to some budget savings.\n  This effort may include reexamining the need for the current 23 \ninstitutes, centers, and divisions. Another approach will be to review \nthe amount of research funding which the NIH currently devotes to \nindirect research costs. Finally, I also believe that we will need to \nreexamine how the NIH makes its grants to ensure that the most \npromising areas for research advancement receive funding, while funding \nfor basic biomedical research is maintained.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to consider this amendment \ncarefully. Its effect would be to improve the health of our Nation's \ncitizens by supporting funding for biomedical research through the NIH. \nThe effort of NIH has and will continue to create a national \nenvironment in which biomedical research and health flourish.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I would like to yield 3 minutes to the \nSenator from California.\n  Mr. President, in yielding to the Senator from California, she was \nfacing the same issue, I understand, in her committee work, and I wish \nto thank the Senator for laying the foundation at that time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend very much. I will be brief because I \nthink so much has already been said on this.\n  I simply want to add my voice in support of the Senator from Oregon. \nI did, in fact, offer a similar amendment in the Budget Committee. \nHowever, I took the funds out of the little tax cut--honey pot--that \nwas squirreled away by our chairman and there was no support from the \nRepublican side for using that as an offset.\n  I truly understand the frustration expressed by the Senator from \nOregon. He wanted to cut across the board and include in the cut to pay \nfor this NIH increase the military budget. I think the Senator is wise \nnot to offer that up because there are not the votes here to do that, \nbut I wish to spend just a minute talking about that and adding my \nvoice to that of the Senator from Oregon.\n  I think the people of this country understand that the cold war is \nover, and I think the people of this country understand we are the only \nsuperpower, and I think the people of this country understand that we \nare spending 2\\1/2\\ times more than all of the potential enemies \ncombined in the world, and that includes on the list the potential \nenemies Russia and China. The fact is if you add the spending of the \nNATO countries, America and the NATO countries are spending 5\\1/2\\ \ntimes more than all the potential enemies in the world.\n  What are the real enemies that we face on a daily basis in America? I \nwould say the daily enemies we face are the prospect of disease \nstriking a loved one. Alzheimer's has been discussed, osteoporosis, \nbreast cancer, AIDS, prostate cancer, lung cancer, diabetes, \nscleroderma, something many people do not know about, which is a soft \ntissue disease which is disfiguring and frightening and strikes young \nwomen; strokes, Parkinson's disease. There are so many others.\n  The fact is, I say to my colleagues, these are the enemies that we \nface, and to retreat from this war would be ludicrous.\n  Now, it hurts my heart to vote to cut other domestic programs. It \nbreaks my heart. I think it is outrageous that we do not have the votes \nhere to include defense in a small cut, but like the Senator from \nOregon I am a realist. I am a realist, and I wish to see this funding \nbe restored to the NIH. We are one plane ride away from a major \nepidemic. We read with horror about this Ebola virus. Anyone who has \nread the book ``The Hot Zone'' understands the tenuous position we are \nin in this very world in which we now live. As we lose the rain forests \nof the world, what scientists are discovering is that viruses that live \nin the rain forests are looking for other hosts, and they are finding \nus. So to cut back on the National Institutes of Health, which is our \nfirst line of defense against these diseases, would be worse than \noutrageous.\n  I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record at this point a \nletter from the University of California, Irvine, and I would close \nwith a quote from the dean of the college of medicine there, Thomas C. \nCesario. He says:\n\n       With Federal support, the University has achieved \n     remarkable breakthroughs in medical research which prevent, \n     control, or reverse disease, saving lives and millions of \n     dollars in medical care.\n\n  And he just says that the UC doctors there with Federal funds were \nfirst to identify the lack of a gene as a cause of disease. They \ndeveloped a blood test for the genetic defect that causes Tay-Sachs, \nand it goes on and on.\n  I see my time has run out. So again let me add my voice to the \nSenator from Oregon. I thank the Senator so much for picking up this \nfight in this Chamber. I am with the Senator all the way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 University of California, Irvine,\n\n\n                                          College of Medicine,\n\n                                         Irvine, CA, May 22, 1995.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: I am writing to express my deepest \n     concern over the funding cuts to the National Institutes of \n     Health that have been assumed in the Committee's Budget \n     Resolution and to thank you for your tremendous effort to \n     restore funding during the Committee's consideration of the \n     NIH bill.\n       According to the committee report, the Senate Budget \n     Committee recommends a 10 percent cut for the NIH budget in \n     FY 1996, and then a freeze of the NIH budget at this lower \n     level through 2002. This means that the NIH budget would be \n     cut from $11.3 billion in FY 1995 to $10.2 billion in FY \n     1996, and then frozen at $10.2 billion through 2002. Cuts of \n     this magnitude would be devastating to our nation's \n     biomedical research enterprise. The NIH is one of the \n     country's most respected and revered research institutions, \n     setting international standards for excellence for basic and \n     clinical biomedical and behavorial research and ensuring that \n     medical care in the United States is the best in the world. \n     Many people literally owe their lives to NIH-funded research.\n       These cuts represent a serious retreat from the national \n     support given to medical innovation. They would be \n     devastating to the NIH mission. NIH projects that with a 10 \n     percent reduction in its budget the success rate for \n     competing research project grants would fall from its current \n     overall level of 24 percent in FY 1995 to between 6 percent \n     and 12 [[Page S7298]] percent in FY 1996. The potential loss \n     in new life saving discoveries is incalculable. We know that \n     few, if any, new clinical trials could be instigated and \n     other NIH mechanisms of support would be decimated.\n       Cuts to NIH would certainly wreak havoc throughout the \n     University of California's research institutions. About 85 \n     percent of the NIH's appropriation is expended on extramural \n     research conducted in all 50 states. The University of \n     California operates the largest health science program in the \n     nation--with five schools of medicine. Last year UC received \n     about $650 million for extramural grants university-wide. \n     Three of our five medical schools were ranked among the top \n     15 institutions for receipt of extramural research awards for \n     FY 1993 and all fell within the top 100 institutions.\n       With federal support, the University has achieved \n     remarkable breakthroughs in medical research which prevent \n     control of reverse disease, saving lives and millions of \n     dollars in medical care; UC doctors:\n       were first to identify the lack of a gene as a cause of \n     disease;\n       developed a blood test for the genetic defect that causes \n     Tay-Sachs disease;\n       created the first human vaccine by genetic engineering;\n       were among the first three groups in the world to isolate \n     the AIDS virus;\n       found a quick method to determine if infants were infected \n     with the AIDS virus;\n       developed an artificial ankle to replace joints damaged by \n     arthritis;\n       adapted a heart pump implant to pump insulin in diabetics \n     thus eliminating the need for daily insulin injections;\n       developed a procedure that restores hearing by replacing \n     damaged middle ear bones with sculpted cartilage.\n       In addition, the University has been an incubator for the \n     rapidly growing biotechnology industry in California. \n     California has the largest concentration of the nation's \n     biotechnology companies and 28 percent of high tech medical \n     device firms in the nation. The University of California at \n     San Francisco and San Diego alone account for more than 50 \n     new companies pursuing life saving medical drugs and devices \n     from AIDS, cancer and heart disease to genetic disorders like \n     cystic fibrosis and multiple sclerosis.\n       Cuts to NIH cut the lifeline of biomedical research. The \n     devastation would be felt for years to come. The pace of \n     scientific discovery would slow and cures for diseases like \n     AIDS and cancer would be delayed. Even worse, biomedical \n     research would be essentially eliminated as a career track \n     for a whole generation of young people.\n       I urge you to do all you can to restore funding to the NIH \n     during the Senate's consideration of the Budget Resolution.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Thomas C. Cesario, M.D.,\n                                        Dean, College of Medicine.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I thank the Senator from Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, again I am going back to the list of \nthose who have made their request to be heard. I would yield 2 minutes \nto Senator Kennedy, 3 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Two minutes will be fine.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Two minutes to Senator Kennedy from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Senator from Oregon and the other \ncosponsors are speaking for the best American values and are really \nspeaking for mankind all over the world in the restoration of this \nfunding for the National Institutes of Health. This budget is permeated \nwith penny-wise and pound-foolish mentality that values short-term \nsavings today over investments that will improve the life of the Nation \ntomorrow.\n  There is no better example of these misplaced priorities than the \nmeat-ax cuts in the National Institutes of Health. It is truly a great \nsuccess in terms of research, and it maintains respect throughout the \nworld. The NIH is not just a source of excellence to those of us on the \nfloor of the Senate. It is recognized throughout the world.\n  The NIH is the symbol of excellence in medical research. Its \nachievements are world renowned. Dollar for dollar, it is among the \nwisest and most productive investments the Nation has ever made. It is \nthe source of America's international preeminence in industries such as \npharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and medical devices. Talk to any \nleaders of these industries, and they will tell you that without the \nbasic research of the NIH, progress in their industry would slow to a \ncrawl, and America's international competitiveness would fail.\n  Above all, we need NIH research because of its indispensable role in \nimproving the health of the American people. In recent years, \nbiomedical research supported by the NIH has led to new and more cost-\neffective treatments for cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and a wide \nrange of infectious diseases. More than a million premature deaths from \nheart disease alone were prevented by improved cardiovascular programs \nand innovative treatments developed by NIH research in the past quarter \ncentury.\n  With mushrooming new discoveries in biotechnology, we stand on the \nthreshold of even greater progress in the years ahead in the conquest \nof dread diseases. There is no American family that has not lost a \nloved one or a close friend to the ravages of heart disease, cancer, \ndiabetes, or Alzheimer's disease. Why would anyone curtail the \nextraordinary progress that is possible?\n  If the cuts in this budget resolution are approved, only 10 percent \nof meritorious research will be funded, according to the NIH's own \nestimates. Currently, ninety scientists have received Nobel prizes for \nresearch funded in whole or in part by the NIH. With these cuts, young \nresearchers will leave the field because they cannot find support for \ntheir investigations. Careers in biomedical research will be less \nattractive to the brightest minds of this generation of college \nstudents. Worst of all, it is no exaggeration to say that because of \nthese cuts, Americans will die who would have been saved.\n  These funds make such a difference to the families that all of us \nrepresent. I urge the Senate to adopt this amendment and maintain NIH's \nvital investments in medical research.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nNew Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. President, I support the amendment of the Senator from Oregon. I \nalso want to point out that the problem he identifies with medical \nresearch funding is part of a larger problem that we are trying to \naddress in another amendment that will come up for a vote later today. \nThat is the amendment related to civilian research more generally.\n  The Senator from Oregon made the point that the proposed budget as it \nnow stands in the area of medical research is a prelude to disaster. I \nwould say that the same point could be made about civilian research \ngenerally in this country.\n  I would address people's attention to this chart which shows Federal \ncivilian R as a percentage of the gross domestic product of this \ncountry from the period 1961 through the end of the century, the last \nportion, of course, being the projected level of funding for civilian \nresearch and development.\n  This chart includes the figures for the National Institutes of \nHealth, about which the Senator from Oregon is speaking. It shows that \nwe will be dropping to an unprecedented low in our level of support for \ncivilian research if we go ahead with the budget as it presently \nstands.\n  The amendment the Senator from Oregon proposes will cure the problem \nas it relates to the National Institutes of Health. The larger \namendment that I have proposed with Senators Lieberman and Rockefeller \nand Hollings and Biden deals with the larger issue of civilian \nresearch, and it is necessary also if we are going to avoid the same \nkind of precipitous drop in Federal support for civilian research that \nis contemplated in the present budget.\n  I thank the Senator and I support his amendment strongly.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I thank the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I asked the Senator from Oregon only for a minute \nbecause I am one of those Senators who later on wants to speak to other \namendments, and I know we are in a time crunch.\n  I say to the Senator from Oregon I certainly want to be included as \nan original cosponsor, but I do it with some sadness because I believe \nthat the military-defense part of the budget [[Page S7299]] ought to \nhave been included in the offset. I understand why the Senator was not \nable to do so.\n  Second of all, I am very worried about cuts in some of the other \nnondefense discretionary programs. Therefore, later on I am going to \nhave a sense-of-the-Senate amendment making clear it does not have to \nbe in each of those areas because each deserve a high priority, and I \nam going to try to point out the direction in which we should be \ndirecting our priorities. But it is with a sense of equity and fairness \nI proudly support this amendment.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. MACK. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  First, let me express my deep appreciation to Senator Hatfield for \nhis leadership on this issue in bringing this amendment to the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  In trying to figure out what I would confine my comments to in 5 \nminutes, because there is so much that I feel and so much that I have \nlearned with respect to what the National Institutes of Health is \ninvolved in, again, it is very difficult to kind of bring it down to a \ncouple of points.\n  A book that I read several years ago called ``The Transformed Cell,'' \nwritten by Dr. Steven Rosenberg out at the NIH National Cancer \nInstitute, really talks about the fundamental changes that have taken \nplace in the way we treat diseases in this country and, for that \nmatter, around the world. I am referring specifically to the treatment \nof cancer now.\n  For many years, if one was diagnosed with cancer, basically, surgery, \nradiation, or chemotherapy were the three choices, if you will. The \nphysicians would look at the particular disease and status to make a \ndetermination about which of those three alternatives to pursue.\n  Dr. Steven Rosenberg began his practice over 20 years ago when \nsomething occurred that kind of indicated to him that maybe there was \nsomething else going on that could, in fact, be used to fight the \ndisease. An individual that he was treating was cured of, I believe, \nmelanoma. And 20 years ago, if a person was discovered with melanoma, \nit was just a matter of time. There was no cure.\n  But, somehow or other, this patient survived. Dr. Steven Rosenberg \ncame to the conclusion and a very strong feeling that the answer was in \nthe immune system; that what saved that individual was his own immune \nsystem. And then that raised the question: Well, if the immune system \ncan defeat the disease in one individual but yet it does not in \nanother, why does that occur? And that began a long process of over 20 \nyears of trying to come to the discovery and understanding of what we \ncan do to enhance the immune system in order to fight the disease.\n  Now, if Dr. Steven Rosenberg were here today, I do not think he would \nsay to us that he has the total answer. But if you read his book, you \nwill find, for example, that in 40 percent of the cases there was a \nresponse to immunotherapy in melanoma.\n  The reason I get a little bit focused on melanoma is because, as many \nof you know, I am a survivor of melanoma. In 1989, after coming to the \nU.S Senate, I was diagnosed with melanoma. Fortunately, we found it \nearly and I should not have to be concerned with it at all. But in \n1979, my younger brother Michael died of melanoma. And I can tell you \npersonally what that experience is like.\n  And I could be talking about AIDS, I could be talking about, as the \nSenator from California talked about, the viruses, I could be talking \nabout any one of those. But the reality is that we are making great \nstrides today because of the work that is being done at NIH by people \nlike Dr. Steven Rosenberg.\n  So he added a fourth modality to the treatment of cancer. And there \nis a fifth today, and it is called gene therapy. And we are just \nbeginning to scratch the surface on gene therapy.\n  One of the earlier speakers referred to the discovery of the breast \ncancer gene, and there probably are several breast cancer genes. But \nthere has also been discovered a melanoma gene. It is called P-16. And \nwe know, through the research that has been done out at NIH, that it is \nrelatively simple to define cancer but very complicated to come up with \na solution. Cancer is nothing more than the uncontrolled growth of \ncells. But the issue is: Why are they uncontrolled and how can we \ncontrol them? And gene therapy and DNA are going to play a significant \nrole in making that determination.\n  My last point would be this: We have discovered what is called P-53, \nwhich I believe is a protein--it may be a gene as well--a protein that \nis involved in sending the message to the individual cells as to when \nthey should grow and when they should stop growing. There have been \ngreat strides made with respect to the P-53 gene.\n  It would be a tragedy for us to step back now when we are on the \nverge of breakthroughs on all kinds of diseases through gene therapy.\n  So what I am saying to the Senate is there are great benefits that \ncome from this investment.\n  I will close with this quote. Pasteur wrote: ``I am on the verge of \nmysteries and the veil is getting thinner and thinner.''\n  We want to provide the funds to make sure that that veil disappears.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I recognize the floor manager, the Senator \nfrom New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to propose a unanimous-consent \nrequest that will protect the Senator from Oregon but will advise \nSenators of when we will vote.\n                                 on nih\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to express my passionate support \nfor the National Institutes of Health.\n  The National Institutes of Health is the foundation of this Nation \nand the world's medical research. It is an investment in the future \nhealth and well-being of every American.\n  Over 85 percent of the NIH funding goes to academic medical centers \nof excellence all over the United States of America. From Stanford \nUniversity, Johns Hopkins University, and Harvard to the University of \nMaryland and the University of Wisconsin--these are the leaders in \nmedical science research.\n  What does our investment dollars get? Our investment in the NIH \nprovides the means to find the cures and preventions for disease. It \nkeeps the United States of America in the forefront of biomedical \nscience and biomedical technology. It encourages our global \ncompetitiveness and assures economic growth through the creation of \njobs in Maryland and throughout the United States. It helps communities \nhelp themselves.\n  The NIH has icon status in America and around the world. The short-\nsightedness of narrow-minded people in green eyeshades who would cut \nthe NIH funding is deeply disturbing. I simply cannot understand it.\n  The American people deserve a future of improved health. They \nunderstand the importance of investing in research and prevention. They \nwant their Federal dollars to go to programs that will help them meet \ntheir day-to-day needs. That is what the NIH does. Its research finds \ncures, prevents the onset of disease, and helps people live not only \nlonger but better lives.\n  For some time, I have worked on a bipartisan basis to advocate for a \nwomen's health agenda. I was one of those who led the fight to \nestablish an Office of Women's Health Research at the NIH--the first of \nits kind. I worked with my colleagues to expand research and address \ngender-specific health concerns like breast cancer, cervical cancer and \nprostate cancer.\n  The National Institutes of Health is the anchor for health research \ninvestment in this country.\n  And now, this picky little budget wants to freeze NIH funding into \nthe year 2000, or worse yet, may even cut NIH funding by 10 percent. \nLet us face the fact. You cannot freeze disease. You cannot freeze \nneurological deterioration and Parkinson's disease. And you cannot \nfreeze life saving research. You just cannot.\n  The impact of cutting NIH will take an incredible human toll. The \nmajor killers of men and women today are lung cancer and heart disease. \nWhat will happen to this research when there is not enough dollars to \ninvest in finding a cure? How will we ever find a cure \n[[Page S7300]] for Alzheimers disease and for AIDS without investing \nthe necessary dollars?\n  My own dear father died of Alzheimers disease. He died one brain cell \nat a time, and it did not matter that I was a U.S. Senator. All I could \ndo was look out for him, care for him, and make sure that he was \ncomfortable and safe. In loving memory of my father, I vowed to do all \nthat I can to lead the fight for research to find a cure for \nAlzheimers.\n  This is what this Budget would knock out. It is a tragedy for the \ndedicated men and women of NIH who have committed their lives to \nfinding cures to deadly diseases. And it is a tragedy for the American \npeople who look to NIH to meet our day-to-day health needs and to get \nus ready for the future.\n  I am passionate about my commitment to preserve this investment. We \nmust not turn our back on NIH. There are those who seem set on trying \nto dismantle the National Institutes of Health. I want to put those \npeople on notice--they will have to put up with me first. I will do \neverything I can to keep the National Institutes of Health an \ninvestment that saves lives, saves jobs, and helps communities.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. EXON. I applaud the Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I agree with the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, although I share the concern of my \ndistinguished colleague from Oregon, Senator Hatfield, about funding \nfor the National Institutes of Health (NIH), I must oppose his \namendment. I oppose his amendment because it fails to address the \nunderlying defect in the Budget Resolution we are debating--a one-third \nreduction overall in nonmilitary discretionary spending.\n  The amendment, in effect, simply rearranges the deck chairs on the \nTitanic. It cuts across-the-board from all discretionary functions--\nexcept for military, international affairs and the functions that fall \nlargely under the jurisdiction of the Labor, HHS Appropriations \nSubcommittee--to restore the 10-percent cut in NIH assumed in the \nbudget resolution.\n  I emphasize the word ``assumed'' because it should be clear that the \nfunding levels for individual programs are not determined by the budget \nresolution. The budget resolution only determines the amount of \ndiscretionary spending overall. The appropriations process determines \nthe amount of funding for individual programs, such as NIH. In fact, \nthe budget resolution does not even determine the amount of total funds \navailable to the Labor, HHS Appropriations Subcommittee which has \njurisdiction over NIH funding. Section 602(b) of the Congressional \nBudget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 reserves that power to the \nAppropriations Committee as well.\n  In addition, I take strong objection to the exclusion of the military \nand international affairs functions from the across-the-board cut \nrequired by this amendment. The cold war is over and the military \nshould bear a share of the cuts that this budget resolution will force \nthe Appropriations Committee to make in most, if not all, non-military \nprograms, including the very worthy NIH.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I support the amendment offered by my \ndistinguished colleague from Oregon, Senator Hatfield. We have worked \ntogether in the past to increase our commitment to the National \nInstitutes of Health [NIH]. Last year, during the health care reform \ndebate, Senator Hatfield and I introduced legislation to ensure that \nany reform plan also included increased investment in the fight against \ndisease and disability.\n  But, Mr. President, I am disappointed that this amendment once again \nprotects and preserves a bloated Pentagon budget. The budget resolution \ncuts over $1 trillion in Federal spending. It cuts health, education, \ntraining, veterans, and virtually everything else but it does not touch \ndefense. The Pentagon is increased by $34.5 billion over what a hard \nfreeze would be over the 7 years. So, while I support this amendment I \nbelieve strongly that instead of taking money away from discretionary \nprograms that are below a hard freeze in this budget to protect NIH we \nshould have looked to the bloated Pentagon budget.\n  NIH, as we all know, stands for the National Institutes of Health but \nit could just as easily stand for National Investment in Health. That's \nwhat we're talking about, investing in the health of our people and our \neconomy.\n  Unfortunately, today we are not here to talk about taking a small \nstep forward in medical research, we're here to prevent taking a giant \nleap back and cutting our commitment to research that saves lives and \nmoney.\n  The budget resolution before us cuts NIH by 10 percent and freezes \nspending through 2002. This translates into a cut of over $1 billion \nfor fiscal year 1996 alone.\n  Backing away from that commitment is shortsighted and fails to \nrecognize the important role that NIH plays in improving health care \nand holding down health care costs in the long run.\n  As former chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Warren \nMagnuson, said ``medical research is the first link in the chain of \nprevention.'' Without sufficient investment, we can't build that chain.\n  People from all over the world come to the United States for medical \ncare. Why? Because, we lead the world in quality of care. And research \nis key to this quality.\n  The United States has built an impressive biomedical research \nenterprise. Today, dramatic developments in genetics\n and gene therapy offer hope to many suffering from disorders such as \ncystic fibrosis, breast and prostate cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's \ndisease.\n\n  Increased investment in health research is key to reducing health \ncosts in the long run. And if we can unlock the cure for a disease like \nAlzheimer's the savings would be enormous--in dollars and human lives. \nToday, federally supported funding for research on Alzheimer's disease \ntotals $300 million yet it is estimated that nearly $100 billion is \nexpended annually on caring for people with Alzheimer's.\n  Gene therapy and treatments of cystic fibrosis and Parkinson's could \neliminate years of chronic care costs, while saving lives and improving \npatient's quality of life.\n  Past investment in research has paid off.\n  Less than $1 million spent to develop a potassium citrate treatment \nto prevent the formation of kidney stones yields over $436.2 million in \nannual savings in treatment costs.\n  $20.1 million in NIH support over a 17-year period led to the \ndevelopment of an improved influenza intervention for children, saving \nat least $346.6 million annually from a reduction in premature \nmortality and long-term earnings losses.\n  Clinical trials to develop a laser treatment for a diabetes related \neye condition cost $180.6 million and has resulted in a potential \nannual savings of over $1.2 billion.\n  New cell therapy techniques can reduce the costs of a bone marrow \ntransplant by as much as $50,000.\n  This country invests far too little in medical research, less than 2 \npercent of the total health budget is devoted to medical research. \nCompare that to the Pentagon where 15 percent of military dollars are \nspent on research. Where are our priorities?\n  It is expected that this budget proposal would reduce the success \nrate of qualified research proposals from the current 25 percent to as \nlittle as 15 percent. Just a decade ago, it was twice that. Science and \ncutting edge medical research are being put on hold. And every day we \nwait is another day we go without finding the cure for diabetes, \nAlzheimer's, Parkinson's and countless other diseases.\n  Mr. President, this resolution also further discourages our young \npeople from pursuing careers in medical research. The number of people \nunder the age of 36 even applying for NIH grants dropped by 54 percent \nbetween 1985 and 1993. This is due to a host of factors but I'm afraid \nthat the lower success rates among all\n applicants is making biomedical research less and less attractive to \nyoung people. If the perception is that funding for research is \nimpossible to obtain, young people that may have chosen medical \nresearch 10 years ago will choose other career paths.\n\n  Mr. President, investing in NIH doesn't just promote the health of \nour people, it promotes the health of our economy. The biotechnology \nand pharmaceutical industries contribute some $100 billion annually to \nthe economy and support 200,000 highly skilled jobs. [[Page S7301]] \n  In 1994, sales of biotechnology products totaled close to $8 billion \nand the Department of Commerce estimates that biotechnology will be a \n$50 billion industry by the year 2000.\n  Investing in medical research promotes healthier lives, creates jobs, \nand strengthens our economy and our competitive position in the global \nmarketplace. It's the right thing to do and the smart thing to do.\n  Mr. President, I support this amendment. But, even if this amendment \npasses as expected, it does not address the underlying defect in the \nbudget resolution we are debating, a one-third reduction overall in \nnonmilitary, discretionary spending.\n  This amendment cuts across-the-board from all discretionary \nfunctions, except for national defense, international affairs and the \nfunctions that fall largely under the jurisdiction of the Labor, HHS \nAppropriations Subcommittee, to restore the 10-percent cut in NIH \nassumed in the budget resolution.\n  But, Mr. President, funding levels for individual programs are not \ndetermined by the budget resolution. The budget resolution only \ndetermines the amount of discretionary spending overall. It is the \nappropriations process that determines the amount of funding for \nindividual programs, such as NIH. So, Mr. President, despite this \namendment, the Appropriations Committee will be faced with a one-third \nreduction in nonmilitary discretionary spending and, therefore, all \ndiscretionary spending programs such as the NIH are going to be subject \nto cuts because of this budget resolution.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I support what the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, Senator Hatfield, is attempting to do, ensure \nthat sufficient funding is made available for the work of the National \nInstitutes of Health [NIH]. I strongly support the important work that \nbody is undertaking, particularly with respect to research on breast \nand prostrate cancer, heart disease and diabetes.\n  However, what troubles me about this amendment is the proposition \nthat it isn't possible to reorder priorities within function 550--the \nhealth account--to make the necessary funding available to the NIH. To \nmake the amount of funding contemplated by the amendment available to \nthe NIH, we simply have to shift $1 billion within function 550, an \naccount that will total $120 billion in fiscal year 1996, rising to \n$150 billion by 2002. Instead, the amendment takes money out of other \naccounts, including funding for veterans, and that seriously concerns \nme.\n  The budget resolution already contemplates a phase-out of \nconstruction of VA facilities. Higher prescription copayments for \ncertain veterans are assumed. Outlays for veterans programs would \nactually amount to $500 million less next year compared to this year. \nAnd the Hatfield amendment would take another $224 million a year out \nof veterans programs on top of that.\n  If I thought that it wasn't possible for Congress, for the \nappropriators, the Health and Human Services Department or the NIH \nitself to prioritize spending for the good and necessary work that the \nNIH does, I might be willing to support this amendment.\n  However, we all know that the budget resolution doesn't require that \nNIH funding be cut, only that funding within function 550 not exceed a \nspecified level. There are ways to do that without adversely affecting \nthe work that the NIH does. For example, the growth of Medicaid could \nbe slowed, as Senator Gramm proposed yesterday.\n  I am confident that, as the author of the amendment and as chairman \nof the Appropriations Committee, Senator Hatfield won't allow the NIH \nbudget to be cut too deeply when it comes time to appropriate money for \nthe NIH. The Department of Health and Human Services and the NIH won't \nsacrifice critical research when it comes time to prioritize the use of \nfunds that are ultimately appropriated.\n  Mr. President, I want to work with the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee to find a solution, but one which doesn't adversely affect \nour Nation's veterans.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby my colleague from Oregon, long recognized as a leader in our efforts \nto promote biomedical research. I can think of no more worthy a purpose \nthan to restore funding for the National Institutes of Health. NIH is \nthe world's premier biomedical research institution. It is our \ninvestment in the Nation's future health. I have watched with pride as \nNIH has grown during my years in the Congress. I have watched with \npride as exciting discovery after discovery spawned by the NIH has \nbecome a reality. I have watched with pride as efforts at the premier \nresearch institutions in Utah, such as the excellent work at the \nUniversity of Utah, have led to incredible discoveries helping to \nimprove literally millions of lives.\n  As with many of my colleagues, I was very disappointed when the \nmeasure approved by committee set NIH on a such a steep downward \nfunding path. While I do not believe any program or agency should be \nimmune from reductions in our efforts to get Federal spending under \ncontrol, the NIH may have been hit too hard.\n  Some may say that a 10-percent cut in NIH does not sound like a lot, \nbut it is. The President's proposed NIH budget of $11.8 billion was \nintended to support 23,874 research project grants, which includes \n6,046 new and competing research project grants. Maybe that sounds like \na high level, but it is not. The President's proposal represented a \ndecrease of 522 new and competing grants from this fiscal year, and the \nbudget resolution funding level will lead to even further reductions.\n  In 1987, by comparison, we funded almost 7,200 new and competing \ngrants. It is not commonly recognized, in addition, that the majority \nof projects submitted to the NIH, extremely worthy projects which could \nyield scientific advances as promising as any, are not funded. Just \nlook at the numbers: This year, project grants at NIH are expected to \nhave a 24-percent success rate; this means that only one-quarter of the \nprojects which are approved are funded.\n  Under the President's budget, it is expected to decline to 23 \npercent. And under the budget resolution, to an even smaller \npercentage. Contrast this to 1992, when the success rate was 29.6 \npercent, or 1986, when it was 32.1 percent. Although I do strongly \nsupport this amendment, I also want to express my concern about the \n``offsets'' used to ``pay for'' the amendment, or, in other words, \nabout the source of funding which will make up the difference if NIH \nfunding were increased and the entire budget resolution is to stay \nwithin the same overall cap.\n  As I understand the amendment offered by my colleague, it would \nrestore $7 billion of the proposed $7.9 billion reduction in NIH \nfunding over the coming 7 fiscal years. The difference would be made up \nby an across-the-board reduction in all budget functions except for the \nsocial programs, broadly speaking, and defense and international \naffairs. The effect of this amendment is to place the burden of making \nup the difference on the other accounts within the budget, many of \nwhich are already sustaining large reductions.\n  For example, under this amendment, in order to increase NIH, \ndecreases would be effected in programs for veterans, agriculture, \nspace and science research, energy, natural resources, and community \ndevelopment.\n  I am particularly concerned about a proposed reduction of about $1 \nbillion over 7 years in law enforcement and crime prevention efforts, \nat a time when increased acts of violence and terrorism throughout the \nUnited States are threatening the ability of peaceful, law-abiding \ncitizens to lead their lives.\n  In addition, I would point out to my colleagues that under the budget \nresolution, funding for function 550, the health function, comes down \n12.2 percent overall. However, several accounts are held harmless \nwithin that function, including the Food and Drug Administration, which \nwould receive $884 million--AIDS programs at the Health Resources and \nServices Administration--$656 million--the Indian Health Service--\n$1.963 billion--the Centers for Disease Control--$2.88 billion--the \nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration--$2.197 \nbillion--and AIDS research at NIH--$1.336 billion. These programs were \nall held level.\n  I urge the House and Senate budget conferees to take a look at the \nentire health function to see if we are allocating funds most \nappropriately in relation to the other budget \nfunctions. [[Page S7302]] \n  Obviously, I have no interest in seeing very vital programs such as \nIndian health or AIDS sustain unwise reductions. At the same time, I do \nnot wish to see the Administration of Justice account, or veterans \nprograms, for example, sustain inappropriate reductions.\n  It is my desire that conferees take all these competing needs into \naccount and create the best possible balance.\n  That being said, Mr. President, I urge adoption of the Hatfield \namendment on NIH.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nOregon, Senator Hatfield, for his leadership in providing biomedical \nresearch funding, and I strongly support his amendment to restore $1 \nbillion per year that otherwise would be cut under this Senate budget \nresolution.\n  Most basic biomedical research in this Nation is supported by the \nNational Institutes of Health. Nearly every week we hear of advances \nagainst disease supported by NIH grants. As such, NIH not only reduces \nsuffering in our country, it lays the groundwork for economic growth \nand leads the world in the fight against disease.\n  Despite our profound responsibility to maintain NIH funding, we \ncurrently provide funds adequate to support only one in four research \nproposals. The Senate budget resolution could cut that current support \nlevel to 1 in 10.\n  At that level, young researchers will be strongly encouraged to seek \nother careers. The steady stream of Nobel Prize winners at NIH--89 so \nfar--will dry up. In short, we will be cutting into the muscle and bone \nof an institution that demonstrates the best of American Government and \nthe best of human endeavor.\n  Furthermore, the Senate budget resolution funding levels would \neffectively forestall life-saving, cost-effective research. NIH is \ncurrently in the middle of many long-term projects that revolutionary \nimplications for medicine. NIH is supporting a $3 billion, 15-year \neffort to map the human genome. This project underlies the revolution \nin genetic medicine that has implications for cancer, developmental \ndisabilities, Alzheimer's disease, juvenile diabetes, and numerous \nother diseases. NIH began a 12-year, $68 million prostrate cancer \nprevention trial in 1991. It began a $50 million, 11-year childhood \nasthma management program in the same year. In 1990, it began a 12-year \ntest of tamozifen treatments for breast cancer among a randomized group \nof 16,000 women. It continues to support the Framingham longitudinal \ninvestigation of factors influencing the development of cardiovascular \ndisease, which began in 1948. Next year NIH plans to support six \ncenters specializing in hypertension research over 5 years.\n  These are just a few examples of the critical research underway at \nNIH that should not be eliminated or delayed in the name of short-term \nbudgetary gains. The truth is, we save money through biomedical \nresearch. Recent NIH advances in the therapy of sickle cell disease \nsave an estimated $350 million annually. Recent advances against \nalcoholism save $125 million annually. Research underway to delay the \nonset of blindness in diabetics and to delay the onset of Alzheimer's \ncould save billions. Simply delaying the onset of cardiovascular \ndisease by 5 years is estimated to potentially save $70 billion yearly. \nAnd clearly, without progress against AIDS, will continue to spend \nbillions in our hospitals and in lost human productivity.\n  So, Mr. President, we cannot responsibly turn away from these \nresearch needs. We must provide for them in the budget, and Senator \nHatfield has provided the vehicle to do so. Again, I thank him for his \nleadership and urge all of my colleagues to support the Hatfield \namendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Hatfield \namendment which adds $1 billion to the budget for the National \nInstitutes of Health [NIH]. The budget proposal before us recommends a \n10 percent cut for the NIH in fiscal year 1996, and then a freeze at \nthis lower level through the year 2002. This means that the NIH budget \nwould be cut from $11.3 billion in fiscal year 1995 to $10.2 billion in \nfiscal year 1996, and then frozen at $10.2 billion through 2002.\n  If the proposed cuts are permitted to take place, it would damage NIH \nresearch at a time of unprecedented productivity, drive talented \nscientists, both young and established, into other careers, and cause \nthe United States to lose its hard-won leadership in such fields as \nbiotechnology and pharmaceuticals.\n  Mr. President, NIH has been a tremendous investment for the American \npeople. The research supported by NIH has saved lives, reduced \nsuffering, and led to lower medical costs. The NIH has an impressive \ncollection of new successes, such as the following list of some \nfundamental discoveries and clinical advances for the past year:\n  A revolution in cancer risk assessment, the long-sought gene for some \nheredity breast cancers, BRCA-1, has been isolated, as have genes that \npredispose some patients to colon cancer, melanoma, and kidney cancer.\n  A simple drug, hydroxyurea, alters the composition of hemoglobin and \nthereby reduces by half the painful crisis that commonly hospitalize \npatients with sickle cell disease.\n  Hormone replacement successfully controls blood lipids in post- \nmenopausal women and likely reduces cardiovascular disease.\n  A new acellular vaccine for whooping cough is safe as well as \neffective.\n  The biomedical research supported by NIH makes vital contributions to \nthe Nation's health, improving the quality of life, advancing science, \nand creating economic growth. Advances derived from NIH research save \nan estimated $69 billion in medical care costs each year. Because of \nthe discoveries made by biomedical researchers over the years, we live \nlonger, healthier, and more active lives. Today, an American's life \nexpectancy is 75.5 years, an increase of almost 5 years since 1970.\n  If this progress is to continue, it is imperative that the NIH budget \nbe preserved. Stable NIH funding is required to maintain laboratories \nperforming cutting edge research. Even a short hiatus in funding \nresults in loss of established research programs that can not be \nreadily recovered.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, at the \nconclusion of the debate on the Hatfield amendment, the Senate begin \nvoting in the following sequence: on the Harkin amendment, on the \nFeingold amendment, on or in relation to the Bumpers amendment, on or \nin relation to the Dodd substitute, on or in relation to the Snowe \namendment, and on the Hatfield amendment. I further ask unanimous \nconsent that the first vote in this sequence be 20 minutes and \nthereafter the remaining ones, back to back, be 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Do I hear objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, and I shall not, I missed, \nMr. President, what the distinguished manager said. Did he say when \nthese votes would begin?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Well, they will begin when Senator Hatfield's time has \nrun out.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senator. I have no objection.\n  Mr. EXON. Reserving the right to object, and I do not intend to \nobject, I would just say, for purposes of clarification, two things. \nWith regard to the Snowe amendment, could we insert in the language \n``the Snowe amendment, as amended, if amended''?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. One further question. Could we get agreement at this time \nto move things along. As the Senator from Nebraska has continually \nwarned, we are running out of time. Could we get an agreement, as a \npart of this unanimous-consent agreement, to have the votes on the \nseries of amendments that have been outlined by the chairman of the \ncommittee to start, I am suggesting, maybe at 10 minutes after 10 or \nsomething of that nature?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think Senator Hatfield has 17 minutes.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I have 17 minutes and other Senators are asking to be \nheard. I would agree, say, to a quarter after 10, provided this time is \nnot charged against my allotment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time remaining to the Senator from Oregon \nis 14 minutes 56 seconds.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Does that include this period of colloquy? \n[[Page S7303]] \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That time has come out of the time of the \nSenator from New Mexico, who requested the time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So, Mr. President, for the understanding of everyone, \nSenator Hatfield has 15 minutes, and I will yield back the remainder of \nthe time on the amendment so we will have more time for other \namendments, and we will proceed in this order.\n  Mr. EXON. So the vote will be in the area of 10:15?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is about right.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, will the distinguished \nmanager be willing to amend that to the following: that after the \nseries of votes, the Senator from Vermont be recognized for not to \nexceed 4 minutes to speak on two resolutions which will be voted on.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, it seems to me that the Senator from \nVermont, with all due respect, is trying to step ahead of several other \nSenators whom we have made commitments to. I would ask the Senator to \nwithdraw that request.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I was not aware of the commitments.\n  I withdraw the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Hearing none, so ordered.\n  Mr. HATFIELD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in strong support as a cosponsor \nof the Hatfield amendment. I also want to commend the Senator from \nFlorida for his very eloquent statement on why the NIH is so important \nto this Nation, and I do not have too much to add to that.\n  But I will point out that this is a perfect example of what can \nhappen if we are not careful as we go forward with the debate on the \nbudget and agree to cut things without recognizing that, in many cases, \nthose things that we seek to cut to try to reduce the deficit, in \neffect, will add to the deficit. That is certainly true when it comes \nto medical research.\n  Time and time again, we have been able to make breakthroughs through \nthe research by the NIH. Those breakthroughs have resulted in \nconsiderable, if not substantial, and gigantic savings in the cost of \nhealth care.\n  We all know that as we move forward, the most essential area that we \nhave to control costs in is the health care area. So I would say that \nthe NIH is clearly an entity that must be maintained because this is \none area where they have a role and a role that must be maintained to \nnot only do the research that they do at the NIH but, in addition to \nthat, to take care of the research that is done in the hospitals, the \ntraining schools and the training universities, so that our whole area \nof health care can improve as we move along.\n  This creates many jobs through the biomedical research and technology \ntransfers and all this adds, again, revenues to our deficit.\n  The resulting knowledge is essential from these entities for \nestablished industries such as DNA and other areas of research.\n  In other areas, we have saved already billions of dollars with \nrespect to psychoactive drugs that save over $70 billion a year in \nhospitalization of mental patients. Vaccines and fluoridation save \ncountless health care dollars and, again, help reduce the deficit.\n  The recent discovery of bacterial causes of peptic ulcers will save \nmillions in chronic care costs. As I said over and over again, the same \nis true in education generally, not just medical education; that if we \ncut those things which are resulting in savings, then our job to solve \nthe deficit problem will get worse and worse instead of better.\n  So I commend the Senator from Oregon for this amendment and support \nit with enthusiasm. If I have any time remaining, I yield it back.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his comments. I \nyield 2 minutes to the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized \nfor 2 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wish to join with many of my colleagues \ntoday who support the amendment of the Senator from Oregon. In the \nprocess of developing a budget, we have to set priorities and, in this \ninstance, I think the Senator from Oregon has rightly pointed out the \ninitial budget resolution had some priorities that should be adjusted, \nand he has certainly pointed out the strengths and importance of NIH \nand what it contributes to the fabric of America's society and it \nshould be supported. I strongly commend him for that. Therefore, I will \nvote for this amendment.\n  NIH is a unique institution. It is a collection of some of the most \ntalented and brilliant individuals from around the world, but \nespecially from the United States, who are working together to push the \nenvelope of improving the health of not only the American people but \nthe world in general.\n  It is an institution which is also fairly delicate. That type of \ntalent and ability needs to be nurtured and needs to be supported, and \nit can be affected rather considerably by changes in its funding \nstructure or in its general structure.\n  Therefore, I want to commend and support what the Senator from Oregon \nhas decided to do with this amendment, which is to assure that NIH \nremains a strong and vibrant institution as we move into the future, \nand that their commitment to improving the lives of all Americans will \nnot in any way be undermined by this budget resolution.\n  So I support and look forward to voting for the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Oregon.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time to the Senator from Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I have a number of comments I wish to \nclose with, but if there are questions pending, I would like to \nrespond.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I will be very happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. There is some confusion as to where the offsets are coming \nfrom. Will the Senator please state where he is getting these offsets \nfor his increase in the NIH funding?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, the offsets are coming from nondefense \ndiscretionary funds and accounts. I have pages of tables here on each \nprecise account that would indicate where they are coming from. We have \nexcluded within that Medicare, and the health services, but they are \nthen from all other remaining of the nondefense discretionary accounts.\n  Mr. BYRD. Well, I am a strong supporter of adequate funding of NIH \nresearch programs, but we are already suffering terrible blows to \nnonmilitary discretionary programs. I would like to have seen the \nSenator's amendment take the funds out of military discretionary \nprograms and foreign aid.\n  I would like to know just what other programs are being cut. The \ndistinguished Senator has stated that certain programs are not being \ncut. But what does this leave by way of nonmilitary discretionary \nprograms that are going to suffer additional cuts over and above those \nthat are already involved in the resolution?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I will respond by saying I \nwholeheartedly agree. In fact, at the beginning of my time allocation \ntoday, I sent to the desk a proposal that would take these funds, \noffset these funds from everything in the discretionary area, including \nmilitary.\n  Having shopped that proposal around the Senate, I calculated we would \nhave had about 20 votes. So we would have ended up with the \ndismantling, what I call this proposal, which is a prelude to disaster, \nof the medical research infrastructure we have developed in this \ncountry, the greatest in the world.\n  By taking a second-degree or withdrawing the first and offering the \nsecond proposal, which was to exclude the military, by that action, we \nhave salvaged, at the expense of a fewer other agencies than my first \nproposal, but we at least have salvaged the future of NIH.\n  It is a matter of robbing Peter to pay Paul, I suppose would be the \nmost succinct way to do it. Not my preference, but with the political \nreality I face on this floor, it was the only way I could find to \nsalvage and save NIH.\n[[Page S7304]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. In other words, if I may pursue the subject a bit further, \nit would mean additional cuts in VA programs?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. It would mean additional cuts in education programs?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. It would mean additional cuts in various other health \nprograms?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Yes, various others. Nondefense discretionary funds, \nwith the exclusion of the health programs and Medicare.\n  Mr. BYRD. It would mean additional cuts in law enforcement?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator. I applaud \nhis objective. I want to support the amendment, but at the same time, I \nfind it hard to continue to cut more and more and more from these other \nnonmilitary discretionary programs.\n  I suppose we are faced with the choice now of either voting for or \nagainst the amendment. I am sorry that other nonmilitary programs are \nto be cut.\n  We apparently do not have the votes in here to cut military funding. \nAs an example, the B-2 bomber costs somewhere between $740 million and \n$1.2 billion per copy--and I believe that we have already committed \nourselves to a contract for 20 additional B-2 bombers to be completed \nby the year 2000. There are many other military programs of like manner \nthat I could cite, but I will not do it at this time. I thank the \ndistinguished Senator for allotting me this opportunity to ask a \nquestion.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I share the agony. Believe me, one might \nthink that we have cause to celebrate a victory if this amendment \npasses--which I expect it to do, and to survive conference, which I \nhope it could do--but I do not believe that it does call for a joint \ncelebration because we have achieved one goal at a pretty heavy cost to \nan awful lot of other programs that I have deep interest in, as well. \nIt is like choosing between your children. It is very difficult.\n  Mr. President, if I could have the attention of the chairman of the \nSenate Budget Committee, I would like to ask a question for the Record. \nIn the report of the Budget Committee accompanying this resolution, \nwhere there were exemptions listed within the report language, if this \namendment is adopted, do I understand clearly that that will then, in \neffect, eradicate, eliminate, excise those conditions within the report \nlanguage of exemptions?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator is absolutely correct.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I thank my colleagues who joined in this \neffort. I say that it is, I believe, a step in the right direction. \nBut, at the same time, I want to take a moment, once again, to commend \nthe chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici from New Mexico. \nI would not trade with him for all the tea in China. I think Senator \nDomenici has probably one of the toughest jobs in the Senate. No matter \nwhat he does and his colleagues on that committee, it is a no-win \nsituation. It is a very, very difficult task. I think they have carried \ntheir duties with not only great skill, great dignity and, above all, \nwith remarkable patience. I have been in the strategy meetings, and \neverybody is gigging, and I am happy that everybody is taking it out on \ngood old Pete. I want to come to his defense--not that he needs my \ndefense--but I admire him as chairman of the committee. I admire what \nhe does and his dedication and spirit. And I deeply admire him as one \nof my closest personal friends.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I think the Senator has 1 minute. If he \ndoes not mind, I will use it. I personally thank Senator Hatfield for \nhis comments. I think it is obvious to everyone that you do not have a \nbudget resolution like the one pending on the floor without a lot of \ncooperation. On our side, let me say that the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee clearly could have made this more difficult, \nand he chose to go with us on a balanced budget. He has been a strong \nadvocate on it. We are not going in a direction he might choose, but I \nthink he indicated to me that he is so concerned about our deficit \nspending that he compliments us on what we are doing.\n  Let me also say there is no doubt in my mind that the funding for the \nNIH that the distinguished Senator from Oregon seeks could be \naccommodated in the budget resolution by the appropriators, by \nallocating differently and leaving more for the NIH. I think the \nSenator has decided he wants the Senate to speak on the issue. I gather \nthat is the purpose of the vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Oregon yield the \nremainder of his time?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield any time I may have had remaining, Mr. \nPresident.\n                           amendment no. 1130\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Bumpers-Bradley \namendment to strike language that would allow us to count the sale of \npublic assets--parks, powerplants, buildings, even oil in national \nstorage facilities--as deficit reduction.\n  This bill language will open the floodgates for proposals to unload \nvaluable Federal assets in return for the fast buck. Many of these \nproposals, in fact, will lead to reduced revenues in the future, and \nhigher deficits. Only by a reliance on today's political myopia--a \nsimpleminded scoring of sales revenue within the limited budget \nwindow--will many of these proposals withstand the straight face test. \nOnly by railroading these proposals through the Senate, under the very \nrestrictive and controlled conditions of budget reconciliation, would \nmany of these proposals ever have a chance of becoming law.\n  I have not seen the Budget Committee's latest scoring of these asset \nsales receipts. But I note for colleagues' benefit that the analysis \nthat I have shows an interesting point. In the short term, the \ncommittee's proposals produce deficit reduction. In the longer term, \nhowever, and certainly by the year 2002, these savings disappear. In \nfact, selling these assets appears to reduce future revenues \nsufficiently that the actual effect by the year 2002 is that the \ndeficit increases. Asset sales are short-term and short-sighted.\n  It would be helpful to review why we produce these budget resolutions \nin the first place. The reason is not to balance the budget. If it was, \nI'm sure we could create some appropriate fiction which showed \nbudgetary balance by definition.\n  But that's not what we were supposed to be doing here. We're supposed \nto be systematic. We're supposed to be honest. We're supposed to be \nconsistent. We're supposed to address the substantive, structural \nissues which keep the Federal Government spending--year in, year out--\nmore money than it takes in.\n  So what do we have here, buried deep in this bill? We have a trick, a \ngimmick. We cut spending, by redefining what a cut is. Now, for the \nfirst time since we gave this budget process teeth--with the passage of \nGramm-Rudman--we can sell off national property--national assets--and \ninclude the proceeds as deficit reduction.\n  Mr. President, because of these cynically clever changes, we can now \npropose--for example--to sell nearly a billion dollars' worth of oil \nfrom the strategic petroleum, and chalk that up to deficit reduction.\n  Notwithstanding the fact that both Democratic and Republican \nadministrations have endorsed expanding the SPR, notwithstanding the \nfact that hardly a week goes by without some oil State Senator coming \nto the floor to talk about rising oil imports and the threats to \nnational security, notwithstanding the fact that at any time we could \nliquidate this oil inventory for cash, how can we seriously allege that \nthis particular sale has anything to do with positive public policy, \nwith putting our fiscal house in order, with creating a better future \nfor our children?\n  Why stop at a billion dollars of SPR oil? Sell it all. And credit the \n$10 billion raised to balancing the budget or protecting our children's \nfuture.\n  This asset sale language will lead to all sorts of questionable \nproposals. It may make sense to sell the assets of the Tennessee Valley \nAuthority, or Bonneville Power, or the hydrodams in [[Page S7305]] the \nWest, or some small park in Louisiana or Texas or Virginia. But these \narguments need to have a broader basis than the most simpleminded \nbudget concerns.\n  In fact, I doubt that any business accountant or economist would \nagree with the underlying budgetary premise--that liquidating public \nassets adds to public wealth. If I sell my stock portfolio and put the \nreturns in my checking account, do I become wealthier? Have I protected \nmy children? It may make sense to make sell my stocks, but the \ntransaction itself produces no wealth--except for my broker.\n  Consider the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. We can lease the refuge \nto oil developers and sell any oil that might be underground to them. \nWe will get some money. The companies will get the rights to oil. If \nthey find oil, probably it will be shipped to the Pacific rim and \nburned completely. Have we done a lot for our kids? You must be joking.\n  At best, we can claim for our children a neutral financial \ntransaction. But what about the larger issues? If we go ahead with the \ndevelopment of ANWR, we damage probably irrevocably a unique, world-\nclass ecosystem. We consume utterly a non-renewable resource. We get \nsome cash.\n  If we forgo the drilling of ANWR, we preserve intact this ecosystem. \nWe preserve intact any oil underground and the possibility of future \ndevelopment. We do not get the cash.\n  I, frankly, reject any claim that our children will thank us for \nusing up this oil and running oil rigs and oil pipelines across the \nArctic Plain.\n  Mr. President, what the American public expects, and what our \nchildren expect, is for us to get our fiscal house in order. Our \nchildren are not asking us to sell off their collective inheritance. \nOur children are not asking us to look narrowly at some budget window \nand forget that many of these assets produce public value--and I do not \njust mean financial value--beyond the window.\n  When one Member from the other side of the aisle, Senator Craig, \nconsidered this issue as a House Member, he said ``asset sales are in \nfact blue smoke and mirrors at best. If they are to happen, they should \nbe set off budget.'' Exactly right.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I rise today in support of the amendment offered by my \ncolleague, Senator Bumpers, to strike a provision of the budget \nresolution that would allow scoring of revenues from the sale of \nFederal assets. Make no mistake, I believe in reducing the Federal \ndeficit. But this is simply the wrong way to do it.\n  The current rule prohibiting the scoring of Federal asset sales, \nfirst adopted as part of the 1987 Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act, has been \nincorporated into recent budget resolutions. When it was first adopted, \nSenator Chiles, then chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, made it \nclear that the rule was intended to prevent the use of asset sales from \nbeing used to jimmy the figures, in other words to give the appearance \nof deficit reduction without really reducing spending.\n  The same principle applies here today. By changing the current rule \nprohibiting the scoring of Federal asset sales, the budget resolution \nwould allow individual Committees to reach their deficit reduction \ntargets by selling off Federal properties. This is a short-sighted \nstrategy that sacrifices our children's heritage for an immediate \ninfusion of cash; we should not use their inheritance to pay our debts.\n  There are two examples where I think this strategy is particularly \nmisguided. The first is the sale of power marketing agencies that year \nafter year provide affordable electricity to people in rural \ncommunities across this country. The second is the leasing for oil and \ngas development of one of this Nation's most magnificent wildlife \nrefuges, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska.\n\n\n                        power marketing agencies\n\n  I've spoken many times before opposing the sale of power marketing \nagencies as a silly and shortsighted idea. It's nonsense. We should be \nselling off our infrastructure. We would be opening the door to \nmonopolies. And that spells higher utility bills for ratepayers in \nMontana and other States across the Nation. In other words, it's \nnothing but a heavy-handed, punitive tax on the middle class.\n\n\n                    arctic national wildlife refuge\n\n  The budget resolution also proposes to lease the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge, which is in the northeast corner of Alaska. The refuge \nsupports a spectacular diversity of wildlife, including polar bears, \ngrizzly bears, wolves, and snow geese. In addition, more than 150,000 \ncaribou migrate through the refuge, bearing their young on the coastal \nplain. The caribou are an important source of food for the native \npeople who live near the refuge and continue, as their ancestors have \nfor generations, to depend on the land to sustain their way of life. In \n1987, the United States and Canada signed an International Agreement \nfor the Conservation of the Porcupine Caribou Herd.\n  Under the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, which \nCongress passed in 1980, oil and gas development is prohibited in the \n19 million acre refuge unless authorized by Congress. Because the 1.5 \nmillion acre coastal plain is such an important and unique are for \nwildlife, I believe it should be permanently protected. I have \ncosponsored a bill (S. 428) to designate that area as wilderness.\n  However, regardless of whether you agree with me that this area \nshould be permanently protected or, as the Budget Committee proposes, \nit should be opened for drilling, I believe this issue is too \nsignificant and too complex to be resolved during the budget process. \nThe budget process focuses on the short-term economic gains to be \nobtained by drilling. It is not suited to considering what benefits and \nvalues will be lost for future generations of Americans by developing \nthis pristine wildlife refuge. The budget resolution and the subsequent \nreconciliation bill are two of the very few bills where Senate rules \nlimit debate and amendments. In my opinion, this path does not provide \nan adequate opportunity to evaluate alternatives, to question the \nassumptions on which those projected economic gains are based, or to \nfully consider the potential impacts of drilling on the fragile arctic \nenvironment.\n  These decisions could result in higher utility bills for middle-class \nAmericans across the country and significantly impact one of our most \nprecious national wildlife refuges. To ensure that these issues receive \nthe full consideration and debate they deserve, I urge my colleagues to \nreject the proposed rule change that would allow the scoring of federal \nasset sales and to vote for the Bumpers amendment.\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 1126\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I believe now we would proceed under the \npreviously agreed to order. I yield such time as she may need to the \nSenator from the State of California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer].\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, will the Senator yield on my time?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Of course. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time remains on the bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One hour forty-nine minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It is divided about equally?\n  Mr. EXON. I believe the time rests with the minority.\n  Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time controlled by the Senator from \nNebraska is 1 hour and 49 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to remind Senators that when that \n1 hour and 49 minutes is up--and, obviously, if the Senator uses the \nfull hour--we will use a full hour on our side on the amendment. Then \nthere will not be any time left.\n  It would seem to me that we ought to try to expedite things and find \nout how many amendments are real. I will try to do that in the next 10 \nminutes; find out exactly how many amendments we must have on our side. \nI hope we will try because I think Senators must know. Last year, on \nthe budget resolution, there were 20 or 35 amendments, and the way the \nmajority leader then did it was the clerk read one sentence explaining \nit and we voted.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I think I can enlighten my friend. It is \nthis Senator's intention to use only about 5 or 6 minutes, then to \nyield back my time on this amendment to my ranking member, Senator \nExon, and then he will yield to other Senators to explain their \namendments. That is the plan.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is fine. I just want Senators to know that even if \nthe Senator yields her time I do not have to yield my time. I would \nlike to get some understanding of how we are going to use the time \nbecause I will use an hour in opposition. On the other hand, we might \nbe able to work out something, if the Senator would like.\n  Mr. EXON. I appreciate the attitude expressed by the chairman of the \nBudget Committee. I appreciate the remarks and the agreement made by \nthe Senator from California.\n  What we are trying to do is give Senators on this side 2 or 3 minutes \nto explain amendments that will later be offered, and trying to use the \ntime in that fashion. Hopefully we can cooperate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if the Senator might permit me. I will depend \non the Senator from Nebraska totally. When she yields, if the Senator \nfrom Nebraska would use 10 minutes or so while I am off the floor, then \nI will come back.\n  Mr. EXON. I will be able to use that, or as much time that the \nSenator from New Mexico cares to be gone.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator very much. I would like to use mine \nin opposition.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1134\n\n (Purpose: To strengthen the sense of the Congress that 90 percent of \n       the benefits of any tax cuts must go to the middle class)\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1134.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 89, strike line 1 through 17 and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 306. PROHIBITION OF LEGISLATION THAT WOULD INCLUDE A TAX \n                   CUT UNLESS 90 PERCENT OF THE BENEFITS GO TO THE \n                   MIDDLE CLASS.\n\n       (a) Finding.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the incomes of middle-class families have stagnated \n     since the early 1980's, with family incomes growing more \n     slowly between 1979 and 1989 than in any other business cycle \n     since World War II; and\n       (2) according to the Department of the Treasury, in 1996, \n     approximately 90 percent of American families will have \n     incomes less than $100,000.\n       (b) Point of Order.--It shall not be in order in the Senate \n     to consider any bill, resolution, amendment, motion, or \n     conference [[Page S7308]] report that contains a reduction in \n     revenues unless at least 90 percent of the benefits of that \n     reduction goes to working families with annual incomes less \n     than $100,000.\n       (c) Appeals.--Appeals in the Senate from decisions of the \n     Chair relating to this section shall be limited to 1 hour, to \n     be equally divided between and controlled by, the appellant \n     and the manager of the bill or resolution, as the case may \n     be. An affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members of the \n     Senate, duly chosen and sworn, shall be required in the \n     Senate to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a \n     point of order raised under this section.\n       (d) Congressional Budget Office Reports.--Whenever the \n     Director of the Congressional Budget Office shall prepare a \n     report pursuant to section 308 of the Congressional Budget \n     Act of 1974 in connection with a bill, resolution, or \n     conference report that contains a reduction in revenues, the \n     Director shall so state in that report, and, to the extent \n     practicable, shall include an estimate of the amount of the \n     reduction in revenues and the percent of the benefits of that \n     reduction in revenue that will go to working families with \n     annual incomes less than $100,000.\n       (e) Estimates.--Solely for the purposes of enforcement of \n     this section on the Senate floor, the percentage of benefits \n     of a reduction in revenues going to working families with \n     annual incomes less than $100,000 shall be determined on the \n     basis of estimates made by the Congressional Budget Office.\n       (f) Sunset.--This section shall expire at the close of the \n     104th Congress.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to \nspeak for 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we are asking the question again with this \nBoxer amendment: ``Whose side are you on?'' And with many amendments \nthat have come before this body which have all been revenue neutral \nwhich have not added 1 cent to the deficit, we have asked this \nquestion: ``Whose side are you on?\"\n  I think that this Boxer amendment gives all of us a chance to answer \nthat question one more time.\n  The amendment says that the only tax cuts that will be in order in \nthis Congress will be tax cuts where 90 percent of the benefits go to \nthose earning under $100,000 per year. Any other tax cut plan will be \nsubjected to a 60-vote point of order.\n  So this is our opportunity to really take a stand with the middle \nclass, not just in words but in actual votes.\n  Why is this amendment necessary? Simply because the Republican \ncontract calls for tax cuts for the very wealthy, the very top 1, 2 \npercent of the people, and I would like to point this out, courtesy of \nSenator Lautenberg. We have some facts here.\n  The winners in the Republican budget clearly are wealthy. Nothing \nthat has happened on this floor has changed it. Indeed, the amendments \nthat we had, which would have helped this balance tilt back toward the \nmiddle class, have gone down in flames because of party-line votes.\n  So clearly the winners are the rich, $350,000 a year, and this \nRepublican budget will give them a $20,000 tax break. That is what is \nhidden in the so-called reserve for tax cuts. That is what the House \nhas already voted on.\n  We know that corporate subsidies are protected and tax loopholes are \nsaved. As a matter of fact, when we tried even to end the one that goes \nto the billionaire Benedict Arnolds who leave the country to avoid \ntaxes, we could not even get that one through.\n  I think another chart by the Democratic leader shown to us in this \ndebate tells the story. Working families pay for GOP tax cuts for \nwealthy. Here is the family. Seniors pay $6,400 more due to the changes \nin Medicare. Working families pay $1,400 more because of the changes in \nthe earned-income tax credit. Students pay $3,000 more over the \nlifetime of the loans because of the change in the cuts in student \nloans.\n  So that is who is paying for the tax cuts for the wealthy. Who? Those \nover $350,000 will get a $20,000 tax cut. That is in the contract, and \nthat has been voted by the Republican House.\n  Now, will there be tax cuts? We hear the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee saying there are not going to be tax cuts. ``I do not have \nthem in there. It is going to be awhile.''\n  I say to my friends that there are going to be tax cuts. Look at what \nthe majority leader says, Senator Dole. ``We are going to have tax \ncuts.'' It does not say ``maybe.'' It says, ``We are going to have tax \ncuts.'' He said it on May 9. He said it on March 11. ``I am certain \nthat Senate tax cuts will be as big in magnitude as the House,'' \nSenator Dole.\n  Senator Gramm:\n\n       I don't think a budget without a tax cut can pass.\n\n  And we know that is true because Senator Feingold just had an \namendment that would have taken that little honeypot and put it toward \ndeficit reduction, and it went down because Republicans voted against \nit.\n  So to UPI, Senator Gramm said in March:\n\n       Let me assure you that tax cuts are in order in the \n     Republican Senate. I am for them. They are part of our \n     Contract With America.\n\n  So that really shows you the facts. There is going to be a tax cut, \nand what this Senator from California is saying is, if there are going \nto be tax cuts, let us make sure they go to those earning under \n$100,000. I think it is very important.\n  Now, I want to say to my friends who are debating in their mind how \nthey are going to vote that in the committee, every single Republican \nexcept one, Senator Gramm, voted for the Boxer amendment that was a \nsense-of-the-Senate that said 90 percent of the tax cuts should go to \nthose earning $100,000 or less.\n  I ask for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator has 1 additional \nminute.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Is that the remainder of my time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes now. There were \n6. She has two additional minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  So every single Republican save one voted for the sense of the \nSenate. Now we are putting some teeth into that sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution. Now we are saying if the Republicans come up with a tax cut \nthat benefits the rich, it will take 60 votes to allow that tax cut to \nmove forward. This is a chance for my Republican friends to stand up \nand be counted for the middle class.\n  Now, in the course of this debate, Senator Gregg, Senator Brown, and \nSenator Domenici referenced my sense-of-the-Senate resolution that \npassed and is part of the budget resolution. They said this Senate is \non record; we believe that tax cuts should go to the middle class and \nthe middle class only.\n  Well, now is where the rubber meets the road. They have a chance to \ncast their vote on the side of those earning $100,000 or less. They \nhave a chance to say that those will be the only tax cuts that come \nbefore us.\n  I say to my colleagues, this is an opportunity to stand with the \nmiddle class, to stand with those hard-working Americans and to say to \nthose who earn over $350,000, over $250,000: Listen, you are great \nAmericans, but it is time for you to pay your fair share and it is time \nfor others to get some of the breaks that you have received.\n  I think it is important to close with a quote from Kevin Phillips, a \nRepublican, who said about this budget the following:\n\n       Spending on Government programs for Medicare and education \n     to home heating oil assistance is to be reduced in ways that \n     hurt the poor and middle class, while simultaneously taxes \n     are to be cut in ways that benefit the top 1 or 2 percent of \n     Americans.\n\n  Kevin Phillips closes his remarks, and he says about this budget, \nwith these tax cuts in it:\n\n       It deserves to be rejected with outrage.\n\n  Those are his words, a Republican who has looked at this budget. I \nthink that the Boxer amendment that clearly points out that a point of \norder will lie against any tax cut that does not benefit the middle \nclass is one which we should all agree to and vote for in a bipartisan \nway. I thank the Chair.\n  I yield my time back to the Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield to me?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have yielded my time back to the Senator from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. We are now going to go forward in an orderly fashion. I \nyield 2 minutes to the Senator from Louisiana. Following the Senator \nfrom Louisiana, I had committed to yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nMaryland, 2 minutes to the other Senator from Maryland, 2 minutes to \nthe Senator from New Mexico, 4 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, 2 minutes [[Page S7309]] to the Senator from Nevada, and \nthen we will go to a main amendment of the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, the Johnston amendment takes the $170 \nbillion fund which is reserved exclusively for tax cuts and permits \nsuch part of that as the Senate wishes to allocate to reduce the cuts \nin Medicare.\n  Under the Domenici proposal now before the Senate, there is $257 \nbillion cut from Medicare in the amounts shown in each of these years. \nWhat I would do is authorize that the $170 billion be restored in the \nmanner shown here so that net cuts in Medicare would amount to only \none-third of those proposed by Senator Domenici. There would be no cuts \nat all in the first 2 years and a minimal cut in the third year, and \noverall there would be less than a third the cuts which are presently \nproposed.\n  Mr. President, this amendment places in stark contrast the fact that \nMedicare cuts are not required in order to balance the budget. At least \ntwo-thirds of those cuts are not required to balance the budget. Two-\nthirds of the Medicare cuts proposed by Senator Domenici and now backed \nby the Senate are required to lower taxes, and to lower taxes on the \nwealthy, not required to balance the budget.\n  Mr. President, this does not require that we spend the money to \nreduce Medicare cuts, but it authorizes that. And I will tell my \ncolleagues that we have not the foggiest notion how we are going to \nachieve those Medicare cuts. We have not been told. We are told there \nmight be a commission appointed. What I am saying is the Senate ought \nto have the freedom to decide whether or not, after this budget \nresolution passes, and after we make that $170 billion in savings, we \nought to have the freedom to spend that $170 billion to reduce the \nimpact of Medicare cuts on our senior citizens.\n  All the public opinion polls say 80 percent of the people of this \ncountry are opposed to these deep Medicare cuts. Now, why does the \nSenate want to lock itself into reducing Medicare by that much when all \nwe have to do is give ourselves the freedom to take the tax cut for the \nwealthy and spend it to reduce the Medicare cuts?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Maryland is recognized for 2 minutes.\n\n\n                Retirement Benefits of Federal Employees\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, the amendment which I will be sending to \nthe desk at the proper time on behalf of myself, Senator Mikulski, \nSenator Warner, Senator Robb, and Senator Bingaman goes directly at a \nprovision that is in the budget resolution which is going to change the \ncalculation of retirement benefits for Federal employees from the \nemployee's highest 3-year average to the highest 5-year average.\n  This I think is a breach of the contract with the Federal employees. \nI think it is clearly unfair to them. The amendment honoring our \ncontract with Federal employees is paid for by closing the \nbillionaires' tax loophole that allows very wealthy people to escape \npaying taxes by renouncing their American citizenship.\n  Mr. President, I regret that Federal employees are constantly being \nused as whipping boys in the course of these budget deliberations. \nBehind the phrase Federal worker are individual men and women who every \nday go in and try to do a dedicated job and render a service to the \nAmerican people. They perform critical and important functions each and \nevery day with a great deal of dedication and a great deal of devotion, \nand in my judgment they are entitled to be treated with dignity and \nrespect.\n  Federal employees have already in the various deficit reduction \nprograms made very significant sacrifices. We are talking about men and \nwomen who have worked hard in service to their country. They have \nearned their benefits, and the rules ought not to be changed on them as \nthey are approaching retirement.\n  The existing provision, the 3-year provision, has been in effect for \nmore than a quarter of a century. People have calculated their \nretirement and their ability to meet their financial obligations based \non the current system, and we ought not to come along at the very end \nand change the rules on them, by shifting the basis on which their \nretirement is being calculated.\n  The truth is that Federal workers give dedicated service to their \ncountry and have earned their benefits. They made a choice to serve \ntheir country with an understanding of what that service entailed and \nwhat they could expect in return. To change the rules breaches the \ncontract with these employees. This is an issue of fairness and I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in support of this important amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski], is \nrecognized for 1 minute.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Sarbanes-Mikulski \namendment which strikes the provision which cuts Federal employee \nretirement benefits. The proposed change in the budget resolution would \nreduce lifetime retirement benefits for Federal employees between 2 and \n4 percent.\n  Now, that might not sound like that much, but for an average Federal \nworker, that could mean as much as a loss of $27,000 or more over a \nlifetime.\n  Mr. President, this is outrageous. We are changing the rules of the \ngame on Federal employees in the middle of their career or near the end \nof their career. I have Federal employees in my State, 130,000 of them. \nThey are the civilian work force that makes your Air Force One keep \nflying. They are the people at the National Institutes of Health that \nwe just extolled the virtues of when we supported NIH.\n  We talked a great deal about a wonderful physician by the name of Dr. \nRosenberg who has devoted his life to saving lives and curing cancer, \nand now this amendment will cut his Federal pension.\n It is both a reality and a metaphor for people who gave up careers \nthat would have paid more in the private sector but wanted to serve \ntheir country and they thought they would have an adequate health \ninsurance plan and a reasonable retirement plan.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I really ask the U.S. Senate to support the \nSarbanes-Mikulski amendment to ensure that promises made are promises \nkept and that we can continue to attract the kind of quality work force \nfor the Federal Government that we have had.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself 15 minutes in opposition \nto the Boxer amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me suggest to my good friend if we \nwould like to build a little bit of back and forth on this, I am more \nthan willing. Otherwise, we will use the hour in opposition to the \nBoxer amendment. I would very much like to know where we are.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could direct a question through you to \nthe manager of the bill, to the chairman. The Senator was off the \nfloor. There are a few of us here that have only a couple of minutes to \nexplain what our amendments would be, and it would probably be that we \nwill only have a couple minutes to maybe get these out of the way. \nWould that be possible?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The way it is now, you have an hour, the rest of an \nhour, and I have an hour. I would like to be accommodating.\n  Mr. EXON. I simply say to my friend, we want to be accommodating, \ntoo. We know the situation we are in. I have three additional Senators \nwhich I had assigned time, of which Senator Reid is one of them. There \nis 1 minute, 2 minutes, and 2 minutes. If we could accommodate those \nSenators who have been waiting--and I do not want to be unfair--for the \nnext 5 minutes, at least we would take care of the first round of the \nattempts that this Senator is trying to make to accommodate a whole \ngroup of Senators on this side who want to speak.\n  Could we complete the first round, in line with the question from the \nSenator from Nevada?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve my 15 \nminutes until the Senator's wishes as expressed are completed. Then I \nwill speak in opposition to the amendment. [[Page S7310]] \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for \n2 minutes.\n\n\n                   Civilian Research and Development\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I wanted to speak just briefly on an \namendment that I will be offering, along with Senators Lieberman, \nRockefeller, Biden, Hollings, Byrd, and Kerry from Massachusetts for a \nvote later on today.\n  The amendment attempts to restore some of the funds that are proposed \nto be eliminated in the civilian research and development accounts. \nThis amendment is attempting to retain as much as we can of the U.S. \nscience and technology enterprise which has brought such great results \nto our country and to the world.\n  This chart, I believe, sums it up very well. This shows what has \nhappened to Federal civilian research and development as a percentage \nof gross domestic product from 1960 until the end of this century if we \nwere to take the budget proposal that is now pending on the Senate \nfloor. As you can see, under the proposed GOP budget, there will be an \nadditional dramatic drop off in Federal support for civilian research \nand development. This includes the National Institutes of Health \nfunding which we earlier had a vote on, but it also includes many other \nareas of funding that the Federal Government supports in the research \nand development area.\n  You can see the last year we had a balanced budget in this country, \nabout 1968-1969, we were spending something in the range of 0.7 of our \ngross domestic product on civilian research and development. If this \nbudget is adopted, we will be spending less than 0.3 percent, less than \nhalf of that. We will be spending substantially less as a country than \nour competitors in other parts of the world.\n  I believe our amendment is important. I know Senators Lieberman and \nRockefeller intend to speak on it later, as well.\n  I have used my time and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                  Restoring Funding to National Parks\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, our national parks are in a state of \nembarrassing disrepair. As an example, water systems in one of our \nbusiest national park areas has been closed because of water not \nmeeting minimal standards. In short, it is not safe to drink.\n  We will be closing visitor centers, closing roads and trails, closing \npublic buildings, closing campgrounds; and law enforcement reductions \nwill occur, to name but a few.\n  My amendment, which I will offer, will seek $1 billion from the \nproposed tax cuts and instead give the money to partially restore, \nrenovate, and maintain our beautiful national heritage--that is our \nNational Park System. And that will only partially do it, because there \nis a $2 billion backlog. I will apply the $1 billion toward this.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to propose an amendment to the 1996 \nBudget Reconciliation Act that over the next 7 years would restore $1 \nbillion in funding to the National Park Service to alleviate its \ndevastating maintenance backlog. These fund would be drawn from the \n$170 billion reserve fund. With my amendment the money can only be used \nfor restoration, renovation, or maintenance of our national parks.\n  As Teddy Roosevelt, the man most responsible for the conservation \nmovement involving our public lands once said and I quote, ``Surely our \npeople do not understand even yet the rich heritage that is theirs. \nThere can be nothing in the world more beautiful than the Yosemite, the \ngroves of giant sequoias and redwoods, the canyon of Colorado, the \ncanyon of Yellowstone, the tetons; and our people should see to it that \nthey are preserved for their children and their children's children \nforever, with their majestic beauty all unmarred.'' These words spoken \nby Theodore Roosevelt in 1905 ring true today. But, the very \ngovernment, this Congress, that has been given the responsibility to \nprotect the crown jewels, better known as our national parks and \nrecreation areas, is abdicating that trust.\n  That is why I have come to the floor today to highlight a matter of \nnational concern. I am speaking of the outrageous and deplorable \nconditions of our national parks and recreation areas. The spending \ncuts proposed by this budget would reverse a longstanding trend of \ncommitted support by the citizens of this nation to the continued \npreservation and protection of its National Park System.\n  In today's environment of fiscal responsibility it is interesting \nthat some in this body and the leadership in the House are calling for \na tax cut for the wealthiest Americans. The tax breaks in the House-\npassed Contract With America tax bill will mostly benefit those \nfamilies with incomes over $100,000, the top twelve percent of income \ndistribution in this country. In essence these cuts are going to those \nwho can afford to travel anywhere for vacation.\n  However, millions of less affluent Americans in 1994 traveled to one \nor more of our national parks for their vacations and in many instances \nfound these facilities in some form of disrepair.\n  It defies common sense to think that Congress will approve a tax cut \nand then proceed to pass a budget that will decimate our national \nparks. In essence, funding for the National Park Service continues to \nbe inadequate to meet public use needs. With this budget, the current \nmaintenance backlog of over two billion dollars is simply going to grow \nand grow causing portions of the parks to become unavailable to the \npublic.\n  Rehabilitation of park structures, roads, trails, and utility systems \nis critical to the health and safety of visitors as well as employees. \nWith increased visitation to our national park system the proposed \ndecrease in funding is going to limit the Park Service's ability to \nserve the public.\n  There are many examples of the terrible conditions that have befallen \nour national treasures. In my own State of Nevada, the Lake Mead \nNational Recreation Area has an antiquated water treatment system. \nAfter State officials inspected the park's various water treatment \nfacilities they notified the park service that because of surface water \nfacility deficiencies, water supplied in areas of the park poses an \nacute risk to human health. The park then posted signs requesting \nvisitors to boil their water before drinking. For a park that received \n10 million visitors last year this is an outrage. As a result of the \ncurrent budget proposals it may take as long as 10 years before this \nproblem is corrected.\n  Here are some other examples that illustrate my concerns of what can \nbe expected if this budget becomes an reality. At Independence National \nHistorical Park there would be extensive building closures--total or \npartial closure of 11 of the 14 buildings open to the public resulting \nin elimination of 700,000 to 800,000 park visits.\n  At Yosemite National Park, operational oversight of concessions would \nbe reduced. Campfire programs and visitor centers hours would be \nreduced and some visitor centers would simply close. Preventative \nmaintenance on facilities would cease and cutbacks in snow removal \nwould delay road openings over mountain passes. Additionally, \ncampground seasons would be shortened and horse and backcountry patrols \nwould be reduced. Also, visitor protection responses would be reactive \nonly and limited to life threatening emergencies or criminal incidents \ninvolving threats to persons.\n  In Rocky Mountain National Park, the drastic reduction in seasonal \npark ranger staff would cut essential personnel available for search, \nrescue, law enforcement, and other emergency services. Three of five \nvisitor information centers would be closed. Not to mention that the \ntwo remaining centers and all campgrounds would be open only from \nMemorial Day through Labor Day.\n  At Redwood National Park, all nondiscretionary funds would be \neliminated forcing severe reduction of the temporary workforce, and \noperating supplies which would minimize maintenance on buildings, \ngrounds, trails and roads due to lack of supplies and materials and \nshortage of personnel to complete the work.\n  Mount Rainer National Park would also suffer in this current and \nfuture budget cycle. The park would see its interpretive programs \neliminated and [[Page S7311]] the inventory of endangered spotted owls \nand marbled murrilette would not be accomplished. This in turn would \nlead to the degradation of other natural resources such as fragile \nalpine meadows. Not to mention the scaling back of ranger patrols and \nreduced campground operating hours with reductions in maintenance and \ncleaning.\n  Mr. President, we must not stand by and allow our national parks to \nsimply rot. While in the short-term this budget proposal would save \nmoney, it would, over the long run lead to irreversible consequences, \nand irrevocable damage to the nation's heritage and legacy. I want to \nreemphasize the point that all National Park Service sites, will be \naffected, including the representative symbols of our democracy. For \nexample, the Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island, Washington Monument, \nIndependence Hall, Jefferson Memorial, Mount Rushmore, Fort McHenry, \nand Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historical Site.\n  The impact of the current budget proposals in years one and two force \nthe park service to curtail visiting hours at Independence National \nHistorical Park and many buildings would be entirely closed. The Statue \nof Liberty would be closed at least 1 day a week. In years three \nthrough five the impacts are expected to be more extreme. For example, \nwith staffing levels further reduced, extensive and prolonged park \nclosures could occur. Many of the park services resources would be \nsubjected to unacceptable levels of risk pertaining to loss through \ndeterioration, theft, fire, and other factors.\n  Mr. President, let us reflect for a moment on the responsibility that \nhas been delegated to the National Park Service. The Park Service is \ncomprised of 368 park units covering more than 80 million acres in 49 \nStates. The physical inventory alone consists of 15,000 buildings, \n5,200 housing units, 1,400 bridges, 8,000 miles of roads, 125 sewage \ntreatment plants, and 1,300 water systems.\n  Simply put, the insufficient funding levels proposed by this bill, in \naddition to new facilities and requirements associated with the \naddition of 12 new parks since 1991, will cause the Park Service to \ncontinue to fall behind in maintaining these structures, thereby \ncontributing to a mounting backlog of deficiencies. The net result will \nbe increased costs in the future and the subsequent loss of some \nirreplaceable and irretrievable resources.\n  Let me reemphasize the point that the effect of this action would \nresult in outcomes immediately visible to the public, such as, deferred \nmaintenance, closures of campgrounds, and closures of visitor \nfacilities. We must and can find other savings offsets in our quest to \nreduce the Federal deficit. These parks are one of the great legacy's \nwhich we will leave our children. Lets not leave them underdeveloped \nand rundown.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I would like to leave you more sound \nadvice from Theodore Roosevelt:\n\n       To waste, to destroy, our natural resources, to skin and \n     exhaust the land instead of using it so as to increase its \n     usefulness, will result in undermining in the days of our \n     children the very prosperity which we ought by right to hand \n     down to them amplified and developed.\n\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor 4 minutes.\n\n\n                  Presidential Campaign Finance System\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I call up an amendment at the desk on \nbehalf of myself, Senators Simon, Ford, Feingold, Bradley, Biden, and \nWellstone.\n  I ask unanimous consent that several letters and editorials \nsupporting the existing campaign finance law be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Statements in Support of Presidential Campaign Finance System\n\n       The bipartisan Commission on National Elections, headed by \n     Melvin Laird, Secretary of Defense in the Nixon \n     Administration, and Robert Strauss, former chair of the \n     Democratic National Committee, recognized the value and \n     success of the presidential campaign finance system. The \n     Commission concluded: ``Public financing of presidential \n     elections has clearly proven its worth in opening up the \n     process, reducing undue influence of individuals and groups, \n     and virtually ending corruption in presidential election \n     finance. This major reform of the 1970s should be \n     continued.''\n       Former Senator Paul Laxalt (R-NV), who chaired the 1976, \n     1980 and 1984 presidential campaigns for President Reagan, \n     also praised the presidential campaign finance system. In \n     discussing the campaign finance problems in Congress, Senator \n     Laxalt said, ``The problem is so bad we ought to start \n     thinking about federal financing'' of House and Senate \n     campaigns. ``It was anathema to me * * * but in my experience \n     with the [Reagan] presidential campaigns, it worked, and it \n     was like a breath of fresh air.''\n       The New York Times calls the presidential campaign finance \n     system ``the best existing counterweight to the dominance of \n     check-writing special interests in national politics. * * * \n     This public financing has worked remarkably well to minimize \n     the financial advantage of the party in power and reduce \n     candidates' dependence on wealthy favor-seekers.''\n       The Washington Post says the presidential campaign finance \n     system is ``hugely important to efforts aimed at limiting the \n     impact of campaign fund-raising on the presidency.'' It notes \n     that the system ``has actually worked.''\n       According to The Wall Street Journal's columnist Gerald F. \n     Seib, ``Whatever else may be said about presidential \n     campaigns of the last two decades, they have been largely \n     free of charges of serious financial corruption. And the \n     elections themselves have been fair and competitive. * * * \n     [T]his is one part of the system that doesn't seem broke.''\n       Seib wrote of the effort to repeal the presidential \n     campaign finance system, ``And ultimately, this change would \n     undercut what is supposed to be the GOP's very purpose, which \n     is to balance the budget. The budget is hardly going to be \n     balanced with the minuscule savings achieved by eliminating \n     the presidential campaign fund. * * * It is going to be \n     balanced by getting the snouts of special interests out of \n     the public trough. But special interest snouts won't be kept \n     out after they are invited deeper into American political \n     campaigns.''\n     \n                                                                    ____\n             [From the Atlanta Constitution, May 22, 1995]\n\n                     Presidency to Highest Bidder?\n\n       Tucked away in the 90-page deficit-reduction blueprint of \n     Senate budget Chairman Peter Domenici (R-N.M.) are two lines \n     that would make only a slight dent in federal expenses--less \n     than $50 million a year--but could drastically and \n     perniciously alter the way America picks its presidents.\n       The two lines call for the termination, starting in the \n     year 2000, of the presidential campaign fund, which is \n     financed by taxpayers' check-offs on their income tax returns \n     and then made available every four years to qualifying \n     candidates for president during both primary and general \n     election campaigns.\n       So what's So wrong with this particular program \n     elimination? Plenty.\n       Public financing of bids for the White House was a reform \n     born in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal. Its whole \n     purpose was to avoid a repeat of the corrupting excesses of \n     the 1972 Nixon campaign, which amassed millions of dollars \n     more than it knew what to do with, legally.\n       Considering the climate of cynicism about politics these \n     days, the justification for public campaign financing may \n     sound hopelessly idealistic, but it is fundamentally sound: \n     The presidency ought not be up for auction. No contestant for \n     the office ought to have a wildly disproportionate funding \n     advantage. Serious candidates ought to have enough money to \n     get their messages across throughout the country without \n     becoming beholden to powerful individual donors or interest \n     groups.\n       The budget resolution may have Domenici's name on it, but \n     the fingerprints of Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) are all over \n     the two lines in question. He is an unabashed opponent of \n     public financing and delights in misrepresenting it as ``food \n     stamps for politicians.'' He believes that since the \n     Republicans, who currently are taking a king's ransom in \n     special-interest contributions, are in a position to kill \n     public financing, they should go for it. So there.\n       Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole is hardly less enthusiastic \n     about sinking the program--for the campaign in 2000, that is. \n     Whatever principles he may have on the matter don't apply to \n     his immediate situation. He'll happily accept whatever \n     millions be qualified for to pay for his 1996 candidacy.\n       Democrats, who blew their change to reform campaign \n     financing rules for Congress in the last session, promise to \n     do what they can to save the presidential campaign system, \n     but they don't appear to have the numbers. A veto may be the \n     only recourse, and since the regression the McConnell \n     champions is so profound, President Clinton should be \n     readying one.\n       Public financing, it must be conceded, is not a widely \n     popular notion. Only about 15 percent of taxpayers dedicate \n     $3 each of their taxes for the presidential campaign fund. \n     What that shows is that too few Americans have considered the \n     alternative--that absent public financing, our country may \n     get the best president that money with strings attached ban \n     buy.\n       America should strive to do better.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n[[Page S7312]]\n\n               [From the Kennebec Journal, May 18, 1995]\n\n                      Money, Money, and More Money\n\n       As congressional Republicans work to dismantle the one \n     significant campaign finance reform measure of our time--\n     public funding of presidential races--the influence of \n     private money upon the making of public policy continues to \n     be a national disgrace.\n       According to former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, \n     who fought hard if unsuccessfully to reform the system, big \n     money contributions may not actually buy votes but they do \n     buy access to members of Congress.\n       ``I think it obviously creates the appearance of conflict \n     and casts doubt on the independence of judgment,'' says \n     Mitchell in a new book on the subject produced by the Center \n     for Responsive Politics. ``I think it reduces respect for the \n     institution and the product of its work.''\n       However, it is far more than simply a public relations \n     problem. Big money is a corrupting influence in fact as well \n     as in appearance, even if it only gives the contributor \n     readier access to a member of Congress than competitors or \n     ordinary citizens may enjoy.\n       It is no doubt true, as Mitchell asserts, that most special \n     interest groups contribute to politicians who share their \n     views rather than attempt to sway those who do not. Even so, \n     the big contribution in that case is used to bind goodwill \n     and ensure a sense of mutual loyalty.\n       Clearly the giving of money in large amounts to political \n     candidates is viewed by donors as more than simply a \n     friendly, civic-minded gesture. And it can be used as a stick \n     as much as a carrot.\n       Think back a year or so when a Maine labor leader \n     threatened to cut off campaign contributions to then-1st \n     District Rep. Thomas Andrews if he failed to vote against the \n     North American Free Trade Agreement. Call it a form of \n     reverse bribery. Andrews ultimately voted against NAFTA, but \n     swore off labor PAC contributions. It proved costly; he \n     unexpectedly ended up running for Mitchell's Senate seat and \n     raised far less money than his opponent, Sen. Olympia Snowe.\n       Most candidates prudently avoid such grand gestures, and, \n     as the cost of election campaigns continues to escalate, so \n     does the candidate's dependence upon special interest money. \n     Last year, 35 to 40 percent of the campaign funding for \n     winners in U.S. Senate and House races came from political \n     action committees. Overall spending in Senate races was up a \n     whopping 20 percent.\n       The system cries out for reform, not retrenchment. For \n     years, the Republican minority in Congress has insisted it \n     favors effective reform while rejecting virtually every \n     Democratic proposal to cut the flow of cash from special \n     interests to policy makers. Now that the GOP is in control, \n     we know what it meant by reform: lowering the flood gates.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                 [From the Boston Globe, May 17, 1995]\n\n                    What About the Fairness Deficit?\n\n       The changes being pushed by Republican budget makers are so \n     grave they understandably dominate public attention, but they \n     are crowding out some senseless proposals that also deserve \n     the spotlight.\n       A prime example is the Senate Budget Committee proposal to \n     eliminate the Presidential Campaign Fund after the 1996 \n     election.\n       Created post-Watergate, the fund is the single greatest \n     political reform of modern US history. It took the ``For \n     Sale'' sign off the White House, moving moneyed special \n     interests out of the driver's seat and into the spectator \n     stands with the rest of us. Candidates have been funded in \n     the primaries by small individual givers and by federal \n     matching funds, and in the general election by the \n     presidential fund alone. Bill Clinton and George Bush each \n     received $55 million in 1992.\n       It has worked. The benefits of the fund have been watered \n     down in recent years by rulings allowing the parties to \n     collect huge sums of ``soft money'' contributions that \n     support campaigns indirectly. The Federal Elections \n     Commission needs to close this gaping loophole. But far from \n     eliminating the fund, it should be expanded to include \n     candidates for Congress so the nation's legislators would not \n     have to continue selling themselves to special interests to \n     raise the requisite thousands of dollars a day. The only \n     other problem with the system--uncertain cash flow--was \n     addressed this year when the voluntary tax checkoff to \n     finance it was raised from $1 to $3.\n       Politicians can debate the exact message from voters last \n     November, but the people surely wanted cleaner government, \n     not corruption.\n       The Budget Committee chairman, Sen. Pete Domenici, \n     characterized his proposal as ``doing something right for the \n     future of our country and for our children.'' He was speaking \n     of deficit reduction, though eliminating the campaign fund \n     would save only $45 million. In attempting to restore balance \n     to the budget, Domenici's proposal could return venality to \n     the Oval Office.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                 [From The Buffalo News, May 15, 1995]\n\n    Keep Presidential Checkoff--Ending It Would Strengthen Special \n                               Interests\n       Hidden among proposals that have aroused loud immediate \n     objections is an ominous Senate Budget Committee plan. It \n     would shift the presidential selection process away from \n     average Americans and place it even more in the hands of big-\n     money special interests.\n       That's what will happen if Congress wipes out the two-\n     decade-old system that allows for partial public funding of \n     presidential elections by having taxpayers check a box on \n     their income tax returns.\n       Approving the checkoff--currently $3--has absolutely no \n     impact on the size of a taxpayer's refund or the amount of \n     taxes owed. When taxpayers check the box, as all should, it \n     simply means that the contributions will be used to help \n     finance the presidential selection process.\n       That is one of the best investments taxpayers can make in \n     good government. It means candidates will be more beholden to \n     average Americans and less beholden to special-interest \n     groups for their money. In fact, this Watergate-era reform, \n     first employed in the 1976 campaign when Jimmy Carter \n     challenged President Gerald Ford, is the antidote to the \n     poison of special-interest funding that has left candidates \n     with a taint and the public with a bad taste in its mouth.\n       Before allowing Congress to end this reform, the public \n     should ask a simple question: Without this public funding, \n     where else will candidates turn for money?\n       The $45 million per year raised through the checkooff is a \n     minuscule amount in a $1.5 trillion budget. Yet, while \n     limiting the impact of lobbyists, it also puts sensible \n     limits on campaign spending and levels the playing field \n     among candidates. That helps elevate ideas over fund-raising \n     ability as the determining factor in campaigns.\n       Senate Republicans are hypocritical and less than \n     forthright in trying to end all of that by slipping this \n     provision through amid the turmoil surrounding the rest of \n     their budget proposals.\n       The hypocrisy can be seen in the fact that the proposal \n     would end the checkoff system after the 1996 election cycle. \n     That would mean current GOP senators eyeing the White House--\n     among them, Majority Leader Bob Dole and Texan Phil Gramm--\n     would still benefit next year.\n       But the real benefit of the checkoff goes to the public. \n     That's why, if a revision this significant is to be examined, \n     it should be done separately so that the proposal can be \n     judged on its own merits.\n       Once that happens, and Americans really understand what's \n     at stake, it is unlikely that they will choose to forsake a \n     system of such demonstrated worth. Over two decades, the \n     checkoff system has shrunk the influence of big-money \n     interests, helped clean up the process of choosing American \n     presidents and returned that process closer to the American \n     people.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, May 16, 1995]\n\n                   A Sneaky Blow at Campaign Finance\n\n       Senate Republicans are proposing to eliminate the best \n     existing counterweight to the dominance of check-writing \n     special interests in national politics. The budget blueprint \n     unveiled last week by Pete Domenici, chairman of the Senate \n     Budget Committee, includes a call to abolish the public \n     campaign financing system for Presidential candidates.\n       This 20-year-old system provides matching funds for \n     candidates during the primaries and, for the general \n     election, identical grants to both major party candidates. \n     The system is financed by allowing taxpayers to indicate on \n     their income tax returns whether they want $3 of the tax they \n     owe to be used for the campaign fund. This public financing \n     has worked remarkably well to minimize the financial \n     advantage of the party in power and reduce candidates' \n     dependence on wealthy favor-seekers.\n       The proposal to end public financing is the brainchild of \n     Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who also played a big \n     role last year in killing a Democratic reform measure that \n     would have repaired damaging loopholes in the Presidential \n     system while reducing the influence of big money in \n     Congressional races as well.\n       Under the G.O.P. budget proposal, the Presidential public \n     financing system would not end until after the 1996 election. \n     That would allow the Republicans to continue using public \n     financing in their quest to drive out the incumbent \n     Democratic President, but then block public financing after \n     they hope to have recaptured the White House.\n       Abolishing public financing for Presidential campaigns \n     would save only about $45 million a year, while destroying a \n     worthwhile effort to curb the amount of special-interest \n     money in national politics. House and Senate Republicans also \n     want to impose a crippling funding cut on the Federal \n     Election Commission, the agency charged with enforcing \n     campaign finance laws. It begins to look like a G.O.P. war on \n     cleaner politics.\n                                                                    ____\n\n             [From the Philadelphia Inquirer, May 17, 1995]\n\n     Wrong-Way Pete--Domenici Bugles Retreat on Campaign Financing.\n\n       ``Declare victory and retreat.'' That was the tart \n     suggestion of a senator years ago on how to salvage the \n     fiasco that was Vietnam.\n       Now, another senator, Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete \n     Domenici of New Mexico, has got it into his head to declare \n     defeat and propose retreat in an area where there's actually \n     been a major victory: public financing of presidential \n     campaigns.\n       This post-Watergate reform has insulted presidential \n     campaigns from the corrupting influence of special-interest \n     money. For some strange reason, the budget proposal \n     [[Page S7313]] made by Mr. Domenici last week would end it.\n       Of all the Republican ideas for balancing the budget, this \n     may be the worst. By giving special interests carte blanche \n     to start subsidizing presidential candidates again, Mr. \n     Domenici would drop White House wannabes back into the pigsty \n     of special-interest financing where Congress still wallows.\n       Not only is the system that pays for presidential races not \n     broken, it works quite well. If you want to put $3 of your \n     tax bill toward presidential campaigns, you check that \n     option. If you feel that public financing is sinister or \n     socialistic, you don't.\n       In the primary season, the system's matching money helps \n     underdogs get their ideas across to the voters. In the \n     general election, it helps ensure a fair battle.\n       The elimination of public financing may be just a sop to \n     Sen. Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), the Senate's leading \n     obstructionist on campaign-financing reform; maybe Senate \n     leaders will quietly drop the idea later on.\n       Instead of scrapping the checkoff, Republicans ought to be \n     acting to get special-interest money out of congressional \n     campaigns. Of course, their reforming zeal might be muted \n     because the majority of that money is now flowing to them.\n       It's sad to see the Senate even toying with this ill-\n     advised retreat on campaign financing. And it is a discredit \n     to Mr. Domenici's otherwise bold budget-balancing plan.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n       [From the Rutland Herald & the Times Argus, May 21, 1995]\n\n                        GOP And Campaign Finance\n\n       Over the next few weeks almost every budget cut that the \n     Republicans in Congress have proposed will be opposed by some \n     special interest group or other. But there is one intended \n     cut that would harm the very fabric of our democratic \n     process--by changing the way we elect our presidents.\n       The GOP Senate budget resolution would abolish the \n     presidential campaign financing system, beginning in 1996. \n     Eliminating public financing of presidential campaigns would \n     save from $100 million and $300 million by 2002, the date the \n     Republicans have targeted for balancing the federal budget.\n       The GOP wants to abolish the public campaign finance law to \n     help provide about $350 billion in tax cuts that would \n     benefit many of their favorite corporate benefactors. It's \n     not hard to imagine the generosity of such companies when it \n     comes time to replenish the campaign coffers of worthy \n     Republicans.\n       Why do we use tax dollars to fund presidential campaigns? \n     The practice began in 1974, after Watergate, which showed the \n     nation how dramatically money can change the political \n     equation. Since the cost of national campaigns has risen so \n     drastically, politicians find they must budget a larger and \n     larger share of their time to fund-raising--and currying \n     favor with potential contributors.\n       Shouldn't private financing of elections benefit Democrats \n     as well as Republicans? In the past, many wealthy \n     contributors realized that since Democrats controlled \n     Congress, any Democratic candidate might become a powerful \n     committee chairman. So the moneyed interests have \n     traditionally covered their bases by contributing to both \n     candidates in many elections.\n       But now that the Republicans control both houses of \n     Congress, a fundraising gap favorable to the GOP is likely to \n     grow even wider, as the party of big business calls in its \n     chips for the constituent service it's currently performing. \n     The Republicans already have claimed an edge in fund-raising \n     for 1996 campaigns.\n       The Republicans may be able to brush aside the few limits \n     that now exist on campaign spending. And the Democrats have \n     only themselves to blame for not passing more comprehensive \n     campaign finance reform while they had control of Congress. \n     If the GOP gets its way, the Democrats will be sorely \n     punished for their own complacency.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n            [From the San Francisco Chronicle, May 17, 1995]\n\n                      Unreforming Campaign Finance\n\n       When the Republicans took over Congress, they vowed to \n     clean up Washington and give government back to the people. \n     So what are they doing with this hypocritical proposal in the \n     Senate budget plan to eliminate the presidential campaign-\n     finance tax checkoff?\n       The Watergate-inspired public-campaign-financing law has \n     somewhat limited the corrupting influence of special \n     interests on presidential elections by providing each \n     candidate in the general election with around $60 million in \n     voluntarily contributed tax dollars, about the same amount \n     Richard Nixon spent in 1970. The use of public funds, under a \n     landmark Supreme Court ruling, allows an overall spending cap \n     to be imposed. Without it, a run for the presidency would \n     cost an estimated $200 million.\n       When campaigns cost $200 million we all lose, because \n     special interests will be free to flood the presidential \n     election process with money. The fragile integrity of the \n     democratic process will be the first victim.\n       Instead of reversing public financing, the Republicans \n     should join with Democrats in finding ways to bring equally \n     effective reform to congressional elections.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                [From The Washington Post, May 11, 1995]\n\n                        A Bad Idea, Well-Hidden\n\n       Tucked away in the middle of Senate Budget Chairman Pete \n     Domenici's 97-page budget blueprint are two lines describing \n     a proposal with a minuscule impact on federal spending but \n     enormous meaning for the nation's political process. Mr. \n     Domenici, following a suggestion by Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-\n     Ky.), proposes the elimination of public financing for \n     presidential campaigns after the 1996 election.\n       This is not only a terrible idea; it also has no place in \n     the budget debate. A change this large in the electoral \n     system should be debated on its own, independent of the great \n     confrontation that is about to occur on the deficit. The \n     amount of money involved is trivial in a budgetary sense--\n     roughly $45 million a year in a $1.5 trillion budget--but \n     hugely important to efforts aimed at limiting the impact of \n     campaign fund-raising on the presidency.\n       Public financing of presidential campaigns has actually \n     worked. It was instituted after the Watergate scandal \n     revealed all sorts of unsavory fund-raising shenanigans in \n     the 1972 campaign. The idea is simple: The presidency ought \n     not be put up for bid, the major party candidates ought to \n     compete on a level playing field, and the party in power \n     should not enjoy a prohibitive financial advantage. Existing \n     law provides for a Presidential Election Campaign Fund that \n     is financed through a voluntary $1 checkoff on income tax \n     returns. For the general election, each major-party candidate \n     draws the same amount from the fund--George Bush and Bill \n     Clinton got $55.2 million each in 1992. The law also includes \n     provisions for future public financing for any third party \n     that makes a substantial electoral showing (as did the \n     independent movements of John Anderson in 1980 and Ross Perot \n     in 1992). And it provides for a system of matching funds in \n     the primaries, whereby candidates who raise a certain amount \n     in private contributions qualify for a share of the federal \n     funds. The formula puts a premium on smaller contributions, \n     so candidates who are serious but without huge interest group \n     backing have a chance to make their case.\n       There are problems with the system that need to be \n     addressed. The campaign fund has been running low, and the \n     checkoff amount needs to be increased. But at a time when \n     Congress's emphasis should be on finding ways to reduce the \n     impact of money on politics, this proposal moves in entirely \n     the wrong direction. It is also interesting that the budget \n     proposal would leave the current system in place long enough \n     to allow Republican presidential candidates (such as Sens. \n     Dole, Gramm, Specter and Lugar) to take advantage of it while \n     the GOP is out of the White House, and only abolish it after \n     the next election.\n       If Mr. McConnell wants an open debate on the merits of the \n     public financing system, he can encourage one. But a change \n     this large should not happen covertly as part of the budget \n     process.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                  [From the Valley News, May 17, 1995]\n\n                           Cash For Campaigns\n\n       Hold your tears for those Republicans who complain that \n     special-interest groups are preparing to lay waste to the \n     balanced-budget proposals they're now championing. If \n     special-interest groups exercise undue influence over the \n     federal government, why are Republicans proposing that their \n     influence be expanded?\n       That is exactly what would happen if the budget plan \n     proposed last week by Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., is passed \n     intact. It contains a provision that calls for elimination of \n     public financing of presidential campaigns. That item would \n     save the federal government $45 million a year but would \n     exact a much greater cost in the damage it would do to the \n     national political system.\n       Few would argue that presidential politics are squeaky \n     clean. But they are far better than they were before the \n     Watergate scandal prompted Congress to reform the system.\n       Presidential candidates still must raise bucketfuls of \n     money to be considered serious contenders. But the prospect \n     of matching federal contributions encourages primary \n     candidates to concentrate their fund-raising on contributions \n     that qualify them for federal funds--relatively small \n     donations from individuals. During the primary season, \n     candidates who accept public financing agree to abide by \n     spending limits established for each state. In the general \n     election, each major party nominee draws an equal amount from \n     the campaign fund (the 1992 candidates each received $55.2 \n     million)--placing them on equal footing and reducing the need \n     for candidates to go hat in hand to potential contributors.\n       Problems remain. Both parties continue to abuse so-called \n     soft-money contributions, donations that are made to parties \n     and spent for generic campaign purposes rather than directly \n     for candidates. But the system is far better than the one \n     that existed before 1973, when candidates accepted lots of \n     cash from deep-pocketed donors, many with a direct interest \n     in federal policy.\n       If public financing is abolished, the corrupting cancer \n     that has severely undermined the integrity of Congress will \n     spread to the White House and similarly compromise its \n     integrity. All those things we have come to know and detest \n     about the influence of money on federal legislators will \n     afflict the White House--political action committees, nonstop \n     fund-raising, the amassing of campaign war chests.\n       Few Americans are enthusiastic about proposals to pay for \n     campaigns with taxpayers' money. The notion of bankrolling \n     some of the behavior that passes for campaigning \n     [[Page S7314]] these days is enough to make the most earnest \n     goo-goo blanch. But it is strictly a defensive strategy: The \n     public picks up the tab to ensure that no one else does--and \n     that no one lays a greater claim on the loyalty of the people \n     elected to conduct the public's business. Public campaign \n     financing needs to be expanded, not rolled back.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                     May 23, 1995.\n       Dear Senator ------ ------:\n       We strongly oppose the Senate Budget Committee's 1996 \n     budget recommendation to abolish the presidential campaign \n     finance system.

Maintaining \n     the reform costs .003 percent of the budget.\n       Watergate dramatized the three-step relationship between \n     large political contributions, the outcome of elections, and \n     the governmental decisions of those who win. We should never \n     forget the acceptance of a $2-million pledge from the Milk \n     Producers Association to the Nixon Administration, which \n     concurrently granted an increase in the support price of \n     milk; the approval of American Airlines' route applications \n     shortly after a large corporate contribution to the party in \n     power; or the settlement of antitrust litigation against ITT \n     Corporation, shortly after an ITT subsidiary agreed to \n     underwrite a large proportion of the cost of the Republican \n     National Convention.\n       Spurred by this corruption, Congress in 1974 enacted the \n     presidential campaign finance system as a vital means to \n     restore public confidence in government. Through this system, \n     small individual contributions are matched by public funds in \n     the primary elections. The major party candidates receive a \n     grant of public funds with which to conduct their general \n     election campaigns. Importantly, spending limits are imposed \n     in both the primary and general elections.\n       The system has worked. Presidential elections were largely \n     cleansed of the corrupting influence of special-interest \n     money. Spending in presidential campaigns was brought under \n     control. Candidates in the general election were freed from \n     the burdens of fundraising. And presidential elections, \n     unlike congressional campaigns, became more competitive. \n     Exploitation of a soft money loophole has reduced the gains. \n     But the system is fundamentally sound. The remedy is to close \n     the soft money loophole.\n       We are told that political candidates should not campaign \n     with taxpayers' money. The money goes to protect ourselves by \n     keeping the system honest. The alternative is for candidates \n     to campaign with special-interest money to be repaid with \n     much larger government favors after the election--in short, \n     to go back to the days of Watergate.\n       I urge the Congress not to repeal the centerpiece of the \n     Watergate reforms. The presidential campaign finance system \n     must be preserved.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                      [Common Cause, May 23, 1995]\n\n            Statement of Common Cause President Ann McBride\n\n       We are very pleased to join today with Senators John Kerry \n     (D-MA) and Bill Bradley (D-NJ), and with the League of Women \n     Voters and Public Citizen, to launch an all-out effort to \n     preserve the presidential campaign finance system.\n       Today we face a deadly serious attempt in the Senate to \n     destroy the most important political reform in nearly a \n     century.\n       By burying a simple two-line provision to kill the \n     presidential campaign finance system deep in their proposed \n     budget, the Senate Republican leadership has conducted a \n     stealth attack on our democracy--an attack that would turn \n     back the clock two decades to the dark days of Watergate and \n     its influence money scandals, a time when the integrity of \n     the Presidency hit rock bottom.\n       The stakes in the outcome are enormous. If this attack were \n     to prevail, the winners would be Washington lobbyists and \n     monied special interests. The losers would be the average \n     taxpayers.\n       That's why Common Cause urges Congress to eliminate this \n     provision from the Senate budget proposal and to act to save \n     the presidential campaign finance system.\n       A vote to kill the presidential campaign finance system is \n     a vote for corruption and a return to the campaign finance \n     scandals of Watergate.\n       The responsibility to save the presidential campaign \n     finance system lies not only with Congress, but with \n     President Clinton as well.\n       If President Clinton is serious about preserving the \n     presidential campaign finance system, he must make clear that \n     he will veto any legislation that includes a provision to \n     repeal the system.\n       Killing the presidential campaign finance system would do \n     more than eliminate the public funds available to \n     presidential candidates. Killing the presidential campaign \n     finance system completely repeals campaign spending limits in \n     presidential races. The result would be a campaign \n     fundraising--and campaign spending--free-for-all, and a ``For \n     Sale'' sign back on the White House.\n       The public financing system has worked. Spending has been \n     limited. Richard Nixon's 1972 reelection campaign raised and \n     spent $60 million--the equivalent of more than $200 million \n     today. That's less than both major party candidates combined \n     spent in the 1992 campaigns.\n       Elections have been competitive. Under this system, four \n     incumbents have sought reelection--three challengers have \n     won. And special-interest contributions have been replaced by \n     dollars designated by millions of taxpayers.\n       As The Washington Post has noted, ``Public financing of \n     presidential campaigns has actually worked. . . . The idea is \n     simple: The presidency ought not be put up for bid, the major \n     party candidates ought to compete on a level playing field, \n     and the party in power should not enjoy a prohibitive \n     financial advantage.''\n       Instead of destroying a system that has worked, and worked \n     well, for two decades, the Senate should instead be shutting \n     down the soft money system that has emerged in recent years.\n       This issue is not a budget issue. The presidential public \n     financing system is not a simple piece of a budget puzzle \n     that can be turned off and on at will. In fact, from a \n     federal budgetary perspective, the $45-million program is a \n     small amount. Fiscal responsibility comes from a Congress \n     that will stop the financial drain that special interests \n     impose on the federal budget through access-seeking campaign \n     contributions. Ending the presidential campaign finance \n     system simply will open the budget to even more big-money \n     investments from special interests.\n       This issue should not be a partisan issue. The presidential \n     public financing system was passed with bipartisan support \n     and signed into law by President Gerald Ford. All but one \n     major party candidate have voluntarily chosen to use public \n     funds to wage their campaigns. In the five presidential races \n     conducted under this new system, the Republican candidate has \n     won three times, the Democrat twice.\n       This issue is a matter of integrity.\n       More than 20 years ago, Common Cause members pressed their \n     Members of Congress to create a campaign finance system that \n     would restore the integrity of a presidency that had been \n     devastated by the scandals of Watergate. Congress did.\n       Today, Common Cause, along with a broad coalition of other \n     organizations, is launching a nationwide campaign to protect \n     the presidential campaign finance system.\n       Common Cause members and other concerned citizens will work \n     just as tirelessly now to ensure that the presidential \n     campaign finance system is not destroyed.\n\n\n[[Page S7315]]\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, there is in this budget an unfortunate \neffort to try to take away the current system of a----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend, while I ask the \nclerk to report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1135.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to consideration of the \namendment at this time?\n  Mr. EXON. The Senator was not recognized to offer an amendment. I \nwant to make that clear to the Senator. You can reserve the right to \noffer an amendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask unanimous consent----\n  Mr. EXON. Have you done that?\n  Mr. KERRY. I did ask unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. EXON. I object.\n  The Senator from Nebraska yielded to the Senator from Massachusetts \nwith certain instructions and understandings that the Senator from \nNebraska is going to insist upon. Therefore, I yielded to the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts not to offer an amendment, but to make such remarks \nas he sees fit.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I certainly apologize. I had no idea. I \nthought the procedure was to call the amendment up. There was no \nintention to try to go outside of the Senator's desires.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the past exchange not come out of this \nSenator's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized for 4 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair, and I thank the distinguished managers.\n  Mr. President, there is in this budget resolution an effort to do \naway with the Presidential checkoff finance system. I would like to \nshare with my colleagues what Archibald Cox, the Watergate prosecutor, \nsaid with respect to this particular effort.\n\n       Watergate dramatized the three-step relationship between \n     large political contributions, the outcome of elections, and \n     the governmental decisions of those who win. We should never \n     forget the acceptance of a $2 million pledge from the Milk \n     Producers Association to the Nixon administration which \n     concurrently granted an increase in the support price of \n     milk; the approval of American Airlines' route application \n     shortly after a large corporate contribution to the party in \n     power; or the settlement of antitrust litigation against ITT \n     Corp. shortly after an ITT subsidiary agreed to underwrite a \n     large portion of the cost of the Republican National \n     Convention.\n\n  Mr. President, this campaign system has worked. Some 63 primary \ncandidates since 1976 have used the checkoff fund. The checkoff fund \ndemocratizes the Presidential races of this country. It distances \nPresidential candidates from the fundraising process. It liberates our \nentire system from the influence of big money, as Watergate prosecutor \nArchibald Cox said.\n  In 1972, when Richard Nixon ran for President, he spent $60 million \nin that race, the equivalent of $200 million today. That is more than \nPresident Bush and Bill Clinton spent together in 1992. If this \namendment were to fail, if we proceed on the assumption that that \ncampaign system will be taken away, all voluntary limits on campaign \nspending in Presidential races are gone. No voluntary limit will \nremain, and it is only that volunteerism in the system that keeps \naccord with the Constitution on Buckley versus Valeo that allows us to \nhave a limit in Presidential races.\n  So we will have gone back to the system of 1972 when there was \nunlimited funding from sources in Presidential races. I cannot imagine \nanything that runs more contrary to the vote of 1994 and to the \ngrassroots statement of Americans in the 1994 election. They do not \nwant this country going back to big money, large corporate interests. \nThey want people liberated to participate. In fact, Mr. President, more \npeople participate through the checkoff than contribute voluntarily to \ncampaigns in this country. One out of seven Americans participate in \nthe checkoff, whereas only one in 22 Americans contributed to campaigns \nin 1994. The checkoff could, in fact, be stronger than it is today. \nBut, everybody should understand, no American is coerced to do this. It \nis a voluntary system where $3 from an individual has as much impact as \ntens of thousands of dollars from the rich or from corporate interests.\n  Mr. President, it would be an enormous setback in our efforts to gain \ncontrol of our political process if, now, we choose to go backward.\n  Some people say, ``Well, we're not controlling all the money in the \nsystem; you still have soft money and we should be closing that \nloophole.'' The solution is not to take the hard money restriction in \nthe voluntary system and make it like soft money. The solution is to \nmake the soft money like the hard money or outlaw it altogether, Mr. \nPresident.\n  So it is my hope that colleagues who have supported this in the past \nwill not now go counter to the very grassroots effort that is \nsupposedly being represented on the floor. This system has worked. It \ncosts $45 million on the year, Mr. President, but to lose it would be \ntens of millions of dollars in campaign contributions. I hope we will \nsupport the system.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, the budget resolution includes a provision \nthat will have a far reaching consequence for this Nation. It assumes \nelimination of the program that provides for spending limits and public \nfunding in Presidential election campaigns. This provision was enacted \nwith bipartisan support to address the campaign finance abuses of \nWatergate.\n  This is voluntary program. The American taxpayer voluntarily funds it \nand candidates voluntarily accept funds from it. It is the only Federal \nprogram that the American public directly votes to fund each year. And \nas long as the American taxpayer votes for campaign spending limits, \nthen we should not eliminate it.\n  What is interesting to this Senator, is that the Republican budget \nresolution does not affect the 1996 Presidential election cycle. It \nwould allow candidates to continue to take taxpayer money to fund their \nprimary campaigns next year. That means up to approximately $15 million \nin taxpayer dollars to each Republican and Democratic primary \ncandidate, with a potential $62 million more to the nominee in the \ngeneral election.\n  Perhaps a different amendment would have been to eliminate this \nprogram immediately. That would give our distinguished Republican \ncolleagues here in the Senate who have announced their candidacy for \nPresident an opportunity to vote to give back their potential $77 \nmillion in taxpayer funds to the Treasury and the American taxpayer in \norder to help eliminate the deficit. Let me respectfully suggest that \nit seems a little self-serving to take the money next year but deny it \nto future candidates.\n  American taxpayers support this program and vote on how much to fund \nit each year. It is the only Federal program which serves to limit the \nmoney chase to the White House. Until we come up with a better system, \nI urge my colleagues to leave this program in place and support the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). The Senator's time. has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I really want to use a little bit of my \ntime. I am on my 15 minutes in opposition, but I just want to talk to \nthe Senate a minute.\n  Frankly, to my knowledge, there is only one law that controls the \nU.S. Senate in terms of debates and amendments and the like, and it is \nthe Budget Act, which includes impoundments.\n  Essentially, it says in law, it sets down the detailed rules of how \nyou proceed on a budget resolution and how you proceed on a \nreconciliation bill. It is not my rule. It is not Senator Exon's rule. \nIt says 50 hours equally divided.\n  Frankly, maybe we will ask so the Record will be clear, how much time \nremains now on the entire budget resolution, under 50 hours that we are \nallocated by law?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Approximately 1 hour 20 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Approximately 1 hour 20 minutes. Essentially, I will \nsay to the Senate, if 1 hour is used on Senator Boxer's amendment and 1 \nhour [[Page S7316]] used in opposition to it, there will be no time \nleft. No time left.\n  What I would like everybody to understand--and this is not my rule; I \nwish it were different--but I do not know if there is going to be very \nmuch time to debate very many amendments in that remaining time.\n  I have been expressing to the Senator from Nebraska, based on this \nreality--this is just real--when the 50 hours comes, any Senator can \nsay ``regular order'' and, obviously, there is no more time for debate.\n  I want to make sure everybody knows, under a unanimous-consent \nagreement, the majority leader and the minority leader, after all the \nvotes are finished, including those that may be handed to the desk, \nthere will be one-half hour allotted to the Democrat leadership and \none-half hour to our leadership, to recap the budget situation. So that \nis there and that is all it can be used for.\n  We will soon be out of time. Maybe Senators on my side and Senators \non that side of the aisle do not understand that we cannot help very \nmuch, but we would like to be helpful. So what I would like to do, and \nI am urging that we find a way to decide, is for you all to decide on \nyour side through your ranking member what are all the amendments that \nyou intend to offer. Some will be debated for a couple of minutes; some \nare just going to be offered at the end.\n  Why would I like to know? Because I would like to help. I would like \nto say maybe everybody ought to have a minute before they have to vote \non their amendment, even beyond the 50 hours. I have no such authority \nfrom the majority leader. But I cannot do that if there are 50, 60 \namendments because we will be here until midnight, and the whole \npurpose was to have 50 hours.\n  We are getting close to that 50 right now. So if there is any way \nthat Senators on that side could accommodate so that we might sit down \nhere soon in a room and say what process could we agree to to give \neverybody a little bit of time.\n  Again, I want to say the majority leader has told me on our side, if \nthere are 20 or 30 such amendments, or 40, we are not going to agree to \nany time because you add all that up and the time to vote and we will \nbe here 6 hours to 7 hours.\n  So I am asking for some reason, some reasonableness. When the 50 \nhours is up--and I am not using anybody's time so nobody has to worry \nabout that. I am entitled to this time under the law, and when that \ntime is up, there is no opportunity to talk about an amendment, unless \nwe, as a Senate, agree to that. So if you have an amendment at the end \nleft over and you want to insist on it, and the statute says you can do \nthat, the statute also says no debate. We are not going to agree to \ngive everybody time when we have already used up all the time unless we \ndo it in an understandable manner where the Senate then understands \nwhat the amendments are, how many there are, and then maybe we may be \nin business to try to make some overall agreement.\n  I hope everybody understands, I am not trying to be harsh. I am not \ntrying to take time away from anybody. That is just the reality.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield on my time.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank the Senator for what he is trying to do and for his \ncomity. It is kind of unusual, and I am glad to see it.\n  If we have 20 amendments that will be offered at the end of the 50 \nhours, we have two options, as I hear you: One is to offer the \namendment, or call it up and we can vote up or down or to table; we can \ndo that. Or on the other side, if we have a minute, you offer a minute \nor 2 minutes on each side, pro and con, on how many amendments? Do you \nhave any figure if they are less than that or more than that?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I very much would like you all to come up with some \nproposal.\n  Mr. FORD. When you say you all, who do you mean?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Democratic side.\n  Mr. FORD. How many will be on your side?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We probably, in short order, can establish the fact \nthat there would only be four or five.\n  Mr. FORD. You will have four or five amendments to come after the 50 \nhours?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will give that to Senator Exon shortly.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank the Senator for his courtesy.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me correct the record. You said there are only two \nthings that can happen. I do not want anybody to misunderstand. An \namendment pending at the desk can be second-degreed even if there is no \ntime. There is a series where we understand somebody wants to exercise \nthat. They understand it is pending. They would not have any time \neither.\n  Mr. FORD. They would still offer it and then you move to table.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes. Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Approximately 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will yield 10 minutes to Senator Burns.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I will respond to the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from California and just point out some things about that \namendment that I think are flawed. The Senator's amendment would create \nanother point of order against how a tax cut should be constructed, and \nI think that is very important with this body because we already have \nenough points of order on the rest of this bill. Rather than a point of \norder against tax cuts, I think we should have a point of order against \nraising taxes, if you want to do it on both sides.\n  Let us be very careful. Whenever we start talking about this budget \nand what it does, all at once we start offering the amendments and it \nstarts to come unraveled. When it was first put together in the Budget \nCommittee, everybody just about knew where we had to go and what we had \nto do. Some would increase taxes, as has been proposed by some, really, \non both sides of the aisle. I am firmly opposed to that.\n  Right now, most folks in America have a marginal tax rate over 45 \npercent--almost one-half of their yearly salary. So what is there left \nto tax? It makes no sense to bankrupt American citizens in the name of \nkeeping the American Federal Government solvent.\n  So I think when you look at the overall budget, we have to come up \nwith the word responsible. And that is what I would like to emphasize \nthrough this recap of not how I look at the amendment but the entire \npackage of the bill. We have slowed the rate of spending. Back in 1990, \nI offered a bill that was a 4 percent solution--I called it--to allow \nin the budget process the Federal Government expenditures to only grow \n4 percent based on the previous year's expenditures and do away with \nbaseline budgeting. Unfortunately, that did not pass. But with the \nassumptions that we made then, by 1995 and 1996, we would have balanced \nthe Federal budget. But I have to say there are hints of my ideas that \nI had back in 1990 in this bill.\n  Everyone would agree, maybe, that the Government has gotten too big \nto operate efficiently. This bill freezes pay for Senators, \nRepresentatives, Federal judges, and political appointees for a period \nof 7 years. As far as I am concerned, I can accept that. I am not real \nsure if my wife can. But nonetheless I think she will. It cuts Senate \nstaff by 15 percent and Senate support staff by 12.5 percent. And we \nhave cut a little already. It reduces the spending of the Executive \nOffice of the President by around 25 percent. Those cuts save us almost \n$7 billion.\n  I take the budget another step further. I would consolidate the \nSurgeon General's office with the Assistant Secretary of Health. The \noffice of the Surgeon General was originally created to function as a \nspokesperson for public health and has been used as a political \nfootball. I advocate putting an end to that political grandstanding by \neliminating this unnecessary position and consolidating its duties with \nthose of the office of the Assistant Secretary of Health. That is the \nway it used to be. During the Carter administration, Dr. Julius \nRichmond served as both the Surgeon General and the Assistant Secretary \nof Health. I see no reason why the American taxpayer should have to pay \nfor staffing both offices.\n  When we look at what it does--a while ago we talked about the NIH, \nNational Institutes of Health. I voted to restore some of those funds \nbecause I believe that this Government should be \n[[Page S7317]] actively involved in research and development, \nespecially in the line of health. But the chairman's budget also calls \nfor the transformation of NASA's management structure, contracting \nprocedures, and the reduction of Government involvement in scientific \nresearch, infrastructure and equipment. I have to say that I voted \nagainst the Snowe amendment a while ago for the simple reason that it \ncalled for another billion-dollar reduction in NASA, when they have \nalready shown their good faith, without any cajoling from this Congress \nto come to the bar, and cut $5 billion over 5 years. And there are some \nwithin the NASA organization that say now we have to start looking at \nsafety when we start thinking about our space programs.\n  So we are glad to see that baseline budgeting is out. The chairman's \nbudget proposed the elimination of spending on the National Biological \nService. I have long said that is not needed. We have enough biologists \nin the Forest Service, in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife, and BLM to do \nwhat they want to do and what Interior wants to do. They have to do it \nwithin the confines of that. Why another layer of bureaucracy? I \ngenerally support that.\n  As I explained last week, I have concerns with the provision that \ncuts the Agricultural Research Service. I find it ironic that we are \ncutting back on R in the very area that is very important to us in \nthe production of food and fiber for this country. To reduce the ARS at \nthis time is appealing in the short run, but it would have a \ndevastating long-term negative impact on farming and ranching in the \nUnited States and, consequently, on the Federal Treasury. I believe our \nfirst priority should be a commitment to the production of food and \nfiber. I find that many folks are surprised when you tell them that for \nthe first time in the history of this country, wheat yields have \nactually leveled off in some areas and were declining because of our \nresearch work in developing new strains of wheat that are disease \nresistant.\n  So I am opposed to a reduction in ARS funding. Furthermore, \nagriculture has taken its fair share of cuts; if you look at the last 8 \nyears, about a 45 percent cut.\n  So with that, it is a good package. When we start picking away at it, \nit starts to come unraveled. I want to congratulate my friends from New \nMexico and Nebraska. They have worked very hard together on this. And \nit should be presented and they should be given the guidelines for the \nrest of us to complete our work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, are my 15 minutes used?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I reserve that.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I have four more relatively short speakers \nthat I would like to yield to at this time. I would like to yield at \nthis time in whatever order they are entitled to the floor from the \ntime allotted to me most generously by my colleague from California. \nFirst is Senator Leahy for 2 minutes, and then Senator Baucus for 2 \nminutes, Senator Conrad for 6 minutes, and fourth, Senator Graham for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Senator Exon, could we take a couple \nnames at a time instead of the whole list? Who are the first two?\n  Mr. EXON. The first two I have are Senator Leahy for 2 minutes and \nthen Senator Baucus for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have a Senator on the floor who would \nlike to speak in opposition for up to 10 minutes on my time. Maybe we \ncould move back and forth after the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. EXON. Since we are limiting--may I suggest we take care of the \ntwo Senators that I have mentioned--this is 4 minutes--and then go to \n10 minutes. Is that reasonable?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Can we have the two Senators for 4 minutes and then the \nSenator from Kentucky for 10?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. INHOFE). The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                   Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will have two resolutions that we will be \nvoting on at the appropriate time. One is expressing the sense of the \nSenate that the violent crime reduction trust fund not be cut. \nNotwithstanding the tremendous violence we have seen in New York, \nOklahoma, and elsewhere, the House of Representatives voted on April 5 \nto cut $5 billion from the violent crime reduction trust fund and to \ngive it for a tax cut.\n  They congratulated themselves on this, but have not explained to the \nAmerican people that they are cutting out money in a trust fund set \naside to fight violent crime.\n  Frankly, I think that is more important than to give a tax break to \nthe wealthiest. We will be voting on that.\n  Earlier this year, on April 7, 1995, the Senate passed a resolution \nreaffirming our support for State and local law enforcement when their \nintegrity was challenged.\n  When we passed Senate Joint Resolution 32 we were responding to \nremarks, by a well-known attorney in connection with a high-profile \ncriminal case, that unfairly and inaccurately maligned the integrity of \nthe Nation's law enforcement officers.\n  On April 19, 1995, a bomb exploded outside a Federal building in \nOklahoma City killing scores of Americans, including a number of \nFederal law enforcement employees. There is reason to believe the bomb \nwas directed at the Federal Government and its law enforcement \nofficers.\n  This bombing has served to focus our attention on the real threats of \nviolent extremism here at home and foreign terrorism. We will soon have \nan opportunity to consider legislative efforts to provide additional \nresources and better coordination of Federal, State, and local law \nenforcement efforts to deal with these threats.\n  Today, my purpose is a related one: I ask my colleagues to join with \nme to pass this resolution reaffirming our commitment and appreciation \nfor Federal, State, and local law enforcement and the outstanding job \nthat they do under the most difficult and dangerous circumstances and \nto reject House attempts drastically to cut our financial support for \ntheir efforts.\n  Since the bombing there has been a lot of public debate and comment \nabout the activities of law enforcement and the rhetoric that has been \nused over the past few years to disparage and malign these dedicated \npublic servants and the law enforcement agencies in which they serve.\n  I submit that law enforcement deserves better. We owe these men and \nwomen our respect, appreciation, and public, moral, and financial \nsupport.\n  Even had we not recently noted the increasing threats against the \nsafety and lives of law enforcement officers, the Oklahoma bombing and \nthe reports of attacks against park rangers, Forest Service employees, \nTreasury employees, and others all make the gruesome point too well.\n  Moreover, there has been a lot of recent discussion about the way \nresponsible citizens converse about law enforcement and other public \nofficials. I certainly understand President Bush's reaction when those \nwith whom he served and who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the \nservice of public safety are being criticized unfairly.\n  I commend our colleagues, from both sides of the aisle, who have \ntried to tone down the rhetoric and to turn the focus of debate to \nresponsible efforts to assist law enforcement to do its job.\n  Likewise, I appreciate the apology recently issued by the National \nRifle Association of the intemperate tone of certain remarks.\n  I have spoken about my revulsion with celebrities talking about how \nto shoot Federal agents and their using representations of our \nPresident for target practice. This is vile and reprehensible.\n  If we are to preserve freedom of speech in this increasingly violent \nand confrontational society, we need to use our freedoms to reject \nviolent extremism and hatemongering. We need to remind ourselves that \nwe live in the freest nation on Earth because the rule of law is \nrespected, as are people's rights to speak, associate and petition the \ngovernment.\n  We need to speak out ourselves against those who would portray the \nPresident, the Congress, the Government or law enforcement as \nconspirators intent on taking away people's rights. To the contrary, \nthe dedicated men and women in Federal, State, and local government and \nlaw enforcement work long hours for limited financial reward in order \nto serve the public, protect us, and preserve our freedom. \n[[Page S7318]] \n  It is in this context that I was concerned when the House of \nRepresentatives voted on April 5 to offset certain tax reduction \nproposals by cutting $5 billion from the violent crime reduction trust \nfund.\n  As it congratulated itself on its first 100 days and adjourned for \nits April recess, the House majority did not explain to the American \npeople that it was invading the violent crime reduction trust fund and \nmaking it impossible to pay for the law enforcement and crime \nprevention programs of the Violent Crime Control Act of 1994, which the \nPresident signed into law only last summer.\n  Although this major crime bill was 6 years in the making, the House \nis apparently prepared to gut it. I hope and trust that our Senate \ncolleagues will reject this $5 billion cut in funding to Federal law \nenforcement and Federal assistance to State and local efforts.\n  When we passed the crime bill last year we paid for its program. A \ntrust fund was established from the saving of the downsizing of the \nFederal Government by some 250,000 jobs. The violent crime reduction \ntrust fund contains funds dedicated to law enforcement and crime \nprevention programs, and is intended in large part to provide Federal \nfinancial assistance to critical Federal, State, and local needs.\n  On April 5, the House invaded that trust fund without debate and \nslashed our anticrime funding by $5 billion to help offset the budget \ndeficit the House tax bill would create. This is wrong.\n  Since passage of the Violent Crime Control Act, the U.S. Department \nof Justice has been doing a tremendous job getting these resources to \nthe field. I commend the Associate Attorney General John Schmidt and \nChief Joe Brann, who directs the community policing programs for their \nquick work.\n  I know that funding to assist local law enforcement hire additional \nofficers went out almost immediately based on simple, one-page \napplications. Vermont received commitments of over $2 million toward 35 \nnew officers in 34 jurisdictions, for example. The House action would \ncost Vermont, for example, the equivalent of 50 State and local law \nenforcement officers over the next 5 years.\n  The House would have us turn our backs on law enforcement and \nprevention programs and the commitments we made in the Violent Crime \nControl Act. Law enforcement and community-based programs cannot be \nkept on a string like a yo-yo if they are to plan and implement crime \ncontrol and prevention programs.\n  What we need to do is to follow through on our commitments, not to \nbreach them and violate our pledge to law enforcement, State, and local \ngovernment, and the American people. Invading trust funds dedicated to \ncrime control purposes is simply no way to justify the elimination of \nthe corporate alternative minimum tax or capital gains taxes.\n  From our Attorney General to the Fraternal Order of Police, \nInternational Brotherhood of Police Officers, National Association of \nPolice Organizations, National Sheriffs Association, and the Police \nFoundation, dedicated law enforcement officers are justifiably outraged \nby this arbitrary action.\n  Funding for important programs implementing the Violence Against \nWomen Act and our rural crime initiatives should not have been cut by \none-sixth or at all, let alone without debate and justification.\n  I will work with the Attorney General and my Senate colleagues to \nreject the ill-advised House action and preserve the violent crime \nreduction trust fund so that we can fulfill the promise of the Violent \nCrime Control Act and our commitment to all that we can to reduce \nviolent crime in our local communities.\n  I have noted that this is not the time to undercut our support for \nFederal law enforcement or the assistance provided State and local law \nenforcement. After the tragedy in Oklahoma City, I was certain that the \nHouse would abandon this ill-conceived plan.\n  Yet, in spite of all that has happened, the House chose to reaffirm \nits intention to proceed with this $5 billion cut in law enforcement \nfunding, which it included in the House-passed budget resolution last \nweek.\n  Accordingly, I offer this amendment as an embodiment of the Senate's \nresolve against the House-passed cuts to the violent crime reduction \ntrust fund and reductions in funding of Federal, State, and local law \nenforcement.\n  Now is not the time to cut law enforcement funding and this is not \nthe way to show our support for those whom we ask to protect public \nsafety and preserve our precious freedoms.\n                 Protecting Federal Nutrition Programs\n\n  My other resolution is very simple. It says that the infant formula \nthat is purchased by the WIC Program be done under competitive bidding.\n  The House of Representatives gave in to some very powerful lobbyists \nand very powerful drug companies, and removed the amendment which \nrequires competitive bidding for WIC. That meant the taxpayers will \ngive a $1 billion windfall to four drug companies, and they will take \n1.5 million pregnant women and newborn infants off the WIC Program.\n  This sense of the Senate says we ought to take care of the women and \nthe infants before we do the drug companies, especially at taxpayers' \nexpense.\n  It also says we ought to have real nutritional standards in school \nlunch. Not what the fast food industry would like, but perhaps what \nmothers, fathers, and children should like and should have.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is very simple.\n  It says that it is the sense of the Senate that infant formula be \npurchased by the WIC Program under competitive bidding. It says that \nschool lunches should meet minimal nutrition requirements and that the \ncontent of WIC food packages be based on scientific evidence.\n  That has been the case for years and should continue. I am offering \nthis amendment because the House-passed welfare reform bill does not \nfollow that longstanding approach to child nutrition programs.\n  I am very pleased that the Senate Budget Committee majority report \ndoes not assume that the Senate wants to eliminate those protections \nfor children.\n  The Contract With America, as passed by the House, would allow States \nto serve junk foods with lunch. The Senate should stand up to that \nchallenge and say ``no.''\n  It would allow States to waste Federal taxpayer dollars on needlessly \nexpensive foods for the WIC Program.\n  I have spent 8 years protecting the WIC Program from drug companies. \nNow the House Contract With America changes that. A few years ago, I \ncalled on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate price-fixing and \nbid-rigging regarding infant formula companies and the WIC Program.\n  I introduced bills, which all my Senate colleagues supported, to \nrequire that WIC buy infant formula under competitive bidding rules \nsimilar to rules used by the Federal Government, and most State \ngovernments, to purchase goods.\n  These WIC procedures save $1 billion a year. That money keeps 1.6 \nmillion pregnant women, infants, and children on WIC at no additional \ncost to taxpayers.\n  The House bill does not require competitive bidding. Instead it \nincludes paltry cost containment requirements that are a sham.\n  It is hard to imagine a provision that better symbolizes what is \nwrong with the Contract With America.\n  The contract could give up to $1 billion to four corporate giants and \ntake 1.6 million low-income women, infants, and children off the WIC \nProgram.\n  For 8 years as chair of the Agriculture Committee, I tried to make \nour work on nutrition programs bipartisan. And I am pleased that the \nSenate Budget Committee report is supportive of the WIC Program.\n  Last year both the Senate and the House passed the child nutrition \nreauthorization by unanimous agreement.\n  That reauthorization act maintained the principle that school lunches \nprovide one-third of the nutritional requirements for each day. It \nmaintained strong competitive bidding procedures for the WIC Program.\n  And it ensured that foods of minimum nutritional value may not be \nsold with school lunches. It passed the Senate without objection last \nyear.\n  The House bill eliminates minimum nutritional requirements for school \nlunches. I fought Coca-Cola and the [[Page S7319]] fast food companies \nlast year to make school lunches healthier.\n  Congress reduced the saturated fat content of school meals, and \nclarified that schools have the right to say ``no'' to Coca-Cola and \nPepsi-Cola.\n  Under the House Contract With America, soft drinks can be sold to \nschool children during lunch instead of milk. Candy companies, fast \nfood giants, and junk food purveyors are the big winners. Children and \ndairy farmers are the big losers.\n  The House-passed Contract With America could hurt child nutrition \nprograms by eliminating what we put into law last year.\n  I hope the Senate tells the lobbyists for the soft drink bottlers \nthat Coke or Pepsi should not be part of a school lunch or breakfast.\n  I hope the Senate tells the lobbyists for drug companies that make \ninfant formula that the Senate wants to continue to save taxpayers $1 \nbillion a year in the WIC Program by mandating strong competitive \nbidding procedures.\n  Remember, before the Congress required competitive bidding, many \nStates did not use those procedures that now put 1.6 million more \npregnant women, infants, and children on the WIC Program at no \nadditional cost to taxpayers.\n  I hope the Senate rejects the House approach that repeals scientific \nstandards for the WIC food package. These standards make WIC a success.\n  I want to make one additional point not directly related to the \namendment I am offering. I believe it is a mistake to block grant food \nstamps.\n  On December 2, 1969, President Nixon said in a speech that relying on \nlocal governments meant that ``our Nation's food programs have been \nshot through with inequities.''\n  Chairman Goodling put it another way when he opposed block grants a \nfew years ago--he said that a ``child's basic nutrition needs do not \nvary from State to State.''\n  I joined with Senator Dole in opposing block granting some years ago. \nHe said, and I agreed with him, that the ``Federal Government should \nretain primary responsibility for nutrition programs in order to \nguarantee some standardization of benefits.''\n  We have to recognize that food stamps are America's best and largest \nchild nutrition program.\n  Over 80 percent of food stamp benefits go to families with children; \nand over 90 percent of food stamp benefits go to families with \nchildren, or the elderly or disabled.\n  I am pleased to report that as the economy has grown over the last \nyear, participation in food stamps has dropped by 1 million persons.\n  It is crucial to me that food stamps not be block-granted--I agree \nwith the House of Representatives and Chairman Roberts, Chairman \nEmerson and Chairman Gunderson on this issue.\n  Their view is that food stamps is the final safety net and that it \nshould neither be block-granted nor cashed out. In rejecting block \ngrants, the House used some of the same points made years ago by \nPresident Nixon.\n  In closing, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.\n  Mr. President, I thank the managers for their courtesy.\n\n\n                   Privatizing PMA's is Backdoor Tax\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have an amendment, joined with Senator \nPressler, Senator Dorgan, Senator Robb, Senator Warner, and others, No. \n1120, to oppose the sale of the public power marketing administrations.\n  Very simply, Mr. President, this is the situation: The budget \nresolution proposes the sale of public power marketing administration, \nthe PMA's.\n  What is the effect of that sale? Twofold. No. 1, to dramatically \nincrease the rates of consumers, utility consumers, in most States of \nour country, because public power is sold at a lower rate than power \nfrom other sources that is sold to consumers.\n  The estimate is between a 20- and a 60-percent increase in utility \nrates for farmers, for ranchers, for homeowners, for small business, \nfor anybody who is in a rural co-op, or anyone who buys public power. \nNo. 1, the effect is very much to increase the rate. It is a hidden \ntax, Mr. President. It is a hidden tax because in effect people will \nhave to pay more.\n  The second major consequence of the sale of the PMA's: Increase the \nbudget deficit. That is a consequence. Why? Very simply, because the \nPMA's currently make money. They make about $240 million a year. When \nthe PMA's loan is retired, in about, I think, 14 or 16 years, Uncle Sam \nwill make $5 billion on the investment.\n  So the sale of PMA's has two effects. No. 1, big increase in utility \nrates; No. 2, increase in the budget deficit.\n  My amendment says, ``No, let's not sell the PMA's; therefore, let's \nnot raise utility rates; and let's also reduce the budget deficit by \nkeeping the PMA's alive.''\n  Please add Senators Ford, Harkin, Heflin, and Hollings as cosponsors. \nWebster defines a ``tax'' as follows: ``to require to pay a percentage \nof income, property or value for support of the government.''\n  So a tax can come in many forms--a direct levy, or a hidden fee that \nsneaks up on taxpayers under a cover name. And that is precisely what \nthis budget resolution contemplates for ratepayers across rural \nAmerica.\n  Privatizing the power marketing administrations is a bad idea. It is \nshortsighted and it hurts rural America. Privatization cannot work when \nits result is simply to create four huge monopolies, which will gouge \ntheir captive market like any other monopoly.\n  So at its core, the proposal to sell off PMA's is no more than a \nbackdoor tax increase on the rural middle class. A tax hidden in a \nutility bill is every bit as much a tax as a gas tax, income tax or \nanything else. I won't stand for it. And many of my colleagues on both \nsides of the isle won't stand for it.\n  Let me tell you what this would mean to Montana. Montana, like much \nof the west, was built on hydroelectric power. By harnessing the \nMissouri River at Fort Peck Reservoir, Montanans bring water to arid \nlands for farming and ranching. Small industries use the affordable \npower to create jobs and build communities. And folks in rural areas \nget affordable power to heat and light their homes.\n  This is an essential service. It is something that works. And it has \nworked ever since Franklin Roosevelt came out to break ground at the \nFort Peck Dam and bring public power to rural Montana. Public power \nmeant electricity that an ordinary farm family could afford. It helped \ncreate Montana communities like Glasgow, Sidney, and Shelby. It keeps \ntowns like these strong and healthy today.\n  As my friends George and Barbara DenBoer of Dupuyer, MT, recently \ntold me:\n\n       Our electric bills are high enough. We are barely making a \n     living on the ranch now and with all the new taxes and \n     increases in expenses it is all but impossible to continue. \n     Please stop and consider how many rural people will be \n     affected with higher rates. . . . We need the Power Marketing \n     Administration. Please do not make it impossible for those \n     who make their living in the country.\n\n  One hundred thousand Montana families--nearly one in three Montana \nmen, women, and children--share George and Barbara's feelings.\n  All of them use WAPA power in Montana today. And they stand to see \ntheir electric bills increase by at least 30 percent if this proposal \ngoes forward. You are talking about a real, tangible cut in the living \nstandards for people in rural America. And that is why I so strongly \noppose the sale of WAPA and the PMA's.\n  A second point is that WAPA and the other power marketing programs \ntake not one tax dollar. In fact, the Federal Government makes money \noff of these programs.\n  WAPA is a good example. The Federal Government has invested a total \nof $5.6 billion in WAPA. And each year, WAPA pays the Federal \nGovernment approximately $380 million for this loan with interest. So \nfar, the Federal Treasury has gotten back $4.1 billion on its initial \nloan. And by the time this debt is retired in 24 years, the Federal \nTreasury will have made $14 billion on its initial investment of $5.6 \nbillion.\n  Second, even now the PMA's run a profit for the Government. A \nrecently released CRS report on the PMA's found that the Federal \nTreasury actually earns a profit of $244 million a year on the PMA's. \nYou have to look long and hard to find a Federal program that provides \na good service to the public and makes a profit.\n  I find it incredibly shortsighted that the Congress would want to \nsell America's infrastructure for a quick, one time shot of cash. What \nis next? Our highways? Our bridges? Our national [[Page S7320]] parks? \nThe principle is just the same. America's infrastructure up for sale. \nIt doesn't make any sense to me, and I will not stand by and let it \nproceed without a fight.\n  And I urge my colleagues--particularly those Republicans and \nDemocrats from the 32 rural States served by the PMA's--to join me. \nSenators will find a comprehensive list of all electric utilities in \ntheir States who are served by the PMAs on their desks.\n  Let me read for the Record, States who are served by the PMA's:\n  Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, \nIowa, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, \nMissouri, Mississippi, Montana, North Carolina, North Dakota, Nebraska, \nNew Mexico, Nevada, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, South Dakota, \nTennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.\n  I urge Senators to take a moment before they vote on my amendment to \nconsider the consequences elimination of the PMA's will have on the \npeople in their States--the small businesses, farmers, ranchers, \nhomeowners, and school districts. Say no to this backdoor tax and \nsupport my amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to yield 7 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Kentucky.\n\n\n                    No Taxpayer Funding of Elections\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I listened with great interest to my \nfriend and colleague, Senator Kerry from Massachusetts, decry the \neffort of the Budget Committee to get rid of the Presidential checkoff. \nLet me say, my good friend could not be more wrong.\n  In looking back at the Watergate scandal, it is interesting to note \nthat the Select Committee on Watergate in the mid-1970's in \nrecommendation No. 7, said the committee recommends against the \nadoption of any form of taxpayer funding of elections--against any form \nof it. The Congress proceeded to establish the Presidential fund in \nspite of that.\n  During the last 20 years, Mr. President, such eminent persons as \nLyndon LaRouche has gotten a $12 million in taxpayers funds to run for \nPresident of the United States. He even got, interestingly enough, \n$200,000 from the taxpayers to run for President while he was in jail. \nMy assumption is he would not even be able to vote for himself as a \nresident of the jail.\n  In addition, that outstanding American, Lenora Fulani, has gotten \n$3.5 million from the taxpayers of America to run for President.\n  Now, Mr. President, the taxpayers of America have an opportunity \nevery April 15 to vote on how they feel about using taxpayers' money \nfor the Presidential election. As a matter of fact, it could be argued \nit is the most complete survey ever taken in America on any subject.\n  Every April 15, voters get to decide whether they want to check off--\nit used to be $1, and now $3--of taxes they already owe--it does not \nadd to their tax bill--to divert that away from whatever else may be \nfunded by the Federal Government into this fund.\n  Now the checkoff participation has dropped down last year to 14.5 \npercent, and is still falling. Two years ago, the majority, for fear \nthat the taxpayers would totally revolt and there would be no money in \nthe fund at all, raised the checkoff from $1 to $3. Now the net effect \nof that is that fewer and fewer people could divert more and more \nmoney. Eighty-five percent of the American people choose not to check \noff, even though it does not add to their tax bills, $3 to go into this \nfund.\n  Everyone, in effect, ends up paying for the checkoff because the \nmoney is diverted away from other topics.\n  If there is any system that has been thoroughly discredited, Mr. \nPresident, it is this one. It has not stopped spending. It has not \nstopped soft money, and it has eaten up about $1 billion of the tax \nmoney of the people of the United States over the last 20 years.\n  If we cannot kill this program, Mr. President, then what program can \nwe kill? Now, at the appropriate time I will be offering a second-\ndegree amendment to the Kerry amendment. I would like to briefly \ndescribe what that is about.\n  Among the things, Mr. President, that taxpayers funding has been used \nfor during these years was to settle a sexual harassment case. My \namendment would prevent, assuming the Presidential fund survives--which \nI hope it will not, but assuming it survives--my second-degree \namendment to the Kerry amendment would be a sense of the Senate that \nthe Presidential election campaign fund, if it survives, could not pay \nfor or augment damage awards or settlements arising from a civil or \ncriminal action, or the threat thereof, related to sexual harassment.\n  Now, I will be offering that second-degree amendment to make a point, \nMr. President, as to how taxpayers' money has been used: $37,500 was \nused to settle a sexual harassment case against a top aide of the \ncurrent President in his campaign back in 1992. The taxpayers paid for \nthe settlement.\n  At the appropriate time, I will be offering a second-degree amendment \nwhich I hope will be approved. I hope that the underlying amendment \nwill be disapproved. This is a program that ought to end up on the ash \nheap of history.\n  In addition to that, Mr. President, I will offer an amendment with \nregard to the Appalachian Regional Commission, a Commission that is \nextremely important to my own State of Kentucky, and will be \ncosponsored by Senator Warner, Senator Cochran, Senator Rockefeller, \nand Senator Heflin.\n  Essentially, Mr. President, even though the Appalachian Regional \nCommission would be taken down in its funding over a period of 7 years, \nvery, very significantly, this amendment would prevent the ARC from \nbeing totally phased out, and it would pay for it largely by diverting \nfunds from the Office of Surface Mining and from other regulatory \nactivities.\n  So, essentially what this amendment is about is to take money away \nfrom regulators and give it to those involved in economic development. \nIt is simply a question of priorities. Do we want to give the money to \nthe Office of Surface Mining and others engaged in regulating in this \nand other fields? Or do we want the money to go directly into economic \ndevelopment activities in parts of our country that are economically \ndeprived? This ARC covers such States as West Virginia, Kentucky, \nTennessee, Mississippi and Alabama, and it has been useful in providing \nroads and other economic development tools for the most poverty \nstricken parts of that part of America.\n  I am somebody who is going to support the final budget resolution. I \nam in favor of ending a lot of programs and intend to so vote. But I \nbelieve here in this particular amendment we will simply be choosing \nbetween whether we want to fund more and more Government regulators on \nthe one hand or economic development in poverty-stricken areas on the \nother.\n  So I hope the McConnell amendment on ARC, supported by Senators \nWarner, Cochran, Rockefeller, and Heflin, will be approved when it is \noffered at the end of the time.\n  Mr. President, I have actually done an astonishing thing. I believe I \nhave finished before Senator Domenici had to ring the bell. So I will \nyield any remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time did he give back?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 26 minutes and 45 seconds.\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from North \nDakota, followed by 2 minutes for the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today we are engaged in a historic debate \non our economic future. There are many of us on both sides of the aisle \nwho are committed to balancing our budget. But a group of us have \nworked for a number of weeks on producing a plan that we call the Fair \nShare plan, because we believe the Republican alternative that has been \npresented does not call on all of our citizens on a fair basis to \ncontribute to this effort.\n  Perhaps the conservative commentator Kevin Phillips said it best when \nhe said, ``If the budget deficit were really a national crisis we would \nbe talking about shared sacrifice, with business, Wall Street and the \nrich, the people who have the big money, making the biggest sacrifice. \nInstead, the richest one or two percent, far from making sacrifices, \nactually get new benefits and tax reductions.'' [[Page S7321]] \n  That does not strike some of us as fair. We believe everyone in this \ncountry ought to be asked to contribute to solving this budget problem. \nSo we have created an alternative that we call the fair share balanced \nbudget plan. It balances the budget by the year 2004 without counting \nthe Social Security trust fund surpluses. The Republican plan claims to \nachieve balance by the year 2002, but they do that by counting Social \nSecurity trust fund surpluses. In fact, if you look at the Republican \nbudget resolution you will find that they have a $113 billion budget \ndeficit, when it is fairly stated, in the year 2002. We understand they \ndo not achieve a balanced budget without counting Social Security \nsurpluses until the year 2006.\n  Our plan offers even more deficit reduction in the year 2002 than \ntheir plan. Without counting the Social Security surpluses, the \nRepublicans have a $113 billion deficit in 2002, while the Fair Share \nplan has a $97 billion deficit, $16 billion less in deficit than the \nRepublican plan.\n  We freeze defense spending, like the Republican plan does.\n  We freeze nondefense discretionary spending while the Republicans cut \nit $190 billion below a freeze. In other words, we have frozen both \ndefense spending and nondefense discretionary spending for 7 years in \nour plan. In the Republican plan, they have cut, on domestic \ndiscretionary spending, $190 billion below freeze. That means the high-\npriority areas of the budget are devastated under the Republican plan: \nEducation, infrastructure, research and development, technology. We add \nback $47 billion to education. We add back $54 billion to \ninfrastructure, and some $13 billion to R and technology because \nthose are the keys to America's future.\n  We also cut other important priorities less than the Republican plan. \nWe restore $100 billion of the $256 billion Republicans cut in \nMedicaid. We have full funding for student loans, some $14 billion. We \nrestore $24 billion of the $46 billion the Republicans cut in nutrition \nand agriculture. We restore $60 billion of the $86 billion cut in \nincome assistance in the Republican plan. And we restore $5 billion of \nthe $10 billion Republicans cut in veterans benefits.\n  To fund these changes we reject the Republican tax cuts targeted at \nthe wealthy. The fair share plan eliminates $170 billion reserved in \nthe Republican plans for tax cuts targeted primarily for the wealthy.\n  We also ask the wealthiest among us to contribute to a balanced \nbudget by limiting the growth of tax breaks, tax loopholes and tax \nbenefits, tax preferences that benefit the wealthy and the big \ncorporations. Tax entitlements are the largest entitlement in dollar \nterms and the third fastest growing major area of the Federal budget. \nThe Republican budget plan lets these tax loopholes and tax preferences \ngrow without discipline, at twice the rate of overall Federal spending. \nOur plan limits the growth in tax entitlements to inflation plus 1 \npercent, producing $228 billion in savings over 7 years.\n  We are simply saying, as the Republicans have argued, that \nentitlement growth ought to be limited. We agree. But we do not think \nwe should forget the biggest entitlement of them all, the tax \npreferences, tax benefits, tax loopholes that go to those who have the \nmost in our society. Let us ask everyone in our country to contribute \nto an effort to reduce the deficit and let us ask them to contribute on \na fair basis.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from Florida is recognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I wish to add my voice in support of the \namendment to be offered by the Senator from North Dakota. I believe it \nspeaks to two important principles in this debate. One, there has been \nan assumption that there is a single path to the heaven of a balanced \nbudget; if we did not ride on the chariot that has been provided to us \nby the Republican leadership that we could not get to that destination. \nSenator Conrad has clearly outlined that there are alternative means of \nreaching the goal of a balanced budget. And we stand second to no \nMember of this body in terms of our commitment and the length of our \ncommitment toward the goal of a balanced budget.\n  Second, I believe we will not reach a balanced budget with the \nRepublican plan, and we will not because it fails to meet a fundamental \nrequirement and that is the requirement of fairness; the requirement \nthat all Americans be asked to contribute to the balancing of the \nbudget in an evenhanded manner.\n  The wheels and wings of this chariot of the Republican leadership for \na balanced budget will fall off before we reach the year 2002 because \nthe American people will object. They will reject the proposal to reach \nthat balanced budget which attempts to do so primarily by reducing the \nalready meager capability of the poorest and the oldest of Americans.\n  The most dramatic example of that is in the area of health care. We \nhave beaten upon our respective breasts about how we are holding down \nentitlements. Here is what we are doing. According to the Congressional \nBudget Office, overall health care expenditures are projected to \nincrease by over 7 percent per capita between now and the year 2002. \nThis budget would restrain Medicare, the program for our oldest \nAmericans, by less than 6 percent, and 1.5 percent for our poorest \nAmericans.\n  That is unfair. That plan will not reach the year 2002. Senator \nConrad's plan will.\n  I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 26\\1/2\\ minutes for your side, and \n18\\1/2\\ minutes for the other side.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am using my time.\n  I hope Senators understand that is literal. There are 26 minutes left \non our side, 18 minutes left on Senator Exon's side. I intend to make \nthat where it comes out even.\n  I yield 3 minutes to Senator Santorum in opposition to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth). The Senator from Pennsylvania \nis recognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to talk about the Conrad amendment and just \nsuggest that this is more of the same, again smoke and mirrors, no \ndefined plan of how you are going to get there, more taxes, $230 \nbillion is what they tell you about, but go ahead and spend $170 \nbillion in the reserve fund. We do not know how that necessarily will \nwork and whether that is really there.\n  I ask the Senator from North Dakota. Has that been scored by the \nCongressional Budget Office that your budget gets a bonus of $170 \nbillion? Do you get that bonus?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Am I to respond?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We have treated the $170 billion in the same way that the \nRepublican resolution has treated it. In other words, only that money--\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Has the CBO scored $170 billion in savings in your \nbudget as a result of it going to balance as it did the Domenici \nbudget?\n  Mr. CONRAD. We do have CBO scoring for the 7 years that indicate we \nwill save $1.250 trillion. We will balance without using Social \nSecurity surpluses.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am running out of time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We have more deficit reduction in the year 2002 than the \nRepublicans.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If I can reclaim my time, I am not getting an answer to \nthe question. I guess the answer is the CBO has not scored $170 billion \nin bonus savings as a result of getting to balance in 9 years. So they \nare using money that they do not even have. So it is already \npotentially $170 billion out of balance.\n  They have $230 billion in tax increases. They do not solve the \nMedicare problem because they add money back which does not take care \nof the problem with the insolvency of the trust fund. They have $443 \nbillion in new spending, but only $398 billion in offset. So that falls \nshort.\n  This plan looks remarkably like a 10-year plan that the President \nsupposedly is eyeing over at the White House of how to get to a \nbalanced budget in 10 years, which this budget does in 9 years.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator from Pennsylvania yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Let me finish my time. Then I be would happy to yield, \nif I have any time left. [[Page S7322]] \n  I did a little homework. I found the Chief of Staff at the White \nHouse, Leon Panetta, who was Budget Committee chairman when I was on \nthe Budget Committee and offered a budget resolution. ``The Story of \nAmerica's Future, Preparing the Nation For the 21st Century,'' which \nwas a 10-year balanced budget, just being produced over at the White \nHouse, basically presented here today, and they are remarkably \nsimilar--big cuts in defense, cuts in entitlements, which the Conrad \nbudget does, and up to a $400 billion in tax increases.\n  It is the same old song.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator from Pennsylvania yield for a question?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. The time of the Senator from Pennsylvania has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  Mr. President, let me say to Senator Conrad and those who joined him, \nthat we are--\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator from New Mexico yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No, I will not. I have not had a chance to speak yet. \nLet me do this. I am not shying away from questions. Let me say to \nSenator Conrad that it is very good that you would bring a balanced \nbudget to the floor at 1 o'clock when there is 30 minutes left to \ndebate.\n  The President sent a budget up about 4 months ago. The Republicans \nsent a budget to the Budget Committee about 2\\1/2\\ to 3 weeks ago. We \nhave been on the floor a little more than a week. Frankly, there is no \nway to analyze the budget. But, frankly, I am absolutely positive that \nit does contain a couple of things that everybody should understand.\n  The Senator would say he is just taking care of loopholes, just not \nletting those grow as much, not letting the tax credits and other \nthings grow. He is freezing them at 1-percent growth.\n  The truth of the matter is that equals a number. That is a dollar \nnumber. My estimate is that it is $230 billion in new taxes no matter \nhow you cut it, because in this resolution, if it is done right, they \ntell the Finance Committee to raise revenues in the amount of $230 \nbillion. Obviously, if you raise revenues $230 billion, you can spend a \nlot of money. You can spend $230 billion of the taxpayers' money. We \ndid not do that. Americans should understand that.\n  In addition, the Senate budget resolution said when you balance, \nthere is a dividend. We do not know if they have a dividend on that \nside. But we said when that dividend accrues we cut Americans' taxes by \n$170 billion. It is very easy to sit up here and say we are only going \nto cut for the rich. It is not true. If they did not have that in their \nvocabulary on that side, they would not have anything to talk that \nabout. Every time they get up, they talk about taxing the rich.\n  The budget resolution says when we have tax cuts, if we do, they will \nnot go to the rich. I do not know how many times I can say it, but that \nis the truth. Read the resolution.\n  In addition, that $170 billion which the Republicans say give back to \nAmericans, they spend that. Of course, $230 billion and $170 billion is \n$400 billion. It seems to me, if you have $400 billion to spend, you \ncan save a lot of programs.\n  I yield 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for \n1 additional minute.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The question is, should the American people be taxed \n$230 billion more at this time in history, and should they not be \nentitled to at least take a look at whether they should get a tax cut \nwhen we get things in balance, or should we spend it all? That is the \nissue, plain and simple. All the rest is an interesting discussion \nwhich nobody has enough time to analyze. But I still commend the \nSenator. It is better than nothing. We did not have anything until now.\n  So I thank him for doing something better than having nothing to \noffer. Frankly, it is a false gesture. There will be a lot of people \nwho will vote for it. They will say they voted for a balanced budget \nalso. Frankly, I think it is a little too late. Nonetheless, we will \nprobably vote on it later today.\n  I yield the floor at this point and reserve the remainder of the \ntime.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator from New Mexico yield for a question or \nyield time to the Senator from Pennsylvania?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I do not have any time.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, unfortunately, the Senator from Nebraska is \nplaced in the position where I have a great number of Senators who want \nto address this. If I have any time left for myself at all, I would \nlike to answer some of the statements that have been made. But in view \nof the fact that I have Members on this side who are very vitally \ninvolved in this whole matter at this time, I would like to yield 2 \nadditional minutes for whatever purposes he sees proper to my colleague \nfrom North Dakota. I would like to yield, following that 2 minutes, to \nmy colleague from the State of Illinois and 2 minutes to my colleague \nfrom the State of New Jersey, 6 minutes in total.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator from Nebraska.\n  In answer to my colleague from Pennsylvania, this is not the same old \nsong. This is a balanced budget and one that does it without using or \nwithout counting Social Security trust funds. It is a significant \nbreakthrough. We do it by less draconian cuts on the high-priority \nprograms of education, Medicare, Medicaid, veterans, and many others.\n  We are able to do that because we reject the tax reduction aimed and \ntargeted primarily at the wealthiest among us, and we say there is no \nneed to defend every tax preference, every tax loophole, every tax \nbreak that is in the current code.\n  This chart shows it--$4 trillion of tax preferences over the next 7 \nyears. We say let us limit the growth to inflation plus 1 percent. That \nsaves us $228 billion.\n  Now, my friends may be able to defend every tax preference, every tax \nbreak, every tax loophole. I am not. I do not understand the practice \nof allowing 73 percent of the foreign corporations doing business in \nthis country to get by without paying one dime of tax. Those are not \nU.S. taxpayers. They are foreign taxpayers doing business here, and we \nallow 73 percent of them to get by without paying a penny. It makes no \nsense.\n  I do not understand the practice of having a section 936 in the code \nthat costs $57,000 for every job created in Puerto Rico under that \nsection of the code. I think we could do away with that loophole, and \noverwhelmingly the people of this country would agree. I do not see any \nreason we should not say to the billionaires who renounce their U.S. \ncitizenship to avoid taxes, that loophole should now be closed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Conrad \namendment. In response to my colleague from Pennsylvania, who said this \nis smoke and mirrors, it took about 10 of us about six meetings to put \nthis together, plus our staffs. It is substantial. I do not suggest \nthat the budget offered by the Senator from New Mexico is smoke and \nmirrors. This is not smoke and mirrors. The question is, which is more \nequitable? And I think clearly the Conrad amendment is.\n  The second question is the growth of tax loopholes or tax \nentitlements. I have heard the Senator from New Mexico speak often \nabout entitlements and the need to get hold of them. He is absolutely \ncorrect. But that also applies to tax entitlements, and what the Conrad \namendment does is say on tax loopholes, they can grow at the rate of \ninflation plus 1 percent.\n  Finally, I would say I am a pessimist that any of these things will \nstand without the teeth of a constitutional amendment. Our history is \nafter 2 years they blow up. But I believe the Conrad plan has a greater \nchance of standing up through the test of time because it is more fair. \nThe burden is [[Page S7323]] spread more evenly. I strongly support the \nConrad amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, the issue of whether there will be a tax \nincrease in the budget resolution, of course, is yesterday's story. \nThere already is a tax increase in the Republican budget proposal. It \nis the elimination of the earned-income tax credit. It is a tax \nincrease of $20 billion on families that earn under $28,000 a year.\n  So make no mistake, the issue is not whether or not there will be a \ntax increase. The issue is who is going to pay the tax. And I believe \nthat this measure is appropriate. It says that corporations and wealthy \nindividuals who use tax loopholes should lose them or have them \nlimited. The Senator from South Dakota and I might disagree on which \ntax loopholes should be eliminated, but there is no question that we \nshould tell the Finance Committee to work to achieve that amount of \ndeficit reduction through the elimination of the tax loopholes.\n  If this amendment does not succeed, when we get to the end and we are \noffering amendments that will not be able to be debated, I will be \noffering another alternative budget that will cut discretionary \nspending more, Medicaid and Medicare less, tax expenditures less, have \na tobacco tax, cut defense more, and cut agriculture more. That will be \nan alternative budget to the one that is being offered now by the \ndistinguished Senator from North Dakota. So that, indeed, we will have \ntwo Democratic amendments that would produce a balanced budget--not one \nbut two. And I hope that this amendment is seriously addressed by the \nSenate and passed, because it is clearly better than the current budget \nproposal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 19 minutes 2 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is all that is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic side has 12 minutes 9 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have a number of comments I wish to \nmake. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, on Federal workers, there will be an amendment called \nup that Senator Sarbanes offered, and, frankly, I want the body to know \nthat I worked very hard with Federal employees representative groups. \nWe did a lot better in this budget resolution for Federal workers than \nthe House did.\n  First of all, we did not freeze their pay. They get their regular pay \nincreases. We provided sufficient money. The House provided a freeze. \nUnlike the House approach, we did not put a tax on them to put in the \npension fund of 2.4 percent. The only thing that is in this budget \nresolution is use the top 5 instead of the top 3 for your averages. And \nwe hope to do some grandfathering in the committee so that it has the \nleast damaging effect. On the other hand, I would like to do more but I \nam also hopeful that when we go to conference I can hold what we have \ndone, and from what I understand from most senior groups, most Federal \nemployee groups, with some grandfathering this is much more palatable \nthan what the House did.\n  Second, I would like to talk about WIC. Some people have talked about \nthe Women, Infants and Children Program. I think it was Senator Leahy. \nWe accommodated an increase in the WIC Program. There is no argument \nthat other programs should be restrained, but we said we think that \nshould be increased; that is very important, nutrition. In fact, it is \na $1.6 billion increase.\n  With reference to the power marketing, there is and there will be an \namendment and discussion about it. Let me just suggest we understood \nfrom Members on our side and the Democrat side that the PMA's as \nproposed by the House was too tough; it would raise utility rates very \nhigh in some areas of the country. We scaled it back tremendously in \nthis budget resolution. For those who are interested, we reduced the \nsavings in the President's budget by two-thirds, or $2.9 billion, the \nassumption of savings.\n  We also assumed that existing customers get preferential rights to \npurchase the PMA's. I think we did a very credible and good job in that \narea, and I hope that the Senate would not further change that during \nthe waning moments.\n  In addition, I repeat one more time, this budget resolution says by \nadoption of a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, if taxes are granted to \nthe American people, 90 percent of them shall go to Americans earning \n$100,000 or less.\n  If I did not use all of my time, I will reserve the remainder of it \nand yield at this time.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will be pleased to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I will be very brief.\n  That this resolution is more sensitive toward the Federal employees \nthan the House-passed resolution is correct. I think we have done \nbetter than the House. I offered the amendment on the retirement \nprovision because I feel strongly we ought not to change the rules on \npeople who have given long service and planned this retirement. But the \noverall package in the Senate resolution is better than what the House \nhas done, and I am hopeful that we can do even better in the \nconference. But I offered this particular proposal because I am very \nconcerned about people having the retirement rules changed on them \nalong the way in their working career.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 12 minutes 9 seconds.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Michigan and \nfollowing that 2 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nebraska.\n  The budget resolution before us assumes a 15 percent reduction in \noverhead for programs in nondefense agencies. It assumes no reduction \nin overhead for the Defense Department. I think that is the wrong \nsignal to send to the Defense Department, particularly given the fact \nthat we know there has been remaining waste in the defense budget. We \nhave identified literally hundreds of millions of dollars that the GAO \nhas pointed out could be saved by improved efficiency in travel \nmanagement. We know of the billions of dollars of expenditures where \nthey cannot even identify authority for the expenditures.\n  We can reduce somewhat the overhead in the Defense Department. My \namendment which I will send to the desk says it is the sense of the \nSenate that the Armed Services Committee and the Appropriations \nCommittee should reduce the overhead in the Defense Department by 3 \npercent--just 3 percent. And again the contrast here is very clear. We \nhave in this budget assumed a 15-percent reduction in overhead of \nnondefense agencies, but the budget makes no cut, no assumption about \nthe reduction in overhead in the Defense Department. And given the fact \nthere has been identification of excess and waste in overhead in the \nDefense Department, we ought to at least ask the Appropriations \nCommittee and the authorizing committee to cut overhead--and I \nemphasize the word ``overhead''--by 3 percent. This does not reduce the \nprogrammatic activities of the agency.\n  Just the way the 15-percent reduction in overhead was directed to be \ntaken out of things like travel and rent and not out of the programs of \nthe agencies, so this minimum 3 percent reduction in defense is \ndirected not to come out of the programmatic activities of the defense \nagencies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. EXON. As I understand it, the Senator will send the amendment to \nthe desk for later consideration.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n                   Agriculture and Nutrition Programs\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank you, Mr. President. [[Page S7324]] \n  Later on, we will be voting on an amendment offered by Senator Exon \nand, I believe, Senators Daschle and Dorgan, and I am an original \ncosponsor. This amendment would restore $15 billion from the tax cuts \nto agriculture and nutrition programs.\n  Mr. President, I will tell you, a minute and a half is not enough \ntime to talk about nutrition programs, but I want to just remind my \ncolleagues that some 13 million children received food stamp benefits \nin 1992. Families with children receive 1.9 percent of food stamp \nbenefits.\n  In addition, we are talking about the child and adult care food \nprogram which is nutritional assistance for children at child care \ncenters--and I have visited those centers--we are talking about $20 \nbillion-plus of cuts in the Food Stamp Program. And I say to my \ncolleagues, not that long ago, the Senate unanimously supported an \namendment that I offered that we would take no action that would \nincrease hunger among children in America. Three times I tried to get a \nvote on that and lost. The fourth time we went on record supporting it.\n  I just simply want to say that these cuts in these nutrition programs \nwill lead to increased hunger among children. The food stamp program in \nthe United States of America is not perfect, but, given the tremendous \ndisparities of welfare benefits, very low benefits, way below poverty \nlevel in many States, it is the true safety net for children.\n  To have these kinds of reductions in this food assistance program is \none of the cruelest things we could do. And this summer, well before \nthat final reconciliation bill, I am going to be on the floor over and \nover and over again reminding my colleagues of the consequences of what \nwe are doing with these cuts. These are real children, real faces, real \npeople, in our country. They do not have the political clout but they \ndeserve much more of our support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Minnesota has \nexpired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I have an additional speaker that I would be \nglad to yield to at this time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to Senator Roth, do you want to \ndiscuss an amendment you were going to offer?\n  Mr. ROTH. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 2 minutes to Senator Roth and 1 minute to \nSenator Stevens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico yields 2 minutes \nto the Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n  Preventing Oil and Gas Leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, when the time has expired, I intend to offer \nan amendment to prevent oil and gas leases to be made in the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge.\n  Mr. President, a financial debt is not the only threat that hangs \nover the heads of future generations. There is an environmental debt, \nas well. We have a moral duty to give them a world that has clean water \nand clean air, and open vistas where wildlife runs free. One of the \ngreat birthrights of every American citizen is the wealth of \nsuperlative public lands.\n  Unfortunately, the budget resolution before us today jeopardizes one \nof the most spectacular places in America: the coastal plain of the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge. There is a provision in the budget \nthat provides for oil and gas lease sales in this sanctuary. Located in \nthe northeastern corner of Alaska, this unique piece of our natural \nheritage is bordered on the north by the Arctic Ocean and Beaufort Sea, \nand on the south by the snow-capped Brooks Range.\n  As a lead sponsor of S. 428, the bill that designates the coastal \nplain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as wilderness area, I am \nconcerned by the provision in the budget proposal that uses revenues \ntaken from sales of leases to drill the coastal plain.\n  My concern arises on two levels: first, that the budget is assuming \nrevenue from a pristine wilderness area; and second, that the revenue \nraised from drilling in this wilderness area will not amount to such an \ninsignificant amount of money that it could easily be found elsewhere.\n  Mr. President, as I've said before, the best thing we have learned \nfrom nearly 500 years of contact with the American wilderness is \nrestraint, the need to stay our hand and preserve our precious \nenvironment and future resources rather than destroy them for momentary \ngain.\n  For this reason, I have been active in the effort to designate the \nrefuge coastal plain of Alaska as a wilderness area. And I am not \nalone. Only 4 years ago, Congress rejected the idea of sacrificing a \nprime part of our national heritage, the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge, for what would be a minimal supply of oil. The Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge is an invaluable region with wildlife diversity that \nhas been compared to Africa's Serengeti.\n  As I've said in earlier statements, the Alaskan wilderness area is \nnot only a critical part of our Earth's ecosystem--the last remaining \nregion where the complete spectrum of arctic and sub-arctic ecosystems \ncomes together--but it is a vital part of our national consciousness. \nIt is a place we can cherish and visit for our soul's good. It offers \nus a sense of well-being and promises that not all dreams have been \ndreamt.\n  The Alaskan wilderness is a place of outstanding wildlife, \nwilderness, and recreation, a land dotted by beautiful forests, \ndramatic peaks and glaciers, gentle foothills, and undulating tundra. \nIt is untamed--rich with Caribou, polar bear, grizzly, wolves, musk \noxen, Dall sheep, moose, and hundreds of thousands of birds--snow \ngeese, tundra swans, black brant, and more. In all, about 165 species \nuse the coastal plain. It is an area of intense wildlife activity. \nAnimals give birth, nurse and feed their young, and set about the \ncritical business of fueling up for winters of unspeakable severity.\n  Addressing my second concern--that the revenue raised from drilling \nin this wilderness area will not result in such a significant amount of \nmoney that it couldn't be found elsewhere--let me say that the \nestimated revenue is only two-tenths of 1 percent of the total savings.\n  And that's why I'm here today, to offer an amendment that will \nprohibit the leasing of the coastal plain of ANWR to pay for deficit \nreduction and to recommend that we pay for the loss in revenue with an \noffset that would come from taxing millionaire ex-patriots. I don't \nthink there's any question that the small number of wealthy individuals \nwho choose to renounce or relinquish their citizenship for the purpose \nof avoiding taxes--or any other reason--are still responsible to pay \ntaxes on the estate, income, trust and gift revenue they received while \nstill Americans.\n  My amendment to prohibit the sale of leases for oil and gas \ndevelopment in the coastal plain of ANWR is revenue neutral. The \nrevenue loss of $2.3 billion over 7 years is fully offset by closing \ntax loopholes that have been used by wealthy Americans who renounce \ntheir citizenship.\n  My amendment is consistent with the current law--with the dictates of \nCongress--law that prohibits oil and gas drilling in the coastal plain \nof ANWR. It is also consistent with agreements that we have made with \nCanada to preserve and protect this wilderness area, especially the \nhabitat and culture of the native people who live in the area.\n  My amendment prevents oil and gas leasing in the coastal plain of \nANWR without hearings in Congress. It does not preclude future \ndevelopment of this area, but only prevents Congress from using these \nsavings from oil and gas leasing in the current budget process.\n  The coastal plain--where the oil and gas leasing would occur is the \nbiological heart and the center of wildlife activity in the refuge. It \nis a critical part of our Nation's preeminent wilderness and would be \ndestroyed by oil development.\n  There are those who may think the northern coast of Alaska is too \nremote for us to worry about. I urge them to read the Congressional \nRecords from the 1870's. The men who initially urged the Congress to \nprotect a place called Yellowstone were subject to ridicule. Why, \ncritics asked, should we forgo the opportunity to dig up minerals from \nthe area? It's a remote place, and few Americans will ever venture \nthere.\n  Today, as we wrestle with America's future, let's be as far-sighted \nas that Congress eventually proved to be. Let's not cash in a unique \npiece of America for a brief, hoped-for rush of oil. Let's protect the \ncoastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge--\nforever. [[Page S7325]] \n  Mr. President, this amendment will not allow revenues to be used in \nthis budget that are supposed to come from doing something that \nCongress has not allowed.\n  This is how it should be done. My amendment accomplishes this \npurpose. And I encourage my colleagues to support this important \neffort.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield one 1 minute to the Senator from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the basic concept of this resolution is \nthat it assumes no increase in revenue. Senator Roth's amendment is one \nof the first to assume increased taxes. It is a tax increase. His \namendment will require an increase in revenue because it takes out the \nrevenue that would be generated by leasing 1.5 million acres of the \nNorth Slope. It is not wilderness. It has never been wilderness. It is \nthe largest potential area of oil and gas production in the United \nStates.\n  I oppose this amendment. The audacity of those that would keep that \nblocked up. They are leading to the concept where we are now purchasing \n55 percent of our oil from overseas, roughly $70 billion a year, \nbecause we are not producing oil from our own public lands.\n  I want to respond to suggestions that the coastal plain Congress set \naside in 1980 within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for a study of \nits oil and gas potential is wilderness. This land is not wilderness. \nCongress has not declared it wilderness. Congress set this area aside \nto study the oil potential of this area, the potential which we now \nwish to develop.\n  Mr. President, in 1980, Congress withdrew 19 million acres in \nnortheast Alaska to establish the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, an \nacreage that equals the entire State of Maine. Of that, Congress \ndesignated as wilderness 8 million acres, an acreage exceeding the \ncombined area of the States of New Jersey and Connecticut. Congress \ndesignated the other 11 million acres non-wilderness refuge lands. At \nthat time, Congress also set aside 1.5 million acres within the non-\nwilderness area of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to study them \nfor oil potential. It is this area which we want to develop, not \nwilderness within the Refuge.\n  I also want to respond to the suggestion of some Members and people \noutside this body continue to argue that this 1.5 million acre set-\naside represents the only, or the last, great wilderness. This is just \nnot so. Alaska, which has been singled out among all the states, is \nfull of lands that have been given a wilderness designation by \nCongress. Alaska, in fact, with over 56 million acres of wilderness, \nhas 64 percent of all wilderness acreage in the United States. This is \nan area larger than the States of North Carolina and South Carolina \ncombined. In the Arctic of Alaska, there are 21.2 million acres of \nwilderness, an area larger than the States of Vermont, New Hampshire, \nConnecticut, and Rhode Island.\n  In 1991, Alaska had over 57.5 million acres of wilderness. Compare \nthis with the State with the next greatest amount of wilderness--\nCalifornia--which had, in 1991, less than 6 million acres of \nwilderness. Compare this also with the fact that Connecticut, Delaware, \nIowa, Kansas, Maryland, Rhode Island, and the District of Columbia have \nno wilderness.\n  Within Alaska, we have individual wilderness areas larger than some \nother States. For example, Gates of the Arctic National Park, which at \n8.4 million acres, is twice the size of New Jersey, contains 7.1 \nmillion acres of wilderness--an area 6 times the size of Delaware. \nWithin the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, too, there are 8 million \nacres of wilderness, an area the size of Massachusetts and Delaware \ncombined.\n  But this area should not be confused with the 1.5 million acres that \nwe are discussing today for development of its oil potential. In \nsection 1002 of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of \n1980, Congress set this area aside and required Interior to report on \nthe resources and oil potential in this area for the future.\n  Interior conducted seismic studies of the area and concluded that \nthere is a 46-percent chance of discovering commercial quantities of \noil. It estimated that there may be as much as 9.2 billion barrels of \noil in the coastal plain--which would make it the largest remaining oil \nreserve in North America. To give some perspective of how much oil that \nis, 10 billion barrels have been pumped out of the Prudhoe Bay field--\nand it has been supplying 25 percent of this country's domestic oil \nneed since the late 70's.\n  Some have argued that oil and gas development would destroy the \nwildlife in the area. The same arguments were made when Congress \nconsidered the Trans Alaska Pipeline Authorization bill in 1973. But \nthe facts prove otherwise. Since oil and gas was developed at Prudhoe \nBay, the caribou population in the area has skyrocketed, increasing by \na whopping 600 percent. Likewise, populations of musk oxen, waterfowl, \nand polar bear have either remained stable or increased. In fact, with \nmodern drilling technology, only 5,000 to 7,000 acres--roughly one-half \nof one percent--of the 1.5 million acres in the coastal plain area \nwould be impacted by roads, structures, or other development \nactivities.\n  I urge you to let Alaska's oil resources go to work to reduce the \nbudget deficit, increase domestic oil production, and create jobs. I \nurge you not to be swayed by inaccurate statements about the ``1002 \narea'' on the Arctic coastal plain--inaccurate statements about its \nwilderness designation or its importance as the last great wilderness. \nCongress set aside this area to be studied for development of oil, and \nwe need to do it today for the future of this country's needs for \nenergy and jobs.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, at this time, I yield 2 minutes to the \nSenator from Ohio, followed by 2 minutes to the Senator from Virginia, \nfollowed by 2 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I thank the floor manager of the bill.\n  Mr. President, do I have a bargain for the U.S. Senate. This is the \nbest deal you are going to get all day, I think. For every dollar \nspent, you are going to get $5 back and no new taxes. How do we do \nthat? Sounds like blue smoke and mirrors, but it is not.\n  Mr. President, this amendment makes sure that we do not jeopardize \nmore than $9 billion in deficit reduction. I am pleased to be joined in \nthis amendment by my good friend from Illinois, Senator Simon.\n  Let me stress that there are a number of things about this budget \nresolution I support, not the least of which is its strong approach to \nreducing the deficit and controlling the costs of Government. And while \nI disagree with many of the priorities chosen by the chairman of the \nBudget Committee, I commend his commitment and perseverance in seeking \nto balance the budget so that we can leave our children and \ngrandchildren a legacy of hope, rather than debt.\n  Mr. President, I believe the amendment I am offering today furthers \nthat goal by preserving the antifraud compliance initiative of the \nInternal Revenue Service which will bring in almost $5 for every $1 we \nspend.\n  Currently $164.3 billion in unpaid taxes are owed to the Government. \nMuch of that is not collectible because of defunct corporations, \nbankruptcy, death or loss of employment. But $30.1 billion of that \ntotal is collectible right now. I think that bears repeating: $30.1 \nbillion is rightfully owed to the Government and is collectible right \nnow.\n  That is where the compliance initiative comes in. Last year, with \nbipartisan support, the Congress approved and funded the compliance \ninitiative to collect this debt and it is projected that $9.2 billion \nwill be collected over the next 5 years. I think that is a conservative \nestimate, I am happy to report that collections are ahead of schedule. \nIn the first quarter of the initiative alone, $101 million has been \ncollected--money that will reduce the deficit which is what the budget \nresolution before us is all about.\n  Mr. President, the first quarter results are laid out for all to see \nin this report which I ask unanimous consent to be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n[[Page S7326]]\n\n                     Status of Accounts Receivable\n\n       Currently, gross accounts receivable are $164.3 billion. \n     Included in that amount are an active accounts receivable \n     inventory and a currently uncollectible portion.\n       As of March 1995 the active portion of the accounts \n     receivable inventory was $81.4 billion; $30.1 billion of the \n     $81.4 is the net collectible portion of these receivables--\n     this is the part we can collect right now.\n       The remaining $51.1 billion of the $81.1 is the allowance \n     for doubtful accounts (ADA) of the uncollectible portion--the \n     part most likely to be written off.\n       Some of the reasons why these receivables will not be \n     collected are: defunct corporations; taxpayers who have died, \n     or suffered such other personal hardship as serious illness \n     or loss of employment; bankrupt businesses; inability to \n     locate taxpayers, and abatements due to IRS and taxpayer \n     errors.\n       The portion of our receivables in currently uncollectible \n     status is $82.9 billion. A large portion of this amount is \n     accrued penalties and interest. This category represents \n     accounts not included in the active portion because a \n     collection employee has determined a taxpayer cannot \n     currently pay owed taxes. There is a likelihood that some \n     portion of the amount owed could still be collected in the \n     future.\n       In FY 94 alone, the IRS collected $1.2 trillion in net tax \n     receipts. Also in FY 94, the active accounts receivables \n     increased 7 percent ($5.1 billion), the smallest growth in \n     active accounts receivable in 4 years.\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, this bipartisan antifraud program was \nplaced outside the discretionary spending caps for a very simple \nreason: the Budget Enforcement Act precludes scoring revenue gains from \nthese kinds of compliance activities.\n  Unfortunately, language placed in this year's budget resolution \nshifts the initiative back within the caps. That will have the effect \nof penalizing the initiative--and its substantial revenue gains--in the \nappropriations process, since it forces appropriators to consider the \ninitiative's costs without allowing them to account for its much \ngreater revenue gains.\n  This would likely lead to deep cuts, or even the abandonment, of an \ninitiative that brings almost five times what we spend on it. Those \ncuts would show up as short-term savings of $2 billion to the Treasury. \nBut it would ultimately lead to a net loss of at lest $9.2 billion over \n5 years. This is shortsighted, and it's bad business.\n  Mr. President, that is why members of both parties chose to remove \nthe compliance initiative from the caps last year. It is why the House \nbudget resolution continues that structure. This is not a partisan \nissue. When it came up before the Senate Budget Committee, my colleague \nfrom Missouri, Senator Bond, voted to keep the initiative outside the \ncaps. It is a sound business investment.\n  But Mr. President, the compliance initiative is not only about \nbringing in revenue properly owed the Government, it is also about \nfairness. I know that some view the IRS as an easy target because of \npublic animosity toward the agency. Of course, no one enjoys paying \ntaxes. But what really burns people up is to feel that they are paying \ntheir taxes while others are getting off scot-free.\n  I have talked with countless Ohioans who tell me that they diligently \nfill out their tax forms, go through all of the hassles with our all-\nto-complicated Tax Code, send in their payments, only to then hear \nabout those who are getting away with falsifying their returns or \nsubmitting none at all. Or corporations that have developed tax schemes \nto walk away from their liability while everyone else picks up the tab. \nIt is infuriating. Alot of people may not like the IRS, but I will \nguarantee you they like tax cheats a lot less.\n  Well, if our amendment fails tax cheats everywhere can rest easy. \nQuite simply, by putting the compliance initiative under the spending \ncaps, the budget resolution could force the IRS to abandon this \nimportant initiative which not only generates revenue, but also assures \nhonest Americans that others are also going to be paying their fair \nshare. This notion of fairness is the underlying principle behind the \nTax Code.\n  Eliminating the compliance initiative not only cuts revenue to the \nTreasury by more than $9 billion, even worse, it undermines confidence \nin our Tax Code by signalling to Americans that the Senate believes in \ndouble standards, that there are rules for hard-working Americans who \npay their taxes, and no rules for people who don't. More effective \ncompliance sends the right message: that there are no double standards \nwhen it comes to tax fairness. Everyone must pay their fair share, and \nwe will enforce the laws against those who don't.\n  Mr. President, I would urge my colleagues to recall that this entire \nissue was settled last year. The Senate and the House both approved and \nfunded the IRS compliance initiative, and the IRS has since done its \npart. The IRS is already ahead of schedule in collecting the taxes \ntargeted for this year, and that's before most of the new compliance \nemployees are even fully trained.\n  Now, I have heard that some Senators share my view that the \ncompliance initiative makes a lot of sense, but think that, to avoid \nsmoke and mirrors, it belongs on budget. In other words, they say that \nif the IRS and the administration think this is so important, they \nshould fund the Initiative within the caps. That is a reasonable notion \nthat in years past might have worked, and I probably would have agreed \nwith them.\n  However, as we all know, our efforts to eliminate the deficit have \nnecessitated that funds available in previous years simply don't exist \nany longer. But this initiative was developed to assist in that \neffort--to help reduce the deficit. That is why the current structure \nwas established. We all want to collect delinquent taxes, and a $5 \nreturn for every dollar spent is a wise investment by any standard.\n  I would argue, in fact, that those Senators who support the \ncompliance initiative but insist on placing it under the caps are \nperhaps the ones engaging in smoke and mirrors. These Senators get to \nsay that they support compliance, while knowing full well that under \nthe caps there is no money to pay for it. Unfortunately, the only ones \nwho stand to gain are dishonest people and corporations who are not \nwilling to pay their fair share. They mock the honest American \ntaxpayer. And who are the losers, the American taxpayer who has to pick \nup the tab, the Federal treasury which will lose more than $9 billion, \nand the big loser--deficit reduction.\n  Senator Simon and I want no part of an effort that so flies in the \nface of rationality. The amendment that we have introduced strikes that \npart of the budget resolution which requires that the compliance \ninitiative be funded on budget. The affect of the amendment would \nsimply be to return the compliance initiative to its off-budget status, \nwhere the Congress put it last year, and where it has been working to \nbring in delinquent taxes ever since.\n  Mr. President, I would urge by colleagues to support this amendment, \nso that we can get on with the task of deficit reduction.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the IRS compliance \ninitiative be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                       IRS Compliance Initiative\n\n\n                     need for compliance initiative\n\n       Last year, Congress approved a $405 million annual \n     investment to collect an additional $9.2 billion to reduce \n     the deficit over five years.\n       The structure under which the Compliance Initiative was \n     originally approved has provided the Congress and the IRS the \n     flexibility to meet budgetary objectives, while at the same \n     time strengthen compliance.\n\n\n                  irs compliance initiative is working\n\n       Early results show that IRS will meet or exceed the goal of \n     generating the additional $9.2 billion. Through the first \n     quarter of FY 1995, the initiative has generated an \n     additional $101 million, 31% of the FY 1995 commitment. The \n     payoff in later years will be higher when the new people \n     become fully productive.\n       Initiative results are being tracked. A new system for \n     tracking this initiative and related revenues raised by it \n     was developed by the IRS and accepted by GAO. The First \n     Quarter Report was delivered to Congress, on schedule, on \n     March 31.\n\n\n           cutting the initiative would increase the deficit\n\n       Congress is working hard to shrink government costs. With \n     regard to the initiative, however, for every appropriated \n     dollar ``saved'', tax revenues are reduced by nearly five \n     dollars. Elimination of the five-year initiative commitment \n     for FY 1996 and beyond would dramatically hinder the IRS' \n     ability to address significant areas of noncompliance that \n     the Congress has urged it to focus on--boosting examination \n     coverage, reducing accounts receivable, and curbing filing \n     fraud.\n       Further, only $300 million in additional revenues will have \n     been realized, sacrificing $8.9 billion that will be achieved \n     in FY 1996- [[Page S7327]] 1999, and an additional $2.1 \n     billion in years past FY 1999.\n       And this revenue loss relates only to direct revenues--the \n     Service's enforcement activities also encourage voluntary \n     compliance. Every one percent increase in voluntary \n     compliance increases tax revenues by $10 billion annually.\n        eliminating the initiative seriously damages collections\n\n       IRS has put in place a long range hiring and training plan. \n     By the end of May, over 5,000 people will have been hired or \n     redeployed to compliance jobs as part of this initiative. \n     These employees are collecting taxes already due, which if \n     not collected, increase the burden on those taxpayers who \n     voluntarily meet their tax obligations.\n       Elimination of the Initiative would require IRS to \n     immediately institute a hiring freeze and in FY 1996 furlough \n     the approximately 70,000 Compliance employees for up to 17 \n     days to reduce expenditures by $405 million. In FY 1997, \n     either further furloughs or a reduction in force would be \n     necessary to reduce employment. Attrition alone would not be \n     sufficient to get to lower staffing levels.\n\n\n                      safeguarding taxpayer rights\n\n       As tax administrators, one of the IRS' most important \n     responsibilities is to ensure that taxpayers are treated \n     fairly, courteously and with respect. The IRS is committed to \n     respecting the rights of all taxpayers.\n       In the last several years, the IRS has taken many steps \n     administratively to safeguard taxpayer rights. And IRS is \n     working with the Congress on proposed legislative changes \n     that would further enhance safeguards.\n       The commitment to taxpayer rights will continue to drive \n     IRS' work with regard to the compliance initiative and, in \n     fact, all of the IRS' efforts.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 22, 1995.\n       Dear Colleague: We are writing to inform you about an \n     important issue in the Senate Budget Resolution which, if \n     left unchanged, could cost the government and the American \n     people more than $9 billion in deficit reduction.\n       Last year, with bipartisan support, the Congress approved \n     and funded the IRS Compliance Initiative to collect over $9.2 \n     billion in unpaid taxes to reduce the deficit. And it has \n     been a real success--for every dollar we invest in this \n     program we will receive nearly five dollars in return.\n       Last year's budget resolution placed the Compliance \n     Initiative outside the discretionary caps for a very simple \n     reason: The Budget Enforcement Act precludes scoring revenue \n     gains resulting from these kinds of compliance activities. \n     However, language placed in this year's budget resolution \n     shifts the initiative back within the discretionary caps. \n     That will have the effect of penalizing the initiative in the \n     appropriations process, since it will force appropriators to \n     consider the initiative's costs without allowing them to \n     account for its much greater revenue gains.\n       As a result, this year's budget resolution will likely lead \n     to deep cuts in the Compliance Initiative, or even force the \n     IRS to abandon the initiative entirely. Those cuts would show \n     up as a short-term savings of $2 billion to the Treasury. But \n     it would ultimately result in a net loss of $9.2 billion over \n     5 years (and up to $11.3 billion including the out years). \n     Such short-sightedness would not be tolerated in the private \n     sector, and it should be rejected by the U.S. Senate, as \n     well.\n       During floor debate on the Budget Resolution, we will offer \n     an amendment to strike the proposed language on the \n     Compliance Initiative budget structure, so that we can \n     continue to reduce the deficit as Congress intended last \n     year. We urge you to support his amendment. Please have your \n     staff contact John Haseley with Senator Glenn (4-1519) or \n     Aaron Rappaport with Senator Simon (4-5573), with any \n     questions.\n           Sincerely,\n     John Glenn.\n     Paul Simon.\n\n  I urge support for this amendment. I will submit it at the \nappropriate time. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from Virginia is recognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. ROBB. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the managers of the bill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Did I yield the Senator time, or did the Senator from \nNebraska yield time?\n  Mr. ROBB. The time was yielded by the Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Can I yield it so the Senator from Nebraska has time \nleft? How much time does the Senator from Virginia want, 3 or 4 \nminutes?\n  Mr. ROBB. Two minutes will be adequate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 2 minutes to Senator Robb.\n\n\n                               Fair Share\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise in support of the fair share \namendment that was offered by the Senator from North Dakota, Senator \nConrad. I, with a number of other Senators, worked with him to try to \ndevelop an alternative to the budget resolution that is on the floor. I \ncontinue to accord to Senator Domenici and others credit for moving us \nin the right direction.\n  Their amendment, if you include the $113 billion of Social Security \ntrust funds, would come to balance under that math by the year 2002. \nThis amendment comes by the year 2004 and gives us true balance without \nusing the trust funds.\n  There are some very difficult choices still ahead of us. We are \ntalking about budget resolutions and not budgets. When we get down to \nthe hard work of the authorizing and appropriating, we are going to \nhave to be making some very, very painful and difficult choices. This \nparticular approach, in my judgment, spreads that burden more equitably \nand more fairly. Hence, I am very much in favor of it.\n  I, again, commend the Senator from New Mexico for his leadership and \nI, like some of the other folks on this side of the aisle, may end up \neven voting for the final version, even if this particular distribution \nfails, because I think it is important that we make the statement about \nthe seriousness of our intent to move toward true deficit reduction, \nand we can continue to disagree about some of the details.\n  With that, I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nConnecticut for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the \namendment offered by the Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad], the \none on the fair share budget; and the one offered by the Senator from \nDelaware [Mr. Roth] on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n               arctic national wildlife refuge amendment\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original \ncosponsor of Senator Roth's amendment to protect the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge from oil and gas development. The budget resolution \nbefore us directs the Energy Committee to authorize the lease of 1.5 \nmillion acres of this internationally significant refuge to oil \ncompanies. If this happens, it will virtually destroy one of the \nworld's crown jewels of nature for a small supply of oil. Yet, only \nlast week in Senate debate, oil from wilderness areas of Alaska's North \nSlope was characterized as a surplus that should be made available for \nexport. Clearly, oil from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is not a \nvital energy need for the United States.\n  The social and environmental cost of developing the refuge would be \nhuge. It would severely impact major calving grounds and disrupt \nmigration for one of the largest caribou herds on Earth. The Porcupine \nherd, estimated recently at over 152,000 caribou, uses the coastal \nplain of this refuge where development is targeted, to raise their \ncalves and prepare for the incredibly harsh winter migration. It is one \nof the few areas hospitable enough for calving and summer habitation. \nThe Canadian government provided permanent protection for their portion \nof this habitat in recognition of its importance and highly threatened \nstatus.\n  Development of this refuge will eliminate a significant amount of \nhabitat for other wildlife, including den-ning and feeding \nareas for polar bears and Arctic wolves. Forty three percent of all \npolar bear dens in and around the refuge occur in this area. It will \ndestroy a major habitat of musk oxen, and threaten staging grounds for \nmillions of migratory birds. It has the potential to contaminate water \nsupplies for vast areas of wilderness so pristine that they define the \nvery term itself. It will degrade one of the last scrapes of Arctic \nwilderness with each of the elements of the Arctic North Slope \necosystem preserved intact. Ninety percent of this system is already \nopen to oil and gas development. Without question, oil development will \nresult in major environmental damages to this unique wilderness.\n  It also has the potential to destroy the economic and social basis \nfor Indian cultures that have depended on these herds for thousands of \nyears. We know them as the Gwich'in, the Inuvialuit, the Aklavik and \nothers. We have heard their songs of the caribou. They remind us of \nNative Americans who once followed vast herds of bison on the Great \nPlains, and sang to their future as well. In the words of these Alaskan \nNatives, ``Our Arctic way of [[Page S7328]] life has endured for 20,000 \nyears. Why should it die now for 6 months of oil?''\n  As a result of Senate action to lift the oil export ban last week, it \nis no longer clear whose 6-month supply of oil this might be. \nRepeatedly, we were told during Senate debate that a glut of North \nSlope oil exists. So much so, that we need to export this surplus to \nmore profitable locations, such as Japan. Oil from the refuge, in all \nprobability, will not fill American gas pumps. Therefore, the whole \nenergy independence rationale for drilling in the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge is now clearly without any foundation. We would be \ndrilling for oil company profits, not energy independence. In the \nprocess, we will deplete our domestic oil reserves and destroy one of \nour most valuable environmental assets. I think this is a very bad \ntradeoff, and I think most Americans will agree.\n  The plan to develop the refuge is a bad idea for another very big \nreason: it doesn't make budget sense. Senator Roth offers a replacement \noffset that more than covers the projected revenues from oil leases, \nthe closure of the tax break for expatriate millionaires. This tax \nbreak is for people who renounce their U.S. citizenship to shield their \nenormous wealth from the taxes every hard-working American must pay. It \nshould not be preserved at the expense of the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge or any other significant resource of this Nation.\n  The deficit reduction value of the proposed Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge lease is clouded by several unresolved issues. First, the $1.4 \nbillion figure scored by CBO assumes a 50-percent State share, even \nthough State law calls for a 90-percent share. Second, there are \nuncertainties about the ownership of submerged lands within the refuge. \nIf it is determined that these lands belong to Alaska, it reduces the \nlease value of the refuge further. Third, the most recent offshore \nState lease near the refuge yielded only $48.41 per acre, compared to \nthe estimated $1,533.00 per acre assumed by CBO--a huge discrepancy. \nFinally, the budget process itself is simply the wrong place to \nauthorize major, irreversible actions of this kind because it limits \nnormal debate, testimony, and public input.\n  The current budget rule on public asset sales, which this budget \nresolution seeks to change, prohibits the scoring of these sales for \ndeficit reduction for good reason. It was created in 1985 during the \nGramm-Rudman-Hollings Act to avoid bogus, shortsighted asset sales in \nthe name of deficit reduction. Nothing has changed to reduce the need \nfor this rule today as we debate the fate of the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge.\n  Much has been said since last November about the views of the \nAmerican people on protecting the environment. So often we hear the \npresumption that Americans care less. But, this past week a national \npoll by ABC and the Washington Post found quite the opposite, as has \nevery national poll since the election. Seventy percent of Americans \nfeel the Federal Government has not done enough to protect the \nenvironment. In the case of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and \nmany other treasured public lands across this Nation, I can only agree. \nWe should not transfer public refuges, parks, forests or energy \nreserves without extensive hearings, informed testimony, and debate, \nparticularly when they are so near and dear to the American people.\n  I want read a few words from some of the many letters I have received \nurging me to protect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge:\n  The Ambassador of Canada, Mr. Raymond Chretien, wrote:\n\n       Canada believes that opening the Arctic Refuge to oil and \n     gas development will lead to major disruptions in the \n     sensitive calving grounds and will affect migratory patterns \n     of the Porcupine Caribou Herd on which thousands of Canadian \n     and American Aboriginal people depend.\n       In signing the 1987 Canada-United States Agreement on the \n     Conservation of the Porcupine Caribou Herd, the United States \n     and Canada both recognized the transboundary nature of these \n     wildlife resources and our joint responsibility for \n     protecting them.\n       In 1984, Canada gave wilderness protection to its portion \n     of the caribou calving grounds by creating the Northern Yukon \n     National Park. The critical calving grounds in the United \n     States, however, do not have formal protection and remain \n     vulnerable to development, as evidenced by the recent \n     budgetary proposals.\n       Canada believes that the best way to ensure the future of \n     the shared wildlife population of the Arctic Coastal Plain is \n     to designate the ``1002'' lands as wilderness, thereby \n     providing equal protection on both sides of this border to \n     this irreplaceable living resource.\n\n  Gwich'in Tribe, Renewable Resource Board, Mr. Robert Charlie, wrote:\n\n       Opening up the Arctic Refuge to (oil and gas) development \n     would have a drastic negative impact on the Porcupine Caribou \n     Herd which calves in the area. In turn, the decline of the \n     herd would devastate the aboriginal cultures in Yukon and \n     Northwest Territories which rely on caribou for cultural and \n     economic survival . . .\n       Both President Clinton and Prime Minister Chretien oppose \n     drilling in the refuge.\n       Oil development is opposed by all First Nations in Canada \n     and Alaska, with exception of the Inupiat who have financial \n     interests there.\n       The calving grounds in the ``1002'' lands are recognized by \n     the International Porcupine Caribou Board as the most \n     sensitive habitat of the herd.\n       A study released last week by the Alaska Department of Fish \n     and Game links the drop in growth rate of the Central Arctic \n     Herd at Prudhoe Bay to eviction of cows and calves by oil \n     development.\n       Other department reports in preparation collaborate on the \n     negative impacts of development on caribou calving.\n\n  Wildlife Management Advisory Council of the North Slope, Mr. Lindsay \nStaples, wrote:\n\n       Allowing oil development in the Arctic Refuge would \n     severely impact on the Porcupine Caribou herd. A decline in \n     the herd would mean social and economic ruin for the \n     indigenous peoples who rely on the herd. The Inuvialuit of \n     Aklavik, Northwest Territories are among those whose \n     lifestyle and culture would be at risk.\n\n  President Jimmy Carter, op-ed to the New York Times, wrote:\n\n       The new Congress must be reawakened to protecting the \n     interests of all Americans by protecting public lands in \n     Alaska. For what is at stake is an unparalleled system of \n     Federal reserves protecting wildlife, fish and wilderness. \n     Polar bears, musk ox, wolves and a herd of 150,000 caribou \n     roam the remote Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife \n     Refuge in the far north--a place often called ``America's \n     Serengeti . . .\n       November's election was not a mandate to damage Alaska's \n     environmental treasures. Poll after poll has shown that the \n     American people remain fully committed to the protection that \n     makes the unspoiled reaches of our Nation the envy of the \n     world.\n\n  Mr. President, I believe it is essential for this Nation to balance \nits budget. I salute the budget committee for taking bold and concrete \nsteps to reach this goal. This is a very difficult, complicated task \nthat requires sacrifice by all of us. I believe Senator Roth's \namendment provides a better way to reach this goal than the proposed \ndevelopment of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. It trades something \nwe do not need, a tax break for rich people who do not care about our \ncountry enough to maintain their citizenship, for something we do need \nand are willing to take care of, one of or most precious natural \nresources.\n  In 1991, I was 1 of 44 Senators who voted against a motion to proceed \nwith an energy bill that contained a plan to develop oil on this \nrefuge. Today, we must renew this commitment to safeguarding this \nnational treasure. We must continue our stewardship of our natural \nresources and natural heritage. I ask all my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle to join Senator Roth, me and the many other Senators \nsupporting this amendment today. We may not have a second chance.\n                    technology research and training\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I wanted to speak briefly on the \namendment I am pleased to cosponsor with Senators Bingaman and \nRockefeller on technology research and training.\n  The Federal Government, since the Second World War, by its \ninvestments in research and support of technology, has really driven \nthis economy. This budget begins to dismantle the apparatus that has \ncreated so much wealth, growth, and jobs, and we desperately need to \ncompete in the world today. It is the beginning of kind of an economic \ndisarmament as the world becomes more competitive. In this budget, \nwhile other nations are increasing their relative investment in \nresearch and development and training and technology, we actually \ndecrease the investment that America is making.\n  In Japan and Germany, and other industrialized nations, the \ninvestments that are made in research and training and technology are \nbeyond partisan and political debate. They stand up there with national \ndefense. Those [[Page S7329]] folks in Japan and Germany are probably \nthe ones who will not only find this debate shocking but will get a big \nlaugh out of the fact that we are cutting some of these programs.\n  The Commerce Department, the agency that has finally brought together \nour effort to take the research from the laboratories, convert it into \ntechnologies that create jobs and then have an aggressive export \npromotion program that sells those products abroad is actually being \ndismantled in the budget before us.\n  While I support the bottom line that the budget achieves, these are \nthe wrong priorities, and I hope through the sense of the Senate that \nwe will express our support for different priorities.\n  I find it ironic that the budget resolution, by cutting critical \ninvestments in science, technology and trade, depletes future sources \nof revenues for the national budget, and ultimately weakens our economy \nrather than strengthens it. In trying to save dollars today, we are \nthrowing away the investments with the biggest payoffs tomorrow. We are \nstealing from our own pockets tomorrow, and from our children to pay \nfor budget cuts today. The strategy simply makes no sense.\n  Research and development, applied research, export promotion, and \ntrade law enforcement. These efforts are the fuel of our economy. \nTraditionally, the Government has played an important role in stoking \nour economic furnace with selected, well-defined R programs that \nstimulate the economy and protect and promote our interests abroad. \nThey have been a critical engine for economic growth in the United \nStates and are one of its major competitive advantages. The budget \nresolution's deep cuts into research and development have the potential \nto devastate our research institutions, institutions that have \ninternational reputations for excellence. These institutions spawn the \nnew ideas that form the basis for innovation in the marketplace. No \nmajor research institution is left unscathed--the Department of \nCommerce trade and technology programs, the National Institutes of \nHealth, the Department of Energy Labs, NASA, and even the premiere \nbasic research institution, the National Science Foundation. The lack \nof judgment in cutting these programs is obvious when one notes that \nthe direct return on investment to our economy, from research and \ndevelopment is 30 percent. This figure does not even take into account \nindirect social benefits from research and development.\n  Currently, our Federal investment is research and development is 1.1 \npercent of GDP, split almost evenly between defense and civilian R \nIf we remove the defense component and add on the investment by the \nprivate sector, we find that our investment, as a nation, in civilian \nR is 2.1 percent of GDP. We can compare the R investment trends in \nthe United States with those of other industrialized nations. Today, we \nare behind Japan and Germany in this critical factor. This historic \npattern relative to Japan and Germany has had a direct impact on our \neconomies. Since the 1950's, our per capita GDP has risen an average of \n1.8 percent per year, while in Japan the rate has been 5.2 percent per \nyear, and in Germany, 3.1 percent per year. R means new products and \nnew technologies. The correlation between R investment and economic \ngrowth is real.\n  While other nations are increasing their relative investment in R, \nthe current budget resolution would decrease our R investment. It \nmarks a historic reversal in U.S. policy toward science and R By the \nyear 2002, the budget resolution would decrease our Federal investment \nin R by approximately 40 percent. The result would be to decrease our \nnational investment in R from 1.1 percent of GDP to 0.68 percent of \nGDP. Even if other nation's R investments remain constant, and do not \ngrow, as is the trend, we fall behind countries like France and the \nUnited Kingdom. The lead that Japan and Germany have over us grows \nsubstantially. This graph does not consider the multitude of rapidly \ngrowing emerging nations, who are rapidly becoming fierce competitors \nin the global marketplace.\n  These conservative estimates of the results of the decrease is \ninvestment in R have major implications for our ability to compete in \nthe global marketplace with products that incorporate the innovations \nconceived by our R efforts. It is not sufficient to just conceive of \ngood ideas. These ideas must become products and then be brought to \nmarket, at home and abroad. Our success in the global marketplace is \ndirectly reflected in our standard of living and our quality of life. \nThe budget resolution completely dissolves the agency that has been the \nmost effective in technology development and trade promotion, the \nDepartment of Commerce, ending its programs in these areas up front.\n  The effort to get our creative ideas to market, to feed our economy, \nhas had a bipartisan history. Landmark legislation by Senator Dole and \nthen Senator Bayh led to a Federal initiative in technology transfer \nfrom the federal laboratory bench to industry. I applaud the forward-\nlooking, innovative thinking that was pioneered by our current majority \nleader. The Advanced Technology Program was crafted by congressional \nleaders on both sides of the aisle during the Bush administration. \nThese programs are leading us into the 21st century, with significant \npotential for enormous returns on investment. For example, the \nManufacturing Extension Program, out of the Department of Commerce, was \ndesigned to help some 370,000 small- and medium-sized manufacturers, \nraise their performance to world standards. This program has returned \n$8 to the economy for every dollar the Federal Government has invested. \nThese technology programs account for less than 2 percent of total \nFederal R investment but are critical to our ability to capitalize on \nour innovations. We must not cede to other nations the economic \nbenefits of American ingenuity. Along with the elimination of the \nDepartment of Commerce, these programs are either slated for deep cuts \nor elimination.\n  Getting our products into markets around the world has been one of \nthe real achievements of the Department of Commerce in recent years. \nThe Department of Commerce has worked aggressively to increase exports. \nIn the last 18 months, the Commerce Department successfully advocated, \non behalf of U.S. companies, contracts with a total U.S. export content \nof $25 billion. In other words, for every dollar spent on the \nDepartment of Commerce, $6 have been generated in the economy. Commerce \nhas eliminated unnecessary and outmoded regulations on more than $32 \nbillion in exports, allowing domestic companies the freedom to succeed \nin overseas markets. And, these accomplishments have been made with the \nsmallest Cabinet budget. The advocacy for U.S. trade will be even more \ncritical in coming years as the global marketplace becomes a larger and \nlarger component of our economy.\n  There are new international competitiveness issues on our horizon and \nwe will need to be effective and efficient in our responsiveness to the \nrapidly changing global economy. New markets are emerging in developing \ncountries. Conservative estimates suggest that 60 percent of the growth \nin world trade will be with these developing countries over the next \ntwo decades. During a time when we will need increased emphasis on \ninternational trade we are contemplating eliminating the only agency \nthat advocates for American business, in the Cabinet and abroad.\n  The United States has a large share of imports in big emerging \nmarkets. We are doing well, but much of our edge is due to our large \nshare in Latin America. Vigorous efforts are necessary in other parts \nof the world, particularly Asia, where Japan heavily out-invests the \nUnited States. These markets combined, make up the largest component of \nUnited States exports, and these markets are growing rapidly. But, with \nthe cuts in the budget resolution, we cannot maintain these efforts. We \nwill forfeit the money they bring into our country. We will lose their \nimpetus to our economy. Instead, we are cutting the most critical \nprograms in the smallest Cabinet budget, in the name of decreasing the \ndeficit. It just does not make sense to cut these revenue producing \nfunctions. Cutting these trade functions, and the Department of \nCommerce, will ultimately increase the deficit, not decrease it. I \noften lament the near-sightedness of a corporate America forced to \nfocus on the next quarter's [[Page S7330]] profits. I hate to see my \nSenate colleagues succumb to a similar narrow focus.\n  In conclusion, I support this amendment in order to assure that when \nwe cut government spending, which I strongly support, we cut wisely, \nand we do not cut government investments that build our economy. We \nmust maintain our investments in research, technology and trade \npromotion to ensure our future economic strength and international \ncompetitiveness. This amendment stands for exactly that point.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a \nletter to Senator Bingaman from the Institute of Electrical and \nElectronics Engineers.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                       Institute of Electrical and\n\n\n                                  Electronics Engineers, Inc.,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 24, 1995.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Hart Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: As a representative of the Institute \n     of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc., an \n     organization that promotes the career and policy interests of \n     240,000 U.S. electrical engineers (IEEE-USA), I am compelled \n     to alert you to our unwavering support for the U.S. research \n     and development base. We have become increasingly alarmed at \n     the pace and scope of the rescissions and proposed funding \n     reductions and eliminations of R programs that we see as \n     vital to U.S. industry, the economy and our global \n     competitiveness. Estimates of a 30-40% reduction over the \n     next 5 years in Federal support for research and technology \n     development will have a lingering and deleterious effect on \n     our economy.\n       In the budget resolution recently passed by the House and \n     in the pending Senate counterpart, drastic reductions to R \n     programs across the board are assumed. No one will argue \n     against the merits of deficit reduction. A widening national \n     debt has a very draining effect on our economy and our \n     ability to invest wisely for the future. But in our zeal to \n     find ways to cut government spending, programs which are \n     designed to boost our economy and, in turn revenues, are \n     being sacrificed. This short sightedness needs to be short \n     lived before irrevocable harm is done to the U.S. R base \n     and jobs are lost.\n       We at IEEE-USA are very glad to learn of your intention to \n     offer an amendment to S. Con. Res. 13, the Senate Budget \n     Resolution, to express a sense of the Senate that research, \n     technology and trade promotion are vital to the future of the \n     U.S. economy. Research programs are vulnerable because they \n     do not always have the visibility of many other government \n     programs and therefore are easy targets for budget cutters. \n     Your amendment reminds the whole Congress of the importance \n     of research and technology and hopefully will urge the budget \n     cutters and appropriators to use extreme caution before \n     haphazardly cutting or eliminating needed programs.\n       The IEEE-USA supports your amendment and commends you for \n     your leadership on this issue and stands ready to assist you \n     and your staff in this effort. Please contact Jim Anton of \n     the Washington staff for further information or support at \n     202-785-0017.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                         Joel B. Snyder, P.E.,\n\n                           Vice President, Professional Activities\n                                 and Chair, U.S. Activities Board.\n\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise to, in the strongest terms, \nsupport this amendment which I am pleased to cosponsor. I congratulate \nthe Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman, for his continued leadership \non behalf of the Nation's economic needs and potential, and join \nSenator Lieberman in helping to make this case to our colleagues.\n  The proposal to eliminate the U.S. Department of Commerce is \nincredibly short-sighted and will be extremely harmful to the \ncompetitive position of the United States. The Commerce Department's \nresponsibility for trade enforcement, export promotion, manufacturing, \nand technology is a focused mission for American jobs and growth, and \nquite simply, its elimination is tantamount to economic surrender.\n  To begin with, the Commerce Department acts as the cop on the beat, \nenforcing U.S. trade laws against internationally recognized unfair \ntrading practices. Domestic industry is a huge fan of the Department's \nImport Administration, and a move to eliminate it, or roll it into \nanother agency with a very different mandate, is only going to be red \nmeat for our competitors. I know this from painful experience. Those of \nus who represent industries such as steel have seen what unfair trade, \ndumping and subsidized imports, can mean to local economies and our \nNation's overall economy. The Import Administration does yeomen's work \nenforcing our domestic trade laws--which look out for American \nbusinesses and American jobs--and to move it somewhere else is not only \nthoughtless, it is dangerous.\n  Mr. President, I will not sit by while the one agency that is looking \nout for American business, at home and abroad, is dismantled for \npolitical gain. The Department of Commerce's trade promotion arm is the \nmatchmaker for thousands of businesses promoting products made in the \nUnited States--by American workers--in markets all over the world. I \nspeak from experience here. In January, I led a trade mission of West \nVirginia businesses to Japan and Taiwan, we called it Project Harvest \nbecause that is what we were trying to do, sow the seeds of \nrelationships that would reap tangible benefits for small and large \nWest Virginia companies and their workers. In all this we worked \nclosely with the Department of Commerce's Foreign Commercial Service, \nand in less than 6 months, these companies have already secured \nmillions of dollars' worth of contracts.\n  I know what my friends across the aisle are saying about their so-\ncalled mandate, but I challenge any one of them to tell me that they \nhave one company in their State such as Precision Samplers, that want \nto see the Department of Commerce eliminated. As a result of our trade \nmission, and with the help of the Department of Commerce, Precision \nSamplers has already signed contracts worth half a million dollars. And \nthe list doesn't end there, West Virginia companies such as the Dean \nCo., and FCX Systems and Precision Coil have all signed lucrative \ncontracts since our trade mission, and a big thanks goes to the experts \nat the Department of Commerce who helped make these deals happen. Small \ncompanies such as these owe a great deal to Department of Commerce \nexport promotion programs, and I doubt they would want to see that \nsupport network eliminated.\n  I also want to make a special note of the role played by the Bureau \nof Export Administration [BXA]. BXA evaluates national security \ninterests when American companies seek applications for the export of \ndual use goods and technology; those are products that could have \nmilitary applications. There are a lot of things that need to be \nconsidered in these applications, but as a Commerce entity, BXA has \nlongstanding close relations with exporters and the business community \nthat other agencies simply don't have. However, BXA has to work with \nall those other agencies in making its evaluations. Export licensing \nhas foreign policy implications, so involves the State Department; it \nhas national security implications, so works with DOD; it has to clear \nthe sale of nuclear equipment that DOE is expert in, or other things \nthat the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency has a role to play. And \nBXA coordinates all this while always looking out for the needs of \nAmerican businesses.\n  We need to maintain an umbrella organization that looks out for \nAmerica's business interests at home and across the globe. Creating a \nDepartment of Trade would be better than breaking up all the trade \nfunctions of the Department of Commerce and moving them all over the \nGovernment, to Justice, DOD, Treasury, the ITC, USTR, wherever. But why \nreinvent the wheel? The Department of Commerce works. This idea of \nmaking a Department of Trade or expanding USTR is merely moving around \nthe deck chairs. And maybe it is even worse. This particular ship is \nstanding tall and sailing true. Breaking it down and moving it around \nis a bad idea.\n  I also want to discuss a related set of proposed cuts--support for \nnew breakthrough technologies. It is an astounding proposal, and one \nthat shows how soon some forget what it takes for America to win in the \nnew global economy.\n  We should remember the lessons of the 1970's and early 1980's. During \nthose years, America led in science and new ideas, only to see American \ninventions such as the VCR commercialized first by other countries. \nOther governments [[Page S7331]] have long used research consortia and \nother aid to help their firms overcome the technical hurdles associated \nwith critical but risky new ideas. And time after time, we found our \ncompetitors taking our ideas and sending them back to us in the form of \nVCRs and other new products.\n  Over the past 10 years, both American industry and the U.S. \nGovernment have taken steps to make sure Americans profit more from our \nnew inventions and discoveries. Industry and the venture capital \nindustry have focused their attention sharply on getting the next \ngeneration of products out the door. Both competitive pressures and \nWall Street's push for short-term results have led our firms to focus \ntheir limited R dollars on developing new products. That is good in \nthe short term, but it also means that even our largest firms have been \nforced to cut longer-term research that is essential for the future but \nwhich will not pay off for 10 years.\n  In the real world, as opposed to some theoretical world, American \ncompanies--both large and small--increasingly have turned to cost-\nshared projects with the Government and each other to develop these \nrisky but vital longer-term technologies. These are the breakthrough \ntechnologies that will create new industries and jobs in the future--\ntechnologies such as next-generation electronics, low-cost composite \nmaterials for bridges and other structures, low-cost but highly \nreliable processes for making biotechnology products, and advanced \ntechniques for computer-aided manufacturing. Cost-shared projects in \nsuch areas create the new seed corn for a new generation of American \nindustry.\n  At the Federal level, these cost-shared technology partnerships with \nindustry now constitute less than 3 percent of the Government's $72 \nbillion annual R budget. The entire budget of the Government's \ncivilian technology agency--the Commerce Department's National \nInstitute of Standards and Technology, NIST--constitutes little more \nthan 1 percent of Federal R With the cold war over and the world \neconomic race in full swing, this is hardly overspending.\n  And mark my words, other nations will not drop out of the world \neconomic race just because Congress has thrown in the towel in the \nfight to help develop and market leading edge technologies. Along with \nJapan and Europe, we now see major new industry-government technology \ninvestments in South Korea, Taiwan, and even smaller states such as \nSingapore. In the real world, these countries are out to clean our \nclocks--and they want to use America's own university discoveries and \nentrepreneurial ideas to do it.\n  The United States has just now climbed back to a solid, but fragile, \nlead in most key technologies. Well-run, cost-shared Government \nprograms have played an important role in helping American industry \nregain that lead. But we now combine government cutbacks with ever \nincreasing Wall Street pressures for companies to focus their own funds \nonly on the short term, then we will most certainly fall behind again. \nAnd the American worker and the American dream will be the losers.\n  Killing Federal technology programs, including those of the Commerce \nDepartment, will send our companies into economic battle with second-\nrate support and one arm tied behind their backs. It is a prescription \nfor economic retreat and economic stagnation. In the name of some \nideology, we risk destroying key foundations of future prosperity. And \nfuture generations will wonder why the Nation that used industry-\ngovernment R cooperation to create the modern agriculture, aircraft, \nand biotechnology sectors abandoned a proven formula and let other \nnations walk all over us.\n  Which brings me back to the amendment and the Department of Commerce. \nThis amendment is quite simple, it states that ``the public welfare, \neconomy, and national security of the United States have benefitted \nenormously from the investment the Federal Government has made over the \npast fifty years in research, technology, and trade promotion and trade \nlaw enforcement,'' and that these should remain a national priority for \nthe 21st century.\n  Again, Mr. President, the elimination of an agency of Government so \nvital to our Nation's interests is tantamount to economic surrender. I \nthink our international competitors will see it as just that. In my \nview, proposals to eliminate the Department of Commerce amount to \nunilateral disarmament, and I will fight against those who are \ndetermined to raise this white flag.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have no one seeking time on my side. I \nneed some time, but does the Senator from Nebraska want another 2 or 3 \nminutes of my time, if he needs it?\n  Mr. EXON. I will simply advise the Senator, possibly could we take \ncare of the matters that have been agreed to now? I have one Senator \nwho asked to have 3\\1/2\\ minutes. I have the 3\\1/2\\ minutes remaining, \nbut now I do not have the Senator. I would like to give the remainder \nto him.\n  Maybe the Senator from New Mexico has some time to give me for \nclosing matters. If not, may we take care of those matters agreed to?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1145\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 86, strike line 11 through line 25 on page 87 and \n     insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 305. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS ON A UNIFORM ACCOUNTING \n                   SYSTEM IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND \n                   NONPARTISAN COMMISSION ON ACCOUNTING AND \n                   BUDGETING.\n\n       (a) Finding.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Much effort has been devoted to strengthening Federal \n     internal accounting controls in the past. Although progress \n     has been made in recent years, there still exists no uniform \n     Federal accounting system for Federal Government entities and \n     institutions.\n       (2) As a result, Federal financial management continues to \n     be seriously deficient, and Federal financial management and \n     fiscal practices have failed to identify costs, failed to \n     reflect the total liabilities of congressional actions, and \n     failed to accurately report the financial condition of the \n     Federal Government.\n       (3) Current Federal accounting practices do not adequately \n     report financial problems of the Federal Government or the \n     full cost of programs and activities. The continued use of \n     these practices undermines the Government's ability to \n     provide credible and reliable financial data, contributes to \n     waste and inefficiency, and will not assist in achieving a \n     balanced budget.\n       (4) Waste and inefficiency in Federal Government undermine \n     the confidence of the American people in the Government and \n     reduces the Federal Government's ability to address \n     adequately vital public needs.\n       (5) To rebuild the accountability and credibility of the \n     Federal Government and restore public confidence in the \n     Federal Government, a uniform Federal accounting system, that \n     fully meets the accounting standards and reporting objectives \n     for the Federal Government, must be immediately established \n     so that all assets and liabilities, revenues and expenditures \n     or expenses, and the full cost of programs and activities of \n     the Federal Government can be consistently and accurately \n     recorded, monitored, and uniformly reported throughout all \n     government entities for budgeting and control and management \n     evaluation purposes.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     resolution include the following assumptions:\n       (1) Uniform federal accounting system.--(A) A uniform \n     Federal accounting system should be established to \n     consistently compile financial data across the Federal \n     Government, and to make full disclosure of Federal financial \n     data, including the full cost of Federal programs and \n     activities, to the citizens, the Congress, the President, and \n     agency management.\n       (B) Beginning with fiscal year 1997, the President should \n     require the heads of agencies to--\n       (i) implement and maintain a uniform Federal accounting \n     system; and\n       (ii) provide financial statements; in accordance with \n     generally accepted accounting principles applied on a \n     consistent basis and established in accordance with proposed \n     Federal accounting standards and interpretations recommended \n     by the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board and other \n     applicable law.\n       (2) Nonpartisan advisory commission on accounting and \n     budgeting.--(A) A temporary advisory commission should be \n     established to make objective and nonpartisan recommendations \n     for the appropriate treatment of capital expenditures under a \n     uniform Federal accounting system that is consistent with \n     generally accepted accounting principles.\n       (B) The Commission should be appointed on a nonpartisan \n     basis, and should be composed of public and private experts \n     in the fields of finance, economics, accounting, and other \n     related professions.\n       (C) The Commission should report to the President and the \n     Congress by August 1, 1995, on its recommendations, and \n     should include in its report a detailed plan for implementing \n     such recommendations.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to thank the very \ndistinguished floor managers of the budget resolution, Senator Domenici \nand Senator Exon, for their willingness to work with me on this \namendment, which would establish a temporary, nonpartisan advisory \ncommission on accounting and budgeting. I appreciate their support for \nthe amendment, and I am grateful to their staff, Austin Smythe and Jodi \nGrant, who have been extremely helpful and pleasant to work with.\n  The amendment I am proposing modifies section 305 of the resolution \ncurrently before the Senate. Section 305 recognizes that unlike most \nprivate business and state governments, no uniform Federal accounting \nsystem exists for Federal entities and institutions. This lack of \nuniformity contributes to the difficulty of accurately reporting the \nfinancial condition of the Federal Government and achieving a balanced \nFederal budget.\n  To help rebuild accountability and credibility in the Federal \nGovernment and advance the trend toward a ``private sector'' type \nfinancial management policy, section 305 calls for a uniform Federal \naccounting system that is consistent with generally accepted accounting \nprinciples and proposed Federal accounting standards recommended by the \nFederal Accounting Standards Advisory Board. Once in place, a uniform \naccounting system should enable us to better assess the full cost of \nFederal programs and activities. Actual costs will be consistently and \naccurately recorded, monitored, and uniformly reported by all \ngovernment entities for budgeting and control and management \nevaluation.\n  Mr. President, I believe to achieve the commendable goals set forth \nin section 305, we first must address the issue of the treatment of \ncapital expenditures for Federal accounting and budgeting purposes. \nPrivate businesses throughout the country and many States already have \nin place accounting systems and budgets that deal with capital \nexpenditures in realistic terms. I believe we in the Federal Government \ncan learn from their experiences.\n  I am proposing the establishment of a temporary advisory commission \non accounting and budgeting that would study and make recommendations \non the appropriate treatment of capital expenditures under a uniform \nFederal accounting system that is consistent with generally accepted \naccounting principles.\n  Commission members, to be appointed on a nonpartisan basis, would \ninclude public and private experts in the fields of finance, economics, \naccounting, and related professions.\n  By August 1, 1995, the Commission would report its recommendations to \nthe President and the Congress. In the report, Commission members would \nset forth a detailed plan for implementation of their recommendations. \nIt is my hope that if the Commission includes a recommendation on the \nuse of a capital budget, its report will specify the components of such \na budget in the context of a unified, balanced Federal budget. I \nunderstand many of my colleagues currently oppose the use of a Federal \ncapital budget. I believe that as we take steps to streamline the \nFederal Government, improve efficiency, and operate Federal systems in \na manner more consistent with the private sector, all options should be \nreexamined and given a fresh analysis. In my view, this is particularly \nrelevant in the context of section 305 of the budget resolution, which \nas I stated earlier, calls for a uniform Federal accounting system \nconsistent with generally accepted accounting principles.\n  Mr. President, the commission I am advocating can serve a very \nimportant service to the Nation. The Commission will examine, in an \nobjective, nonpartisan forum, the treatment of capital expenditures and \nlong-term investments in the context of a uniform Federal accounting \nsystem. By reporting on this work to the President and the Congress \nwithin the time frame specified in the amendment, which I calculate to \nbe before final reconciliation of the fiscal year 1996 Federal budget, \nthe Commission's recommendations could serve as the basis for \nresolution of some the serious and divisive problems we in the Congress \nhave encountered, and will continue to encounter, as we work through \nthe budget process. I look forward to the results of the Commission's \nwork, and again, I thank the distinguished floor managers of the \nresolution for their assistance with this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1146) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield the remaining 3\\1/2\\ minutes of the \ntime to the final Senator to debate the issue, as of now at least, my \ncolleague from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleague from \nNebraska. [[Page S7333]] \n  Mr. President, in the fairly short time that I have available--and I \nam pleased to have the precious time taken for these couple of \nmoments--I would like to describe several amendments that I have \nprepared which will be voted on this afternoon.\n  First, Senator Rockefeller and I will offer an amendment to close the \nso-called Benedict Arnold billionaires' tax loophole. We would transfer \nthe savings to veterans programs. I call this the ``from expatriates to \npatriots'' amendment. Then I will be offering four amendments that \nwould create exceptions to the so-called firewall that prohibits \ntransfers between the military and domestic programs.\n  The amendment would allow the Senate, by a majority vote, as opposed \nto 60 votes, to transfer funds from the wasteful bureaucratic overhead \nand procurement in the military budget for specific and compelling \nreasons. The purposes would be up to $2 billion to address the problem \nof domestic violence; up to $1 billion to strengthen reinforcement of \nimmigration laws; up to $5 billion to hire police officers for \ncommunity policing and to do prison building; and up to $100 million \nfor research on breast cancer.\n  My final amendment would create a 60-vote point of order against \ncutting Medicare or Medicaid to pay for any tax cuts for the rich.\n  Some of my Republican friends have claimed that that is not their \nintent, and I say, well, then let us put it in writing and make it \nenforceable. Certainly, the intent was challenged when we saw the chart \ngo up at an earlier time in this debate when the Senator from Texas \nproposed tax cuts amounting to over $300 billion.\n  So, Mr. President, when I look and see those who have made their \nfortunes in this country and decide to renounce their citizenship so \nthey do not have to pay a State tax, they do not have to pay capital \ngains taxes; they move out of here, give up their American citizenship, \nleave this place where their fortunes were made, where their families \nwere raised just to avoid some taxes, to take something out of these \nhuge fortunes that went abroad, I want to give it to the patriots, \nthose who served their country, those who need help, those who are \nturning to the VA for hospital care, those who are turning to the VA \nfor prostheses, those who are turning to the VA for counseling. I want \nto take it from the Benedict Arnolds and give it to those who served \ntheir country.\n  With that--I do not see the ranking Member--is there any time left on \nour side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from New Jersey has \nexpired.\n  The Senator from New Mexico has 7 minutes 52 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Democrats have how much?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired on the Democratic side.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1147\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate of the United States that \n the reforms and proposals contained within the Independent Budget for \n      Veterans Affairs, Fiscal Year 1996, should be given careful \n  consideration in an effort to ensure the Nation's commitment to its \n                               veterans)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for Mr. Dole \n     and Mr. Simpson, proposes an amendment numbered 1147.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . CONSIDERATION OF THE INDEPENDENT BUDGET FOR VETERANS \n                   AFFAIRS, FISCAL YEAR 1996.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Whereas over 26,000,000 veterans are eligible for \n     veterans health care;\n       (2) Whereas the Veterans Health Administration of the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs operates the largest Federal \n     medical care delivery system in the United States, providing \n     for the medical care needs of our Nation's veterans;\n       (3) Whereas the veterans' service organizations have \n     provided a plan, known as the Independent Budget for Veterans \n     Affairs, to reform the Veterans' health care delivery system \n     to adapt it to the modern health care environment and improve \n     its ability to meet the health care needs of veterans in a \n     cost-effective manner;\n       (4) Whereas current budget proposals assume a change in the \n     definition of service-connected veterans;\n       (5) Whereas proposals contained within the Independent \n     Budget may provide improved service to veterans;\n       (6) Whereas current budget proposals may not have fully \n     considered the measures proposed by the veterans' service \n     organizations in the Independent Budget\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the Sense of Congress: the \n     reforms and proposals contained within the Independent Budget \n     for Veterans Affairs, Fiscal Year 1996 should be given \n     careful consideration in an effort to ensure the nation's \n     commitment to its veterans.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to offer a Sense-of-\nthe-Senate amendment regarding the Nations 26 million veterans.\n  Over the past few days, some have argued that the budget resolution \nbefore us is mean-spirited in its treatment of veterans--that it does \nnot take into consideration the real needs of those who served and \nsacrificed on behalf of our country. Well, I would like to set the \nrecord straight on this matter.\n  Before the White House or those on the other side of the aisle start \nattacking Republicans on this issue, they had better take a hard look \nat the Congressional Budget Office's reestimate of the President's \nfiscal year 1996 budget request. Over 5 years, the President's own \nbudget gives the Department of Veterans Affairs $339 million less for \ndiscretionary medical spending than it would receive under a hard \nfreeze.\n  However, a coalition of veterans' groups has put together a plan \ncalled the Independent Budget for Veterans Affairs: Fiscal Year 1996. \nThe coalition claims that the recommendations set forth in the this \ndocument will help to improve the Department of Veterans Affairs' \nhealth care system while saving taxpayer dollars. The coalition--Which \nincludes AMVETS, Disabled American Veterans, Paralyzed Veterans of \nAmerica, and Veterans of Foreign Wars--submitted its plan to Congress \nand to the Clinton administration earlier this year.\n  The amendment I offer today simply states that Congress should give \nthis proposal careful consideration. It is a nonpartisan document, \ncrafted by the people who know the system best--the veterans \nthemselves. Let us consider their expertise and rise above partisan \naccusations as we work to improve the efficiency and quality of service \nto veterans.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this amendment has been cleared on both \nsides.\n  I yield back any time I may have on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1147) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. EXON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me state the way I understand \nthings. When the 3\\1/2\\ minutes that I have are used up, all time will \nhave expired on the bill.\n  I will pose a parliamentary inquiry. When that event occurs and there \nis no more time, what would the pending business be?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the Boxer amendment \nNo. 1134.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the distinguished majority leader, the Boxer \namendment has been debated. Many other amendments will be offered that \nhave not been debated. I think I am going to yield back my 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes. I do not know that anybody wishes to speak, unless the \nmajority leader does.\n  Mr. EXON. May I inquire at this particular time, if we have a little \ntime left. We have been having various discussions. Has there been an \nagreement reached on how we are likely to handle a whole series of \namendments, especially those not debated, with regard to brief \nstatements from the Senators--30 seconds or a minute? Has there been a \ndetermination on that, I ask my colleague?\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, we have discussed it briefly with the \nSenator [[Page S7334]] from New Mexico. I hope there will not be many \namendments. We have had 50 hours of debate and a lot of votes. There \nmay be one or two on this side. Is there a specific number on that \nside?\n  Mr. EXON. Yes. I will tell you now that we have 31 sure amendments. \nAnd, as the Senator knows, other Senators may reserve their rights by \nappearing and offering their amendments. But there will be 31 \namendments filed to be voted on from this side of the aisle.\n  Mr. DOLE. So we are talking about 5, 6, 7 hours of votes, right, \nwhich we will do today. We will save final passage until tomorrow \nsometime.\n  Mr. EXON. Of course, that is up to the leader. I certainly say that I \nhave suggested to Senator Daschle and to the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee--and maybe it has not reached you--that possibly we can cut \ndown some of those at some time. I hope we can work out something to \ncut down the time that has to be taken for all those votes.\n  Mr. DOLE. I am going to ask unanimous consent that after the first \nvote, all votes be 10 minutes in length.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. DOLE. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Would it be possible to get consent that each vote go for \n7\\1/2\\ minutes? I believe that can be done. I have seen it done in \nhere. And possibly we can have a minute or half a minute on a side, so \nas to have some explanation. By cutting it back to 7\\1/2\\ minutes for \nthe vote, perhaps that will accommodate both sides' concerns.\n  Mr. EXON. I had made a suggestion along those lines that I think \nSenator Byrd outlined, and maybe even to speed things up, we can cut \nthe votes to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOLE. They are concerned about doing it in 7\\1/2\\ minutes, unless \nwe remain in our seats. But I think the bottom line is that we are \nactually going to have to vote on 31 amendments on the other side. If \nthat is the bottom line, and people--ordinarily, you would have a right \nto have your amendment read. If it is a delaying tactic, we can be here \na couple more days. The last time around, I recall that Senator \nMitchell advised the Chair that if we insisted on having the amendment \nread, the ruling of the Chair would be appealed.\n  So we then decided that when the clerk called up the amendment, they \nwould state the purpose, period, and that is it--you know, economic \ngrowth, tax relief, or whatever. That was all the explanation there \nwas. If we start giving everybody 30 seconds, or 1, 2, 3 minutes, we \nare looking at another 2 or 3 hours, and we will never finish action on \nthis budget resolution. We will be in recess this afternoon for at \nleast 40 minutes, from 4:20 until 5 p.m. I will suggest the absence of \na quorum briefly----\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, before that, I will make one statement that \nI think may be helpful. Certainly, we would enter into a unanimous-\nconsent agreement on this side that the reading of the amendments would \nnot be in order. We are not going to be dilatory about this. We think \nthat for everybody that wants a vote on their amendment--and it has \nbeen customary to have that in this body--there would be no reason to \ndo that.\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask unanimous consent that there not be a requirement \nthat amendments be read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. So the clerk can state the purpose if we have the purpose.\n  Mr. BYRD. If the leader will yield, I am not sure the clerk can state \nthe purpose in a way that we can understand what we are voting on.\n  Mr. DOLE. The last time we did this, I think we had an agreement that \nthe staff would put ``purpose'' and they would read the purpose, such \nas tax relief, economic growth, or whatever. At least you had some idea \nwhat you were voting on. And it would be agreed upon by the two \nmanagers.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. With your permission, I will talk to the senior Senator \nfrom West Virginia. I was accommodating today in what we did for your \nside, I think 10, 12, maybe even 14 of your amendments. Does anybody \nhave a number of how many were already discussed? Senators took the \nfloor and somewhere between 10 and 12 of those have had anywhere from 2 \nminutes to 6 minutes which might not have occurred otherwise. So I \nthink we have given a pretty good opportunity----\n  Mr. EXON. I appreciate the accommodation, and I think there has been \naccommodation on both sides.\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask unanimous consent that after the first vote, all \nother votes be limited to 8 minutes in length.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. EXON. Reserving the right to object. The minority leader is here. \nAre you also going to agree that with an 8-minute vote, there will be \nan explanation of some type before each vote, or not?\n  Mr. DOLE. The clerk can state the purpose, to be agreed upon by the \ntwo managers.\n  Mr. EXON. I would like our leader to give you his feelings.\n  Mr. DOLE. We have had 50 hours. I do not think we need another 50.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I hope that we could have just a short \ndescription of what the amendment is prior to the time we are called \nupon to vote. In some cases, Senators in good faith have been waiting \nfor an opportunity to offer their amendments and have been precluded \nfrom doing so.\n  If we can accommodate each author of an amendment with a very short \ntwo-sentence explanation, I think it would be in the interest of \neverybody so that we do not make mistakes on what these votes may be.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, where we are now is there will be 15 \nminutes on each vote, unless the Senate agrees later on, which I am \nsure when we get 15 or 20 of these votes in, we will agree.\n  There will be no reading of the amendment. We have no agreement on \nany comments on the amendment. So there will be no comments on the \namendment. That is the way it is now.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me say that for the first vote we will \nadd the customary 5 minutes, so there will be 15 plus 5; after that it \nwill be 15 minutes, period. No additional 5 minutes. I do not need \nconsent for that.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1134\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on agreeing to the \namendment No. 1134, offered by the Senator from California.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the pending amendment is not germane to \nthe provisions of the budget resolution pursuant to section 305(b)(2) \nof the Budget Act. I raise a point of order against the pending \namendment.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974, I move to waive the act for the consideration of \nthe pending amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 46, nays 54, as follows:\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 187 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--46\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnston\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Snowe\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--54\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Packwood\n     Pressler\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 46, and the nays \nare [[Page S7335]] 54. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and \nsworn not having voted in the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  The point of order is sustained, and the motion falls.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I have had a discussion with the \ndistinguished Democratic leader and the managers of the bill. I now ask \nunanimous consent that votes be limited from here on to 9 minutes, and \nthat the manager have 1 minute to explain the purpose of any amendment \nthat has not been debated.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. This is a very workable agreement, Mr. President. The \nonly way it can work, however, is that we anticipate the order in which \nthese amendments can be brought for a vote. We have that order.\n  So I encourage all the sponsors of these amendments to give the \nmanagers their descriptions so that these descriptions can be read and \nput in the order in which the amendments will be brought up.\n  But the managers will have 1 minute to describe the amendment, and \nthat description can be anything the sponsors may suggest they want it \nto be. But I think it will work out well. And it will allow us to cut \nback substantially the degree of time.\n  I urge everyone's cooperation.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I want to make it clear we are talking only \nabout those amendments that will not be debated. Those already debated \nwe will not take another minute on. They have had plenty of time. This \nwill apply to amendments that have not been debated because of the time \nconstraints, and they will be explained briefly by the manager on \neither side.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is our understanding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object, I understand that what is \nbeing propounded is that we have 9 minutes to vote, and we have 1 \nminute to explain it by the manager. If you are going to take 1 minute, \nwhy not let the proponent of the amendment take 1 minute? You are going \nto take a minute anyway.\n  Mr. DOLE. We are just trying to cut down the time. If we have to stop \nand recognize everybody up and down--it seems to me you can tell the \nmanager what it says, and they can read it. We will have the vote. We \nare trying to accommodate Senators, particularly on that side, because \nyou have all the amendments, I understand. If you will just give the \nmanager a one-sentence or two-sentence statement, we are just trying to \nsave time. We thought it might save time.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. There is another practical concern, if the Senator will \nyield; that is, that assumes that the sponsor of the amendment is going \nto be on the floor right at the time the amendment is to be called up. \nIn many cases, we will not be able to guarantee that. So if we are \nassured that the manager has the description, we will know there will \nbe an explanation.\n  I hope we can accommodate this process. I think all Senators will \nhave the opportunity to have this amendment at least explained prior to \nthe time we have our vote.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I would like to put a question to the \ntwo leaders. Some of the amendments have been debated. Will they be \ncalled up first, the ones on which there has been debate?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The order is going to be worked out between Senators \nwho have amendments and staff, Senator Exon's staff and Senator \nDomenici's. We are starting to put that in some kind of sequence right \nnow.\n  Was that the question?\n  Mr. SARBANES. The question was there are some amendments that have \nbeen debated, and some amendments that have not been debated. The ones \nthat have not been debated, I take it the managers will make a \nstatement about them. I was wondering whether the ones that have been \ndebated by the sponsors of them could be called up.\n  Mr. DOLE. No; we have already had debate.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Not for debate. We have had debate on some amendments. \nI have an amendment that we had a debate on. I was here to sort of send \nit to the desk and get a vote on it. We have had debate on that \namendment which just recently occurred.\n  Mr. DOLE. What would be your request?\n  Mr. SARBANES. That that amendment be up near the top, the front of \nthe list, since we have had the debate recently.\n  Mr. DOLE. I agree with that.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, might I \nrenew the request of Senator Harkin from Iowa? It seems to me that the \nmanagers know the amendments best. They can still be confined to the \nsame length of time, the proponents of the amendment, the same time as \nthe managers. It would be my suggestion that the amendment is called \nup, and if the author of the amendment is not here, he loses the right \nto offer the amendment.\n  I just think a better explanation would be given of what the \namendments are if the proponents of the amendment describe them during \nthe 1 minute, then the other side offers their description during that \nsame period. And if the author of the amendment is not here when it is \ncalled up, I suggest he lose the opportunity to call up the amendment.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. I think it is fair to say we are trying to find some middle \nground. We do not have to do anything. We do not have to let anybody \nexplain them; just say nothing. We already have consent that the \namendment cannot be read. So you will not have any debate. We are \ntrying to accommodate everybody by going to the managers. If you have a \n1-minute statement, let the manager read it. We are just trying to \naccommodate everybody at the same time to hopefully save some time.\n  If Senator Exon, for example, had a statement that Senator Domenici \ndisagreed with, then we have to understand the other manager, or \nwhoever, would have the same rights.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. I shall not object. It seems that we cannot agree on \nanything around here. Let me set the stage. We are making a change here \nunder unanimous consent, or attempting to, to change the rules. Now, \nfor good reason, we set a 50-hour limit for debate on the budget \nresolution and you cannot filibuster.\n  Now, we have been here through a very difficult process, as we always \ndo go through. I would simply say that I happen to feel in this \nparticular case the majority has come a long way to make some changes \nwhich benefit us. The fact is we have far more amendments that can be \noffered under the rules and it turns out there is not time to have \ndebate.\n  Now, certainly I feel we should recognize that we have gone through a \nlot of effort, give and take, trying to work out something that is \nreasonable. It has been agreed to by the minority leader. It has been \nagreed to by the majority leader.\n  I would simply say that any Democratic Senator who has an amendment, \nif he wants to write out what he wants to say on his amendment, he can \ngive it to me, and I can read it just as well as he or she can without \ngoing through the folderol that we are going to find ourselves in, as \nwe always do, to start recognizing people back and forth--where are \nthey? Are they not here?\n  It would seem to me that we have a reasonable process which people \ncan pick to pieces but can we agree after a lot of effort to come to an \nunderstanding that I think should be acceptable to our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the unanimous-consent \nrequest is agreed to. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  [[Page S7336]]\n  \n                           Amendment No. 1148\n\n  (Purpose: Continue funding for economic development in Appalachian \n                                region)\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment by number.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell], for himself, Mr. \n     Warner, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Heflin, and Mr. Cochran, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1148:\n\n       On page 29, line 10, increase the amount by $100,000,000.\n       On page 29, line 18, increase the amount by $200,000,000.\n       On page 30, line 2, increase the amount by $200,000,000.\n       On page 30, line 3, increase the amount by $100,000,000.\n       On page 30, line 10, increase the amount by $200,000,000.\n       On page 30, line 11, increase the amount by $100,000,000.\n       On page 30, line 18, increase the amount by $100,000,000.\n       On page 30, line 19, increase the amount by $100,000,000.\n       On page 31, line 2, increase the amount by $100,000,000.\n       On page 31, line 3, increase the amount by $100,000,000.\n       On page 20, line 7, decrease the amount by $100,000,000.\n       On page 20, line 15, decrease the amount by $200,000,000.\n       On page 20, line 23, decrease the amount by $200,000,000.\n       On page 20, line 24, decrease the amount by $100,000,000.\n       On page 21, line 7, decrease the amount by $200,000,000.\n       On page 21, line 8, decrease the amount by $100,000,000.\n       On page 21, line 15, decrease the amount by $100,000,000.\n       On page 21, line 16, decrease the amount by $100,000,000.\n       On page 21, line 23, decrease the amount by $100,000,000.\n       On page 21, line 24, decrease the amount by $100,000,000.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment that \nwill continue a program that is very important, not only to Kentucky, \nbut also to a great number of other States.\n  Unlike a lot of other Government programs, this one is targeted to \nassist those who are in greatest need; and it has had a tremendous, \npositive impact over the years.\n  Unlike a lot of other Government programs, this one spends most of \nits funds making a difference in people's lives--rather than wasting \ntaxpayer dollars on administrative expenses.\n  The program I am speaking of is the Appalachian Regional Commission, \ncommonly known as ARC.\n  Before I discuss the substance of my amendment, I would like to \ncommend the authors of this budget resolution, especially the chairman \nof the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, for making literally \nthousands of tough but intelligent choices with regard to this Nation's \nspending priorities.\n  They have done a superb job, and they have done it with care and \ncompassion and concern for those who will necessarily be impacted by \nthis resolution.\n  But of course, on an issue as complex and multifaceted as the Federal \nbudget, there are bound to be honest differences of opinion. And it is \nin that spirit that I am offering my amendment to save the Appalachian \nRegional Commission from the budget ax.\n  Let me also point out, however, that this amendment hardly preserves \nthe status quo. I do not think anyone from this side of the aisle would \ncontend that business as usual is going to achieve a balanced budget by \nthe year 2002.\n  Every Federal program and agency is going to have to adapt, and cut \ncosts, and become more efficient in response to the country's fiscal \npressures. Every program and agency will need to do more with less, or \nface total extinction.\n  That is what my amendment envisions: An Appalachian Regional \nCommission of the future that continues to provide excellent services \nand programs in distressed areas, but with a more targeted approach \nand, frankly, with less funding.\n  I should add that the people in my State, and many who work for ARC, \nare more than willing to make the changes necessary to preserve the \nagency as a vital and active force in the region. But all of them also \nbelieve, as I do, that the mission of the ARC has not yet been \ncompleted; and we need to continue to support its positive efforts.\n  Although ARC has made a dramatic impact in improving the economic \nopportunities and quality of life for people living in Appalachia, \nthere continues to be a real need for assistance in this region. \nPoverty, out-migration, and high levels of unemployment are especially \nprevalent in central Appalachia, which includes some of the poorest \ncounties in the Nation.\n  In all, the ARC serves parts of 13 States, totaling 399 counties from \nNew York to Mississippi. This is a region that lags behind the Nation \nin most, if not all, major economic measures. It experiences \nchronically higher unemployment levels, substantially lower income \nlevels, and perniciously high poverty rates. In eastern Kentucky, for \nexample, the poverty rate stood at 29 percent in 1990--16 percent \nhigher than the national average.\n  Of the 399 counties served by ARC, 115 of these counties are \nconsidered severely distressed.\n  This means that these counties suffer from unemployment levels and \npoverty rates that are 150 percent of the national average and receive \nper capita incomes that are only two-thirds of the national average.\n  The ARC was designed to address the unique problems of this region \nwhich has been afflicted by over a century of exploitation, neglect, \ngeographic barriers, and economic distress. These are not problems born \nof cyclical economic fluctuations but are the result of years of \nunremitting underdevelopment, isolation, and out-migration.\n  That is the bad news. The good news is that ARC has worked hand in \nhand with each of the 13 States in its jurisdiction to develop flexible \nand effective programs, tailored to the specific needs of each \ncommunity or region.\n  And there is more good news. ARC is unusually lean, as Federal \nagencies go, with respect to administrative and personnel expenses. \nTotal overhead accounts for less than 4 percent of all expenditures. \nThat is largely achieved through cooperation with the States.\n  State Governors contribute 50 percent of the administrative costs as \nwell as the full cost of their own regional ARC offices.\n  In fact, Mr. President, I would urge my colleagues to look to the ARC \nas a model of efficiency, cost sharing, and State cooperation for other \nFederal programs.\n  Some people have said that ARC represents a special windfall for a \nsingle area of the country. That is simply not true. The stark reality \nis that Appalachia receives 14 percent less per capital spending from \nthe Federal Government than the rest of the country, and that includes \nthe amount it receives through ARC. If anything, Appalachia is an \nunderserved area.\n  The ARC's mission has been to provide the assistance needed to make \nAppalachian areas economically self-sustaining, rather than to simply \nhand out government largess.\n  This is an important distinction.\n  The ARC is not a traditional poverty program but an economic \ndevelopment program, with a lot of work still ahead of it. If we were \nto ax the ARC outright, the fact is that much of the investment we have \nmade up to now would have been for naught.\n  It would be like laying the foundation of a building, putting in the \nbeams and supports, and then deciding to stop before putting on the \nroof and the walls. Unless the work is seen to completion, much of what \nhas been done to this point will have been in vain.\n  At the same time, because of the tremendous fiscal pressures we are \nfacing, my amendment would not restore funding for ARC to its current \nlevel. Instead, it puts the ARC on a glidepath of reduced spending \nthrough the year 2002. The partially restored funding is entirely \noffset and will fully comply with guidelines established by the Budget \nCommittee to reach a balanced budget by the year 2002.\n  The way we achieve these goals is quite simple. First, we start with \na 35-percent reduction from the current funding level for ARC. There is \nno question that this is a considerable cut, and it will have an impact \non the ARC's ability to fully serve its target areas. But I think it \nunderscores how serious we are about preserving this agency.\n  From the 35-percent-reduction level in 1996, my amendment will \ncontinue [[Page S7337]] to lower funding levels each year through 2002. \nOverall, if we use as a baseline a hard freeze at 1995 funding levels \nfor ARC, my amendment would achieve a 47-percent reduction in spending. \nThis amounts to $925 million in savings over 7 years.\n  Mr. President, I would ask that a table reflecting the savings \nproposed by my amendment appear in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, nobody can charge that this amendment \nis an attempt to preserve the status quo. Instead, it is an effort to \npreserve an essential Federal program by making some very tough but \nnecessary choices.\n  In order to provide the necessary budget offset, I have proposed a \nreasonable reduction in the regulation and technology account of the \nOffice of Surface Mining. The regulatory arm of OSM has served its \nstatutory purposes well over the years, but the fact is that much of \nits current activities are now being handled effectively at the State \nlevel.\n  In fact, primary responsibility for regulation in this area has been \npassed on to 23 of the 26 coal-producing States.\n  Further, the size of the industry being regulated by OSM has shrunk \ndramatically over the last decade and a half. While the number of \nactive coal mines has dropped from over 6,000 in 1979 to barely 3,000 \nin 1993, OSM staff has increased by more than 50 percent. Even since \n1983, when the last of the 23 States assumed primary regulatory \nauthority, OSM staff grew by a quarter.\n  About half of the OSM budget for regulation and technology funds \nactivities that duplicate existing state resources.\n  So what you have here is a smaller industry--smaller by half--being \nregulated by 50 percent more bureaucrats. That is the kind of anomaly \nthat our constituents want us to change.\n  Voters believe that 52 cents on every tax dollar is waste by the \nFederal Government. If there is any program that suggests this might be \ntrue, it is the regulation account at OSM which serves a smaller and \nsmaller industry, and whose activities are being duplicated by more and \nmore States.\n  Further, I am told that OSM has actually become a burden on State \nregulatory agencies, making excessive requests for data collection and \nstudies that divert valuable resources from their own regulatory \nactivities.\n  The proposed reduction in OSM's title V program should come out of \nthe agency's inspection and regulatory activities which duplicate State \nprograms. Adequate funding for State regulatory grants should be \nmaintained, and my amendment is in no way intended to affect such \ngrants.\n  Mr. President, in these tight budgetary times, a 28-percent reduction \nin the OSM regulatory budget is entirely reasonable. This cut will \nactually force OSM to streamline operations and eliminate many \nduplicative services that are a burden to State regulatory agencies.\n  I would suggest that the remaining cuts be from other Federal \nprograms that duplicate State regulatory or oversight functions within \nfunction 300. If we intend to streamline the Federal Government, we can \nstart with Federal activities that overlap with State agencies and \nprograms. Overall, my amendment would cut three-fourths of 1 percent \nfrom this function. This small cut will provide substantial benefit to \nseverely distressed regions of Appalachia.\n  In drafting this amendment, I have consulted with officials at ARC to \nhelp redesign the focus and size of the agency. It is my view that ARC \nshould eliminate those functions that are beyond the central mission of \neconomic development.\n  We also need to critically assess which areas that are currently \nunder the jurisdiction of ARC no longer need its support, due to the \nsuccess of ARC's programs.\n  There are a number of counties that have achieved the goal of \neconomic self-sufficiency and therefore have outgrown the need for ARC \nfunding.\n  My amendment would enable the ARC to focus its resources on those \ncounties that struggle with the most severe economic hardships.\n  Let me conclude. If my colleagues believe that eliminating ARC will \nsave money, they are sadly mistaken. The poverty and economic distress \nof central Appalachia will only deepen, imposing higher costs on other \nFederal programs. On the other hand, if we keep ARC alive, and help \nthis region to help itself, we will be saving a lot more money in the \nlong run.\n  Of course, all programs must make every effort to revaluate their \nmission and eliminate those functions that are no longer needed. I have \nproposed eliminating certain authorities of the ARC that are no longer \nneeded, and reforming the eligibility criteria to take certain \neconomically stabilized counties off the rolls. These reforms are \nassumed in the lower spending levels contained in my amendment.\n  In sum, this is a creative and commonsense way to save one of the few \nFederal programs that has actually worked: the ARC. Just as important, \nmy proposal is consistent with the goal of balancing the budget which \nall of us want to achieve. I urge my colleagues to support the \namendment.\n\n                                                   McCONNELL AMENDMENT--HARDLY KEEPING THE STATUS QUO                                                   \n                                                                [In billions of dollars]                                                                \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                      1996         1997         1998         1999         2000         2001         2002        Total   \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMcConnell Amendment:\\1\\                                                                                                                                 \n    Annual budget authority.....................         .183         .177         .173         .166         .150         .100         .100        1.049\nFreeze at 1995 levels:                                                                                                                                  \n    Annual budget authority.....................         .282         .282         .282         .282         .282         .282         .282        1.974\nCurrent funding adjusted for inflation:                                                                                                                 \n    Annual budget authority.....................         .291         .301         .312         .323         .334  ...........  ...........        1.561\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\The McConnell amendment saves more than $900 million over a 7 year freeze at 1995 ARC funding levels. The McConnell amendment saves more than $500   \n  million over 5 year--inflation adjusted--ARC funding levels.                                                                                          \n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I would like to clarify the Record. I \nbelieve the distinguished junior Senator from Kentucky may have \nmisspoke earlier with regard to the need for this amendment to address \npayments made by the Federal Election Commission [FEC] from the \nPresidential Election Campaign Fund for settlement of alleged sexual \nharassment claims.\n  The entire $37,500 payment referred to by the Senator was disallowed \nby the FEC as a qualified campaign expense and the FEC required \nrepayment of all Federal matching funds used to pay this expense. As my \ncolleague knows, the courts have held that the FEC may only require \nrepayment of disallowed campaign expenses to the extent Federal funds \nwere used.\n  In this instance, the FEC determined that of the $37,500 in \ndisallowed campaign expenses, $9,675 were paid with Federal matching \nfunds. Consequently, the campaign repaid the Presidential Election \nCampaign Fund that amount.\n  Therefore, no taxpayer funds were used to pay this settlement.\n  But I agree that taxpayer funds should not be used for this purpose \nand I support the amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the McConnell \namendment to ensure that the essential services provided by the \nAppalachian Regional Commission are continued for some of this Nation's \nmost destitute areas.\n  At a time when we are correctly terminating or scaling back outdated \nFederal programs, I believe the Appalachian Regional Commission is the \ntype of Federal initiative we should be encouraging. It is important to \nrecognize that the ARC uses its limited Federal dollars to leverage \nadditional State and local funds. This successful partnership enables \ncommunities in Virginia to have tailored programs which help them \nrespond to a variety of grassroots needs. [[Page S7338]] \n  In the Commonwealth of Virginia, 21 counties rely heavily on the \nassistance they receive from the Appalachian Regional Commission. \nIncome levels for this region of Virginia further indicate that, on \naverage, my constituents who reside in this region have incomes which \nare $6,000 below the average per capita income for the rest of the \nNation.\n  In 1960, when the ARC was created, the poverty rate in Virginia's \nAppalachian region was 24.4. In 1990, the poverty rate statistics of \n17.6 show improvement which can be attributed to the effectiveness of \nthe ARC. However, we are still a long way from achieving the U.S. \naverage poverty level of 13.1 and also the regional poverty level of \nother ARC-member States of 15.2.\n  With these statistics in mind, I would like to offer some specific \npoints one should keep in mind regarding the effectiveness of ARC \nprograms, its relationship with the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the \ndirect impact that this relationship has on the private sector.\n  In recent years, a significant portion of ARC funds have been \ndedicated to local economic development efforts. Were it not for this \nassistance, the LENOWISCO Planning District and Wise County would not \nhave been able to complete construction of the\n water and sewage lines to provide utility services to the Wise County \nIndustrial Park at Blackwood. These lines were financed by a $500,000 \ngrant from the ARC and a $600,000 grant from the U.S. Economic \nDevelopment Administration. The construction of these utilities to \nserve a new industrial park has attracted a major wood products \nmanufacturing facility which has created 175 new jobs for the \ncommunity.\n\n  The Fifth Planning District serving the Alleghany Highlands of \nVirginia is a prominent example of leveraging other State and local \nfunds and stimulating economic development with partial funding from \nthe ARC. For fiscal year 1995, with $350,000 from the ARC, the \nAlleghany Regional Commerce Center in Clifton Forge, VA was \nestablished. This new industrial center already has a commitment from \ntwo industries, providing new employment opportunities for over 220 \npersons.\n  The ARC funds for this project have generated an additional $500,000 \nin State funds, $450,000 from the Virginia Department of \nTransportation, $145,000 from Alleghany County, and $168,173 from the \nAlleghany Highlands Economic Development Authority. As a result of a \nlimited Federal commitment, there is almost a 4 to 1 ratio of non-\nFederal dollars compared to Federal funds.\n  In many cases, these funds have been the sole source of funding for \nlocal planning efforts for appropriate community development. For \nexample, such funds have been used to prepare and update comprehensive \nplans which are required by Virginia State law to be updated every 5 \nyears in revise zoning, subdivision, and other land use ordinances. In \naddition, funds are used to prepare labor force studies or marketing \nplans in guiding industrial development sites.\n  Mr. President, the mission of the Appalachian Regional Commission is \nas relevant today as it was when the program was created. This rural \nregion of the Nation remains beset with many geographic obstacles that \nhave kept it isolated from industrial expansion. It is a region that \nhas been attempting to diversify its economy from its dependency on one \nindustry--coal mining--to other stable employment opportunities. It is \na program that provides essential services and stimulates the \ncontributions of state and local funds.\n  I thank Senator McConnell for his leadership on this issue and I urge \nthe amendment's adoption.\n                           amendment no. 1148\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of this \namendment to preserve funding for the Appalachian Regional Commission, \nand I thank the Senator from Kentucky for offering it. Without his \namendment, the budget proposal before us includes a plan to wipe out a \nvery small and valuable agency over the next 5 years. This amendment is \nthe Senate's chance to reject the idea of eliminating the tools \ndedicated to the economic development and future of 13 Appalachian \nStates, including West Virginia.\n  Senators listening to this debate may think this is an amendment that \nonly deserves the votes of those of us representing those States. I \nhope our case will be heard so that won't be the conclusion of our \ncolleagues. The people of every State have a stake in the economic \nstrength of the rest of the country. When floods ravage the Mid-West or \nthe Gulf States; when a major defense installation or space center is \nlocated in a State like Texas or Alabama; when payments are made to \nfarmers for crop losses; when billions are spent to shore up S \ninstitutions in certain States; when special aid is given to cities or \nto California after its riots or earthquakes; when research labs get \nspecial funds in New Mexico or Massachusetts--when any of this support \nand assistance is extended, it is the country's way of investing in \neach region and in the futures of Americans everywhere.\n  The Appalachian Regional Commission is the Nation's effort to help a \npart of this country overcome tremendous barriers. In many parts of the \nregion, major progress has been achieved. But the ARC's job is not \nfinished, and the agency should not be abolished until it is.\n  Like so much else in this budget debate, this amendment is about \npriorities. For me, this represents a choice between two programs that \naffect the people of West Virginia. It calls for a little less support \nfor the Office of Surface Mining, in order to put more into the ARC.\n  The key message in this amendment is its call for continuing the \nARC's partnership with West Virginia and the Appalachian region to \nfinish the foundation we need for more growth, more jobs, and more hope \nfor our people.\n  To that end, I accept the idea that the Office of Surface Mining \nshould reduce its bureaucracy and excessive regulatory activity in \norder to finish ARC's work for families and businesses in Appalachia. \nThis amendment will not add to the deficit or prevent us from reaching \na balanced budget in 2002--it will simply redirect funding from certain \nactivities at OSM so that the ARC can continue its mission for the \npeople of Appalachia.\n  This amendment accepts a fair share of responsibility for deficit \nreduction. But instead of saying wipe out the ARC, it charts a course \nof gradual reductions, starting with a 35 percent cut in ARC funding \nfor 1996, with continued reductions through 2002. Overall, it would be \na 47 percent cut in ARC funding if the commission were frozen at its \n1995 level. This is going to require changes and further streamlining \nat the ARC, which should be tough but doable. Under the McConnell \namendment, ARC is still contributing its fair share to deficit \nreduction. Without it, one region of the country is asked to suffer \nmore than is fair and to a point that will hurt the region.\n  As a former Governor, and now as a U.S. Senator from West Virginia, I \nknow--vividly--the value of the ARC and how it improves the lives of \nmany hard-working citizens. Whether the funding is used for new water \nand sewer systems, physician recruitment, adult literacy programs or \nthe Appalachian corridor highways, it has made the difference in West \nVirginia, Kentucky, and the other Appalachian States.\n  The highways are the most visible and best known investments made by \nthe ARC for the people of Appalachia. As of today, over two-thirds of \nthe ARC highway system has been completed. But if the ARC is simply \nabolished, the job will not be completed. What a waste of money to pull \nout before a road system is finished.\n  At this very moment, some of these highways are called highways \nhalfway to nowhere, because they are just that--half built, and only \nhalfway to their destination. The job has to be completed, so these \nhighways become highways the whole way to somewhere. And that somewhere \nis called jobs and prosperity that will benefit the rest of the \ncountry, too.\n  Appalachia simply wants to be connected to our national grid of \nhighways. Parts of the region weren't lucky enough to come out as flat \nland, so the job takes longer and costs more. But it is essential in \ngiving the people and families in this part of the United States of \nAmerica a shot--a chance to be rewarded for a work ethic and commitment \nwith real economic opportunity and a decent quality of life. \n[[Page S7339]] \n  I won't speak for my colleagues from other Appalachian States, but \nWest Virginia was not exactly the winner in the original Interstate \nHighway System. And Senators here represent many States that were. As a \nresult, areas of my State have suffered, economically and in human \nterms. Without roads, people are shut off from jobs. That's obvious. \nBut without roads, people also cannot get decent health care. Dropping \nout of school is easier sometimes than taking a 2-hour bus ride because \nthe roads are not there.\n  The structure of the ARC makes it more efficient and effective than \nmany other agencies. The ARC is a working, true partnership between \nFederal, State, and local governments.\n  This structure expects responsibility from citizens and local \nleaders, Federal funding is designed to leverage State and local money \nfor any activity. Accordingly to the ARC, throughout its lifetime, it \nhas contributed less than half of the total amount of project funds. \nAdministrative costs have accounted for less than 4 percent of total \ncosts over ARC's lifetime.\n  Long before it was fashionable, ARC used a from the bottom up \napproach to addressing local needs, rather than a top down, one-size-\nfits-all mandate of the type that has become all too familiar to \ncitizens dealing with Federal agencies. It works, too.\n  I urge everyone in this body to keep a promise made to a region that \nhas been short shrifted. Each region is unique. Solutions have to \ndiffer, depending on our circumstances. When it comes to Appalachia, a \nsmall agency called the Appalachian Regional Commission should finish \nits work. Abolishing it overnight will only create more problems and \nmore costs that can be avoided. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor \nof the McConnell amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

FEDERAL RETIREMENT.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (a) the assumptions underlying the revenue and functional \n     totals in this resolution assume that the Federal Retirement \n     programs will continue to calculate retirement benefits from \n     the average of an employee's high 3 years of service; and (b) \n     the restoration of Federal Retirement benefits will be \n     restored by closing the tax loophole which allows \n     billionaires to escape taxes by renouncing their citizenship.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to speak for a few minutes \nregarding the Sarbanes amendment, of which I am an original cosponsor. \nThis amendment eliminates the provision in the budget resolution which \nchanges the basis for calculating retirement benefits for Federal \nemployees from the average of an employee's highest 3 years to the \naverage of the highest 5 years.\n  The Government cannot change the rules in the middle of the game for \nthese loyal public servants who are relying on and planning for \nretirement using longstanding practices. Government personnel, civilian \nor military, active or retirees, should not be singled out to bear the \nburden of balancing the budget.\n  While I am a strong advocate of balancing the budget, I do not \nbelieve that a disproportionate share of the budget cuts should fall on \nFederal employees. I strongly agree with the mandate which American \npeople delivered in the 1994 elections. I am committed to working to \ncut spending and reduce big government, while striving to see that \nbenefits to the truly needy are not unfairly affected.\n  We cannot and must not allow those who have given years of service to \nthe Federal Government to be uncertain about their retirement decisions \nand their future financial well-being.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I rise today in support of the amendment offered by my \ncolleague, Senator Roth, to protect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge \nin Alaska from oil and gas development. The proposed budget resolution \nassumes that the Committee on Energy [[Page S7341]] and Natural \nResources will reach its budget target by opening up this magnificent \nwildlife refuge to oil and gas development. By striking $2.3 billion \nover 7 years from that committee's required reduction in budget \noutlays, and adding that amount to the reduction required by the \nFinance Committee, Senator Roth's amendment would protect the refuge, \nwhile preserving the budget resolution's bottom line.\n  To ensure that this amendment is deficit neutral and therefore does \nnot impair our progress toward a balanced budget, a goal I strongly \nsupport, Senator Roth has suggested that those funds instead be \nobtained by eliminating the ability of persons to avoid taxes by \nrelinquishing their U.S. citizenship. As a result, this amendment would \nallow us to continue to protect a national treasure for future \ngenerations by closing a tax loophole for wealthy expatriates who \nchoose to give up their American citizenship to avoid paying taxes.\n  A word about the refuge. It is a truly special place. Located in the \nnortheast corner of Alaska, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has \nbeen referred to, for good reason, as ``America's Serengeti.'' The \nrefuge supports a spectacular array of wildlife, including polar bears, \ngrizzly bears, wolves, and snow geese. In addition, the porcupine \ncaribou herd, numbering over 150,000 animals, bear their young on the \ncoastal plain and provide an important source of food for the native \npeople that live near the refuge.\n  Oil and gas development is now prohibited in the refuge, unless \nauthorized by Congress. Senator Roth's amendment is therefore \nconsistent with current law. However, regardless of whether you \nbelieve, as I do, that the coastal plain should be permanently \nprotected as a wilderness area or, as the Budget Committee proposes, \nthat the law should be changed to authorize leasing for oil and gas, \nthe budget process is not the time or the place to settle this \nimportant issue. It should be fully and objectively debated, taking \ninto consideration not only the immediate economic return of leasing \nbut the potential loss to future generations of developing this \npristine wilderness.\n  The Roth amendment will remove the budget incentive to develop the \nrefuge while maintaining the deficit reduction totals. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \namendment proposed by the distinguished Senator from Delaware. It is my \nbelief that this amendment would accomplish two very important goals \nwith one simple action, namely, closing an outrageous tax loophole for \nthe super-rich, and preserving one of this continent's most fragile \ntreasures, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  Now as some of my colleagues are no doubt well aware, as long as I \nhave been coming down to this floor to speak, I have been speaking in \nopposition--strong opposition--to opening up ANWR to oil and gas \ndrilling. My position has not changed one bit, for those of my \ncolleagues who have not heard me address this issue before, I want to \ntake this opportunity to again state the reasons why I am so opposed to \ndrilling.\n  Mr. President, opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is not \nan energy policy, it is a non-energy policy. Even if--and this is a big \n``if''--even if the big oil companies were to tap the 3.2 billion \nbarrels of oil the Department of Interior has estimated may lie under \nANWR, the United States would be no more energy secure than it is now. \nThe oil reserves under ANWR would compose only a fraction of this \ncountry's huge appetite for oil for a short period of time, and at a \ntremendous, perhaps catastrophic ecological cost. We will be no less \ndependent on foreign oil, and perhaps more so, now that the Senate has \napparently expressed its willingness to see Alaskan oil exported \noverseas to the highest bidder. We will have gained nothing except the \nexperience of witnessing, once again, the grand exercise of greed.\n  And at what cost, Mr. President? I will tell you what cost. We will \nhave squandered one of the last remaining, irreplaceable treasures that \nbelong not to us, not to the oil companies, not to this Government, but \nto our children, and their children and their children's children. The \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge is the biological heart of the Arctic; \nand once it is gone, Mr. President, it is gone forever.\n  Let us not continue any further down this path of foolishness. I urge \nmy colleagues to vote for their children's sake to accept the Roth \namendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to strongly support the \namendment by Senator Roth to remove language in the budget resolution \nwhich might allow drilling in the coastal plain of the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge.\n  A provision in the budget resolution assumes leasing revenues of $1.4 \nbillion from leasing rights in the coastal plain. It is, in reality, \nnothing more than a yard sale to special interests of the resources in \nthis critical Arctic wilderness. Additionally, the $1.4 billion revenue \nestimate is highly speculative, at best. All and all, the provision is \nmisplaced and misguided.\n  The issue of whether to drill in the coastal plain in the Arctic \nRefuge deserves full, open and deliberative debate. This is an \nembarrassing back-door attempt to allow development of our last \nremaining wilderness. We should not consider a decision of major \nimportance to be made under the time restrictions required by the \nbudget resolution--we should pursue this discussion through separate \nlegislation. That's the responsible thing to do.\n  Including this discussion in the context of the budget resolution \ndenigrates the natural values of the coastal plain which, unlike \nbarrels of oil on the open market, cannot be quantified. The budget \nresolution concerns itself primarily with identifying revenues and \ndirecting spending. It is not the place to develop Federal policy on \nland use or natural resources. The ecological values of the coastal \nplain, many of which are intangible, will lose out when compared to the \nCBO scoring of potential revenues of barrels of oil.\n  Mr. President, I oppose the budget committee proposal because it \ncontinues, and even strengthens, the existing misplaced energy \npriorities that have yet to reduce our need for foreign oil. The \nlanguage in the resolution emphasizes environmentally destructive \nenergy development when what we need to do is develop cleaner, \nnonpetroleum-based fuels and seek important energy conservation \nopportunities.\n  If we allow drilling in the coastal plain, we are destroying what the \nFish and Wildlife Service calls the biological heart of the only \ncomplete Arctic ecosystem protected in North America. We will be \ndestroying that resource for a one in five chance of finding any \neconomically recoverable oil in the coastal plain. And, even worse, we \nwill destroy that biological heart in an effort to recover what many \nexperts suggest will be only 200 days worth of oil for the Nation.\n  In addition, Mr. President, we cannot be sure that the revenues the \ncommittee assumes from the leasing are real. First, the leasing \nrevenues are speculative in light of what has been bid on other highly \nprospective leases near the Arctic Refuge. The State of Alaska's most \nrecent onshore lease sale located west of the Refuge brought in an \naverage of $48.41 per acre, and leases immediately offshore the refuge \nin the Beaufort Sea only gained an average of $33-$153 per acre, versus \nthe estimated $1,533 per acre the committee assumes would be paid if \nthe entire coastal plain were leased.\n  Second, the Federal treasury may take in as little as ten percent of \nall leasing revenues, not a split of 50 percent as it appears that the \nBudget Committee currently assumes. The State of Alaska can be expected \nto sue to get 90 percent of the leasing revenues, as it does currently \nfor other leases on Federal lands in Alaska.\n  Mr. President, after the Exxon Valdez spill, I visited the tragic \nspill site, the industrial complex at Prudhoe Bay, and the coastal \nplain of the Arctic Refuge. What I saw was the best of nature and the \nfailings of humanity. I saw the best of nature in the Arctic Refuge, an \narea that the renowned biologist George Shaller calls ``unique and \nirreplaceable, not just on a national basis, but also on an \ninternational basis.'' He notes, ``most remote ecosystem, both inside \nand outside reserves, are rapidly being modified. The refuge has \nremained a rare exception. The refuge was established not for economic \nvalue, but as a statement of our nation's vision.'' [[Page S7342]] \n  Beauty, wilderness, pristine--these words simply fail to capture what \nI saw and what is at stake if we allow oil and gas drilling to proceed. \nThe infrastructure alone will severely impact the ecosystem. The oil \nrigs, roads, pipelines, airstrips, production facilities, seismic \ntesting and air and water pollution associated with the development \nwill have dramatic negative impacts on the fragile coastal plain \necosystem.\n  We also threaten the food and culture of one of the most traditional \nsubsistence peoples in the world, the Gwich'in indians who depend on \nthe healthy and undisturbed porcupine caribou herd which gives birth \nand raises its young in the coastal plain.\n  Unfortunately, in seeing the spill in Prince William Sound, I saw how \nempty promises and humanity's carelessness despoiled a rich ecosystem. \nDead wildlife, oil-coated beaches, fishing towns and villages of native \nAlaskans turned upside down with the destruction. Today, seabird, seal, \nsea otter, and herring populations still have not recovered, and the \nsocial disruption still is felt by the villagers. Most natural \nresources injured by the spill still show little or no sign of \nrecovery, according to the Exxon Valdez Trustee Council.\n  If we drill in the refuge, we threaten the unique wilderness system. \nAnd if we destroy the wilderness values in the Arctic Refuge, we also \nthreaten an undisturbed ecosystem with its polar bears, snow geese and \ninternational porcupine caribou.\n  The very nature of the budget process will denigrate the values of \nthe coastal plain which the public and previous Congresses have sought \nto protect. The debate will not be about whether wildlife and \nwilderness are worth more than the chance of finding oil--the debate \nwill hinge on what scores for budget deficit purposes. How do you score \npolar bears, musk oxen and caribou? How do you measure the loss of an \nintact, undisturbed ecosystem to science? How will the Budget Committee \naccount for the wilderness values which will be gone forever?\n  For all these reasons, Mr. President, I strongly object to the \nprovision assuming leasing revenues from the coastal plain in the \nbudget resolution. I strongly urge my colleagues to vote in favor of \nthe Roth amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this Congress should not have a yard sale \nto balance the budget.\n  A yard sale is an opportunity to clean house, to clear out things \nthat have outgrown their usefulness, and to get rid of junk you don't \nneed. The Alaska National Wildlife Refuge is not junk. It should not be \ndrilled for oil to balance the budget.\n  The refuge is one of a kind--in fact, it's the last of its kind. The \nAlaska National Wildlife Refuge is the only place we have left that \nresembles the kind of land that gave birth to our Nation centuries ago.\n  I wonder how many people realize that outside this chamber, 500 years \nago, the first Americans could hunt bison and elk in the open forests \non the banks of the Potomac. I wonder how many people remember that \noutside this building passenger pigeons used to roost in American \nchestnut trees, sometimes in flocks of thousands.\n  Today the bison and elk are gone, the passenger pigeon is extinct, \nand the American chestnut has been wiped out in this region by an \nexotic disease. The first Americans wouldn't recognize this place.\n  Now we turn to a remote corner of our country, the last expanse of \ntrue wildness left, and Congress is saying ``we need that too--to \nbalance the budget.'' On behalf of the children, I object.\n  Drilling for oil in the Alaska Wildlife Refuge has been a \ncontroversial issue for almost ten years. This is not a reason to sneak \nit into the budget resolution. This is an issue for the light of day, \nnot for legislative tricks.\n  Drilling for oil in Alaska is not even going to be a major \ncontribution to our deficit--the leasing revenues are only one-fifth of \none percent of the budget gap.\n  Finally, Alaska, the State that gets more Federal dollars per person \nthan any other State in the Union, will get at least 50 percent of the \nrevenues, and the State wants to take 90 percent according to previous \narrangements.\n  The Alaska National Wildlife Refuge is American treasure that does \nnot belong to us--it is the heritage of our country. Just like the bald \neagle, the grand canyon, and a good trout stream--ANWR exists for our \nenjoyment today and for the enjoyment of generations to come. It should \nnot be laced with roads and drilled for oil.\n  I urge support of this bipartisan amendment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am in strong support of the Roth \namendment.\n  We cannot sacrifice the incomparable wilderness of the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge to support our bad spending habits. This \nrefuge is one of the only remaining complete and undisturbed arctic \necosystems in the world. It is home to an abundance of wildlife, \nincluding grizzly and polar bears, musk-oxen, wolves, and a host of \nmigratory bird species. It is also home to the magnificent porcupine \ncaribou herd, whose 160,000 members rely on this coastal plain for \ntheir calving grounds.\n  ANWR also provides essential habitat for people. The Gwich'in people \nhave inhabited this arctic ecosystem for more than 20,000 years. They \nare dependent upon the caribou herd for their food source, clothing \nsupply and culture.\n  Mr. President, this body could, today, begin a process that will \nsignal the beginning of the end for many of the people and wildlife of \nANWR. With this budget resolution, the doors will be opened wide for \noil development in the Refuge. Oil development will likely disrupt the \nporcupine caribou and force them to change their calving grounds and \nmigratory routes. This, in turn, will affect other wildlife and impact \nthe lifestyle and culture of the Gwich'in people.\n  Proponents of development claim that only 13,000 acres of the Refuge \nwill be impacted. While this may be true, that development will take \nplace in the biological heart of ANWR and have a devastating impact on \nthe wilderness values of the area. In this biological heart, developers \nwill create a major industrial complex. They will build hundreds of \nmiles of roads and pipelines, erect housing for thousands of workers, \nand construct two sea ports and one airport. These developments will \nlead to mining of enormous amounts of gravel, will require diversion of \nstreams and will result in pollution of fragile tundra.\n  In addition to harming this precious piece of our heritage, I am \nskeptical about the revenue assumptions made in the budget resolution. \nThe resolution assumes an intake of $1.4 billion from ANWR oil leases. \nThis assumption is based on a split between the Federal Government and \nthe State of Alaska of 60/40. While the Federal Government may push for \nthis division, the state of Alaska has historically received 90 percent \nof the money from Arctic leases. It is likely that Alaska would file \nlawsuits to ensure that 10/90 split continues.\n  Leasing ANWR will not result in a balanced budget. Leasing ANWR will \nresult in an imbalanced ecosystem in one of our greatest wilderness \nareas. I urge this body to protect the Refuge for future generations of \nAmericans. Support the Roth amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Roth-\nLautenberg amendment. This is a deficit neutral amendment that will \ncorrect a misguided policy assumption in the current budget resolution.\n  Mr. President, the 1996 budget resolution assumes 2.3 billion dollars \nin revenue over 7 years from leases to oil companies for oil \nexploration and development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. It \nassumes the opening up of a unique wildlife refuge for the sake of oil \ndevelopment.\n  Mr. President, the 1980 passage of the Alaska National Interest Lands \nConservation Act opened up 95 percent of Alaskan lands with high or \nfavorable oil and gas potential to exploration and development.\n  That same act did NOT allow oil and gas exploration in an area of the \ncoastal plain designated ``section 1002'' because of its uniqueness as \na natural resource.\n  This ``Section 1002'' of the Arctic coastal plain is precisely the \nland area that the budget resolution assumes will be leased to oil \ncompanies for oil exploration activities.\n  Mr. President, in other words, the budget resolution assumes that \nexploration will occur in an area where in current law, it is \nexplicitly illegal to do so. [[Page S7343]] \n  What would the consequences be of opening up the Arctic plain to \ndevelopment?\n  I would like to quote to you from a passage written by Peter \nMatthiessen in his forward to the Natural Resources Defense Council \nreport Tracking Arctic Oil:\n\n       Today the oil companies have set their sights on the last \n     undeveloped lands to the eastward, pressuring Congress for \n     permission to exploit the 125 mile-long coastal plain of the \n     Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, the very last protected \n     stretch of our arctic coastline, where polar bears still hunt \n     over the ice and come ashore, where a mighty herd of 180,000 \n     caribou, with its attendant wolves, migrates each year from \n     Canada to give birth to its young. . . . The danger posed by \n     destructive and inefficient drilling in the Arctic with \n     irremediable loss to wilderness and wildlife, is not an \n     Alaskan problem. It is a national problem, a world problem.\n\n  Mr. President, the first step toward victory for those hungry oil \ncompanies occurred last week in the Senate, with the passage of a bill \nthat would lift the ban on the export of Alaska North Slope Oil.\n  The lifting of the ban goes against all the principles on which \nCongress based its controversial and expensive decision to construct \nthe Trans-Alaska Pipeline.\n  Today, we face step two: a budget resolution that assumes 2.3 billion \ndollars in revenue from oil exploration and development leases along \nthe pristine coastal plane of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  Republicans in the budget committee say that they are ``only leasing \n8 percent of the 19 million acres of the Arctic Wildlife Refuge'', and \nthat ``The development of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge would \nonly affect 13,000 acres''.\n  Those 13,000 acres are on the last pristine arctic coastal plain--and \nare part of the original wildlife range established by President \nEisenhower in 1960. Those 13,000 acres are in an area that the House of \nRepresentatives has twice voted to designate as wilderness in order to \ngive it permanent protection from any development.\n  The fact is, Mr. President, that what we are talking about here is \nturning the only remaining protected stretch of our arctic coastline \ninto an immense industrial desert.\n  Mr. President, leadership is about finding long term solutions to \nproblems--not temporary solutions.\n  The proposal to open the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge demonstrates \nlack of long term vision and a lack of leadership--I firmly believe \nthis is not where the citizens of this Nation want to go.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on agreeing to the \namendment offered by the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Roth amendment would reduce the \ninstructions to the Energy Committee by $2.3 billion over 7 years and \noffset that reduction by increasing revenues $2.3 billion over the same \nperiod of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator assumes this would be ANWR. I add that to \nmy explanation.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am glad to see that amendment offered \nby the Senator from Delaware to strike a major source of new Federal \nrevenues from the budget resolution was rejected by my colleagues. This \nsource of new revenue is $2.3 billion from competitive bonus bids from \nleasing the oil and gas resources of an area in the northeast part of \nmy State. This is an issue that is important to my State and to our \nNation. This vote to keep those funds in the budget resolution is a \nclear indication that my colleagues would like to see the revenues from \nthe leasing of this area considered in context of the budget deficit \nreduction effort.\n  Together with the other members of the Alaska delegation I opposed \nthis amendment. The amendment was also opposed by the Inupiat Eskimo \npeople who live on the North Slope; by the local government for this \nregion, the North Slope Borough; by the Eskimo-owned Arctic Slope \nRegional Corp.; by the State of Alaska; by our Governor Tony Knowles, \nand by an overwhelming majority of Alaskans.\n  Mr. President, I want to review the history and the potentially huge \nbenefits that opening the coastal plain to oil and gas leasing can \nprovide to the Nation.\n  In the 1980 Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act Congress \nwithdrew more than 19 million acres in northeast Alaska, 8 million \nacres were designated wilderness and another 11 million acres \nnonwilderness refuge lands. However, under section 1002 of that act \nCongress set aside about 1.5 million acres to study for oil potential. \nThe purpose of the study was to evaluate the oil and gas values and the \nfish and wildlife values of this area.\n  In April 1987 the Department of the Interior released the legislative \nenvironmental impact statement and coastal plain report to the \nCongress.\n  This led to the recommendation of the Secretary of the Interior to \nopen the 1002 area to oil and gas leasing. Let me quote from the \nreport:\n\n       The 1002 area is the Nation's best single opportunity to \n     increase significantly domestic oil production. It is rated \n     by geologists as the most outstanding petroleum exploration \n     target in the onshore United States. Data from nearby wells \n     in the Prudhoe Bay area and in the Canadian Beaufort Sea and \n     Mackenzie Delta, combined with promising seismic data \n     gathered on the 1002 area, indicate extensions of producing \n     trends and other geologic conditions exceptionally favorable \n     for discovery of one or more supergiant fields (larger than \n     500 million barrels).\n       There is a 19-percent chance that economically recoverable \n     oil occurs in the 1002 area. The average of all estimates of \n     conditional economically recoverable oil resources (the \n     ``mean'') is 3.2 billion barrels. Based on this estimate, \n     1002 area production by the year 2005 could provide 4 percent \n     of total U.S. demand; provide 8 percent of U.S. production \n     (about 660,000 barrels/day); and reduce imports by nearly 9 \n     percent. This production could provide net national economic \n     benefits of $79.4 billion, including Federal revenues of \n     $38.0 billion.\n\n  The report continues:\n\n       Discovery of 9.2 billion barrels of oil could yield \n     production of more than 1.5 million barrels per day. \n     Estimates of net national economic benefits based on 9.2 \n     billion barrels of oil production, and other economic \n     assumptions, are as high as $325 billion.\n\n  On April 8, 1991, the Department of the Interior issued a formal \nupdate of the recoverable petroleum reserves 1987 study and report. The \nmajor finding from the update was that the probability of economic \nsuccess of finding commercial oil in the 1002 area was increased from \n19 percent to 46 percent. [[Page S7344]] \n  Let me place this in context. The probability of finding oil in the \nlower 48 States in an unexplored area is about 1 percent. As a result, \n46 percent is unprecedented.\n  Mr. President, let me quote from the 1991 update:\n\n       The 1991 update of recoverable petroleum resources in the \n     1987 Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Alaska Coastal Plain \n     Assessment, also known as the 1002 Report, makes a \n     considerable contribution to the knowledge and understanding \n     of the petroleum geology of the 1002 area of the Arctic \n     National Wildlife Rufuge (ANWR). This study reaffirms most of \n     the conclusions and estimates made in the 1002 Report, and \n     increases the level of confidence that ANWR is part of the \n     North Slope oil province. This is demonstrated by the \n     increase in the marginal probability of economic success from \n     19 percent in the original assessment to 46 percent in the \n     current assessment. The increase in marginal probability \n     means that ANWR has a higher potential for oil discovery. The \n     overall Minimum Economic Field Size (MEFS) for the 1002 area \n     has been lowered from about 0.44 billion barrels of oil (BBO) \n     to about 0.40 BBO. The mean resource estimate has increased \n     from 3.23 to 3.57 BBO.''\n\n  Mr. President, since this 1991 update, a number of new wells have \nbeen drilled near the 1002 area. A large number discovered oil and gas. \nSome of these wells may be commercial oil- fields. These discoveries \nreflect very favorably on the prospect that the coastal plain contains \nmajor reserves of oil and gas.\n  As the reports quoted above make clear, the economic benefits of the \ncoastal plains oil and gas reserves far exceed the $2.3 billion assumed \nin the pending budget resolution. The 1987 report notes that a \ndiscovery of 3.2 billion barrels of oil would produce net national \neconomic benefits of $79.4 billion, including new Federal revenues of \n$38 billion. A discovery of 9.2 billion barrels would yield net \nnational economic benefits of $325 billion and new Federal revenues of \naround $150 billion over the life of the oil fields.\n  The Department of Energy and Wharton Econometrics have done \nindependent studies which project that leasing the coastal plain could \ncreate 250,000 to 732,000 new direct and indirect jobs in all 50 of our \nStates.\n  Mr. President, in addition to providing a major stimulus to the \neconomy and creating new jobs, opening the 1002 area will allow my \nState to continue to produce 25 percent or more of the Nation's \ndomestic oil for an additional 30 or 40 more years. This is very \nimportant because Prudhoe Bay is now in decline. Since 1990, oil \nproduction has fallen from 2 million barrels a day to 1.6 million \nbarrels a day. Every barrel of oil produced in Alaska is a barrel the \nUnited States does not have to buy abroad.\n  Senator Henry M. ``Scoop'' Jackson authored the Alaska Statehood Act \nand the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971. Senator Jackson \nwas a tough, no nonsense moderate Democrat. He was fair. He was \naccessible. He was informed. And he was balanced. Senator Jackson heard \nfrom all of the special interest groups, but he made his own decisions, \nbased upon all of the facts and the interest of people and of the \nNation.\n  Jackson, along with the senior Senator from Alaska, authored the \nlegislation to open Prudhoe Bay to oil production by authorizing the \nTrans Alaska Pipeline Act in 1973. In the face of major opposition from \nthe national environmental organizations, this legislation was adopted. \nAs a result, the Nation has enjoyed two decades of major economic \nbenefits.\n  Scoop also worked out the compromise that was reached which led to \nthe study and report authorized in section 1002. The reason the 1.5 \nmillion acres was set aside was to consider the great oil potential in \nthe area. Scoop included the provision of the national security \nconcerns associated with our country being reliant on foreign oil. We \nare more reliant on foreign oil than ever before. We imported more than \n50 percent of our oil consumption for the first time in 1994.\n  Mr. President, the opposition to opening the coastal plain to oil and \ngas leasing comes from the leaders of some of the Nation's large \nenvironmental organizations. My view is that the leaders of these \norganizations are misguided and poorly informed. I suspect that their \nopposition has more to do with ``fundraising'' objectives than it does \nwith ``wilderness'' values.\n  The leaders of the environmental community have invested a great deal \nof time, effort, and money in the Gwich'in Indian steering committee. \nThe steering committee is composed of some of the 400 Athabascan \nIndians who live in two villages on the Venetie Indian Reservation. The \nsteering committee opposes opening the coastal plain. They are \nconcerned that leasing and development might, in some unknown way, \nadversely impact the porcupine caribou herd. This herd of 160,000 \nanimals annually migrates between Canada and the United States. In some \nyears, the herd uses the southern portion of the coastal plain for \nforage and calving. Last year, North Slope Eskimos and Athabascan \nIndians took about 380 caribou from this herd of 160,000 animals for \nsubsistence uses.\n  I respect the right of the Gwich'in steering committee to oppose \nresource development in the coastal plain. It is a decision, however, \nwhich is contrary to experience at Prudhoe Bay and elsewhere in the \nArctic. Caribou are very adaptable. At Prudhoe Bay, the central Arctic \ncaribou herd is flourishing with oil development. Since oil was \ndiscovered in Prudhoe Bay the central Arctic caribou herd has increased \nfrom 3,000 to 23,000 animals.\n  Further, the Gwich'in steering committees opposition to oil and gas \nleasing is a new development. In 1980 the Gwich'in people of Arctic \nvillage and Venetie villages leased all of the lands in their 1.7 \nmillion acre reservation to the Rouget Oil Co. of Tulsa, OK. This 20-\npage oil and gas lease did not contain any meaningful provisions to \nprotect the porcupine caribou herd. This herd migrates annually through \nor near the Venetie Reservation. Yet, the Gwich'in leased all of their \nlands for $1.8 million on the basis that oil exploration and oil \ndevelopment would not adversely impact the herds well-being. I believe \nthis leasing decision by the Gwich'in was correct. It is supported by \nstudies of caribou and oil industry experience elsewhere, including \nAlaska's North Slope.\n  In 1984, the Gwich'in people hired a consultant to lease their \nreservation lands a second time after the Rouget Oil Co. oil and gas \nlease expired. And again, no concerns were expressed by the Gwich'in \nabout any adverse impact on caribou.\n  The North Slope Inupiat Eskimo people are now asking for the same \nopportunity the Gwich'in had in the 1980's. They regret and I regret \nthat the oil company that Gwich'in leased their lands to did not \ndiscover major reserves of oil and gas on their lands. The North Slope \nEskimo people want the same right to do as the Gwich'in did in 1980. \nThey want the right to explore the 92,000 acres of land they own at \nKaktovik along with the surrounding Federal lands. And if these lands \ncontain oil and gas in commercial amounts, they want the right to \ndevelop their land.\n  Mr. President, I am glad to see that the amendment from my colleagues \nfrom Delaware was defeated. We now can proceed with consideration of \nresponsible oil and gas exploration and development of the best \nprospect for a major oil find in North America.\n                           Amendment No. 1151\n\n  (Purpose: To restore funding for agriculture and nutrition programs)\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon], for himself, Mr. \n     Daschle, Mr. Conrad, and Mr. Wellstone, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1151.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 74, strike lines 12 through 24 and insert the \n     following: ``budget, the revenue and spending aggregates may \n     be revised and other appropriate budgetary aggregates and \n     levels may be revised to reflect the additional deficit \n     reduction achieved as calculated under subsection (c) for \n     legislation that reduces revenues, and for legislation that \n     will provide $15,000,000,000 in outlays to the Committee on \n     Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry for the purpose of \n     restoring outlay reductions required of that committee \n     pursuant to section 6 of this resolution.\n       ``(b) Revised Allocations and Aggregates.--Upon the \n     reporting of legislation pursuant to subsection (a), and \n     again upon [[Page S7345]] the submission of a conference \n     report on such legislation (if a conference report is \n     submitted), the Chair of the Committee on the Budget of the \n     Senate may submit to the Senate appropriately revised \n     allocations under sections 302(a) and 602(a) of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974; budgetary aggregates; and \n     levels under this resolution, revised by an amount that does \n     not exceed the additional deficit reduction specified under \n     subsection (d).''.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, Senator Exon's amendment to restore $15 \nbillion in agricultural spending is a step in the right direction for \nrural America. It is a step in the right direction for the American \nfamilies who depend on USDA nutrition programs. It stands in stark \ncontrast to the Republican budget that takes these funds from rural \nAmerica, not to reduce the deficit, but to fund tax breaks for some of \nthe wealthiest Americans.\n  The Exon amendment instead directs the $15 billion where it is most \nneeded, to farmers who struggle each year to stay on the farm, to keep \nproducing America's food and fiber supply, and to families who strike a \nrough patch when there is job loss or other bad luck, people trying to \nput food on the table and keep their families together.\n  The Republican budget, on the other hand, raids rural America to aid \nthe comfortable. The Republican budget proposal would cut $45.9 billion \nout of the Agriculture Department over the next 7 years. That is likely \nto translate to around $12 billion in direct cuts to farm programs. It \nis a 20-percent cut in farm spending. It will contribute to the further \ndeterioration of the economic and social fabric of rural America. No \nother sector of American life is being asked to absorb such a hit. We \ncannot have a prosperous Urban America riding on the back of an \nimpoverished Farm America. Yet that's what Republican budget cuts will \nproduce.\n  Farmers in South Dakota would see a devastating decline in their \nincome of over $57 million. Other rural States will suffer similar \npain. This budget is shortsighted for rural America and self-interested \nfor the best off. It is not a balanced, fair proposal. It is not a \nbudget that sustains the American tradition of building a strong farm \nsector, a tradition that has enjoyed bipartisan support until this \nRepublican majority.\n  Make no mistake, the agricultural community recognizes the enormity \nof the Federal budget and is committed to reducing it. Farmers are some \nof our most fiscally conservative citizens. But America's producers--\nrightly--feel they should not be asked to bear a disproportionate share \nof spending reductions.\n  They are right. America's producers have already contributed their \nshare. Long before the budget cutters turned to other programs to see \nwhere we could cut, farm producers over the last decade have already \nseen commodity program spending decline more than 60 percent. Other \nparts of the Federal budget have expanded, while agriculture has \nconsistently been cut back. Now we are cutting into live growth, not \ndeadwood. If other Federal sending had been reduced at anything near \nthe same rate as agricultural spending has been, we would have a budget \nsurplus. In this context, to make farmers take another deep cut just to \ngive the richest Americans a tax break adds insult to injury.\n  Ideas have consequences and so do choices. If we choose to sacrifice \na healthy farm sector to the momentary impulse to finance a tax cut, we \nwill pay more down the road. We cannot disinvest and disinvest and \ndisinvest in rural America, channeling support to virtually every other \nsector, without finally paying the price. The fact is, these cuts could \neasily cost us more than they save. Barely 10 years ago, in the mid-\n1980's, we learned the price of misguided and mistaken policies that \nstarved rural America. We paid billions to repair the damage done by \nshortsighted farm policies, unforeseen weather patterns and changing \neconomic conditions. There were more farm and rural business \nforeclosures and bankruptcies than at any time since the Great \nDepression.\n  Right now, producers in South Dakota and across the Midwest are \nsuffering from unseasonably wet weather and destructive flooding. They \ncannot get their crops in the ground. So they will be struggling to \nmake it through this difficult year even with the current level of farm \nspending. With the cuts in the Republican budget proposal, net income \nwill plummet, and land prices will fall again. Another bad year could \npush many producers over the edge into insolvency.\n  We can and should do more to streamline agricultural programs, both \nto make them farmer friendly and to curb costs. But there is a \ndifference in curbing costs and what this budget proposal does. This \nbudget imposes a straightjacket on Congress as we are trying to write a \nbetter, more responsive and more flexible farm bill. This budget will \nprevent reasonable reform, not promote it. It is exactly the wrong way \nto go.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, this amendment, using a $170 billion bonus \nsurplus, gives $15 billion to the Agriculture Committee. The rest can \nstill be used for tax cuts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Are we ready to vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE COSTS OF THE \n                   NATIONAL VOTER REGISTRATION ACT OF 1993.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that within the assumptions \n     under budget function 800 funds will be spent for \n     reimbursement to the States for the costs of implementing the \n     National Voter Registration Act of 1993.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Coverdell amendment is a sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution stating that the funds within this resolution \nshould be spent for reimbursement to States for motor-voter mandates.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, as the lead Republican sponsor of the \nNational Voter Registration Act, I was very interested in a recent New \nYork Times article reporting on the progress of voter registration \nsince the bill's implementation in January of this year. Over 2 million \nnew voters have been registered in the first quarter of 1995 and the \nNational Motor-Voter Coalition estimates that approximately 20 million \nnew voters will be registered by the 1996 Presidential election.\n  It is very gratifying to hear that this important program is being \nimplemented successfully and that the results are exceeding our \nexpectations. I realize there are concerns about this law being a \nburden to the States and its financial impact on them. However, I would \nremind my colleagues that many innovative States, including Oregon, led \nthe way for the Federal Government by adopting State motor-voter laws \nand supported a national law. Additionally, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office study on the implementation costs of motor-\nvoter, the aggregate costs for States would be 20 to 25 million \nannually for 5 years. Mr. President, this does not meet the \nrequirements of the Federal unfunded mandate legislation passed earlier \nthis year by the Senate--which I supported.\n  It is our obligation as policy-makers to protect the voting process \nand, at the same time, to make it accessible. The motor-voter law \neffectively achieves both of these important responsibilities and, \ntherefore, I voted against the Coverdell amendment to the budget \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, and I would like to thank the junior \nSenator from Massachusetts for offering his amendment that would derail \nthis misguided effort to eliminate the Presidential election campaign \nfund.\n  It came as a surprise--and a disappointment--to many of us that when \nthe Republican Party announced last fall their new Contract With \nAmerica and declared their commitment to reforming the Congress and \nending business as usual in Washington, that they did not even bother \nto mention campaign finance reform in their contract.\n  Well, we are now out from under the first 100 days of the contract, \nand there is still no indication that the Senate will be turning to \ncampaign finance reform anytime soon.\n  But not only are we going to be prevented from taking a step forward, \nthe budget resolution before us today would push us back--20 years \nback--to the days before Congress recognized how fundamentally flawed \nour system of Presidential campaigns was.\n  Mr. President, what in the world is the logic behind this? As far as \nI know, even the most vocal opponents of the Presidential campaign \nsystem are not willing to suggest that we have had a single unfair \nPresidential election in the past 20 years. Nor has any general \nelection candidate for President, to my knowledge, ever said in the \npast 20 years that their loss was attributable to the lack of financial \nresources.\n  That is because the Presidential campaign finance system is based on \nsimple principles. One principle is that money should not determine the \noutcome of elections. Another is that elected officials should not be \nspending inordinate amounts of time on the phone soliciting campaign \nfunds.\n  That is what the Presidential system is about. If there is a problem \nof inadequate funding of the Presidential campaign fund, then that \nshould be addressed. We did it 2 years ago and we can do it again.\n  But instead, this resolution is trying to fix a wristwatch with a \nsledgehammer, preferring to discard the one [[Page S7347]] Federal \ncampaign system that has produced fair and competitive elections during \nthe last 20 years rather than finding a targeted solution to ensuring \nthe solvency of the Presidential fund.\n  Finally, I have to ask why the Republicans are trying to do this \nunder the camouflage of the budget resolution. If opponents of the \nPresidential system want to eliminate it, then let us have public \nhearings in the Rules Committee and have an intelligent discussion \nabout it.\n  If opponents of public financing are so convinced that the American \npeople are also opposed to public financing, why are the opponents so \nreluctant to have a public debate on this issue on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate?\n  There is not a single word in the budget resolution about what we are \ngoing to replace the Presidential system with.\n  But again, I have not heard anyone in the nearly 20 years of this \nsystem's existence criticize it for being unfair to challengers, unfair \nto either party, or dominated by special interests.\n  This is a system we need to emulate, not eliminate.\n  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his leadership on this \nissue and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, since I was elected to the Senate in 1972, \none of my central themes has been to get special-interest money out of \npolitical campaigns. The first testimony I every gave as a U.S. Senator \nwas before the Senate Rules Committee in favor of public funding--\ninstead of special-interest funding--of political campaigns.\n  Unfortunately, we have not moved forward as much as I would have \nliked or as much as I have repeatedly advocated. And, what little we \nhave done is now on the chopping block.\n  The Republican budget would eliminate the only positive step we have \ntaken in the last 20 years to clean up our political campaign system--\ngetting special-interest money out of the general election campaigns \nfor President and limiting the amount Presidential candidates can \nspend. Now, the Republicans are trying to let the special-interest, big \nmoney back in.\n  The Republican budget would repeal the Presidential campaign check-\noff system. It is a rather simple system. When you file your income \ntaxes each year, you can check off the box at the top of the tax form \nto have $3 of your taxes go to finance Presidential campaigns. It is a \nvoluntary system. No one has to check it off. No ones taxes are \naffected by the decision. And, the only money that goes to Presidential \ncampaigns is the money that people check off voluntarily. In exchange \nfor taking the money, Presidential candidates must limit how much they \nspend.\n  A simple system. A voluntary system. And, yet the system has worked. \nNo more special interest money in the general election, and no more \nrunaway spending.\n  In the last 20 years, very few people have accused Presidential \ncandidates of being beholden to special interest. Less than 1 percent \nof the money in Presidential campaigns comes from PAC's--political \naction committees. And, once the Presidential primaries are over, the \nquest for money essentially ends. Candidates can spend their time \ndebating the issues--not catering to special-interests.\n  Meanwhile, spending has been held down. Consider this: in the 1992 \nPresidential election, President Clinton and President Bush combined \nspent less in constant dollars then President Nixon spent all by \nhimself in the Watergate election of 1972--before there were spending \nlimits and before there was the Presidential check-off system.\n  What has been the result of all of this compared to the old system? \nCleaner campaigns, fairer campaigns, more competitive campaigns, \ncampaigns more focuses on the issues, and campaigns with limited \nspending.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the Kerry amendment, \nwhich I have cosponsored. It would keep the Presidential check-off \nsystem in tact. Now is not the time to return Presidential campaigns to \nthe days of runaway spending controlled by special interests.\n  This system is not broken. We should not break it.\n                Amendment No. 1154 to Amendment No. 1153\n\n(Purpose: To express the Sense of the Senate on use of the Presidential \n         Election Campaign Fund in regard to sexual harassment)\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the assumptions \n     underlying function 800 include the following: that payments \n     to presidential campaigns from the Presidential Election \n     Campaign Fund, as authorized by the Federal Election Campaign \n     Act of 1974, should not be used to pay for or augment damage \n     awards or settlements arising from a civil or criminal \n     action, or the threat thereof, related to sexual harassment.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today--on C-SPAN--we answer the \nquestion: can we ever get rid of any government program?\n  Even if the program is wasteful, even if it is a proven failure, even \nif we've been spending taxpayers' money on it against their will--will \nwe put a stop to it?\n  Even if the program is a complete boondoggle for politicians--in \nfact, politicians receive every dime from it--can Congress bring itself \nto kill such a program? Stay tuned.\n  The Budget Committee, under the able leadership of Chairman Domenici, \nwisely chose to end the failed Presidential Election Campaign Fund \nprogram. Make no mistake: the Presidential Election Campaign Fund is \nnot simply troubled or fraught with problems--it is an utter failure.\n  It has not achieved any of its stated objectives. It does not limit \nspecial interests. It does not lessen the money chase. It does not even \nlimit spending. On the other hand, it does distort the political \nprocess, by causing campaigns to employ battalions of lawyers to seek \nout and exploit loopholes. It does fork over millions of taxpayer \ndollars to fringe candidates like Lenora Fulani, and even criminals \nlike Lyndon LaRouche.\n  It was the reformers' dream. It has become the taxpayers' nightmare.\n  From beginning to end, the Presidential system of spending limits and \nvoluntary taxpayer funding is a hoax that 85 percent of American \ntaxpayers are not falling for. The tax return checkoff mechanism, which \nfeeds the fund, is itself a fraud. The checkoff appropriates money out \nof the Treasury. It gives a tiny minority--14.5 percent of filers \nchecked ``yes'' on their 1993 returns--the power to appropriate tax \ndollars paid by all Americans.\n  The system is not voluntary for the 85 percent of American taxpayers \nwho choose not to check ``yes,'' but are forced to pay for the few who \ndo. These checkoff dollars don't come out of the pocket of those who \ncheck ``yes''--anymore than appropriations bills come out of the\n pockets of the Senators who vote for them.\n\n  Democracy would be aided--not imperiled--by the demise of the \nPresidential fund. Every year, Americans vote on this fund, via the tax \ncheckoff. It is the largest single public opinion poll conducted \nannually in this country, on the popularity of taxpayer financing of \ncampaigns.\n  The high water-mark--28.7 percent checking ``yes''--was realized on \nthe 1980 tax returns. It's been a downward trajectory since, even \nthough the dollar checkoff has itself been eroded by inflation and \npresumably would be an increasingly inexpensive proposition. Therefore, \nto get more money out of fewer people, President Clinton's 1993 budget/\ntax bill tripled the checkoff to $3. The result was a 23-percent \ndecrease in the checkoff rate--fewer people than ever supporting it--\nwhile the total amount diverted from the Treasury increased 258 \npercent, from $28 million to $71 million.\n  I can tell you there is no outpouring of support among Kentuckians, \nor residents of any other State, for this program. In fact, they are \ncrying out that [[Page S7348]] they do not want their tax dollars \npaying for anyone's campaign. Not the President's. Not Lenora Fulani's. \nNot anybody's.\n  And certainly they aren't interested in paying for a campaign that \nLyndon LaRouche ran from his prison cell. Nevertheless, LaRouche \nreceived Federal matching funds for the Presidential campaign he \nconducted while serving a 15-year sentence for fraud. Having run in \n1980, 1984, 1988, and 1992, he's now planning another run in 1996--\ncourtesy of the taxpayers. Maybe the fifth time's a charm.\n  And then there's Lenora Fulani--I'm hoping to make Ms. Fulani as \nfamous as Senator Gramm has made Dicky Flatt; because no one knows who \nshe is. Well, you may not know Ms. Fulani, but you're paying her \ncampaign bills through the presidential fund.\n  Lenora Fulani is with the New Alliance Party, another household word \nin politics. Ms. Fulani is the lucky recipient of over $3.5 million in \ntaxpayer dollars over the course of three elections--1994, 1988, 1992.\n  In fact, she's gotten so good at the game that she was the first \ncandidate--ahead of George Bush, Bill Clinton, and all the rest--to \nqualify for matching funds for the 1992 campaign. Anyone want to bet \nthere will be another Fulani candidacy in 1996? Who could resist \nmillions of dollars in taxpayer largesse?\n  As these fringe candidates proliferate, I can imagine the \nPresidential fund enlisting Ed McMahon to notify all those who qualify \nthat they have won the grand prize: an all-expense-paid Presidential \nelection campaign--not from Publishers Clearinghouse, but from the \nAmerican taxpayers.\n  Some proponents of taxpayer-financed campaigns say it is \ninappropriate--even hypocritical--for those who have participated in \nthe Presidential system to oppose it. That is absurd. If that were the \ncase--that participating in the system is tantamount to endorsing it--\nthen what should be said about all those from the other side who run \nfor the Senate under a system they want to replace with taxpayer \nfinancing and spending limits?\n  Mr. President, playing by the rules as they exist does not, nor \nshould it, preclude anyone from trying to change them for the better. I \nhaven't seen anyone from the other side volunteer to abide by spending \nlimits because they think they're such a great idea. Is that what is \nbeing suggested?\n  In the same way, Presidential candidates must participate in the \nsystem as it is, not as they would like it to be. That being the case, \nevery single candidate running for President but two has decided, quite \nlogically, to accept the funding--because not to do so would cede a \nhuge financial advantage to other candidates.\n  Not surprisingly, the only two major candidates who have turned down \nthis generous subsidy were extremely wealthy: millionaire John Connally \nin 1980 and billionaire Ross Perot in 1992.\n  So the notion that you are precluded from reforming a program that \nyou have almost no choice but to participate in is absolutely \nludicrous, and should be ignored.\n  But there is another argument against reforming the Presidential \nsystem that should not just be ignored--it should be condemned.\n  Common Cause--which has perfected the art of hysterical, money-\ngrubbing direct-mail appeals--issued a letter on May 11 in which it \nsaid that opposition to taxpayer financing of Presidential campaigns is \nan endorsement of corruption. It went on to charge that a vote for the \nbudget resolution--as is--is a vote for corruption.\n  Over the years, Common Cause has dished up so much disinformation on \ncampaign finance reform, under the guise of good government, that even \nthe Democrats ignore them--or barely tolerate them. They have become a \nparody of their former selves--just another self-interested Washington \nlobby, adding to the cacophony of government-bashing, while making a \ntidy sum in the process. But this goes beyond the pale.\n  The Presidential Election Campaign Fund is a failed relic from the \npost-Watergate reform era. In fact, most of the proposals that were \nenacted in that era were struck down by the Supreme Court as wholesale \ntrampling of constitutional freedoms. So the fact that this system was \nconceived in the wake of Watergate is not necessarily an impressive \npedigree.\n  But since the proponents of taxpayer financing like to invoke \nWatergate, I'd like to read directly from the report prepared by the \nSenate Select Committee on Watergate, which was charged with making \nlegislative recommendations to deal with the issues raised by this \nscandal.\n  Recommendation No. 7, which appears on page 572 of that report, reads \nas follows:\n\n       The committee recommends against the adoption of any form \n     of public financing in which tax moneys are collected and \n     allocated to political candidates by the Federal Government. \n     * * * [t]he committee takes issue with the contention that \n     public financing affords either an effective or appropriate \n     solution. Thomas Jefferson believed `to compel a man to \n     furnish contributions of money for the propagation of \n     opinions which he disbelieves and abhors, is sinful and \n     tyrannical.'\n       The Committee's opposition is based, like Jefferson's, upon \n     the fundamental need to protect the voluntary right of \n     individual citizens to express themselves politically as \n     guaranteed by the first amendment. Furthermore, we find \n     inherent dangers in authorizing the Federal bureaucracy to \n     fund and excessively regulate political campaigns.\n       The abuses reexperienced during the 1972 campaign and \n     unearthed by the Select Committee were perpetrated in the \n     absence of any effective regulation of the source, form, or \n     amount of campaign contributions. In fact, despite the \n     progress made by the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, \n     in requiring full public disclosure of contributions, the \n     1972 campaign still was funded through a system of \n     essentially unrestricted, private financing.\n       What now seems appropriate is not the abandonment of \n     private financing, but rather the reform of that system in an \n     effort to vastly expand the voluntary participation of \n     individual citizens while avoiding the abuses of earlier \n     campaigns.\n\n  That is what the Watergate Select Committee had to say about the \nmatter. So you can call taxpayer financing of campaigns a Common Cause \nreform, but don't call it a Watergate reform, because the Senate \ncommittee in charge of formulating a response to the crisis rejected \nthe idea, flat-out.\n  The fact that the Presidential Election Campaign Fund slipped \nthrough, thereby putting the Government in the business of bribing \npeople to forfeit their constitutional rights, is an unfortunate legacy \nof those tumultuous years. But just because the fund has barely \nsurvived for two decades--teetering on the brink of bankruptcy before \nPresident Clinton bailed it out 2 years ago with taxpayers' money--does \nnot justify its perpetuity.\n  It is the myopia of big-Government liberals that prevents them from \nseeing that anything could possibly replace a Government program. So we \nneed to answer the question: What would exist after the Presidential \nfund's demise?\n  Why, a system in which private citizens voluntarily contribute \npublicly disclosed and limited donations to the candidates of their \nchoice--in other words, the system contemplated by the Watergate Select \nCommittee.\n  Perhaps now, 20 years after Watergate, Congress can finally get it \nright.\n  Of course, I expect the professional government-bashers like Common \nCause to say that reverting to a privately funded\n Presidential system is somehow a guarantee of corruption. They have \nbeen calling the privately financed congressional system corrupt for \nyears. In their view, the only clean money is the taxpayers' money.\n\n  You see, they have this theory that your hard-earned money is dirty \nand corrupting until it's been laundered by the Internal Revenue \nService. It's a very interesting theory, to say the least.\n  However, we have already pumped nearly a billion dollars of the \ntaxpayers' money into the Presidential system, and it has not achieved \nany of the purported goals of that system. The congressional system, on \nthe other hand, doesn't use a dime of taxpayers' money for political \ncampaigns, and if there are instances where it has bred corruption, \nthen--as chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee--I would like to hear \nabout them and we will investigate them to the fullest.\n  If the issue really is corruption, then contribution limits and \npublic disclosure are the best preventive measures--not another \ntaxpayer-funded Government program.\n  But I think the charge of corruption here is just a convenient smoke-\nscreen to maintain the status quo and to let this failed and wasteful \nsystem continue in perpetuity. [[Page S7349]] \n  I think the real issue before us is whether this Congress, faced with \na $4.7 trillion-dollar debt, will step up to the challenge of \neliminating any Government program, even one with as dismal a record as \nthe failed Presidential system.\n  As I said at the outset: despite the expenditure of millions of tax \ndollars, this system has not curbed special interests. It has not ended \nthe money chase. It has not reduced the emphasis on fundraising. It has \nnot even limited campaign spending, as misguided a goal as that is.\n  In fact, this Government program is an utter embarrassment: the \nFederal Election Commission can't even finish its audits of candidates \nuntil they're ready to run again. Every candidate except one has been \ncited for inadvertent violations. Accountants and lawyers are blowing \nopen new loopholes every election that hold the entire system up to \nridicule.\n  And what is the money being spent on? Convenient balloons. Negative \nads. Consultants. Opposition research. Just the things that American \ntaxpayers are telling us they want more of.\n  Will Congress step up to the plate and put at least one wasteful \nGovernment program out of business? Will Congress let the taxpayers off \nthe hook--just once? Will Congress get rid of this exclusive perk for \npoliticians?\n  Inquiring taxpayers want to know.\n  It's time to pull the plug on the taxpayer-financed Presidential \nsystem. It should surprise no one that this Republican Congress, in \npursuant of a balanced budget, should seek to abolish a proven failure \nlike the Presidential Election Campaign Fund. This is one entitlement \nprogram on which the sun should have set--a long time ago.\n\n\n                    second-degree--sexual harassment\n\n  However, if the Senator from Massachusetts prevails in his quest to \ncontinue taxpayer-financing of Presidential campaigns, then at the \nleast we should take some steps to reassure taxpayers that their money \nis used for legitimate campaign purposes. The Presidential Election \nCampaign Fund should not be used to quash scandals such as allegations \nof sexual harassment. Such abuse of taxpayer funds itself impairs \npublic confidence in Government.\n  The second-degree amendment that I am putting forth simply states:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the assumptions \n     underlying function 800 include the following: that payments \n     to presidential campaigns from the Presidential Election \n     Campaign Fund, as authorized by the Federal Election Campaign \n     Act of 1974, should not be used to pay for or augment damage \n     awards or settlements arising from a civil or criminal \n     action, or the threat thereof, related to sexual harassment.\n\n  Mr. President, this is not a hypothetical. It came to light--2\\1/2\\ \nyears after the fact--that President Clinton's 1992 taxpayer-funded \nPresidential campaign used $37,500 to settle a sexual harassment suit \nagainst one of the then-candidate's top aides.\n  This expense item was discovered during the course of an audit of the \nClinton campaign which resulted in a recommendation that the campaign \nrepay to the Treasury a record $4 million. The Commission ultimately \nscaled back the repayment. Along with items including $180,000 in \nquestionable petty cash disbursements, $70,000 for lost rental cars, \ncomputers and other equipment, was the $37,500 to settle what the \ncampaign termed an ``employment dispute.''\n  The Clinton campaign had listed the expense as consulting fees. How \nmuch of it was in fact for consulting and how much was for keeping \nquiet, is unclear. The Washington Post reported on February 15 of this \nyear that ``. . . given the dearth of information the campaign \nprovided, the FEC has ordered it to repay $9,675 in Federal funds that \nwere used in the payment.''\n  Mr. President, the confidentiality clause in the agreement between \nthe claimant and the Clinton campaign impeded the audit and with \nrepayment of part of the money the Federal Election Commission has \nreportedly closed the investigation. Considering that taxpayer funds \nintended for Presidential campaigning are involved, perhaps the matter \nshould be revisited. In any event, the Senate should make clear that \ntaxpayer funds drawn from the Presidential Election Campaign Fund \nshould not be used to coverup charges of sexual harassment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Senator McConnell's second-degree \namendment is a sense of the Senate that Presidential campaign fund \nmoneys should not go toward settling sexual harassment suits.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, this amendment would restore the budget \nstructure of the IRS compliance initiative which now is established in \nlast year's budget resolution with bipartisan support. The initiative \nwas established off budget because of its return of $5 for every $1 \nspent. This budget resolution would change that structure, placing the \nIRS initiative under the spending caps.\n  The amendment strikes that language to ensure that the compliance \ninitiative will be fully funded at $9.2 billion over 5 years and \ndelinquent taxes brought to the Treasury.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I do not object to the statement, but \nfrankly I hope we will exchange statements in the future.

We started at 31, got down to 20, and now it has \ngotten up to 50.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that the only first-degree amendments in \norder to the budget resolution be those submitted by 5:15 this evening.\n  Is there objection to that?\n  Mr. FORD. What about second degree?\n  Mr. DOLE. This only applies to first degree.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. We have been discussing this agreement. This would not \npreclude second-degree amendments. The sponsors of the amendments would \nhave to turn them in to the managers prior to 5:15. I think it is a \ngood suggestion and I hope we can accommodate it.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Which one are we voting on now?\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, the second-degree amendment strikes language \nin the Grassley-Domenici amendment which would restructure the IRS \ncompliance initiative placing it within the budget caps.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BROWN. Is it then true that because none of those amendments have \n[[Page S7352]] been delivered by 5:15, no further first-degree \namendments are in order to the bill?\n  Mr. President, I note that it is now 5:39 and that as of 5:15 none of \nthe amendments had been presented.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendments were to be presented to the \nmanagers of the bill, not the clerk.\n  Mr. BROWN.

The chair does not know what amendments have \nbeen submitted to either of the managers.\n  Mr. EXON. You can get the word of the two managers, if that will \nsuffice for the distinguished Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I do not mean to obstruct proceedings but I \nhave been trying to get copies of amendments after 5:15. I have asked \nthe managers, and they are still not available.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon], for Mr. Bingaman, for \n     himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Biden, Mr. \n     Hollings, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Pryor, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1162.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the concurrent resolution, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE IMPORTANCE OF RESEARCH, \n                   TECHNOLOGY, AND TRADE PROMOTION AND TRADE LAW \n                   ENFORCEMENT PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the public welfare, economy, and national security of \n     the United States have benefited enormously from the \n     investments the Federal Government has made over the past \n     fifty years in research, technology, and trade promotion and \n     trade law enforcement;\n       (2) these investments are even more important at the dawn \n     of the twenty-first century in order to insure that future \n     generations of Americans can remain at the forefront of \n     exploring the endless scientific and technological frontier \n     in the face of ever greater challenges from abroad and \n     thereby maintain and improve their health, standard of \n     living, and national security; and\n       (3) enforcement of United States trade laws and promotion \n     of United States exports, especially programs in support of \n     small and medium sized businesses, serve an invaluable \n     function in creating jobs, promoting national economic \n     growth, and allowing American workers and businesses to have \n     the resources to compete in an ever more competitive global \n     economy.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that, in the assumptions for the overall accounts, it is \n     assumed that--\n       (1) in allocating discretionary spending in fiscal years \n     1996 through 2002 within the discretionary spending limits \n     established in section 201, the Committee on Appropriations \n     will make it a high priority to maintain the overall fiscal \n     year 1995 investment [[Page S7354]] level (without adjustment \n     for inflation) in research, technology and trade promotion, \n     and trade law enforcement programs; and\n       (2) the conferees on the concurrent budget resolution will \n     not agree to any revenue reductions below current law unless \n     the discretionary spending limits established in the \n     conference report will permit the Committee on Appropriations \n     to achieve the goal established in paragraph (1).\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment expresses the sense of \nthe Senate that it should be a high priority to maintain the overall \nfiscal year 1995 investment level, without adjustment for inflation, in \nresearch, technology, trade promotion, and trade law enforcement \nprograms over the next 7 years.\n  The amendment further expresses the sense of the Senate that the \nconferees should not agree to any tax cuts below current law unless the \ndiscretionary spending limits in the conference report permit the \nachievement of the above goal.\n  The GOP budget will reduce civilian research and technology programs \nto a four decade low as a percentage of GDP and Federal spending. By \n2002, Federal civilian research will be 0.26 percent of gross domestic \nproduct. The Bingaman amendment would effectively urge that this be \nraised to 0.31 percent of GDP.\n  For comparison purposes in 1969, the last year we balanced the \nbudget, civilian research was 0.76 percent of GDP. The lowest it ever \nwas in the Reagan years was 0.38 percent of GDP in 1986. It is \ncurrently 0.46 percent of GDP. No one can claim that it is research \nthat has caused our deficit. Quite the contrary. Almost every economist \nbelieves our investments in civilian research pay for themselves many \ntimes over in economic growth and the taxes that corporations pay on \nthe fruits of our federally supported scientific enterprise.\n  The governments of other industrialized nations, such as Japan and \nGermany, invest about six-tenths of 1 percent of GDP in civilian \nresearch. We are already below them, even if you include the Pentagon's \ndual-use basic and applied research investments. And we are pointing \nunder the GOP budget to spending less than half of what our economic \nrivals spend.\n  The cuts in Federal support of civilian research will not be made up \nby the private sector. The reason: they have an ever-shorter focus and \nan ever greater unwillingness to invest in long-term research projects, \nthe benefits of which are uncertain and usually not capturable by a \nsingle firm.\n  Every other nation is following the American model of the last half \ncentury. They are seeking to invest more, not less, in civilian \nresearch.\n  Our model has succeeded. It put men on the Moon, revolutionized \nmedicine, developed computers, communications, and\n advanced materials unimagined a half century ago. Vannevar Bush, the \ngiant of the post-World War II generation, predicted just this in his \nmonograph ``Science: the Endless Frontier'' that served as the basis of \na social compact between government and the research community for the \nlast half century.\n\n  For the past half century, the Federal Government has acted on that \nvision to foster a science and technology enterprise in this country \nsecond to none. Government research funds have helped conquer diseases, \nwin the cold war, and spur incredible advances in electronics, \ncomputers, molecular biology, communications, and materials science. \nThese advances enrich our daily lives and are at the heart of our \nnation's status as an economic and military superpower.\n  It is not an accident that American industries from aerospace to \nagriculture to pharmaceuticals in which the Federal Government has made \nsubstantial research investments enjoy world leadership.\n  As we enter the 21st century, we can not afford a Luddite approach. \nThe scientific and technogical frontier is still endless. We risk \ncondemning our children and grandchildren to a less prosperous, less \nhealthy, and less secure future if we follow the course in the budget \nresolution.\n  The Bingaman amendment is intended to provoke a debate and to serve \nas a warning. It does not fix the problem. Even if its prescription is \nfollowed, we will still be spending half of what our rivals spend in \n2002. But it is a step in the right direction, a finger in a breaking \ndike.\n  If action is not taken to deal with this, we will lose a generation \nof research and a generation of young researchers who will choose other \nprofessions. We will not be able to recover for years from this damage \nonce the pendulum swings back in favor of Federal research investments \nas it will when the full damage of the GOP budget becomes clear.\n  Almost a century ago in 1899 the head of the Patent Office, Charles \nDuell, proposed to close up shop because ``everything that can be \ninvented has been invented.'' Luckily we did not follow such Know-\nNothing advice as we prepared for the 20th century. A half century \nlater Vannevar Bush laid out his vision for the Federal role in science \nand technology.\n  Now we face a choice again between these competing visions, Duell's \nand Bush's. We must reject the notion the endless frontier is over, \nthat every invention has been made, and continue to commit to a \nbrighter future for our children. We cannot afford to short-change \nresearch if the 21st century is to be an American century as the 20th \ncentury was.\n  I ask unanimous consent that several newspaper articles be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                [From the New York Times, May 22, 1995]\n\n         G.O.P. Budget Cuts Would Fall Hard on Civilian Science\n\n\n                         basic research at risk\n\n  experts foresee a crippling of science establishment and layoffs at \n                              universities\n\n                         (By William J. Broad)\n\n       The glory days of the Federal science establishment may be \n     over, science leaders fear, as cuts proposed by Republicans \n     to wipe out the budget deficit fall hard on civilian \n     research.\n       Under the cuts, annual appropriations for nonmilitary \n     research might drop to about $25 billion by 2000 from the \n     current level of $32 billion, for total reductions of $24 \n     billion or more over the period.\n       At risk is the type of Government-financed basic science \n     that has put men on the moon, explored the deep sea, unlocked \n     the atom, cured cancers, found the remains of lost \n     civilizations, tracked earthquake faults, and discovered the \n     chemistry of life, among other feats.\n       Specific casualties of the cuts might include atom \n     smashers, new weather satellites, space probes and dozens of \n     large Federal laboratories that study everything from solar \n     power to violent storms.\n       Republicans say their goal is to trim fat and corporate \n     welfare rather than cripple basic science, which economists \n     agree is a powerful engine for promoting economic growth and \n     high standards of living.\n       Representative Robert S. Walker, a Republican of \n     Pennsylvania who is chairman of the House Science Committee, \n     said this month that the proposed budget would keep ``a \n     robust science policy while providing for the fundamental \n     science base we need to move forward.''\n       But Democrats and private experts say the cuts would undo \n     the Federal science establishment, crippling parts of it \n     beyond repair.\n       To be sure, science leaders in past budget battles, clearly \n     working in their own self-interest, have been known to \n     exaggerate how painful reductions might be. And some pain \n     might be averted as Democrats and Federal agencies fight the \n     cuts, or if President Clinton successfully vetoes spending \n     bills.\n       Even so, the momentum for change is now so great that many \n     private experts, as well as Democrats, say Federal support of \n     civilian science is destined to weaken and shrink no matter \n     what, its budget declining by as much as a third if inflation \n     is taken into account. Such cuts portend wide changes in \n     American science and American life.\n       ``Any sensible person knows you have to make prudent \n     investments to get ahead,'' Representative George E. Brown, \n     Jr., a Democrat of California and former chairman of the \n     House Science Committee, said in an interview last week. \n     ``But the Government doesn't. We're dominated by fools.''\n       Agency heads, university officials and private experts say \n     the fabric of science is likely to fray widely as the \n     Republican juggernaut rolls forward\n      and as the Clinton Administration makes its own cuts in an \n     attempt to regain lost political ground.\n       ``Nationally, there's been a massive sticking of heads in \n     the sand, of not looking at the problem,'' said John Wiley, \n     provost at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, one of the \n     nation's top science schools. ``There's going to be a price \n     of pay.''\n       Experts say the repercussions could include the abandoning \n     of much long-term environmental monitoring, the virtual end \n     of applied research to aid corporations, layoffs at colleges \n     and universities, and a flight of students from scientific \n     careers.\n       ``We don't want to get so lost in the frenzy to balance the \n     budget that we throw babies [[Page S7355]] out with the bath \n     water,'' John H. Gibbons, President Clinton's science adviser \n     and director of the White House Office of Science and \n     Technology Policy, said in an interview.\n       ``What ever the reduction is--a quarter or a third--it's \n     big, and it's a reversal of historical trends,'' he added, \n     referring to how Republican cuts would end years of budget \n     growth.\n       ``There's no question that we have to be sharper with our \n     knives, to streamline the agencies,'' Dr. Gibbons said. ``But \n     if you take away a third, that's going to push us way down in \n     terms of international competition.''\n       During the last four decades, the Federal Government has \n     spent nearly $1 trillion on civilian research and \n     development, laying the basis for a powerful wave of \n     prosperity that has touched most facets of American life. In \n     pushing back the frontiers of knowledge, the Federal money \n     has supported tens of thousands of scientists at universities \n     across the country and has financed the work that led to \n     scores of Nobel Prizes.\n       Spending on nonmilitary science has grown fairly steadily \n     in the last decade. It peaked this year at $31.9 billion, \n     according to the National Science Foundation, a Federal \n     agency that finances much basic research at universities.\n       The civilian science budget of the Federal government is \n     puny compared to the $100 billion that American industry is \n     putting into reseach and Development this year. Yet its \n     importance is greater than size alone suggests, for while \n     industry typically looks years ahead, aiming to please \n     shareholders, the Government often looks decades and \n     sometimes centuries ahead, pursuing fundamental issues of \n     understanding that may ultimately lead to wide social \n     benefits.\n       Another difference is that industrial science is often \n     shrouded in secrecy. By contrast, Government-financed \n     civilian work is usually published openly so it can serve as \n     intellectual kindling for other social and commercial \n     endeavors.\n       After their sweep in the midterm elections last November, \n     the Republicans devised a balanced-budget plan that went easy \n     on military research, currently about $40 billion a year, and \n     hard on civilian science, especially on Federal programs with \n     ties to industry. An aim of the Clinton Administration has \n     been to help high-technology industries better compete with \n     foreign rivals.\n       House Republicans produced the most detailed plan for \n     science cuts, which was endorsed Thursday by the full House \n     as part of a comprehensive package to balance the budget by \n     2002. The Senate is debating a companion measure.\n       Democrats of the House Science Committee portray the House \n     plan as an extensive cracking of the foundations of Federal \n     science. By their calculation, spending under the committee's \n     jurisdiction would fall by a\n      total $24 billion from 1996 to 2000, relative to 1995 \n     levels. If 3 percent annual inflation is assumed during \n     that period, the overall drop would be 34.7 percent in \n     terms of real purchasing power.\n       The committee oversees most civilian science spending in \n     the Federal budget, with responsibility for $27.2 billion \n     this year. The exceptions are the National Institutes of \n     Health and the Agriculture and Interior Departments. The \n     latter's Geological Survey, which monitors water, hunts \n     minerals and makes maps, has been targeted for eventual \n     elimination by the Republicans. Its current budget is $571 \n     million.\n       The biggest cuts are slated for the Federal Government's \n     largest scientific agency, the National Aeronautics and Space \n     Administration. Among possible victims is tiny Pioneer 10, \n     now nearly six billion miles from Earth and still sending \n     back data more than two decades after it was launched.\n       ``A lot more than Pioneer will go,'' NASA's Administrator, \n     Daniel S. Goldin, said in an interview.\n       The Republicans would squeeze a series of planned \n     satellites for global climate monitoring, trimming the budget \n     by $2.7 billion, or about half, to the end of the decade. \n     Overall, the agency's annual budget would drop from $14.3 \n     billion to $11 billion by 2000.\n       On Friday, Mr. Goldin outlined a plan that would move \n     toward eventually turning over operation of the space \n     shuttles to private industry, something the Republicans have \n     called for. The NASA plan would also reduce the work force of \n     the agency and its contractors by about 25,000 people, \n     bringing it to 1961 levels.\n       ``We're right at the edge,'' he said. ``The Republican cuts \n     would roughly double that, pushing about 20,000 people out \n     the door.''\n       A similar tale comes from the National Oceanic and \n     Atmospheric Administration, whose parent, the Commerce \n     Department, has been targeted for elimination by the \n     Republicans. Among other things, NOAA runs weather \n     satellites, makes forecasts, tracks hurricanes and tornadoes, \n     probes the deep ocean and monitors fisheries.\n       James D. Baker, NOAA's Administrator, said in an interview \n     that the agency was already losing 2,300 employees and that \n     the proposed Republican cuts would trim another 1,000 in 1996 \n     alone. Its budget for that year would fall to $1.7 billion \n     from a current $2 billion, with deeper cuts in following \n     years.\n       ``What we see coming is a real tragedy,'' he said. ``We'll \n     have to cut services and stop future investments on all kinds \n     of things.''\n       NOAA runs 11 environmental research labs around the country \n     to study things like air quality, climate changes and severe \n     storms. Some labs would have to be cut back or closed down. \n     And proposed Republican cuts for 1996 would force the agency \n     to abandon plans for a new weather satellite.\n       Ultimately, NOAA officials say, lives will be at risk if \n     weather forecasts decline in quality.\n       ``We're a service agency,'' said Douglas K. Hall, NOAA's \n     Deputy Administrator. ``We have people on duty 24 hours a day \n     at the union's airports. They're critical to the safety of \n     millions of Americans.''\n       More esoteric is the work of the Energy Department, which \n     studies new kinds of solar and geothermal energy production, \n     struggles to harness the nearly limitless power of nuclear \n     fusion, and probes the atom with big particle accelerators. \n     It also is conducting a costly cleanup of sites contaminated \n     by decades of nuclear weapons production.\n       Its current budget is $17.5 billion. The Republicans would \n     cut that by a total of $7 billion over five years.\n       The department says the cuts would trim 2,000 university \n     science jobs and 3,500 jobs from its sprawling system of \n     laboratories, would end the large fusion experiment at \n     Princeton University and would force the cancellation of one \n     of its atom-smasher projects. In addition, hundreds of \n     companies, universities and Federal laboratories that are \n     trying to improve energy efficiency would lose funds.\n       One bright spot in the Republican proposal is the National \n     Science Foundation, whose current budget is $3.3 billion. The \n     Republicans would slightly boost basic research to\n      match expected inflation but would squeeze the social \n     sciences, which include economics, anthropology, \n     psychology, sociology, geography and archeology.\n       The National Institutes of Health, the nation's biomedical \n     research giant and a main patron of university research, \n     would also get some preferential treatment. Its $11.3 billion \n     budget would drop slightly in 1996 and then freeze. Even \n     without severe reductions, however, N.I.H. officials say \n     their programs would be devastated by inflation.\n       For the nation's system of big research universities, said \n     Dr. Wiley of the University of Wisconsin, ``there's likely to \n     be a shakeout'' as the cuts hit home and universities shut \n     down programs.\n       ``We'll probably emerge from the next 15 or 20 years with \n     far fewer universities that try to be comprehensive,'' he \n     said.\n       Robert L. Park, a physicist at the University of Maryland \n     and a spokesman for the American Physical Society, the \n     nation's leading group of physicists, said the race between \n     Republicans and Democrats to make science cuts boded ill for \n     the future.\n       ``Enormous promises have been made and it's hard to see how \n     they can back away from those,'' he said, referring to the \n     Republican promise to balance the budget.\n       ``Social Security and most of Medicare is off the table,'' \n     he added. ``There's not much left in the discretionary \n     budget, except for science.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, May 23, 1995]\n\n                       Crippling American Science\n\n       The budget plan passed by the House mounts an assault on \n     scientific research, science training and American research \n     universities that are the envy of the world. Blinded by \n     ideological fury at government, House Republicans seek to \n     abandon a crucial function of government, the provision of \n     public goods like research that are undersupplied by private \n     markets. Private companies will invest in research that is \n     likely to raise their profit, but they are unwilling to \n     invest in research whose benefits leak out to competitors. By \n     abandoning government's irreplaceable role, the House budget \n     would undermine America's technological base.\n       The magnitude of the House-passed cuts is shocking. \n     Civilian research would fall over five years from about $32 \n     billion to $25 billion, a 35 percent cut after accounting for \n     inflation. Medical research, other than for AIDS, would fall \n     by more than 25 percent. Robert Walker, chairman of the House \n     Science Committee, says the plan would protect basic science. \n     He dissembles. His budget would increase spending on research \n     by the National Science Foundation. But the small increases \n     would not keep pace with inflation, so the number of \n     university-based scholars, graduate students and research \n     projects that the N.S.F. supports would steadily fall. Indeed \n     the plan envisions wiping out support for social science \n     research.\n       The House budget would continue to support the space \n     shuttle and space station, two costly hardware projects with \n     constituencies in key electoral states, but it would provide \n     little money for other aeronautical and space research. It \n     would cut several energy research programs by between 35 and \n     80 percent--eliminating thousands of university jobs--and \n     reduce research on high-speed rail and other transportation \n     projects. Republicans say their cuts eliminate only applied \n     research that business can undertake for itself, but they \n     propose slashing nearly every program in sight.\n       Not all the research that Washington pays for makes sense. \n     Some university-based research can sound ridiculously \n     abstruse. But there is danger in indiscriminately chopping \n     research and undermining a system that has for decades \n     produced the best scientists and graduate programs in the \n     world. The sectors in which America has led the world--from \n     computers and software to agriculture and \n     [[Page S7356]] aircraft manufacturing--can trace their \n     success to heavy Federal support.\n       Mr. Walker could have performed a valuable service by \n     carefully sifting through Federal programs to weed out those \n     that needlessly subsidize corporations for research and \n     development projects that they would undertake for \n     themselves. But massive cutting just to reach a balanced \n     budget quickly risks damaging important economic assets.\n       The party that preaches cost-benefit analysis for Federal \n     agencies ought to practice what it preaches. Cutting the \n     science budget will save a few billion dollars a year in a $6 \n     trillion economy. Knocking out innovative research can lead \n     to stagnant productivity and growth. By that calculation, the \n     House plan is an irresponsible gamble.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 19, 1995]\n\n   The GOP Needs a Bit More R On Its Science and Technology Policy\n\n                          (By Michael Schrage)\n\n       Charred, smoldering and in ruins: The budget bills pending \n     in Congress leave the Clinton administration's ambitious \n     science and technology agenda looking as if it were zapped by \n     one of those space-based X-ray lasers from the Strategic \n     Defense Initiative that never quite got built. The \n     destruction is near-total. Never have a sitting president's \n     programs promising new public-private partnerships for \n     innovation been so thoroughly extirpated so soon after \n     launch. The Commerce Department's Advanced Technology \n     Program--a $430 million-plus effort to turn the National \n     Institutes of Standards and Technology into a high-tech \n     venture capitalist--is toast. The Technology Reinvestment \n     Program, designed to encourage commercial participation in \n     defense technology development, is targeted for extinction.\n       Even a $500 million ``national security'' initiative to \n     build flat-panel displays for the Pentagon now shrivels into \n     silicon scraps. Techno-``welfare'' for rich corporations with \n     billion-dollar research and development budgets of their own \n     is being slashed as rigorously and assiduously as welfare for \n     the poor.\n       Of course, in the context of the biggest proposed budget \n     cuts in U.S. history, there's nothing special about the \n     dismantling of the Clinton science and technology apparat. \n     And why should there be? Everything else is getting cut.\n       What's disturbingly different, however, is that while the \n     Republican majority cheerfully fuses ideas and ideology when \n     it takes on the nation's health care and welfare budgets, its \n     take on federal science and technology budgets seems oddly \n     disjointed. It looks decoupled not only from the marketplace, \n     but from the marketplace of ideas. The same politicians \n     championing the virtues of America's ``Third Wave'' future \n     prescribe federal science and technology policies that would \n     have been deemed simplistic during the country's agrarian \n     heyday.\n       The reflexive anti-Washington, pro-market, neo-federalist \n     sentiment that so energizes the right obscures the essential \n     issues that need to be openly debated: What role should the \n     federal government play in supporting non-defense-related \n     research in science and technology? Further, how far should \n     the federal government go in defining regulations and \n     standards that promote innovation in the marketplace? The \n     Republicans insist that market forces are always the best \n     arbiter--but that obviously is not true.\n       Let's make these conceptually flavored questions more \n     specific and provocative: Would an Internet--with its unique, \n     nonproprietary, flexible, expandable, multimedia \n     architecture--have been an inevitable byproduct of market \n     forces alone? Or did the federal government's active \n     participation play a valuable role in shaping a new kind of \n     medium?\n       Did federal safety and fuel efficiency standards foisted on \n     the automobile and aerospace industries over the past 25 \n     years promote technical innovation and customer satisfaction? \n     Or did the costs of consumers and the manufacturers clearly \n     outweigh the benefits?\n       Was the agricultural extension service, created to\n        promote the decentralized diffusion of agricultural \n     innovation among farmers and researchers, an appropriate \n     medium for a central government to support? What about the \n     Morrill Act, which funded the rise of land-grant colleges \n     and universities?\n       Does a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to \n     monitor the emergence of potentially dangerous viruses and \n     microorganisms make more sense as a federal or state \n     institution?\n       The answer to any one of these questions speaks volumes \n     about why the proffered policy choice between ``centralized \n     government'' and ``market forces'' is a false one. In a \n     democracy, of course, the government is the marketplace and \n     vice versa.\n       Instead of having the courage to deal with these kinds of \n     issues honestly and directly, we have legislators who prefer \n     to cast them into anachronistic vocabularies where it's okay \n     for government to fund ``basic'' and ``pure'' science but \n     ever so bad for taxpayers to sponsor anything that might be \n     ``commercial'' research and development.\n       But traditional definitions of science and technology have \n     become dangerously obsolete. In key research fields, from \n     computer software to new materials to molecular biology, the \n     distinction between basic science and applied technology has \n     blurred into meaninglessness. The applied technology drives \n     the basic science every bit as much as the basic science \n     drives the applied technology.\n       For example, finding the umpteenth gene marker in the human \n     genome is ``basic science.'' But building a machine that lets \n     biologists find gene markers 10 times faster is called \n     ``technology.'' Guess which gets funded? Is a data-\n     compression algorithm that squeezes five video streams onto a \n     single copper wire by using a novel topological equation an \n     example of pure science or commercial technology? What if the \n     student who discovered that algorithm is doing his thesis \n     funded by the National Science Foundation but while working \n     at a Japanese electronics company?\n       Just as it would be crazy to write banking legislation for \n     tomorrow that focused on passbook savings accounts, \n     legislators are kidding themselves if they believe they are \n     doing taxpayers a service by pretending that federally funded \n     science in the 1990s can be managed with the same vocabulary \n     it was in 1975. It can't.\n       One of the biggest lies inside the Beltway is that ``you \n     can't beat something with nothing.'' Of course you can, as \n     long as you're writing the checks. Say this for the \n     Clintonistas: At least this administration presented a model \n     of how the federal government should ally and align itself \n     with industry to facilitate innovation in science and \n     technology.\n       The new Republican majority has yet to present a coherent \n     proposal that explains what kinds of investments and returns \n     taxpayers have a right to expect from their federal R \n     dollars.

The benefits to \n     society could be tremendous,'' Mr. Lucky says. But AT \n     scrapped the research because it had no bearing on its main \n     business. Mr. Lucky, a 31-year veteran of Bell Labs, is now \n     at Bellcore.\n       Chasing far-out notions has long been a hallmark of \n     industrial research in America. But some of the biggest U.S. \n     corporations have cut back sharply on research into ``basic \n     science''--the exploration of how nature works at a \n     fundamental level--to pursue short-term goals and to \n     commercialize products more quickly. Corporate labs, home to \n     75% of the nation's scientists and researchers, are replacing \n     a cherished culture of independence with a results-oriented \n     approach.\n       In past decades, the devotion to basic research without \n     regard to boosting the bottom line spawned a steady stream of \n     breakthroughs, including the transistor, the solar cell and \n     the forerunner to today's laser--all at Bell Labs. Now, in \n     the 1990s, the cutbacks are taking a toll. Some disillusioned \n     scientists have fled to academia. Already, U.S. companies are \n     falling behind in advanced data-storage devices and \n     technology for oil exploration.\n       Some experts worry the shift in an even greater threat to \n     the future. ``It's a short-term response aimed at keeping \n     stockholders happy. Without question this will hurt American \n     competitiveness,'' warns Albert Link, an economics professor \n     at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.\n       Companies counter that as competition intensifies and \n     technology accelerates,\n      they must push harder to get more direct value out of their \n     research. ``We need to focus on customers' needs,'' says \n     Daniel Stanzione, who has hammered at that doctrine since \n     becoming president of Bell Labs in March. A former \n     president of AT's $6 billion public network equipment \n     division, he is the first hard-core business manager to \n     run the famed research arm.\n       The National Science Foundation calculates that U.S. \n     companies' spending on basic research declined slightly to \n     $9.7 billion in 1993 and didn't rise last year. In a survey \n     by R magazine, half of all companies with ``research and \n     development'' budgets of $50 million or more plan to cut \n     spending this year, for a 3.5% decline overall (About 10% of \n     the R budget is typically devoted to basic research.)\n       Those figures mask far more significant cuts in some areas. \n     Among U.S. makers of communications gear and electronics, \n     spending on basic research dropped 64% between 1988 and 1992 \n     to $350 million. Even government-funded basic research at \n     universities and colleges, which has risen in the last five \n     years, is expected to fall slightly in 1995, according to the \n     National Science Foundation.\n       International Business Machines Corp. has chopped $1.7 \n     billion from its annual R budget since 1992, a 33% \n     reduction to $3.38 billion by last year. In the science-\n     oriented research division, annual spending has fallen to \n     $450 million from $625 million in 1990. The staff of \n     scientists has been cut nearly 20% to 2,600; the number \n     pursuing basic research is down by half to \n     200. [[Page S7357]] \n       In the 1980s, IBM labs explored the subatomic mysteries of \n     neutrino particles. In the 1990s, an IBM lab perfected the \n     collapsible ``butterfly'' keyboard in just a year; it might \n     have taken seven years in the old days. Impressive, but \n     keyboards are hardly the stuff of high science.\n       Bernard Meyerson, an IBM fellow and senior manager at the \n     IBM lab in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., says that despite the \n     reductions, ``core research was preserved.'' But he concedes \n     that cutting back is ``a dicey process'' because ``you won't \n     see the impact of funding cuts until it's too late.''\n       Elsewhere the changes have been subtle but no less \n     significant. Xerox Corp.'s PARC lab, which invented laser \n     printing and on-screen icons, now gets detailed ``contracts'' \n     from the company's product divisions directing its research. \n     At General Electric Co., the portion of R spending devoted \n     to long-term projects is down to 15% from 30% in the 1980s.\n       Such changes are sweeping Bell Labs, perhaps the most \n     famous lab in the world. AT still devotes 10% of its annual \n     $3 billion R budget to basic research, but ever bigger \n     chunks will be shifted away\n      from physical science--the lab's traditional strength--to \n     information science, which is closely tied to AT's core \n     business. Bell Labs managers used to be promoted solely on \n     the basis of technical achievement. Now they must also \n     display business acumen.\n       ``That wonderful culture at Bell Labs'' is disappearing, \n     laments Phillip Griffiths, director of the Institute for \n     Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., one of the last \n     strongholds of purely theoretical research in the U.S.\n       It is difficult to quantify what may be lost because of \n     such shifts. Fiber optics, for one, might have been delayed \n     for decades if not for fundamental discoveries made at Bell \n     Labs, GE and IBM. In the early 1960s, scientists stumbled on \n     a curious find: Gallium arsenide was a natural laser. When \n     they zapped an electrical current through it, it emitted an \n     intense beam of light, thus making practical the laser that \n     was first demonstrated by Hughes Aircraft in 1960. Scientists \n     realized this ``semiconductor injection laser'' could be \n     manipulated to transmit vast amounts of data at nearly the \n     speed of light.\n       As many big U.S. companies are backing away, some foreign \n     concerns are pushing on. Major high-tech companies overseas \n     increased R spending 23% from 1988 to 1993, says Schonfeld \n     & Associates of Lincolnshire, Ill.\n       At NEC Corp.'s Research Institute in Princeton, N.J., about \n     30 miles from Bell Labs' campus, scientists delve into \n     condensed matter physics, quantum mechanics and biology. \n     Joseph Giordmaine, a physicist, put in 28 years at Bell Labs \n     but bolted for Japan's NEC in 1988.\n       Now, as a senior vice president, he presides over some \n     truly far-out projects. In one, a fly, its limbs affixed in \n     wax, is set before a TV screen flashing a series of images. A \n     delicate probe connects a single neuron in the fly's brain to \n     an instrument that measures how fast it registers the TV \n     images.\n       The research may one day yield insights into how to design \n     a super-fast computer. ``Basic research means you have to be \n     able to take risks and accept failure,'' says Mr. Giordmaine.\n       Greg Blonder, who invented the wristphone at Bell Labs, has \n     spent most of his career studying physical sciences and their \n     role in future technologies. In January, he switched to \n     ``human-centered engineering'' aimed at making AT products \n     more ``customer friendly.''\n       He admits to nostalgia for bygone days. ``There's no thrill \n     equivalent to the feeling when you discover something late at \n     night, and you know that no one else in the universe knows \n     it,'' he says. ``I miss that.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 22, 1995]\n\n            Baby Bells Find It Hard to Put Price on Bellcore\n\n                           (By Leslie Cauley)\n\n       How do you value a company that has never turned a profit, \n     is prohibited from designing real products and has no \n     experience competing for customers?\n       That question faces Bell Communications Research Co., the \n     jointly owned research arm of the seven regional Bell \n     telephone companies. The Bells have announced plans to sell \n     or spin off Bellcore by next year.\n       The shedding of the company, familiarly called Bellcore, \n     comes at a time when even the most respected technology \n     giants are cutting corporate-research budgets. For the Baby \n     Bells' lab, that raises the question: Who would want it? ``I \n     have no idea,'' answers one Wall Street analyst. ``It isn't \n     commercially oriented, and it's been operated as a nonprofit \n     [entity] that hasn't been accountable to anyone in \n     particular. It's a seven-headed monster right now.''\n       Bellcore came into being 11 years ago when the old AT \n     empire was dismantled, and the seven Baby Bells were spun \n     off. AT Corp. held on to the famed Bell Labs, inventor of \n     cellular technology, the transistor and the satellite. The \n     Bells got newly formed Bellcore.\n       Despite its formal name, only about 10% of Bellcore's work \n     is devoted to outright research. And unlike Bell Labs, \n     Bellcore doesn't engage at all in the blue-sky realm of \n     ``pure,'' or basic, research.\n       The bulk of Bellcore's work is in software programming and \n     consulting. Bellcore experts often are among the first in an \n     emergency, as in the terrorist bombing in Oklahoma City last \n     month. Bellcore software helps the Bells keep track of which \n     phone wires go where, no small feat considering the more than \n     150 million telephone lines in the U.S. It also handles such \n     tasks as assigning area codes and designing a phone system \n     aimed at surviving a nuclear attack.\n       Some of the top engineers and network designers in the \n     world work at Bellcore. They have racked up more than 600 \n     patents. For all the technical muscle, however, the lab has \n     never produced a single commercial product. It can't. \n     Bellcore is shackled by the terms of the AT breakup that \n     bar the Baby Bells from making equipment or offering long-\n     distance service. It also can't design production-ready \n     prototypes or steer customers to particular brands of gear.\n       Once freed from its seven owners, Bellcore would escape \n     these restraints. ``It's about time we were able to start \n     cashing in on what we know and what we have,'' says Alexander \n     Gelman, a Bellcore engineer who experiments with advances in \n     video conferencing.\n       That's why the future is filled with exhilarating \n     possibilities--but also fraught with fear--for the 6,000 \n     people who work at the lab's five sites in New Jersey. Some \n     senior Bell executives say Bellcore may have to get rid of \n     2,000 workers and install\n      a new top tier of outsiders to gird for competition.\n       Technical ability alone won't carry Bellcore in a \n     competitive environment, says Bud Wonsiewiez, vice president \n     of advanced technologies at U S West Inc., the Denver-based \n     Bell. ``Their challenge is to move from a monopoly culture to \n     a competitive culture, which is exactly the same challenge \n     the seven owners face,'' he says.\n       Many Bellcore insiders acknowledge the risk and even seem \n     energized by it. ``If you're up the challenge it can be quite \n     exhilarating,'' says Rob Zieglar, a Bellcore wireless \n     specialist. ``If not, if can be paralyzing.'' (Some \n     colleagues, he says, are thinking of leaving,) He adds: \n     ``Given the chance, ideas are going to jump here. We're going \n     to be a player.''\n       From all indications, they have the potential: Following a \n     major fire in a central switching site a few years ago, \n     Bellcore technicians came up with a fire sensor that could \n     detect a problem long before conventional sensors. Then they \n     had to load it up with clunky circuits to make sure it wasn't \n     manufacturable and didn't violate the ban on designing a \n     production-ready device.\n       ``It's not that our people didn't know how'' to make a \n     commercial product, says George Heilmeier. Bellcore's \n     president and chief executive officer. ``They had to do it \n     that way.'' A manufacturer later refined Bellcore's prototype \n     to build a commercial sensor, Mr. Heilmeier says, leaving \n     Bellcore with some royalties, but little glory.\n       ``We know our concepts are doable--we just have to wait for \n     the right time,'' adds Vincent Vecchio, a Bellcore network \n     specialist. Eric Addeo, a research manager, says operating \n     under the restrictions of the AT breakup pact ``was like \n     being in a dark room with the door cracked. Now the door is \n     opening.''\n       But cutting loose from the Bells also means eventually \n     losing guaranteed financial support. The regional phone \n     companies supply more than 80% of Bellcore's $1 billion in \n     annual funding. Bellcore generated the other $200 million or \n     so from non-Bell clients last year, but that isn't nearly \n     enough to support its operations.\n       The Bells are drafting multiyear contracts with Bellcore to \n     help attract outside investors, but most probably won't \n     commit to more than five years. ``The world is too \n     unpredictable to write contracts that go beyond'' that time \n     frame, says one senior Bell executive.\n       Its technical expertise might make\n        Bellcore an attractive acquisition for a maker of \n     telecommunications gear or perhaps a large ``systems \n     integrator'' that lashes together a client's computers and \n     phone systems. But the Baby Bells say they won't sell to a \n     direct competitor such as, say, AT they want Bellcore's \n     technology to remain within easy reach.\n       That point is one of the few on which the Baby Bells have \n     been able to reach easy agreement these days. Bellcore's \n     mission has grown muddled as its owners have begun pursuing \n     divergent and sometimes colliding strategies.\n       U S West last year acquired two cable systems in Atlanta, \n     home base of BellSouth Corp., with an eye toward offering \n     competitive local phone service. ``That had a sobering \n     influence'' on Bellcore's board, says U S West's Mr. \n     Wonsiewicz, who sits on the Bellcore board. He found himself \n     ``sitting around the table with BellSouth and others [who \n     were] asking, `When are you going to start offering telephone \n     service against us, Bud?' ''\n       Yet to pursue even routine matters, Bellcore has been \n     required to win the unanimous approval of all seven Bells. \n     Asked if he'll miss anything once Bellcore is turned loose, \n     Mr. Heilmeier, the lab's CEO, doesn't miss a beat. ``Oh yes, \n     I'll miss those board meetings where we had to have a 7-0 \n     vote on everything,'' he replies sarcastically. ``The tears \n     are welling up in my eyes now.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                 [From the New York Time, May 22, 1995]\n\n               Clinton's Aid To Industry Is G.O.P. Target\n\n\n                Technology and Trade Programs Would End\n\n                          (By David E. Sanger)\n\n       Washington, May 22.--Buried among the Republicans' sharp \n     cost-cutting proposals to [[Page S7358]] balance the Federal \n     budget is the swift dismantling of two of the Clinton \n     Administration's most prominent economic innovations: the Use \n     of the Government to promote exports and the underwriting of \n     new technologies that corporate America considers too risky.\n       During his Presidential campaign, Mr. Clinton briefly \n     called those strategies ``industrial policy,'' until \n     Republicans seized on the phrase as proof that Mr. Clinton \n     wanted the Government to meddle in the workings of the \n     market. Once in office, the White House dropped the \n     terminology but went ahead anyway with an aggressive program, \n     declaring that the United States needed to develop \n     partnerships with industry and use Government pressure to \n     promote exports, two skills that Japan and Germany turned in \n     to an art after World War II.\n       The Republican budget proposals would bring many of those \n     efforts to a halt and drastically shrink others, from the \n     Energy Department to the Pentagon. The most sweeping cutback \n     proposal, the ``The Department of Commerce Dismantling Act,'' \n     is scheduled to be introduced on Tuesday by House \n     Republicans. The act would immediately terminate six of the \n     Cabinet department's offices and slice up the organization \n     that provides the skills for trade negotiations with Japan, \n     China and several other nations.\n       Many of the functions of the Commerce Department's highest-\n     profile organization, the International Trade Administration, \n     would be carved up or eliminated. It is unclear what would \n     happen to the economic ``war room'' that calls in \n     ambassadors, Cabinet secretaries and sometimes the President \n     to put pressure on foreign governments to buy American goods.\n       Curiously, the White House has said almost nothing in \n     public about the attack on the core of its economic strategy, \n     partly for fear that it would detract from its warnings about \n     proposed cuts to Medicare and other popular social programs.\n       ``Our global competitors are laughing at us,'' Secretary of \n     Commerce Ronald H. Brown said today in a telephone \n     conversation from Paris, where he is attending a meeting of \n     the organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. \n     ``Just at the moment when we've finally learned that there is \n     no way to win without a public-private partnership, without \n     getting the Government involved in promoting a nation's \n     exports, people are incredulous that Congress would be doing \n     this.\n       ``The French are apoplectic that we have been so pro-active \n     and successful,'' Mr. Brown said, a reference to Washington's \n     role in winning a huge contract in Brazil last year over \n     French competition. ``And now they are delighted that we are \n     thinking about not doing it anymore.''\n       The Republican theory is that the Commerce Department has \n     become a brazen example of ``corporate welfare,'' a term \n     coined by one of Mr. Clinton's Cabinet members and close \n     friends, Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich. To the White \n     House's horror, the phrase--which Mr. Reich has not repeated \n     since--has become a rallying call for the freshman class of \n     Republicans, who do not share their party's traditional \n     closeness or dependence on big business.\n       ``There are 19 different departments in the Government that \n     deal with trade,'' said Representative Dick Chrysler, the \n     Michigan Republican who drafted the legislation to dismantle \n     the Commerce Department 92 years after its creation. ``They \n     could all be reduced to a single Department of Trade.''\n       Another target of Mr. Chrysler's is the department's \n     Advanced Technology\n      focused on the programs that most people understand,'' said \n     Hazel R. O'Leary, the Secretary of Energy, whose \n     department's budget would shrink by roughly $7 billion \n     over the next five years.\n       ``It's a little early,'' said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the \n     head of the National Economic Council, an office that was \n     created at the start of the Administration to give economics \n     equal weight with issues of national security. ``There should \n     be a good debate about the wisdom of this, but it is still \n     early in the budget process.''\n       It may be early, but it seems clear that most of the trade \n     and technology promotion programs will be sharply reduced, if \n     they survive at all.\n       As a result, the White House's reticence has not kept the \n     departments themselves from starting allout survival \n     campaigns. Capitol Hill these days is flooded with under \n     secretaries and assistant secretaries explaining and \n     justifying programs that have never before come under intense \n     scrutiny.\n       Many of those programs were started under Republican \n     administrations. The theme of the presentations often boil \n     down to one argument: In an age of economic conflict, cutting \n     out political and economic support for industry is the \n     equivalent of unilateral disarmament.\n      Program, which provides backing for technologies that small \n     companies--and some large ones--consider promising but too \n     risky to attempt. ``This has grown from $10 million in \n     1990 to $250 million in 1993, and now they want $750 \n     million,'' Mr. Chrysler said. ``This is nothing other than \n     picking winners and losers.''\n       Such arguments underscore the sharp difference in the way \n     technology and trade policy is dealt with in Washington and \n     in the capitals of its major economic competitors, where \n     trade is considered national security and ``picking winners \n     and losers'' is a phrase with no political resonance.\n       In Japan and Germany, there is virtually no debate over \n     government programs to provide seed money for risky \n     technologies or to use the influence of top officials to win \n     contracts. It is taken as a given that such roles fall to the \n     central government, along with defending the nation's \n     territory and making foreign policy.\n       In Japan, for example, officials will freely acknowledge \n     that more than 50 percent of the money committed to new \n     technologies will result in utter failure. But even a 20 \n     percent success rate, they argue, should be considered a \n     success. No one would even attempt such an argument in \n     Washington.\n       ``You can't go up on the Hill and talk about a 40 percent \n     success rate, even if that is a brilliant performance,'' Ms. \n     O'Leary said last week. ``People will say: `What? We are \n     throwing away 60 percent?'''\n       Instead, Ms. O'Leary's department has been churning out \n     news releases about its industrial breakthroughs in energy \n     conservation. A giant sulfur lamp now hangs over the Energy \n     Department's entrance on Constitution Avenue, a single light \n     that replaces 250 bulbs. ``It was developed with $1 million \n     in Government money and much more in private funds,'' she \n     said. ``That is hardly a waste.''\n       On the Hill, though, no one wants to talk about sulfur \n     lamps, unless they are designed to illuminate a balanced \n     budget. ``This is the tail-wagging-the-dog syndrome,'' Mr. \n     Chrysler said. ``If it is a good invention, let the private \n     sector invent it.''\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President; I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the amendment of my friend from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman, which \nurges continued funding for Federal investments in research, \ntechnology, export promotion and trade law enforcement. I take strong \nexception to the position espoused by the Republican budget \nresolution--that technology research and trade promotion are not proper \nand appropriate functions of the Federal Government. They are, in fact, \nnot only appropriate but vital to continued U.S. economic growth and \ncompetitiveness in today's global economy.\n  I have long maintained that our Nation needs to be more, not less, \ncognizant of the crucial role technology plays in affecting our \nposition in the world economy. Without it we would not enjoy the \nindustrial and military strength we have today. Our Government has \ntraditionally played a critical role in this area and I am convinced we \nmust continue to invest prudently in research and technology \ndevelopment if we are to maintain our position in an increasingly \ncompetitive global economy. And with all due respect to my Republican \nfriends, the private sector cannot and will not commit sufficient \nresources to make up for the cuts proposed by the Republican budget.\n  Eroding and/or eliminating the Federal Government's role in \nscientific research and technology development is like eating our seed \ncorn, short sighted and ill advised in the extreme.\n  I would assign the same labels--short-sighted and wrong-headed--to \nthe proposed elimination of Federal programs which promote U.S exports. \nUndeniably trade has become a major factor in the U.S. economy. \nAccording to the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee, ``long-term \nforecasts of the U.S. economy put exports as the fastest growing \ncomponent of GDP--increasing perhaps two and a half times faster than \nthe overall economy.''\n  As the 3rd largest exporter of manufactured goods among the 50 \nStates, Ohio has benefited greatly from, and has a vital economic stake \nin, robust international trade. We cannot turn a blind eye to the fact \nthat all our major trade competitors spend considerably more than we do \nto push their products in overseas markets. Nevertheless, our \nrelatively modest investments at the Federal level, prudently targeted \nand efficiently managed, effectively complement private sector \nmarketing efforts and maintain our position is an increasingly \ncompetitive international economic environment. Because governments are \nmajor purchasers in most of the primary categories of U.S. exports, for \nexample aerospace, power generation, transportation, and \ntelecommunications, the government-to-government contacts are \nparticularly useful and appropriate.\n  The least we can and should do in the interest of future economic \ngrowth, jobs and prosperity is to maintain the current modest level of \nFederal investment in research, technology and trade promotion.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of Senator \nBingaman's amendment to protect funding for the important investments \n[[Page S7359]] that our Nation currently makes to help our businesses \ncompete in the evolving global economy.\n  Mr. President, as the cold war passes into our memories, a new type \nof global challenge to the health and welfare of America has emerged. \nIt is an economic war that American businessmen and women are fighting \nin the US marketplace and in global markets against foreign competitors \nsupport and encouraged by their governments.\n  As Commerce Secretary Ron Brown recently said, the budget before us \ntoday is tantamount to unilateral disarmament of the United States. It \nis the business equivalent of shutting down the Pentagon to save money \nin the middle of a world war.\n  Mr. President, don't believe me or Secretary Brown. Believe the words \nof the customers, the American businesses on the front line of global \ncompetition.\n  This morning's Arkansas Democrat-Gazette had a strong story in which \nbusinessmen were asked what they thought about the idea of eliminating \ntrade and technology efforts at the Commerce Department. I ask that \n``Cutting out Commerce Finds Few Fans in Trade'' be placed in the \nRecord following my statement and urge my colleagues to read it.\n  The Vice Chairman of the Arkansas District Export Council, Dave \nEldridge, said ``For a person who has been an international businessman \nfor 30 years, I can tell you that (closing the Commerce Department) \nwould be a serious mistake.''\n  As businesspeople in Arkansas point out, at stake is no less than the \nfuture economic health of our Nation and our standing and power in the \ninternational community.\n  At stake are American jobs threatened by tariffs or other \nrestrictions on US products in foreign markets. At stake are American \nbusinesses, large and small, that must beat foreign competitors to the \nmarket with new and better products, cut costs and improve quality \nthrough better manufacturing technologies, and position themselves in \nthe emerging overseas that will generate huge new consuming publics in \nthe future.\n  To help American businesses compete, the US Government has made \nmodest but effective investments in export promotion, trade law \nenforcement, technology and research. All of these investments are \nunder attack in this budget.\n\n\n                                 trade\n  Mr. President, one of the great success stories in our work to \nsupport US businesses overseas is the International Trade \nAdministration (ITA) at the Commerce Department. During the first 2 \nyears of the Clinton administration, ITA advocacy of US business has \nboosted US exports by $23.6 billion, thereby creating over 300,000 \nAmerican jobs.\n  Taxpayers invested roughly $500 million in the ITA and received a \nreturn of $23 billion in exports. That would pass anyone's cost-benefit \ntest.\n  ITA has helped to open foreign markets for American business and to \nenforce US trade laws that protect us against unfair competition.\n  This budget resolution apparently would dissolve the ITA. Again, Mr. \nPresident, that is unilateral disarmament.\n\n\n                               technology\n\n  Helping American businesses stay at the cutting edge of new \ntechnologies is vital to long term competitiveness and that is exactly \nwhat the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, is in \nthe business of doing. According to studies, 25 percent of America's \neconomic growth since the end of World War II can be attributed to \ntechnology advances. NIST's primary mission is to bolster US \ncompetitiveness by advancing civilian technology by investing in long \nterm, high-risk research and development.\n  This formula for technology advancement is working. NIST leverages \nscarce resources, cost sharing, and risk sharing with industry and \nother government entities. It is maximizing returns to American \nbusinesses and minimizing costs to taxpayers.\n  Another technology program that has proven itself is the Technology \nReinvestment Project (TRP). TRP has worked to integrate our military \nand civilian technology sectors in a way that will strengthen our \neconomy and military. TRP is another useful example of how partnerships \nbetween government and industry are useful in pooling Federal and non-\nFederal resources toward a common goal.\n  Mr. President, quite simply, we can not afford to cut TRP. For years \nthe US military relied on its own separate technology sector and the \nAmerican taxpayers were forced to pay the huge bills. If we want our \nmilitary to deploy the most technologically advanced equipment at the \nlowest cost possible, we must tap into civilian markets more often. By \ndoing so, everyone wins--the US military, the American taxpayer, \nbusinesses and our economy.\n  These technology advancement efforts are under attack in this budget. \nTheir demise would effectively mortgage our future competitiveness and \neconomic health to buy short term budget savings.\n\n\n                             manufacturing\n\n  To help small and medium sized manufacturers put new technologies to \nwork in global competition, this administration has opened 25 new \nmanufacturing centers. These centers bring proven technology to our \nnation's 370,000 small and medium-sized manufacturers. The Centers have \nreceived rave reviews from their customers.\n  Again, this successful investment in future jobs and economic growth \nis also under attack in this budget.\n  In nations around the world, investments in technology and trade \ndevelopment are top budget priorities. Japan, Germany and others will \nbe glad to hear that this budget resolution strips the United States of \nits most effective weapons for global economic competition.\n  Mr. President, it is vitally important that we maintain funding for \nour investments in research, technology, and export promotion. The U.S. \nshould be investing more in making our workers and our firms more \ncompetitive around the globe so that we can win the battle for markets \nand profits, as well as higher wages for our workers.\n  The U.S. can no longer prevail in international economic competition \nbased solely on its vast supply of capital and natural resources, or \nits large educated work force. The economic battles of today and \ntomorrow will be won by the firms that can employ the latest technology \nand the latest information to be the first to market, the highest \nquality competitor, and the most competitive in pricing. These battles \nwill be won by firms that work in concert with their government to \nbreak down foreign trade barriers and open new channels into the mature \nand the emerging markets of the world.\n  This amendment preserves the essential functions of trade promotion, \ntechnology, and research activities. This funding is critical to our \nnation's competitiveness. It is critical to the creation of quality \njobs in the future. And it is critical to the survival of many American \nbusinesses and industries. I urge its adoption.\n  The article referred to follows:\n              Cutting Out Commerce Finds Few Fans In Trade\n\n                            (By Randy Tardy)\n\n       Arkansas international trade officials reacted strongly to \n     a Republican budget-cutting move Tuesday to abolish the U.S. \n     Department of Commerce and transfer its functions to other \n     agencies of government.\n       A bill introduced in the House would terminate six Commerce \n     Department programs, including the Economic Development \n     Administration, the Minority Business Development Agency and \n     the Technology Administration, which promotes public-private \n     cooperation in new technology.\n       The department's export-promoting International Trade \n     Administration would have its functions moved to other \n     agencies, including the State Department, which handled \n     export trade policies until 1980.\n       ``For a person who has been an international businessman \n     for 30 years, I can tell you that would be a serious \n     mistake,'' said Dave Eldridge, vice chairman of the Arkansas \n     District Export Council and director of economic development \n     for Arkansas Power & Light Co.\n       Eldridge served as moderator Tuesday for the 1995 World \n     Trade Conference on European markets featuring a trio of \n     Commerce Department officers representing four European \n     countries.\n       ``If the United States is going to maintain its ability to \n     compete effectively in the world market, then we are going to \n     need a strong advocacy in Washington and throughout the \n     world,'' said Hartsell Wingfield, president of TCBY \n     International, the Little Rock-based frozen yogurt franchiser \n     with operations in 30 countries.\n       That advocate is not Congress; ``it is the strong, \n     effective Commercial Service'' sector of the Commerce \n     Department's International [[Page S7360]] Trade \n     Administration, Wingfield told the conference luncheon in the \n     Excelsior Hotel.\n       ``If we take a hands-off approach to international trade \n     from a political perspective,'' he said, ``we will lose our \n     edge as an international exporter, because other countries \n     are not taking a hands-off approach.''\n       Joseph O'Brien, an international trade consultant and \n     president of the Arkansas World Trade Club, agreed. ``I've \n     had personal experience on behalf of Arkansas clients with \n     the Commercial Service guys stationed in Paris and Madrid and \n     Mexico City and Guatemala City,'' he said, ``and in every \n     case, they were enthusiastic and they tried hard. They really \n     made a big difference.''\n       Putting the Commerce Department's international trade role \n     under the State Department would mean a different set of \n     priorities, O'Brien added. ``We really do need to export more \n     in this country, and this is the one way for small companies \n     to get help overseas. The big boys don't need it; the smaller \n     ones do.''\n       Meanwhile, global trade competition is getting keener, and \n     some of the best potential European markets for Arkansas \n     exports may be in the least-known countries, the Commerce \n     Department's senior commercial officers told the world trade \n     conference.\n       ``Italy is one of the least-known markets in the U.S.; it's \n     a marketplace people don't look at often,'' said Keith \n     Bovetti, minister counselor with the department's Commercial \n     Service in Italy.\n       The country's ``close to a $1 trillion gross domestic \n     product has the fifth leading economy in the world, and major \n     privatization is going on there,'' he said, ``but there are \n     no shortcuts to being there on the spot to do business.''\n       Spain and Portugal are also lesser-known economies, said \n     minister counselor Emilio Iodice, who is assigned to the two \n     countries.\n       ``Spain is not just a land of bullfighters and flamenco \n     dancers,'' he said, ``it has a stable government and the \n     highest growth rate in Europe for the last 12 years.'' Spain \n     in 1994 had $6 billion in U.S. investment and, while that's \n     sizable, foreign investment there was greater, he said.\n       Portugal, with one-fourth Spain's population, ``is a new \n     country, economically,'' Iodice said, noting increased \n     investments in foreign goods and services to help the country \n     become more competitive globally.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, let me be very brief and concise.\n  This amendment by Senator Bingaman expresses the sense of the Senate \nregarding the importance of research, technology, trade promotion, and \ntrade law enforcement programs all very important to America. This \nparticular amendment is cosponsored by Senators Lieberman, Rockefeller, \nBiden, Hollings, Byrd, Kerry, Dodd, and Pryor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this amendment says that the conferees \nhave to keep spending limits at a certain level to accomplish the goals \nthat the amendment contemplates, and there shall be no revenue \nreductions unless we do. Some of the goals are rather vague, and it is \npretty difficult to know what we must do.\n  It is with reluctance that I move to table the amendment, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Murray, I send an \namendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 79, between lines 3 and 4, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . PROHIBITION OF LEGISLATION THAT WOULD DEPRIVE \n                   CHILDREN OF THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE UNDER \n                   MEDICAID.\n\n       (a) Point of Order.--It shall not be in order in the Senate \n     to consider any bill, resolution, amendment, motion, or \n     conference report that would cause children eligible to \n     receive benefits under Medicaid (whether currently or in the \n     future) to lose any of those benefits.\n       (b) Waiver.--This section may be waived or suspended in the \n     Senate by a majority vote of the Members voting, a quorum \n     being present, or by the unanimous consent of the Senate.\n       (c) Appeals.--Appeals in the Senate from the decisions of \n     the Chair relating to this section shall be limited to 1 \n     hour, to be equally divided between and controlled by, the \n     appellant and the manager of the bill or resolution, as the \n     case may be. An affirmative vote of a majority of the Members \n     of the Senate, duly chosen and sworn, shall be required in \n     the Senate to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on \n     a point of order raised under this provision.\n       (d) Congressional Budget Office Reports.--Whenever the \n     Director of the Congressional Budget Office prepares a report \n     pursuant to section 308 of the Congressional Budget Act of \n     1974 in connection with a bill, resolution, or conference \n     report that the Director believes would cause children \n     eligible to receive benefits under Medicaid (whether \n     currently or in the future) to lose any of those benefits, \n     the Director shall so state in that report and, to the extent \n     practicable, shall include an estimate of the number of \n     children eligible to receive benefits under Medicaid (whether \n     currently or in the future) who would lose any of those \n     benefits as a result of that legislation.\n       (e) Estimates.--Solely for the purposes of enforcement of \n     this section in the Senate, the number of children eligible \n     to receive benefits under Medicaid shall be determined on the \n     basis of estimates made by the Committee on the Budget of the \n     Senate.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, a majority vote point of order against this \nlegislation will cause children currently receiving health care \ninsurance under Medicare to lose their insurance. What this does is \nsimply requires a majority vote if such an event would take place.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this amendment is not germane to the \nbudget resolution. It establishes another procedure on how the Senate \nshould consider future Medicaid reform legislation. Because of that, I \nraise a point of order against the pending amendment.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974, I move to waive that act for consideration of the \npending amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon] for himself, and Mrs. \n     Murray, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Pressler, Mr. Akaka, Mrs. Hutchison, \n     Mr. Levin, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Pell, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Baucus, \n     Mr. Kerrey, and Mrs. Kassebaum proposes an amendment numbered \n     1164.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds as follows:\n       (1) In order to fulfill its responsibility to communities \n     that were adversely affected by Federal activities, the \n     Congress established the Impact Aid program in 1950.\n       (2) The Impact Aid program is intended to ease the burden \n     on local school districts for educating children who live on \n     Federal property. Since Federal property is exempt from local \n     property taxes, such districts are denied the primary source \n     of revenue used to finance elementary and secondary \n     education. Most Impact Aid payments are made for students \n     whose parents are in the uniformed services, or for students \n     who reside on Indian lands or in federally subsidized low-\n     rent housing projects. Over 1,600 local educational agencies \n     enrolling over 17,000,000 children are provided assistance \n     under the Impact Aid program.\n       (3) The Impact Aid program is one of the few Federal \n     education programs where funds are sent directly to the \n     school district. Such funds go directly into the general fund \n     and may be used as the local educational agency decides.\n       (4) The Impact Aid program covers less than half of what it \n     costs to educate each federally connected student in some \n     school districts, requiring local school districts or States \n     to provide the remainder.\n       (5) Added to the burden described in paragraph (4) is the \n     fact that some States do not rely upon an income tax for \n     State funding of education. In these cases, the loss of \n     property tax revenue makes State and local education funding \n     even more difficult to obtain.\n       (6) Given the serious budget constraints facing State and \n     local governments it is critical that the Federal Government \n     continue to fulfill its responsibility to the federally \n     impact school districts in our Nation's States.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that in the assumptions for the overall accounts it is \n     assumed that--the Federal Government has a financial \n     responsibility to schools in our Nation's communities which \n     are adversely affected by Federal activities and that funding \n     for such responsibilities should not be reduced or \n     eliminated.\n\n  Mr. EXON. This is sense of the Senate on impact aid, to recognize the \nfact that the Federal Government has a financial obligation to schools \nin our communities adversely affected by some of the proposed \nactivities, and that we should not reduce or eliminate funding for \nthese responsibilities.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am prepared to accept the amendment if \nthere will be no rollcall vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1164) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to reconsider the vote by which the amendment \nwas agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1165\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding student loan \n                                 cuts)\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon] for Mr. Pell proposes \n     an amendment numbered 1165.\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . STUDENT LOAN CUTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) in the 20th century, educational increases in the \n     workforce accounted for 30 percent of the growth in our \n     Nation's wealth, and advances in knowledge accounted for 55 \n     percent of such growth;\n       (2) the Federal Government provides 75 percent of all \n     college financial aid;\n       (3) the Federal student loan program was created to make \n     college accessible and affordable for the middle class;\n       (4) increased fees and interest costs discourage college \n     participation by making higher education more expensive, and \n     more of a risk, for students and their families;\n       (5) full-time students already work an average of 25 hours \n     per week, taking time away from their studies; and\n       (6) student indebtedness is already increasing rapidly, and \n     any reduction of the in-school interest subsidy will increase \n     the indebtedness burden on students and families.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     resolution assume the Labor and Human Resources Committee, in \n     seeking to achieve mandatory savings, should not increase the \n     cost of borrowing for students participating in the Robert T. \n     Stafford Federal Student Loan Program.\n\n  Mr. EXON. The Pell amendment expresses the sense of the Senate that \nthe Labor and Human Resources Committee, in seeking to achieve \nmandatory savings, should not increase the cost of borrowing for \nstudents participating in the Robert T. Stafford Federal Student Loan \nProgram.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, who is the sponsor of that amendment?\n  Mr. EXON. Senator Pell.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Could he change a couple of the words?\n  Mr. EXON. I am advised we cannot accept this until we clear it with \nSenator Pell. I apologize to my friend. Can we lay this aside?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Pleased to do it. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, there will be one more vote tonight, and \nwhatever it is, that will be the last vote.\n  Then at 7 o'clock we will proceed to debate the rescission conference \nreport, but that will not be voted on until tomorrow. The first vote \ntomorrow will be at 9 o'clock, if it is all right with the Democratic \nleader, on the conference report. Then we will start voting on \namendments from 9 o'clock until some time late in the day, I assume.\n  I would hope that some of my colleagues will take another look at \ntheir amendments and see if they really feel it is important.\n  The point I want to make is I made a promise to the President we \nwould try to do the counter--antiterrorism bill. I want to try to keep \nthat promise. I do not know how we can do it if we spend all day \ntomorrow voting.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I say to the distinguished \nmajority leader, I believe they are working diligently to try to cut \nback on the amendments. I thank him for urging that. We believe we can \nmodify the Pell amendment and accept it.\n  Mr. EXON. Would the Senator please state how he would like to have it \namended? It has been agreed to and Senator Pell has authorized it. He \nis [[Page S7362]] right here. He has authorized me to agree to the \nchanges you had suggested, Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is not the amendment.\n  Mr. FORD. It is at the desk.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, we will temporarily set aside the Pell \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1166\n\n (Purpose: To repeal the ex-patriots billionaires tax loophole and put \n     the money into veterans programs to assist American patriots)\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am a proud cosponsor of the amendment \noffered by my colleagues, Senators Lautenberg and Rockefeller, to \nrestore funding to veterans' programs by closing the ex-patriots tax \nloophole.\n  This provision, which allows billionaires to renounce their \ncitizenship to avoid paying taxes, has been quite popular this year. On \ntwo occasions, the Senate has resoundingly supported changing this tax \nloophole. Unfortunately, final legislation to close this loophole has \nnot yet passed. Today we have an important opportunity to close this \nunfair loophole once and for all and to help those individuals who must \nnow face personal battles each and every day because they sacrificed \nfor their country.\n  The Lautenberg-Rockefeller amendment provides that money saved from \nrepealing this tax loophole will be used to restore funds for critical \nveterans' programs. These individuals have been unfairly and \ncontinually targeted as a means to help balance the budget. During the \nbalanced budget amendment debate earlier this year, I supported an \namendment by Senator Rockefeller that exempted current veterans' \nbenefits from cuts. That amendment failed 33 to 62, signaling the \nintent to further cut the benefits of these individuals.\n  This budget resolution seeks to cut $15.4 billion in funding for \nveterans' programs through 2002. This will result in denying care to \nalmost 1 million veterans, and closing the equivalent of 35 of its \nhospitals. Clearly, this is not an effective or responsible way to care \nfor the needs of our Nation's veterans. We should be working on ways to \nimprove care for veterans, not diminish it.\n  Mr. President, I understand the need to make difficult choices about \nwhich programs to cut in our push to balance the budget, and that \ncertain sacrifices must be made. However, we must not lose sight of the \npromises made to those men and women who fought to help preserve \ndemocracy in our country and around the world. We cannot revoke the \nvery care and benefits that were promised to these individuals when \nthey put their lives on the line and served their country.\n  As the daughter of a disabled veteran, I understand the toll \ndebilitating diseases take on a family. I understand the value of the \nVA health system and the critical research being done to help improve \npatient care. This amendment seeks to right a serious wrong. It will \nhelp restore funding for veterans programs that provide medical care \nand medical research for the true patriots of this country, and stop an \negregious abuse of a tax loophole by those individuals who wish to be \nex-patriots.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this amendment and help \nmaintain the promises made to the veterans of this country.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this year marks the 50th anniversary of \nthe end of the Second World War and the 20th anniversary of the end of \nthe Vietnam war. It is a sad irony that at the same time we honor the \nbrave men and women who served so valiantly in these two wars, Senate \nRepublicans are seeking to cut funding for veterans' programs.\n  I support a balanced budget, and I want to work with my Republican \ncolleagues to get there. However, we can get to a balanced budget \nwithout damaging veterans' programs. To do otherwise says that the \nsacrifices of those who were ready to risk their lives can be cheaply \nbought and easily forgotten. It says that solemn promises by Government \nto those who have risked all in the service of Government can be \ncasually disregarded. [[Page S7363]] \n  The Republican budget resolution would slice almost $16 billion from \nveterans' programs over the next 7 years. Part of this savings would \ncome from freezing VA medical care at the fiscal year 1995 level for \nthe next 7 years. This would be a drastic blow to a system that is \nalready sorely underfunded. It will affect every VA health care \nfacility at the same time resources will be withdrawn from Medicare and \nMedicaid, leading to additional pressures on the VA system.\n  The budget resolution also proposes to phase out VA construction by \n1999. According to the Disabled American Veterans, that would lead to \nthe cancellation of 215 projects needed to meet current health care \ndelivery standards. Clearly, this ill-advised move would jeopardize the \nquality of veterans' care across the country.\n  At the same time it cuts funding for needed veterans' programs, this \nbudget resolution does nothing to prevent billionaires living abroad \nfrom renouncing their U.S. citizenship solely to avoid U.S. taxes on \ntheir fortunes. Although relatively few individuals choose expatriation \nfor this purpose, the resulting revenue loss to the U.S. Treasury is \nsignificant. Specifically, closing this tax loophole would raise $3.6 \nbillion in the first 5 years from an estimated two dozen individuals.\n  The Lautenberg-Rockfeller amendment addresses both of these \nshortcomings in the current budget resolution. Simply, the amendment \nwould deny huge tax benefits to ex-patriots and use that savings to \nrestore some of the funding being taken from the VA.\n  As this important amendment illustrates, we don't have to sacrifice \nthe goal of a balanced budget to correct what's wrong with this budget \nresolution. We need only correct the badly unbalanced priorities it \nestablishes.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, this amendment I am offering on behalf of \nSenator Lautenberg is called the ex-patriots amendment. This amendment \nwould close the loophole that allows billionaires and others to avoid \nFederal taxes by renouncing their citizenship, and would apply the \nsavings for restoring funding for the veterans programs.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1167 to Amendment No. 1166\n\n (Purpose: To repeal the ``Ex-Patriots'' loophole and use the money to \n            eliminate the Social Security earnings penalty)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

We have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1165), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . STUDENT LOAN CUTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) in the 20th century, educational increases in the \n     workforce accounted for 30 percent of the growth in our \n     Nation's wealth, and advances in knowledge accounted for 55 \n     percent of such growth;\n       (2) the Federal Government provides 75 percent of all \n     college financial aid;\n       (3) the Federal student loan program was created to make \n     college accessible and affordable for the middle class;\n       (4) increased fees and interest costs discourage college \n     participation by making higher education more expensive, and \n     more of a risk, for students and their families;\n       (5) full-time students already work an average of 25 hours \n     per week, taking time away from their studies; and\n       (6) student indebtedness is already increasing rapidly, and \n     any reduction of the in-school interest subsidy will increase \n     the indebtedness burden on students and families.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     resolution assume the Labor and Human Resources Committee, in \n     seeking to achieve mandatory savings, should do their best to \n     not increase the cost of borrowing for students participating \n     in the Robert T. Stafford Federal Student Loan Program.\n                           ALTERNATIVE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today as a supporter and original co-\nsponsor of the amendment offered by my distinguished friend from North \nDakota, which presents an alternative budget resolution to the \ncommittee-passed version before us.\n  While both plans theoretically achieve balance by the year 2002, I \nbelieve our alterative is a better budget in many important ways.\n  It is a better budget because it maximizes our future investments in \nour people, restoring partial funding in such critical areas as \neducation, infrastructure, and research and development.\n  It is a better budget because it eases the unprecedented cuts in our \nFederal health programs contained in the Republican budget, replacing \n$l00 billion in Medicare and $50 billion in Medicaid.\n  It is a better budget because it restricts current tax loopholes for \ncitizens who make more than $l40,000 a year, bringing greater and \nurgently needed equity to our current tax structure.\n  And it is a better budget, Mr. President, because it does not \ndesignate the so-called economic dividend to an indefensible tax cut \nwhich may ultimately benefit our wealthiest citizens.\n  I participated in efforts to craft this budget resolution, Mr. \nPresident, because I believe strongly that we Democrats cannot simply \nbe against everything on the table. Rather, we have a profound \nobligation to be for something as well.\n  While no document crafted by more than one Senator can make any \nSenator completely happy, I am comfortable that this budget brings much \nneeded equity to our debate. It gives us a plan where revenues are on \nthe table along with spending cuts, where critical investments in our \npeople are preserved whenever possible, where our wealthiest do not \nbenefit at the expense of our neediest, and, where--very importantly--\nour Federal budget is balanced.\n  Let me repeat that final point, Mr. President.\n  We offer today a budget resolution that commits us to more deficit \nreduction than the Republican alternatives by the year 2002. In fact, \nthe budget we propose reaches true balance without using the surplus in \nthe Social Security trust fund by the year 2004. In this amendment, we \ncall for the elimination of our deficit and we outline the budgets that \nget us there.\n  This debate is not about whether or not we should have a balanced \nbudget. This debate is how to balance it.\n  While I believe the cuts in the Republican budget resolution may be \nunsustainable when committees try to implement them, the plan we offer \ntoday, Mr. President, is fair and defensible. It is about meeting our \nobligation to our children and our grandchildren in a manner that more \nresponsibly protects the strength and security of their future.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the very serious alternative \nresolution we bring before the Senate today, Mr. President, and I yield \nthe floor.\n                           amendment no. 1127\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, Senator Feingold's amendment would \nprohibit us from applying any savings above and beyond a balanced \nbudget to tax cuts. The majority has estimated that those savings would \nbe in the range of $170 billion over the next 7 years.\n  I believe we should have used the estimated $170 billion in savings \nto reduce cuts imposed by Senate Concurrent Resolution 13 on Medicare, \neducation, EITC and farm programs. As I noted in the statement I \ndelivered to this body yesterday, those cuts are too severe and will \nhurt the elderly, young people looking to educate themselves, as well \nas the ordinary fellow trying to support grandparents and put his kids \nthrough college.\n  Amendments which would have applied the $170 billion in savings to \nreduce the cuts did not pass.\n  Today, we consider Senator Feingold's amendment which bars using the \n$170 billion savings for tax cuts and would instead apply it to create \na budget surplus.\n  Mr. President, I strongly support the need to bring our annual \ndeficit to zero. I voted for the balanced budget amendment and would do \nso again.\n  Yet, selective, focused tax cuts would be appropriate. Tax cuts that \nwill specifically benefit the middle class taxpayers who find their \nexpectations of a better future challenged or reduced from day to day \nand who are struggling to support aging parents and who want their \nchildren to have the benefit of a college education. At this early \npoint in time, we should not rule out giving them a break.\n  For that reason, Mr. President, I oppose the Feingold amendment.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, as the discussion on the budget resolution \nhas progressed, it appears that there are fundamental and partisan \ndifferences on our spending priorities and programs. Some of these \ndifferences go to the heart of the Democratic and Republican approaches \nto governance, and call into question the Federal Government's role in \nsociety. Soon we may be dismantling the core components of a decades-\nold social compact between the American government and people.\n  Our social safety net--Medicare and Medicaid, education, support and \nassistance for our Nation's poor--is the priority one issue of our \ntime. It is one of the most important functions of our Government, and \nit encompasses the matters about which the American people care most \ndeeply. As critical as they are, however, this budget debate is about \nmore than just our domestic spending priorities. The spending cuts in \nthe budget plan are so wholesale and comprehensive that they will \ndrastically curtail the U.S. ability to conduct diplomacy and advance \nour interests abroad.\n  I would like to take a moment, Mr. President, to focus on the impact \nof the proposed spending cuts on foreign affairs--the so-called 150 \naccount. This budget will slash funding for U.S. foreign affairs \nagencies, personnel and assistance programs; virtually eliminate U.S. \nfinancial support for the United Nations; and shackle the ability of \nthe United States to participate in U.N. peacekeeping missions.\n  Even though it has yet to be adopted, the resolution already has had \na debilitating impact on our foreign policy [[Page S7365]] agencies and \nprograms. Last week the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations \nreported--on a straight party-line vote--foreign relations authorizing \nlegislation that will cut spending for the Department of State and U.S. \nforeign policy programs by $3.5 billion during the next 4 years. \nYesterday the Committee began to mark up foreign aid authorizing \nlegislation, which if reported will have an equally devastating effect \non our overseas assistance program.\n  Together, these bills will abolish three major foreign affairs \nagencies--ACDA, USIA, and USAID. They will curtail U.S. participation \nin the United Nations Organization and support for U.N. peacekeeping. \nThey will slash foreign aid spending and virtually eliminate U.S. \nsupport for multilateral lending institutions. They will arbitrarily \nprohibit U.S. participation in multilateral environmental organizations \nand adversely affect the implementation of critical environmental \ninitiatives. The rush to cut spending is such that the Foreign \nRelations Committee bills will authorize spending at levels far below \neven what the budget resolution currently recommends--perhaps as much \nas $600 million.\n  On its surface, I acknowledge that for some, this news will not be \nentirely disappointing. There are those who do not understand the value \nof spending money on foreign affairs\n programs, and most opinion polls place foreign aid near the bottom in \nterms of public support. At the same time, Americans want the United \nStates to remain a prominent world power in the post-cold war era. The \npeople understand this, and the times demand it. Our economic future \nlies in a global trading system; if we want to protect our national \ninterests we must be active players in the international system.\n\n  The problem, however, is that the scope and scale of the budget and \nspending proposals will force the United States to retreat into \nisolation. All of these initiatives are negative in tone; they dictate \nor suggest that we should not engage in certain activities. They do not \noffer affirmative policy prescriptions. In the post-cold war era, \nRepublicans and Democrats should be working together to fashion a \nbipartisan strategy for U.S. foreign policy in the 21 century. Instead, \nwe are wasting our time debating neo-isolationist proposals which, if \nadopted, will result in the United States becoming a feeble, second-\nrate power. We will be unable to exert influence or work cooperatively \nwith the international community to resolve conflicts, advance our \ninterest, or promote democratic and free market principles.\n  As written, the budget resolution would set us squarely down the road \ntoward retrenchment and withdrawal. If we choose to go this route, we \nwill do grave disservice to the next generation of Americans. At the \nend of World War II, we chose not to yield to the temptation of \nisolationism, and our country prospered as it never had before. I think \nwe should have learned our lesson by now.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, overall, I am supportive of this budget \nresolution. I believe it provides a sensible roadmap toward balancing \nthe Federal budget over the next 7 years and I commend my colleagues on \nthe Budget Committee for their efforts.\n  However, there is one area of the budget resolution with which I \ndisagree: the proposal to sell the Power Marketing Administrations. \nThis sale would have a devastating effect on South Dakota's rural \ncommunities and small cities--and on people across the country.\n  That is why I rise today to join my colleague from Montana in \noffering a sense-of-the-Senate to strike the Budget Committee's \nrecommendation to sell the Western Area, Southwestern, and Southeastern \nPower Marketing Administrations--collectively known as the PMA's.\n  Public power serves many functions in South Dakota. As a sparsely \npopulated State, utilities are faced with the challenge of how to get \naffordable electricity into small cities and rural communities where \nthere are less than two people per mile of transmission line. Public \npower provides the solution.\n  In public power utilities, the only investors are the consumers. \nRevenues are reinvested in the community--in the form of taxes and \nservices. And, the low cost of power is essential to encourage economic \ndevelopment in small cities and towns.\n  Public power, purchased through the Western Area Power \nAdministration, known as WAPA, costs South Dakotans an average\n of 2.5 cents less than the market rate. This allows revenue to be \nreinvested in additional transmission lines, and better service. The \navailability of hydropower from the Missouri River to rural \ncooperatives and municipals has helped to stabilize rates. With 7,758 \nmiles of transmission lines in the Pick-Sloan region, WAPA can serve \n133,100 South Dakotans--without charging them an arm and a leg.\n\n  Public power has brought more than electricity to South Dakota. For \nexample, Missouri Basin Municipal Power Agency, based in Sioux Falls, \nhas embarked on a program offering incentives for planting trees. The \ngoal is to plant at least one tree for each 112,500 meters in the \nagency's membership territory. In fact, Missouri Basin was recognized \nby the Department of Energy for outstanding participation in this \nGlobal Climate Change Program. I congratulate Tom Heller of Missouri \nBasin for this excellent community service program.\n  Public power also brings new jobs to the communities it serves. In \npart due to the low cost of power from East River Electric, there are \nnow three injection molding plants based in Madison, SD--creating \nsnowmobile parts. Arctic Cat, PPD, and Falcon Plastics employ \napproximately 200 people in Madison.\n  East River also is involved in other economic development activities. \nIt provides classes to help the community attract businesses, and \noffers grants for feasibility studies associated with economic \ndevelopment projects. South Dakota clearly has benefitted from the work \nof Jeff Nelson, as the general manager of the East River Electric Power \nCooperative.\n  Public power is a South Dakota success story. It is the source of \ninnovation, development, and community pride. I am sure the same is \ntrue in other small cities and rural communities across America. That \nis why I disagree with the Budget Committee's recommendation to sell \nWAPA and two other power marketing administrations. This is simply \neconomic smoke and mirrors used to cover up a backdoor tax on rural and \nsmall city Americans.\n  In essence, this would force South Dakotans--and public power \nconsumers everywhere--to cover for the rest of America. Why? Because \nthe sale of the PMA's could result in rate increases totaling more than \n$47 million.\n  In addition, many of my colleagues claim that the sale of the PMA's \nwould generate revenue for the Federal Government. Will it? Let us look \nat the facts.\n  PMA's still owe almost $15 billion in principal. Also, more than $9 \nbillion in interest already has been paid to the Federal Government. By \nselling the PMA's, the Government would forfeit future interest \npayments.\n  In fact, a recent report prepared by the Congressional Research \nService demonstrates just how much money the PMA's are expected to \ncontribute to the Federal Government. This year, WAPA is expected to \npay back $225.1 million borrowed from the Federal Government. But WAPA \nwill also return another $153.4 million to the Treasury. Given these \nfigures, it is clear that this plan does not make good economic sense.\n  As my colleagues know, this is not a new issue. I have been fighting \nthe proposed sale of the PMA's ever since I came to Congress. In 1986, \nthe Reagan administration made similar attempts to privatize the PMA's. \nI worked with many of you to pass a law to prevent the Department of \nEnergy form pursuing any future plans to sell the PMA's, unless \nspecifically authorized by Congress. As the debate over the sale of the \nPMA's rises again, it seems this law has been forgotten.\n  Mr. President, once again, we are fighting to prove the worth of \npublic power. Once again, we must demonstrate how necessary it is to \nthe lives of rural and small city Americans. The people of South Dakota \nhave stated their message loudly and clearly--through thousands of \npostcards, letters, and phone calls. South Dakotans such as Ron \nHolstein. Bob Martin, and Jeff Nelson have been leaders in their \nopposition to the proposed AMA sale and I appreciate their hard work.\n\n[[Page S7366]]\n\n  Public power is a solid investment for the Nation. Public power is \none of the great success stogie of South Dakota. I urge all my \ncolleagues to stand united behind this amendment to allow the continued \nexistence of the public power, and the essential service it provides to \nthe Americans who reside in small cities and rural communities. Now is \nnot the time to mess with success.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wanted to take a few moments to comment \non the effect of the pending budget resolution on the Medicare Program.\n  I believe history will indicate there is no one in this body who has \nrisen to give a more vigorous defense against unwise Medicare \nreductions than I.\n  Medicare is an important program. It provides needed, valuable, and \nindeed vital, services for millions of elderly and disabled Americans. \nThirty-seven and one-half million to be exact.\n  Our job is to ensure that beneficiaries have the services they need, \nthat the services are of the highest quality possible, and that they \nare cost-efficient. We need to ensure that services are available in \nrural as well as urban areas. We need to make sure that we have a \nsystem which provides incentives for providers to deliver this high-\nquality, cost-efficient care.\n  In sum, on this, the 30th anniversary of Medicare's inception, we \nmust do everything we can to preserve the program, not tear it apart.\n  What is largely ignored, however, is the fact that absent any \ncongressional action, Medicare will go bankrupt by 2002. In fact, it \nwill run into the red by next year.\n  My question is that: Is it the budget that threatens Medicare--or the \nvery design of the program?\n  The answer is clearly the latter, as most experts will concur.\n  Let us look at the facts.\n  First, Medicare is going bankrupt. The 1995 Annual Report of the \nBoard of Trustees of the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, issued \non April 3, indicate that the present financing schedule for the HI--\nHospital Insurance, or part A--program is sufficient to ensure the \npayment of benefits only over the next 7 years. The situation for \nphysician payments under part B of Medicare, is only slightly more \noptimistic.\n  Second, we cannot sustain the current growth rate of Medicare. Over \nthe next 7 years, the period of this budget resolution, Medicare \nhospital benefits are projected to grow more than twice the rate of \nrevenues.\n  Mr. President, at this time, it takes about four covered workers to \nsupport the benefit payments to each enrollee on Medicare A. That ratio \nis declining quickly, so that the trustees have estimated by the middle \nof the next century, only two covered workers will support each \nenrollee. In fact, absent any legislative changes, that scenario won't \ncome to pass, because Medicare will have been bankrupt long before \nthen.\n  According to the most recent estimates of Medicare spending--the \nMarch baseline issued by the Congressional Budget Office--in 1995, \nMedicare is expected to spend $181.2 billion--$113.6 billion in outlays \nfor hospital costs, and $67.6 billion for physician and related costs.\n  Ten years from now, however, total hospital outlays are expected to \ngrow to $247 billion, and physician costs to $215.8 billion.\n  These numbers are troublesome for two reasons. First of all, they \nshow a level of spending which cannot be sustained. They indicate that \nspending for the Medicare Program is expected to increase over the next \ndecade to almost half a trillion dollars, to $463.2 billion to be \nexact--more than double current levels.\n  And second, they show the dramatic rise in spending for part B. This \nyear, part B costs are roughly half of the amount for part A. In 10 \nyears, they are almost equal.\n  Third, projected shortfalls in Medicare are astronomical. The \nCongressional Budget Office has estimated that it will take $345 \nbillion in additional revenues just to keep Medicare solvent over the \nnext decade. This is $345 billion extra.\n  The budget resolution assumes a $265-billion reduction in the rate of \nincrease over the next 7 years, thus keeping the program solvent for \nthat time period.\n  Fourth, the budget resolution does not cut Medicare, it cuts its rate \nof growth. Under this budget resolution, Medicare spending will still \nexceed $1.65 trillion over the next 7 years. Medicare spending is \nprojected to grow by 94 percent between fiscal years 1995 and 2002 \nunder this budget. Put another way, on average Medicare spending is \nprojected to grow at nearly 10 percent annually, while private health \nspending will average less than 7 percent. Under the budget resolution, \nMedicare spending will still grow on average 7.1 percent per year.\n  Fifth, to do nothing would be fiscally and morally irresponsible. As \nI have said, absent congressional action, Medicare will go bankrupt, \npure and simple. But there is another compelling fact to consider. \nTotal Medicare expenditures this fiscal year will account for 11.5 \npercent of the entire Federal budget. Clearly this growth rate is \nunsustainable; it threatens both current and future beneficiaries.\n  Sixth, there are no easy answers. I wish there were a simple answer \nto the Medicare conundrum.\n  Two weeks ago, Stuart M. Butler, vice president and director of \ndomestic policy studies for the Heritage Foundation, wrote a very \ncompelling article entitled, ``The High Cost of Not Reforming \nMedicare.''\n  Mr. Butler clearly and concisely outlined the choices available to \nthe Congress. He wrote:\n\n       There are only two choices available to the Congress:\n       Choice #1: Do not change the way in which Medicare is run \n     by the government, and pay for future benefits by raising new \n     revenues through higher payroll and other taxes or by \n     diverting money from other programs. This means Medicare \n     survives only by draining money away from the rest of the \n     budget or by raising taxes.\n       Choice #2: Change the way Medicare is run so that benefits \n     are delivered more efficiently, avoiding future tax increases \n     or a diversion of money from other programs. Making the \n     program more efficient would improve the quality of benefits \n     and the choices available to retirees while reducing the \n     double-digit rate of outlay increases. This\n      would slow the depletion of the trust fund and stabilize the \n     program.\n\n  As an illustration of the impact of choice No. 1, Mr. Butler noted \nthat the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund could be put on a \nsound, permanent actuarial footing right now--by raising payroll taxes \n3.52 percent on top of the current 2.9-percent rate. The impact, \nhowever, would be enormous. A worker earning $45,000 would pay an \nadditional $1,584 a year, obviously an unwise step which would not be \nacceptable to the Congress.\n  Clearly, the better course of action is to improve the Medicare \nprogram, making it more efficient and cost conscious. This will not be \nan easy task. Indeed, it will be extremely difficult, perhaps the most \ndifficult task that has faced the Congress in decades. But it must be \ndone.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I wish to make one final point.\n  I do not wish to give the impression that I am diminishing the \nenormity of the task before us.\n  I am extremely concerned about Medicare reductions of this magnitude.\n  I could not vote for this budget if I thought that we were taking an \naction that would lead to the demise of Medicare. Medicare is a promise \nwe made to our Nation's elderly and future elderly.\n  On the contrary, after considerable study of this issue, I can come \nto no other conclusion than that taking no action will lead to the \ndemise of Medicare.\n  I believe it would be both fiscally and morally\n   irresponsible to stand aside and propose no changes in Medicare, \nknowing all the while that a staunch adherence to the status quo would \nlead to bankruptcy of the program.\n\n  Let me hasten to add that I will be monitoring this situation very, \nvery carefully.\n  Under the budget resolution, the Committee on Finance will now begin \nwork to outline specific Medicare changes to meet the instructions \ncontained in this bill.\n  As a member of the Finance Committee, I intend to participate fully \nin those deliberations, to make certain that the changes we craft are \nas equitable and responsible as possible.\n  It is not my intent that the changes we undertake drive providers out \nof business, force hospital net operating margins into the red, or \ndeprive beneficiaries of needed services, although some changes will \ncertainly have to be [[Page S7367]] made to save Medicare. We must face \nthis situation realistically.\n  If we find that these proposed changes have an adverse effect that \naffects patient health, whether in Utah or anywhere else in the Nation, \nI pledge to work closely with my colleagues to rectify the situation.\n  Mr. President, I do not mean to downplay the gravity of the \nsituation. Reductions of this magnitude, even though they are \nreductions in the rate of growth, are difficult for me--and I would \nventure to say for every Senator--to support. Such reductions will \nindeed have an impact.\n  But, in the Senate, as in life, there are times when we have to do \nthe right thing, even if it is also the hard thing. Members of the \nSenate and House simply must see beyond their next elections. We must \nforce ourselves to look at the long term.\n  The alternative--bankruptcy of the Medicare system--is unthinkable \nand must be avoided. If we fail in this task, the health care safety \nnet that Medicare provides for millions of current seniors--not to \nmention those who are approaching senior status--will be lost.\n  I appreciate that the Budget Committee's recommendations were adopted \nwith considerable angst. I commend Senator Domenici and members of the \ncommittee for doing the right thing. We must all focus on solutions to \nthis urgent national fiscal dilemma.\n                 protecting america's influence abroad\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this budget resolution calls for \nelimination of the budget deficit. I support that goal, but there are \nmany different ways to achieve it. I do not support the formula \nproposed by the Republicans. It will hurt the poorest people, and \nreward the wealthiest. There is no better example of the fundamental \ndifferences between Republicans and Democrats.\n  Right now, I would like to focus on what the other side's proposed \nbudget would do to Function 150, the part of the budget that finances \nprograms to advance U.S. foreign policy.\n  Function 150 is not a large item in the Federal budget. It amounts to \nonly a little more than 1 percent of total Federal expenditures. It is \nonly 8 percent of our budget for national defense.\n  But it is vitally important to every man, woman, and child in this \ncountry. The United States is the world's only remaining superpower. We \nhave an historic opportunity to influence global events, and to make \nsure that political and economic developments around the world are \nconsistent with American interests.\n  The momentum is already in the right direction. American investments \nover the past 40 years have paid off. Not only has the direct threat of \nCommunist aggression disappeared. The end of confrontation between the \ntwo superpowers has also caused the world to refocus attention on the \nevils of dictatorship and abuse of human rights that persist in many \nplaces. And the collapse of centrally planned economic systems has \ndiscredited state ownership of the economy all around the world. For \nthe first time in history, the trend is almost single-mindedly toward \nadopting the values that Americans hold dear--democracy, human rights, \nprivate property, open markets, competition.\n  But it is much too early yet to relax our vigilance. The world \nremains an unpredictable, violent and unstable place. The United States \nstill has a vital interest in leading the way towards peace and \ndemocracy and prosperity and away from conflict and instability.\n  The military threat to America has receded, but it is more true today \nthan ever that American prosperity is linked to conditions in the rest \nof the world. Millions of Americans jobs depend upon persuading other \ncountries to open their borders to U.S. exports and helping them to \nraise their incomes so they can afford to buy those exports. Providing \nAmericans clean air and clean water depends upon international action \nto protect the environment. Keeping Americans healthy depends on \ncooperative action to fight\n disease in other countries. Stemming the flow of illegal immigrants \nand refugees to the United States depends on advancing democracy and \neconomic development in the countries from which the refugees are \nfleeing.\n\n  For all that people complain about the U.S. Government wasting money \noverseas, Americans overwhelmingly reject isolationism. They want the \nPresident of the United States to continue to project American power \nand influence abroad.\n  Maintaining a strong military provides underpinning for that exercise \nof leadership. But who wants us to have to risk shedding American \nblood? We need the President to conduct an aggressive, preventive \nforeign policy that will secure America's interests peacefully. This is \nwhere Function 150 is absolutely critical.\n  It is Function 150 that provides the funding for the President to \nlead:\n  It pays for the State Department and U.S. Embassies around the globe \nthat maintain communication with foreign governments and pursue \ncooperation with them. It funds the diplomacy that just a few weeks ago \nsecured the indefinite extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \nTreaty, with the enormous promise it offers for reducing the threat of \nnuclear explosions.\n  It funds U.S. contributions to the various international \norganizations that are the glue that holds our international economic \nsystem together:\n  The United Nations which notwithstanding its weaknesses--weaknesses \nthat stem primarily from the differences of its members--plays a \ncritical role in focusing international attention on world problems and \nhelping resolve them;\n  The International Monetary Fund which brings governments together to \nprotect the stability of the international monetary system; and\n  The World Bank and regional development banks that mobilize capital \nto help the poorer countries develop economic policies that will \nproduce equitable, sustainable economic growth.\n  It funds America's bilateral assistance programs. These include \nprograms for helping Rwandans fleeing from genocide; programs for \ncontaining the spread of AIDS and other deadly, infectious diseases; \nprograms for assisting Russia to install democratic systems and \nprivatize state-owned enterprises; programs for advancing the Middle \nEast peace process.\n  It funds the efforts of the Export Import Bank of the United States \nand other agencies to promote U.S. exports.\n  The budget resolution envisions a $2.4 billion reduction in Function \n150 spending in the 1996 fiscal year, with additional reductions in \nsubsequent years. This may not seem like much in a $1.5 trillion \nbudget, but it amounts to over 12 percent of the current Function 150 \nbudget. Subtracting out accounts that cannot be reduced, it means cuts \nof over 30 percent in many of the remaining accounts. This is not \nstreamlining, this is decapitation.\n  Mr. President, quite simply, the cuts in Function 150 that the budget \nresolution contemplates would undermine the President's ability to \nprotect American interests abroad by non-military means. Let me cite \njust a few examples:\n  We would abandon efforts to promote political and economic reform in \nRussia and the other former centrally planned economies. Given the \nopportunity to help turn our worst enemy into a friend, the Republicans \nwant us to shrug and turn our backs. I am not thrilled with everything \nRussia is doing. The destruction of Chechnya embodies the worst of old-\nstyle Soviet heavy-handed repression. But there have been many \nastonishingly positive developments in Russia, Ukraine, and the other \ncentral and eastern European countries over the past couple of years \ntoo. Enhanced freedom of the press. Privatization of enterprise. \nElections. Our aid is aimed at advancing reform. What folly for us not \nto seek to nurture what is good in the new Europe.\n  We would virtually terminate efforts through the World Bank to \npromote economic reform and growth in the poorest countries of sub-\nSaharan Africa and Asia. This is no trivial matter. If these countries, \nwith their hundreds of millions of people, start to grow, they will \noffer vast new markets for employment-generating U.S. exports. If, on \nthe other hand, they descend into fratricidal war and economic decay, \nthey will produce ever-more-overwhelming flows of refugees and disease. \nRepresenting not just the United States but the entire world community, \nthe World Bank and the other multilateral development banks are the \nmost promising instrument for bringing change to these desperate \ncountries. In the past few years, they have finally begun to record \nsuccess in [[Page S7368]] producing broad-based growth in some of these \ncountries. For less than $2 billion per year, the United States has the \nprospect of promoting the development of economies accounting for a \nthird or more of the world's population. This is a sound investment. \nThe Republican budget resolution would cancel that investment.\n  We would slash spending on bilateral development assistance. This is \nassistance that is keyed directly to U.S. interests. We promote \ndemocracy and sustainable development in countries that are major \nsources of refugees and migrants. The Agency for\n International Development has taken decisive steps during the Clinton \nadministration to bring its activities fully into sync with U.S. \nforeign policy priorities. It is grossly inaccurate to call its \nprograms tax-dollar throw-aways, as some have said.\n\n  Programs of special interest to many Senators, like aid to Eastern \nEurope and the Baltics, Cyprus and Ireland, and military aid to Greece \nand Turkey, would be eliminated. The Ex-Im Bank, Peace Corps, PL-480 \nfood aid, and educational exchanges would all be slashed.\n  Of course, the United States cannot do any of this by itself. But no \none is asking us to. The United States has already fallen to 21st among \nforeign aid donors in the percentage of national income that it devotes \nto development assistance. We aren't even the largest donor in terms of \ndollar amount anymore. Japan has now left us in the dust. The budget \nresolution would force us to withdraw from broad areas of development \nassistance entirely.\n  When I became chairman of the Foreign Operation Subcommittee in \nfiscal year 1990, the Foreign Operations budget, which makes up two-\nthirds of the Function 150 account, was $14.6 billion. During my 6 \nyears as chairman, we cut that budget by 6.5 percent--not even taking \ninto account inflation--while the remainder of the discretionary \nspending in the Federal budget increased by 4.8 percent. Most of those \ncuts were in military aid. They were a calculated response to the end \nof the cold war. But that job is now pretty well done. Foreign aid \ntoday is substantially less than it was during the Reagan and Bush \nadministrations.\n  Mr. President, we must recognize that there is a limit to how far we \ncan cut our budget for international affairs. Our allies are scratching \ntheir heads, wondering why the United States, with the opportunity to \nexercise influence in the world more cheaply than ever before, is \nturning its back and walking away. We are inviting whoever else wants \nto--friend or foe--to step into the vacuum and pursue their interests \nat our expense.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, this is an historic moment--today we are \ncloser than ever before to putting America's economic house in order. \nThe last time Congress balanced the budget was 1969--more than a \nquarter-century ago. Since that time, and despite the will of the \nAmerican people, Congress has been overdrawing the public checkbook \nyear after year after year.\n  Today the opportunity has come to put an end to out of control \nFederal spending--spending that has taken money from the private \nsector, the very sector that creates jobs and economic opportunity for \nall Americans, spending that gambles away our children's future--\nspending that costs us jobs in the workplace and economic security in \nthe home.\n  For too long, Congress has faced the deficit dilemma like an errant \nalcoholic or perpetual dieter, with the words: We'll start tomorrow. \nWell, Mr. President, this is tomorrow, and the budget that Senator \nDomenici and others have crafted is the cure. It is the only cure.\n  The President's budget proposals for next year offer clear evidence \nof the lack of political will to make the hard choices when it comes to \ncutting government spending. At first, his decision was not to fight \nfor further deficit reduction this year. Now, because he sees what the \nHouse and Senate have done, he's revisited the issue, offering another \nwatered-down proposal. It's kind of like the little boy who--wanting to \nbend the rules to benefit himself--holds his breath until he turns \nblue, then, realizing he can hold it no longer, tries to save face by \nrenegotiating the rules of the game.\n  This is no time for politics. The American people are crying out for \na smaller, more efficient government. They are concerned about the \ntrends that for too long have put the interests of big government \nbefore the interests of our families and job-creating private sector. \nThey are irritated by the double standard that exists between how our \nfamilies are required to balance their checkbooks and how government is \nallowed to continue spending despite its deficit accounts.\n  It is clear, Mr. President. The time has come to heed the will of the \npeople. It is our duty, not only to heed their will, but to act in \ntheir best interest. And that is what this budget is all about. It \nmakes the hard choices, eliminating some 140 programs. It consolidates \nduplication and makes Federal programs run more efficiently, more \neffectively, placing many of the existing programs back in the States \nwhere they belong. The Republican budget also allows for a $175 billion \nreserve fund to finance tax cuts when the budget reaches balance.\n  The budget holds Congress and the White House up as leaders--as \nexamples in the effort to reduce government spending. Both the \nlegislative and executive are required to reduce spending by 25 \npercent. This budget protects Social Security and Medicare--vital \nprograms to the well-being of millions of Americans, but programs that \nwould be bankrupt within a few years without the provisions offered in \nthis budget. And, Mr. President, this budget does not cut those \nprograms; spending continues to increase. What this budget does is slow \ndown the rate of increased spending to a level that will allow the \nprograms to survive! It is that simple, and do not let anyone tell you \notherwise.\n  Social Security spending will increase from $334 billion to $482 \nbillion over the next 7 years. Medicare spending will increase at an \naverage of 7.1 percent annually, rising from $178 billion this year to \n$283 billion by fiscal year 2002. This budget is the only workable \nanswer on the table. President Clinton himself has warned about how \nthese programs are going to be insolvent in the near future. Yet, he \nhas offered no viable alternative.\n  His most recent effort to counter the House and Senate budgets plan \nis little more than political twaddle. The Washington Post itself noted \nthat this counter budget which we have yet to see is ironic in that \njust 3 months ago the President ``sent Congress a budget that increases \nthe federal deficit.'' Mr. President, this is not a game. We are \ntalking about real life, real jobs, real families and communities and \nthe future of our children. Balancing the budget for our Nation is one \nof the most important steps we can take to ensure the economic \nopportunities for prosperity for our children and for our children's \nchildren.\n  As a nation--and as individuals--we are morally bound to pass \nopportunity and security to the next generation. This is what the \nbudget we are proposing today will help us do. As Thomas Paine has \nwritten, no government or group of people has the right to shackle \nsucceeding generations with its obligations. Without this budget, \nchildren born today will have a tax burden of up to 84 percent of their \nlifetime earnings; without this budget, each child who owes $18,500 in \nhis share of the national debt will find that obligation increasing to \n$23,000 in just 5 years. Without this budget, there will be no real and \nmeaningful reduction in the size and overbearing power of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  As chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee I have \noutlined a plan to reduce the Federal bureaucracy, eliminate outdated \nand wasteful government programs, and to strengthen government's \nability to better serve the taxpayers.\n  In January I kicked off a series of hearings on ``Government Reform: \nBuilding a Structure for the 21st Century.'' It is my belief that as we \nmove into the 21st century, so should our Government. Innovative \ntechnologies should allow us to cut out many layers of management \nbureaucracy, and reduce Federal employment. Programmatic changes should \nalso occur.\n  Last month I released a report that asked the GAO to examine the \ncurrent structure of the Federal Government. The GAO examined all \nbudget and government functions and missions. They did not conduct in-\ndepth analysis, but [[Page S7369]] simply illustrated the complex web \nand conflicting missions under which agencies are currently operating.\n  The GAO report confirms that our Federal behemoth must be reformed to \nmeet the needs of all taxpayers for the 21st century. I am convinced \nthat it is through a smaller, smarter government we will be able to \nserve Americans into the next century.\n  Deficit spending cannot continue. We can no longer allow waste, \ninefficiency, and overbearing government to consume the potential of \nAmerica's future. I am committed to spending restraint as we move to \nbalance the budget by the year 2002. And I ask my colleagues--and all \nAmericans--to support our efforts.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I believe that the Senate's debate on the \nbalanced budget amendment was a turning point in this session of \nCongress--perhaps a turning point in the economic affairs of our \ncountry. It was important, not for its disappointing final vote, but \nfor the issues it clarified.\n  During that debate, opponents of the balanced budget again and again \nchallenged those of us supporting it. If you really want a balanced \nbudget, propose one. One Member of this body put it like this: ``Let \nSenators get to work to show Americans we have the courage this \namendment presumes that we lack.''\n  This seemed like a good argument to many people--an argument against \neasy hypocrisy on the budget. Opponents of the balanced budget \namendment pressed it as hard and as far as they could.\n  They threw down a gauntlet before a watching Nation. This week, \nRepublicans have picked it up. And those who made that challenge have \nfled from the field--proposing nothing constructive of their own. They \nrevealed that their point in the balanced budget debate was not a \nconviction, but an alibi.\n  For the first time since the 1960's, thanks to this Republican 7-year \nbudget--offered both in the House and Senate, we can see our way clear \nto a balanced budget. After 40 years of wandering in the desert of \ndeficit spending, we are finally destined for the promised land of \nbalanced budgets.\n  There is courage in this budget--courage we have not seen for \ndecades, courage that makes this an historic moment. But, if we are \nhonest, it is courage without alternatives. The status quo may be \ncomfortable, but it is not sustainable. The road we are on may seem \nwide and easy, but it ends with a cliff, and the fall will be \ndisastrous for our economy, disastrous for our people (including our \nseniors). Disastrous for our children, and for this Nation's future.\n  The figures are familiar, but they have lost none of their power to \nshock. Our national debt currently stands at $4.8 trillion, which \ntranslates into $19,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. \nThis figure will jump to $23,000 by 2002. If we ignore our budget \ncrisis, a child born this year will pay $187,150 over their lifetime \njust in interest on the national debt.\n  The argument for immediate change--immediate restraint--is simple. It \nis one of our highest moral traditions for parents to sacrifice for the \nsake of their children. It is the depth of selfishness to call on \nchildren to sacrifice for the sake of their parents. If we continue on \nour current path, we will violate a trust between generations, and earn \nthe contempt of the future.\n  There is no doubt that we need cuts in government to balance the \nbudget. But there is one more reason as well. We need cuts in \ngovernment because government itself is too large--too large in our \neconomy, and too large in our lives. Even if the books were balanced, \nwe would still need a sober reassessment of the Federal Government's \nrole and reach.\n  This is not a matter of money alone. We require cuts in government \nbecause endless, useless, duplicative programs should not be (to use a \nfavorite term of the administration) ``Reinvented''--they should be \nterminated. Because we reject the vision of a passive Nation, where an \narrogant government sets the rules. Because we want to return, not only \nto an affordable government, but to a limited government. And those \nlimits will help unleash the unlimited potential of our economy and our \npeople.\n  Votes we make during this debate are likely to be some of the \ntoughest we ever cast. But if we are honest, most of those votes would \nnot be tough calls for most Americans. I have yet to meet a man or \nwoman from my State who believes that reducing the rate of growth in \ngovernment is anything but a minimal commitment to common sense.\n  The changes made by this budget are bold, but not radical. They are \nambitious, but not dangerous. This is a careful plan to meet a specific \nneed.\n  Under the Senate resolution, Government spending will rise from its \ncurrent level of $1.355 trillion to $1.884 trillion in 2002. This is an \nincrease of nearly 40 percent. To put this in perspective, a family \ncurrently making $45,000--if its income grew at the rate Government \nwill grow under the Republican plan--would be making $63,000 in 2002. \nSurely a family could construct a budget to meet this higher level of \nspending. The Federal Government will be required, under the Republican \nplan, to do the same.\n  There are honest disagreements about the merits and priorities of \nmany of these reductions. I expect we will have a hard-fought debate.\n  On Medicare, it was the President's own commission which concluded: \n``The Medicare Program is clearly unsustainable in its present form, we \nstrongly recommend that the crisis presented by the financial condition \nof the Medicare trust funds be urgently addressed on a comprehensive \nbasis.'' Reforming Medicare and slowing its growth is precisely what \nthe administration itself proposed. ``We feel confident,'' said Hillary \nClinton, ``that we can reduce the rate of increase in Medicare without \nundermining quality for Medicare recipients.'' Ira Magaziner added, \n``slowing the rate of growth actually benefits beneficiaries \nconsiderably because it slows the rate of growth of the premiums they \nhave to pay.''\n  Under this budget, Medicare will remain the fastest growing item in \nthe Federal budget, increasing at an annual rate of 7.1 percent. \nSpending on Medicare alone will grow from $178 billion this year to \n$283 billion in 2002--an increase of 59 percent.\n  As promised, Social Security will remain untouched. Spending will \nactually increase from the current annual total of $334 billion to $480 \nbillion in 2002. One of our central goals has been to protect the \nintegrity of the Social Security system. Social Security benefits will \nbe preserved.\n  I firmly support this budget--but I have two concerns, which will \neventually come to the center of our debate.\n  Our Government has a budget deficit which cannot be sustained. But \nthere is another deficit that concerns Americans as well--a deficit in \nthe resources of families to care for their own. A deficit we have \ncreated by increased taxation over the years, an erosion in the \npersonal exemption. Many families are in a permanent recession, \ndirectly caused by Government policies.\n  We must understand, first, that a balanced budget and family-\noriented, growth-oriented tax relief are not mutually exclusive \nproposals. They are part of the same movement in America--a movement to \nlimit our Government and empower our people. One idea implies and \nrequires the other--when we reduce public spending, we should increase \nthe resources of families to meet their own needs. That is a good \ninvestment, a sound investment. A dollar spent by families is far more \nuseful than a dollar spent by Government.\n  America can have a balanced budget and tax relief for families. No \nchoice is necessary between them. One proposal in particular makes this \nclear. An amendment that will be offered by Senator Gramm slows the \ngrowth of spending to 3 percent rather than the 3.3 percent currently \noutlined in the resolution--allowing additional funds for tax cuts. \nGiving the American people back just 1.5 percent of total budget \nspending is not too much to ask.\n  Senator Gramm's amendment embodies the provisions of the families \nfirst legislation that I introduced earlier this year with Senator Rod \nGrams. It proves that deficit reduction and tax relief can go hand-in-\nhand. We have met the challenge of those who said it could not be done. \nAdding this provision to the budget resolution will prove to families \nall across the Nation that their concerns are a central element of \nbudget reform.\n  It is time to admit that when families fail, so does our society. \nTheir financial crisis is as urgent and as important as any other \npriority in this \n\n[[Page S7370]]\n\ndebate. The Gramm amendment is a way for the Senate to prove it.\n  Much of the opposition to tax relief seems to be based on a myth--a \nmyth that tax cuts somehow cost the Government money. But Government \nproduces nothing, and has no resources of its own to spend. Tax cuts \nare not a waste of Government funds. They are simply a method to allow \nAmericans to keep their own money and care for themselves. They are a \nmethod to build working independence as an alternative to destructive \ngovernment paternalism.\n  My second concern relates to our level of defense spending. The \nClinton budget is clearly inadequate to retain our long-term readiness \nand the quality of life of our troops. On this issue we are talking \nabout the primary purpose of government--to defend our national \ninterests without placing our soldiers at needless risk. We have seen \ndisturbing evidence in the Armed Services Committee that the Clinton \nlevel of funding will leave our forces without all the tools, training \nand conditions to fulfill the roles we will ask of them.\n  Many of us are struggling to recoup at least some of this shortfall. \nSenator Thurmond will be proposing an amendment to restore a portion of \nthis funding. I hope the Senate will support it.\n  Mr. President, we have come to the beginning of the end of deficit \nspending in America. We have come to this place because there is no \nalternative. Two decades of promises, two decades of rhetoric, budget \nproposals, budget deals, tax increases, unfulfilled promises on \nspending cuts, all these have failed. This is the best argument for a \nbalanced budget amendment--defeated, for the moment, by just one vote. \nSo we turn to this effort--the only effort--the only game in town.\n  The President has abdicated his leadership on this most critical of \nall issues facing our Nation. Likewise, Democrats have offered no \nalternative of their own.\n  So we have come to a time that is unique and historic--an authentic \nmoment of decision. It is a moment to act worthy of our words and keep \nfaith with the future.\n               community development block grant program\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Budget \nCommittee's proposals with respect to the Community Block Grant [CDBG] \nprogram. The Budget Committee's report that accompanies the budget \nresolution recommends a 50 percent cut in the CDBG Program and calls \nfor targeting CDBG funds to the most needy areas. I strongly oppose \nthose. CDBG funds are a critical component of this Nation's efforts to \nrevitalize its low- and moderate-income communities. CDBG is already \nwell-targeted to distressed communities, and, more importantly, CDBG is \nwell-targeted to low-income neighborhoods within those communities that \nreceive the block grants.\n  CDBG has been a major element of our Nation's housing and community \ndevelopment strategy for over 20 years. CDBG was signed into law in \n1974 by then President Gerald Ford. It is surprising to me that the \nRepublican budget-cutters have targeted this program for inordinate \ncuts, because CDBG is an excellent example of the policy approaches \nthat my colleagues on the other side of the aisle espouse. CDBG is a \nblock grant. The program distributes its funds on a formula basis to \nState and local governments, and provides jurisdictions with \nflexibility on the use of the funds within broad national objectives. \nCDBG embodies the principle of developing responsibility and decision-\nmaking to local governments. It allows local governments to tailor \nspecific solutions to meet their specific community development needs.\n  The need for these resources is vast. Too many of our Nation's \ncommunities still suffer. Vacant housing, closed plants, and empty \nshops are the visible manifestations of neighborhoods with persistent \nunemployment, broken families, and high crime rates. We know that \nrevitalizing distressed communities requires a multi-faceted approach: \nsuccessful strategies are using community-based organizations to \ndeliver programs that simultaneously attack the physical blight while \naddressing the social service needs of the residents. With its built-in \nflexibility, CDBG allows local governments to implement comprehensive \nstrategies that may, for example, combine the rehabilitation of the \ncommercial strip, with the small business start-up loans, with the job \ntraining for local residents and the child care.\n  The Budget Committee's notion of targeting CDBG should also be \nconsidered carefully. CDBG is already well-targeted. The formula for \nthe program does a good job of distributing CDBG funds by need: 50 \npercent of the program funds go to the 20 percent most distressed \ncities based on a distress ranking created by HUD. Only 5 percent of \nthe funds go to the least distressed cities. Moreover, program data \nshows that 90 percent of the CDBG funds go to benefit low- and \nmoderate-income households consistent with the national purpose of the \nprogram.\n  In the past, proponents of targeting have proposed three types of \napproaches. Some have proposed to cut off formula grant funds to \nsmaller communities, forcing these communities to compete for funds \nthrough the state-administered program. Others have proposed to \neliminate grants to wealthier communities. And, still others would \ntighten the criteria HUD uses to measure program benefits.\n  CDBG currently provides a direct formula grant to more than 900 urban \ncounties, communities with populations above 50,000 people, and \nconsortia of smaller communities. Allowing these communities to receive \nannual, reliable formula grants is extremely important from the \nperspective of the local jurisdiction's need to plan for the use of the \nfunds and to pursue long-term strategies.\n  In some wealthier jurisdictions, CDBG rules often provide the impetus \nfor community development activities in low-income neighborhoods that \nwould not otherwise occur--especially if the communities were entirely \nresponsible for serving their poorer neighborhoods out of own-source \nrevenues. CDBG's fundamental national objective of serving low- and \nmoderate-income neighborhoods argues for a continued distribution of \nCDBG funds to all jurisdictions with these needs.\n  Finally, it would be ironic if, by calling for targeting, the Budget \nCommittee were proposing to tighten the criteria that govern how \ncommunities use the funds. Tighter targeting criteria would take away \nlocal discretion and flexibility, and, therefore, run counter to the \nphilosophy of those who promote block grants. Moreover, forcing \ngrantees to spend more of their funds to benefit poorer neighborhoods \nis not a rationale for a 50-percent cut in program funds. Indeed, the \nresource needs of our poorest communities are so vast, that if the \nprogram objective was based on only strict targeting to very poor \nneighborhoods, this would make the case for increased funding.\n  I would argue that given the limited resources, preserving the \ncurrent program targeting is desirable. States, counties, and cities \nmay find that an optimal economic development strategy would be to use \nsmall amounts of CDBG assistance to leverage private investment in \nareas with other existing features attractive to investors. Grantees \nwho have been losing population, may want to focus community \ndevelopment activities on stabilizing mixed income neighborhoods or in \npursuing strategies to lure moderate-income households into low-income \nneighborhoods. These are local decisions and appropriate community \ndevelopment strategies.\n  I oppose the Republicans proposed cut of 50 percent in CDBG Program \nfunds because CDBG is making a difference in thousands of American \ncommunities. A recent evaluation of the CDBG Program by the Urban \nInstitute concludes that ``. . . the program has made an important \ncontribution to city community development, including demonstrated \nsuccesses in achieving local neighborhood stabilization and \nrevitalization objectives. It's fair to say that in almost every city, \nneighborhoods would have been worse off had the program never existed, \nand certainly, cities would not have embarked on the housing and \nredevelopment programs that now comprise a core function of municipal \ngovernment. Further, CDBG-funded programs clearly benefit those for \nwhom the program was intended--low- and moderate-income persons and \nneighborhoods--and does so by a substantially greater degree than the \nminimum required under law.'' [[Page S7371]] \n  Mr. President, CDBG has a proven track record. Our Nation's \ncommunities continue to need our support.\n                       opposition to transit cuts\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to express my strong opposition \nto the Budget Committee's proposal to eliminate Federal mass transit \noperating subsidies.\n  The report that accompanies the Senate Budget Resolution calls for \neliminating mass transit operating subsidies. Simply stated, these cuts \nwill have significant consequences for our Nation's communities by \nleading to increased fares, reductions in services, and losses in \nridership. As a result, working people will find it more difficult and \ncostly to get to their jobs, roadways will become more congested, and \nenvironmental quality will decline.\n  Public transportation is a critical element of our economy. In 1990, \n8.8 billion American took transit trips; 7.5 million people ride public \ntransportation every weekday. Of these trips 54.4 percent are trips to \nwork. An additional 20 percent of the trips taken by transit riders are \nto get to school or to access medical services. Trips to work are \nespecially important uses of transit systems in large urban areas; use \nof bus service by elderly households to get medical attention is the \nlargest component of rides in smaller communities and rural areas.\n  A high proportion of transit riders are low-income persons or \nminorities, 27.5 percent of the transit ridership has incomes below \n$15,000 compared to 16.9 percent in the general population. African-\nAmerican and Hispanic riders as a percentage of total ridership are \nmore than two times the percentage of African-American and Hispanic \nindividuals in the general population. However, the importance of \ntransit for working people is underscored by statistics showing that 55 \npercent of the riders have incomes between $15,000 and $50,000.\n  For most transit systems, operating revenues are a combination of \nfares and federal and state money. Assuming no increases in state \ncontributions, fares would, on average, have to increase 50 percent to \nmake up for the loss of revenue. Cuts in operating subsidies will also \nhave disparate impacts on smaller communities. Federal operating \nsubsidies make up 21 percent of total operating revenues for transit \nsystems in communities below 200,000 people compared to 13 percent on \naverage for all transit systems. Fares would nearly have to double for \nthese smaller systems. This assumes no cutbacks in services and no loss \nin ridership as a result of the fare increases.\n  Many individuals faced either with increased fares or decreased \nservice will either have to give up their employment or use their cars \nto get to work. According to an article by Neal R. Pierce in the \nNational Journal on April 15 of this year, one study already puts the \ncost of traffic congestion at $100 billion a year in lost productivity. \nFewer transit riders and more drivers will exacerbate this problem. \nMore cars on the road and increased congestion will worsen air quality \nin metropolitan areas where environmental quality is already strained.\n  I realize, Mr. President, that the Budget Resolution itself does not \ncut transit operating subsidies. Decisions with respect to the \nappropriate level of funding for operating subsidies are left up to the \nAppropriations Committee. However, I felt it was important to raise a \nvoice in opposition to the recommendation in the Budget Committee's \nreport at this time and to urge my colleagues to begin to focus on the \nmany cost to our citizens that would occur if the Budget Committee's \nproposed cuts in transit operating subsidies were carried out.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/24/senate-section/article/S7351-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7371-S7385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n     SECOND SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS AND RESCISSIONS ACT, 1995--\n                           CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I submit a report of the committee of \nconference on H.R. 1158 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The report will be stated.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     1158) making emergency supplemental appropriations for \n     additional disaster assistance and making rescissions for the \n     fiscal year ending September 30, 1995, and for other \n     purposes, having met, after full and free conference, have \n     agreed to recommend and do recommend to their respective \n     Houses this report, signed by a majority of the conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of May 16, 1995.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I yield myself whatever time I require.\n  Mr. President, the conference report before us reflects the agreement \nof the two Houses on H.R. 1158, a bill making emergency supplemental \nappropriations for the additional disaster assistance and making \nrescissions for fiscal year 1995, and for other purposes.\n  This conference report is a culmination of several weeks of effort on \na number of different fronts. It represents a balance between our \nresponsibility to provide additional funding when necessary to address \nurgent national needs, on the one hand, and our responsibility to \nreduce funding for lower priority programs whenever and wherever we \ncan, on the other hand. The Senate's conferees on this measure present \nit to the Senate with a belief that it merits approval of this body, \nand I urge its adoption.\n  The bill provides a total of $7,249,503,600 in additional \nappropriations, of which $6,700,000,000, equally divided between fiscal \nyears 1995 and 1996, is for FEMA for the disaster relief programs. We \nhave fully funded the President's request in this regard, and we concur \nwith his designation of this funding as an emergency requirement.\n  We also agree with the President's request for additional emergency \nappropriations in response to the Oklahoma City tragedy and have \nprovided $183,798,000 for that purpose.\n  Finally, we are recommending $365,705,600 in nonemergency \nsupplementals for fiscal year 1995. That latter figure includes $275 \nmillion in debt relief for Jordan as requested by the President and \nendorsed by the joint leadership of the Senate.\n  In addition, the conferees reached agreement on rescissions of budget \nauthority and other funding limitations totaling $16,413,932,975, and \nthose reductions have been the focus of the debate throughout the \nconsideration of the bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table summarizing the \nsupplementals and rescissions recommended in the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                             H.R. 1158, SECOND SUPPLEMENTAL AND RESCISSION BILL CONFERENCE AGREEMENT

HATFIELD. Mr. President, I believe this is a good bill. I believe \nwe should pass it, and I believe the President of the United States \nshould sign it into law. I know that the President's administration has \nobjections to the final outcome reached by the conferees. But I hope \nthe President will realize the conferees addressed many of his most \npressing concerns, and we tried as best we could to reach an \naccommodation of his interests. The so-called striker replacement \nlanguage which the administration indicated was the sole provision--I \nemphasize the sole provision--that would prompt a Presidential veto on \nits own was dropped. That was in a letter addressed to me as the \nchairman of the committee signed by Alice Rivlin, the Director of OMB.\n  I wish to reiterate. In all of the period of this bill's \nconsideration, there was only one communication from the White House \nthat indicated there was a proviso in the bill that would elicit a veto \nresponse from the President. I think that is very important to \nunderstand. And during that 2 months of the consideration of this bill \nand for the week and a half practically that we were in conference, the \nonly other communications were verbal communications indicating \ncategories of disappointment, and that is all I can call them. There \nwere no specifics that were given to us. Account-by-account categories \nof disappointment that we had failed to reach the President's funding \nrequest levels in a number of education matters, and so forth, but they \nwere general.\n  I wish to emphasize also that there were many days in which there was \nmore than one encounter with Presidential representatives from the \nWhite House and not once did I, as the chairman of the committee, \nreceive any kind of counsel requests that would indicate we had to \ncomply with certain requirements of the White House in order to get a \nsignature. There was always the striker replacement and categories of \nwhat I call disappointment.\n  On any number of funding issues, we moved more than halfway toward \nthe administration's priorities as they were known to us.\n  I would like to also indicate, having served on this committee over a \nnumber of years, this is the first administration that has not hovered \nin the appropriations process, hovered day by day, hour by hour, making \nknown specifics, their requests, and what they considered to be the \nrequirements of a compatible bill between the Congress and the \nPresident.\n  In the past 2 days, we have seen indications that the President \nintends to veto this legislation. I suppose I should say that there \nhave been more than indications since the President himself said as \nmuch in public remarks yesterday.\n  I am very, very disappointed by that. I want very much to see this \nbill enacted. It is not the bill in all its particulars that I \npersonally would craft if I were acting alone, but it is a most \nsignificant step in the direction of a balanced budget which we all, \nthe President included, have endorsed as a common goal.\n  Our conference agreement would achieve an estimated $3 billion in \nfiscal year 1996 outlays which may be a drop in the bucket compared to \nthe enormity of the task ahead but is a good start, and get started we \nmust.\n  So I hope the President will reconsider and will sign this bill, \nassuming that we pass this report. And if he chooses to veto it, he \nwill miss a great opportunity. Other opportunities may lie ahead, and I \nhave always been ready to work with this or any other administration to \nseize those opportunities as they arise. But I hope the President, and \nhis many advisors, will remember that the legislative exercise, \nparticularly in matters of the budget, is an exercise in give and take \nand neither side can expect to have things entirely their own way.\n  I yield the floor. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to reserve \nthe remainder of my time for Senator Cochran.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the conference agreement on H.R. 1158 is the \nproduct of lengthy and difficult negotiations with the House conferees. \nThe agreement we reached was the best we could do, under the \ncircumstances.\n  The President has expressed his dissatisfaction, and has indicated \nhis intent to veto the measure when it reaches his desk. Despite the \nmisgivings of some, I want to remind the Members of the time-sensitive \nand emergency nature of some of the items included in the bill.\n  The conference agreement includes the full $6.7 billion request for \nthe Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, disaster relief efforts. \nThese funds are to be used to finance the relief costs associated with \nthe Northridge earthquake, as well as to address declared disasters \nresulting from floods and storms throughout some 40 States, including \nthe most recent, extraordinary rains and hail which occurred in \nLouisiana and some other States. These funds are needed in the next \nseveral weeks, or FEMA will run out of funds to assist in these \ndisasters.\n  With regard to the administration's request for emergency \nsupplemental appropriations in the wake of the tragedy in Oklahoma \nCity, the conferees provided approximately $250 million for anti-\nterrorism initiatives and Oklahoma City recovery efforts. This included \nsubstantial increases above the President's request for the FBI, the \nDepartment of Justice, the Secret Service, the Bureau of Alcohol, \nTobacco, and Firearms, and the Judiciary. Included in this amount is \n$67 million to meet the special needs of the General Services \nAdministration created by the April 19, 1995, terrorist bombing attack \nat the Murrah Federal Building.\n  With regard to the striker replacement issue, the Senate bill struck \na provision which was included in the House bill and which would have \nprohibited the use of any funds in any appropriations act for fiscal \nyear 1995 to [[Page S7373]] issue, administer or enforce any Executive \norder that prohibited Federal contracts with companies that hire \npermanent replacements for striking employees. The conference agreement \ndeletes that provision.\n  The conferees adopted a provision which I authored and which passed \nthe Senate by a vote of 99 yeas to 0 nays. This provision will assure \nthat the net savings in this bill, in the amount of approximately $9 \nbillion, will be applied to deficit reduction only.\n  Members will recall that under the Daschle/Dole joint leadership \namendment, which was adopted when the measure was before the Senate, \napproximately $835 million was restored for various programs which \nassist children and improve education programs. Among those funds added \nback by the joint leadership amendment were a number of Presidential \nand congressional priorities, such as AmeriCorps, WIC, summer jobs, \nschool-to-work, and Chapter 1. Despite numerous meetings and the strong \nefforts of the Senate conferees, the House conferees were adamant, and \nthe Senate was not able to sustain many of the priority addbacks in \nconference. For example, of the $35 million in the WIC restoration in \nthe Senate, the conferees agreed to restore $15 million. With regard to \nChapter 1 funding for the education of the disadvantaged, the Senate \nwas successful in preventing any funds from being rescinded. The House \nhad proposed rescinding $140.3 million and the conference agreement \nfully restored these funds. The conferees also fully restored the \nHouse-proposed rescission of $16.3 million for impact aid. Overall, for \nthe programs of the Department of Education, the House had proposed \nrescinding $1.6 billion, the Senate had restored $1.3 billion, and the \nconferees agreed to rescind approximately $800 million. In other words, \nthe conferees restored about $800 million or one-half of the education \ncuts proposed by the House. However, this still fell short, by about \n$500 million, of the Senate level of restorations in the education \narea.\n  Members may also be encouraged to know that the Senate position \nprevailed in conference with regard to the 1995 Summer Youth Program. \nThe full cut of $867 million, as proposed by the House, was restored. \nThe conferees did, however, rescind all funding for next summer's \nprogram, although this issue can be revisited during the processing of \nthe fiscal year 1996 appropriations bills.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, the conference agreement now before the \nSenate provides important disaster relief and antiterrorism funding. \nThe objectionable provision relating to striker replacements is \ndeleted. The savings in the bill of about $9 billion will be applied to \ndeficit reduction. Unfortunately, there are still substantial cuts in \npriority programs affecting children and improving education. The \nSenate conferees struggled to support the Senate positions, but, \nthrough the give-and-take of the conference process, were unable to \nsustain all Senate positions. Nevertheless, the rescissions agreed to \nin conference are more reasonable and responsible, in large part, than \nwere contained in the original version of the House bill.\n  Consequently, I urge the adoption of the conference report. If the \nconference report is adopted by the Senate and the bill is vetoed when \nit reaches the President's desk, and if the veto is sustained, it \nremains to be seen if the Congress, in subsequent legislation, will be \nable to do any better in the areas of concern to the President.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I compliment the chairman, Senator \nHatfield, for his leadership in bringing this legislation through the \nconference. I also compliment all of the Senate and House conferees. \nThey worked hard and they worked diligently to resolve the issues in \nconference. Although I would have favored other outcomes in conference, \nI must commend the House conferees, under the leadership of their \nchairman, Mr. Livingston, and their ranking minority member, Mr. Obey, \nfor their fairness and cordiality. I think it is a good agreement and I \nintend to vote for it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this bill passed the Senate on a totally \nbipartisan vote of 99-0. I voted for it, along with every one of our \nDemocratic colleagues.\n  I had hoped I could vote for this conference report, especially given \nthe hard work that the chairman, ranking member, and every other member \nof the committee put into the compromise that passed in the Senate.\n  I particularly want to thank the ranking member for his efforts in \nbringing the bill to the point that we had it prior to the time it went \nto conference. And I would like to thank him as well for his efforts in \nthe conference. Without his tireless effort, this conference report \nwould lack even more than it does of the characteristics of the \nagreement we reached with the majority leader. I know that the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia, the ranking member, did \neverything in his power to preserve that agreement.\n  Unfortunately, despite those efforts, some key changes were made in \nconference at the behest of many of our Republican colleagues.\n  As a result, I am unable to support this conference report today, and \nthe President is absolutely right to insist that these changes be \nreversed. If they are not, the President, in my view, is right to veto \nthe bill.\n  This is a different bill than the one we supported when it passed the \nSenate. The bipartisan compromise we reached with the majority leader \nmade it a bill that we could support and the President could sign. \nUnfortunately, in conference, that deal was undone. The priorities were \nchanged.\n  This is not a fight about deficit reduction. It is a fight about \npriorities. We all agree and have voted to cut over $16 billion as this \nbill proposes. We simply disagree about where the cuts ought to be \nmade.\n  The bipartisan deal we reached actually cut spending in the bill by \n$812 million. The Dole-Daschle amendment restored $835 million for \ninvestments in children and education. It paid for these investments \nwith $1.65 billion in additional cuts in lower priority programs.\n  The deal cut spending by twice as much money as it added back for \nchildren and education. Yet, the programs for which we restored $835 \nmillion were cut $685 million in conference below the amount provided \nin the Senate bill. In other words, 80 percent of the funds for \nprograms we restored were dropped in conference.\n  Those cuts, while a small part of the overall bill, betrayed the \nagreement that we had in the Senate. Worse, in my view, they undermined \nour highest priority: America's children and their families.\n  The programs shortchanged by the conference agreement include child \ncare, education, Safe and Drug Free Schools, child nutrition, and the \nPresident's national service program. As a result:\n  Fifteen thousand fewer adults will serve their communities and earn \nmoney for education as AmeriCorps members;\n  Two thousand fewer schools in 47 States will receive funds for \ncomprehensive reforms that can boost academic standards;\n  Several thousand young people would lose the opportunity to \nparticipate in apprenticeships in the School-to-Work Program;\n  Nearly 20 million students and nearly 90 percent of all schools would \nlose the benefits of antiviolence and drug prevention programs.\n  We simply cannot accept this effort to undermine a bipartisan \nagreement we made to protect our investments in children and education. \nAt the same time, we have no debate with the bulk of the provisions in \nthis bill. We accept and have voted for the same level of cuts \ncontained in it.\n  We would prefer to have a rescissions package that we can all \nsupport. Disaster funding for FEMA, the President's antiterrorism \ninitiative, and the costs arising from the Oklahoma City bombing should \nnot be held hostage because certain Members insist on cutting funds for \nchildren's programs.\n  It is not too late. There is still time for us to accommodate many of \nthese concerns, and I hope in the coming days that discussion and \nperhaps resulting negotiations can bring about a better result.\n  If this bill is vetoed, we should quickly revisit the issue and make \nthe changes that can allow us to support [[Page S7374]] and the \nPresident to sign a better bill. We are going to have to put the pieces \nback together in some form that accommodates our concerns, but also \naddresses the bipartisan concern about the need for $16 billion in \noverall rescissions. Whether it is done before or after, it must be \ndone. Many of us prefer it be done before. But if it is done after, let \nus get on with it, let us do it, let us do our job and do it right.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to say to my colleague from \nArizona, I will be relatively brief, probably within 10 minutes.\n  Mr. President, let me just thank the Senator from West Virginia for \nhis fine work. In many ways, I look to him as a teacher, especially \nwhen it comes to understanding this process and also when it comes to \nwedding integrity with politics. I thank him.\n  I rise, however, in disagreement with two Senators for whom I have a \ntremendous amount of respect, because I hold the Senator from Oregon in \nthe same high regard, in the highest regard.\n  Mr. President, while I supported many of the cuts provided for in \nthis bill, I really believe that what happened in conference committee, \nas the minority leader pointed out, really violates a basic standard of \nfairness. For example, I brought an amendment to the floor which put \nthe Senate on record that we will take no action that would increase \nhunger or homelessness among children. The distinguished Senator from \nOregon accepted that amendment as a part of this rescissions package \nthat then went to conference committee. The amendment was dropped in \nconference.\n  I understand why it was dropped, that we were simply expressing the \nsense of the Senate, and not the sense of the House of Representatives, \ntoo. But I also realize, based upon the cuts in this rescissions bill \nand based upon some of the votes that we have cast today, that it is \ngoing to be very important for me and other like-minded colleagues to \nwork hard to make sure that we, in fact, will not take such action in \nthe months to come as we move through this budget process.\n Mr. President, I think that is exactly what we are doing.\n\n  Frankly, I was never quite sure of that bill we passed in the Senate. \nI worked about 12 or 15 hours. So did other Senators, right before the \nfinal vote which must have been about 10 p.m. that night, to restore \ncertain funding for key programs.\n  I felt proud at that point, because while it was not all that I \nwanted, it moved us in the right direction. And when I got up in the \nmiddle of the night about 3 a.m. that night, I started thinking maybe I \nshould not even have voted for that package. It was a close call. We \nhave a lot of close calls, and we make our best decisions.\n  However, I felt good about some of the work many Members had done \ntogether. We restored some of the funding for WIC, Women, Infants and \nChildren Program, restored funding for child care. There was a \ncounseling program for seniors, to make sure that they did not get \nripped off, as all too often happens when it comes to some of the \nsupplemental Medicare coverage. We worked hard to restore funding in \nMedstart, safe and drug-free schools, School to Work initiatives.\n  In any case, Mr. President, I felt like we had done a good job of \nrestoring some funding for programs that are not bureaucratic, but that \nmakes a very important difference to a lot of young people in our \ncountry, especially children at risk.\n  Mr. President, now what has happened is that more than 80 percent of \nthe funds that we restored, most of that funding for the most \nvulnerable citizens in this country--children--have now been cut again. \nOf the $835 million we restored, $685 million was dropped in the final \npackage.\n  Mr. President, I believe that this rescissions packages just simply \ndoes not meet a basic standard of fairness. So many kids are in trouble \nin our country, and we have to be willing to reach out and invest in \nthem, reach out and provide support for them.\n  Not support that reinforces dependency, but support that is important \nto kids, that broadens their opportunities. Starting with making sure \nthat a woman who is expecting a child has a decent diet. Making sure \nthat a newborn infant has a decent diet. What are we doing cutting the \nWomen, Infant, and Children Program? It is an unqualified success.\n  Mr. President, there were never any cuts in the Pentagon budget. None \nof the big military contractors was asked to sacrifice at all.\n  I think this rescissions package asks the very citizens who cannot \ntighten their belts, to tighten their belts. Especially children in our \ncountry. Especially low-income children, minority children.\n  And it is for that reason I believe the President of the United \nStates is absolutely right when he says we should make some changes in \nthis bill, or he will veto it. And they don't have to be wholesale \nchanges, relative to the amount of funds in the whole bill. There are \nparts of this rescissions package I want to support. So do my \ncolleagues. But when it comes to the disproportionate cuts that affect \nthe most vulnerable citizens in this country, starting with children, \nit just simply is wrong. And the President of the United States of \nAmerica is absolutely right to draw the line. To say, ``I am not going \nto be a party to or agree to a package of cuts that basically focus on \nthose citizens who do not give the big bucks, who did not have the \npolitical power. These are just cuts based upon the path of least \npolitical resistance, and I won't be a party to them.''\n  And let me observe one more thing about the President's role in all \nthese negotiations on this bill. It has been implied on the floor here \ntoday that the administration did not provide its full views on the \nrescission bill as it moved through the conference committee process. \nThat is simply not true. I understand the administration provided its \nspecific objections to the bill at each stage of its development, \nincluding a letter to the conferees on April 28. These objections are \nprinted in the Congressional Record of May 18, 1995 on pages H5339 \nthrough H5352. I commend this letter to my colleagues' attention.\n  Mr. President, let me finally say one more thing about this bill. I \ndo not know that there is another Senator who has been more of a leader \non issues that affect people in Indian country than Senator McCain, and \nso I say this conscious of his important role.\n  In many Indian communities there is no running water, sanitation \nfacilities or indoor plumbing. Mr. President, 40 percent of the \nAmerican Indian population live in substandard housing, in substandard \nhousing conditions, in deplorable conditions.\n  Yet we are now poised to wipe out $80 million that was duly \nappropriated last Congress, which could really make a difference in \nproviding some affordable low-income housing. Mr. President, I cannot \nstand by in silence, while the Senate prepares to pass legislation \nwhich I think would have devastating effects on our first American \ncitizens.\n  Mr. President, as I review overall this rescissions package, I just \nthink that we can do better. What has come back from the conference in \nthe form of this conference report includes many of the cuts we \nrestored for nutrition programs, safe and drug free schools, safe \nhousing for children, child care, School to Work, AmeriCorps, 8 percent \nof that, has now been cut again.\n  I speak tonight to express support for the President's decision but, \nmore importantly, to support some of the most important citizens in my \nState and in this country, and that is young people. Some of the kids \nwho are having the most difficult time are the very kids we ought to be \nsupporting right now.\n  We can do much better. I think we will do much better. But only if we \nstand strong and only if the President remains firm in his commitment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I do not intend to take the full 30 \nminutes as I have under the unanimous consent agreement, and also I \nwould like to yield some of the time to the Senator from Pennsylvania. \nAlso, if necessary, I would be glad to yield some of the time to my \ncolleague from Iowa or the Senator from Mississippi in response to some \nof the concerns that I have.\n  First let me applaud the Appropriations Committee for doing an \nadmirable job and resisting earmarks and [[Page S7375]] other \nunnecessary spending, and I especially want to thank Chairman Hatfield, \nSenator Byrd, Chairman Livingston, and other members of the committee.\n  I also disagree with the President for stating that he intends to \nveto this bill. Certainly, the bill is not perfect, but it does, I \nthink, contribute to our efforts to reduce unnecessary spending.\n  There are several aspects of this bill that I have concerns about \nand, very frankly, Mr. President, when the President says there is pork \nbarrel spending in the bill, I am sorry to say that I also have reached \nthat conclusion.\n  I just want to mention several aspects of the bill, and I would be \nglad to hear a response either from the distinguished Senator from \nMississippi, from West Virginia, or the Senator from Iowa, if he so \nchooses.\n  To begin with, there are several portions of the bill where money was \nadded--added--in, and projects created without being in either \nrescission bill before it went to conference.\n  Again, Mr. President, I find this practice unacceptable. I find it a \ndeprivation of my rights as a Senator to vote and debate on \nauthorization and appropriation, and that is why I would continue to \nraise especially these items that are put in conference without \nconsultation with the rest of the Senate or even, very frankly, having \nbeen debated or discussed in the formulation of the bill on both sides.\n  One, the bill's text says:\n       Of the funds made available under this heading in Public \n     Law 103-330 and other Acts, $1,400,000 are rescinded; \n     Provided that of balances available within this account, \n     $12,678,000 shall be available for a grant to Iowa State \n     University for the construction of the National Swine \n     Research Center.\n\n  And the manager's statement says:\n\n       The House bill proposed rescinding $12,678,000 from amounts \n     appropriated for the National Swine Research Facility in \n     Ames, Iowa. The conference agreement provides that the \n     $12,678,000 for the National Swine Research Facility be \n     provided as a grant to Iowa State University to construct \n     that facility at Ames, Iowa. The conferees direct the \n     Agricultural Research Service to convey ownership to Iowa \n     State University. The conferees are aware of the interest and \n     need for important swine research; however, financial \n     constraints require difficult choices. The conferees expect \n     that any future cost of operation associated with that \n     facility be provided by sources other than the federal \n     government.\n\n  By the way, I noted that just last month the President of the United \nStates went to Iowa and expressed his strong support for spending $13 \nmillion for a 13th Federal swine research center.\n  What I do not understand here is, first, why does this action have to \nbe taken in a conference that is on a rescission bill? That is No. 1. \nNo. 2, why should it be given to Iowa State University? Are there other \nuniversities in the country that are qualified? Was there any \ncompetition? Was there any estimate made of the cost? Or did we just \ndecide that $12,678,000 should be given to build a facility at Iowa \nState University? There may be very legitimate answers to these \nquestions, but none of them have been discussed or debated by the \nentire U.S. Senate.\n  There are several more, but two especially. One concerns Clear Lake \nDevelopment Facility.\n\n       The conferees agree to include an administrative provision \n     which will enable the National Aeronautics and Space \n     Administration to exercise an option to purchase the Clear \n     Lake Development Facility, as modified for use as a Neutral \n     Buoyancy Laboratory. The facility is currently being leased \n     by NASA. It is the intention of the conferees that the cost \n     of the facility as modified by the current owner (or \n     contractor) and delivered completely modified to NASA, will \n     be no more than $35,000,000.\n\n  The bill text says:\n\n       Sec. 1008. The Administrator shall acquire, for no more \n     than $35,000,000 a certain parcel of land, together with \n     existing facilities, located on the site of the property \n     referred to as the Clear Lake Development Facility, Clear \n     Lake, Texas. The land and facilities in question comprise \n     approximately 13 acres and include a light Manufacturing \n     Facility, an Avionics Development Facility and an Assembly \n     and Test Building which shall be modified for use as a \n     Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory in support of human space flight \n     activities.\n\n  This provision, which is in the bill text, and the report language \nwas not in either the House or the Senate bills as passed by each body. \nHave there been hearings on this matter? The President's budget request \ndoes not contain request for this purchase.\n  It is my understanding that NASA must now, should this act become \nlaw, purchase this one certain parcel of land. What if there were other \nfacilities that could be bought more inexpensively?\n  Does NASA need the facilities described in the bill text?\n  Why is NASA purchasing building facilities that it is then directed \nto convert into a buoyancy lab?\n  Does NASA have any need for these additional buildings?\n  It is my understanding that McDonnel-Douglas currently owns this \nfacility. What is the fair market value of this facility? Have NASA and \nMcDonnel-Douglas been negotiating this sale?\n  Could not this purchase wait for the normal authorization and \nappropriation process to occur?\n  It seems to me if we are going to make a purchase of $35 million from \na private corporation of a piece of land it should not appear suddenly \nin the conference report of a rescission bill. As I say there may be \nperfectly legitimate reason to do so, but this is no way to legislate.\n  The next one, of course, that I find very unusual is:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law or regulation, \n     the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) \n     shall convey, without reimbursement, to the State of \n     Mississippi, all rights, title and interest of the United \n     States in the property known as the Yellow Creek Facility and \n     consisting of approximately 1,200 acres near the city of \n     Iuka, Mississippi, including all improvements thereon and \n     also including any personal property owned at NASA that is \n     currently located on-site and which the State of Mississippi \n     to facilitate the transfer: Provided, that appropriated funds \n     shall be used to effect this conveyance; Provided further, \n     that $10,000,000 in appropriated funds otherwise available to \n     NASA shall be transferred to the State of Mississippi to be \n     used in the transition of the facility; Provided further, \n     that each federal agency with prior contact to the site shall \n     remain responsible for any and all environmental remediation \n     made necessary as a result of its activities on the site * * \n     *\n\n  The Manager's statement says:\n\n       Yellow Creek Facility, Mississippi--The federal government \n     has a long history of involvement in Yellow Creek, located \n     near Iuka, Mississippi. The site, originally purchased by the \n     Tennessee Valley Authority for use as a nuclear energy plant, \n     was subsequently transferred to NASA after the nuclear energy \n     plant's cancellation. NASA intended to use Yellow Creek to \n     build the Advanced Solid Rocket Motor (ASRM) and, after its \n     cancellation, instead committed to use the site to build \n     nozzles for the Redesigned Solid Rocket Motor (RSRM). On May \n     2, 1995, due to its current budgetary constraints, NASA \n     terminated the RSRM nozzle production effort at Yellow Creek. \n     The bill language included by the conferees on the transfer \n     of the NASA Yellow Creek facility reflects the most recent \n     commitment made by the NASA Administrator to the Governor of \n     the State of Mississippi. The major investment by the State \n     of Mississippi in facilities and infrastructure to support \n     Yellow Creek, in excess of $100,000,000 is a key to factor in \n     NASA's agreement to turn the site over to the State of \n     Mississippi. The main elements of the agreement reached \n     between NASA and the State of Mississippi, which the \n     conferees expect to be adhered to by the two parties, are as \n     follows; The Yellow Creek facility will be turned over to the \n     appropriate agency of the State of Mississippi within 30 days \n     of enactment of this Act. All of the NASA property on Yellow \n     Creek which the State of Mississippi requires to facilitate \n     the transfer of the site transfers within the site to the \n     State, subject to the following exceptions * * *\n\n  And those exceptions are interesting, to say the least. But, also, \nand the final paragraph is also interesting:\n\n       Within thirty days of enactment of this Act, $10,000,000 \n     will be transferred from NASA to the appropriate agency of \n     the State of Mississippi. The site's environmental permits \n     will become the property of the State of Mississippi. NASA \n     will provide all necessary assistance in transferring these \n     permits to the State of Mississippi.\n  Again, Mr. President, this is a rescission bill. This provision was \ncontained in neither the House nor the Senate bills nor accompanying \nreports. Again, this language is not in the President's budget.\n  Why are we forcing NASA to buy one parcel of land while we are \nforcing it to give another away at no cost? If NASA has been working \nwith the State of Mississippi on this matter, why was this provision \nnot included in the rescission bill when that measure was before the \nSenate? Is there some emergency, some reason why we are transferring \nthis land to the State of Mississippi in this bill without waiting for \n[[Page S7376]] NASA reauthorization and appropriations bills?\n  Mr. President, there are numerous other provisions in this bill which \nI will make part of the Record as part of my statement. But here is the \nproblem again.\n  The problem is that we have authorization bills on which many issues \nare silent, like these two I just went over. Then we have an \nappropriations process here on the floor of the Senate where we are \nsilent on these two major projects totaling well over $70 million here.\n  And then out of the conference into the report, where no Member of \nthis body can make any changes to it, appear these appropriations for \nas much as $50 or $60 million in this case. It deprives the Members of \nthe Senate of the ability to debate and discuss issues and the \nexpenditure of their taxpayers' dollars.\n  Especially egregious is when it is on a rescission bill. This is not \na spending bill. This is a rescission bill. So instead of cutting \nfunding we are adding money.\n  Mr. President, as I say, there are probably good and valid and \nlegitimate reasons for these areas and others I will highlight in the \nformal part of my statement. But I can assure you, there is no argument \nthat can be made that this process is correct because it does not allow \nthe Members of this body, who were duly elected but were not members of \nthe conference on appropriations with the other body to have any input \nwhatsoever into these decisions. We deserve that. And it is our \nobligation, since it is our taxpayers' dollars being expended, to be a \npart of that.\n  I hope this process will stop. I hope this process will stop. We are \nabout to begin the appropriations cycle of some 12 or 13 bills.\n  I intend, I say to my colleagues, to continue to do everything in my \npower to stop this practice and return to the practices that we should \nfollow in the U.S. Senate, which are hearings, authorization, \nappropriation, conference, and final signing of the bill by the \nPresident of the United States.\n  Mr. President, I ask how much time I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 18 minutes and 5 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will yield at the appropriate time, when \nhe is ready, 10 minutes to the Senator from Pennsylvania, of my time \nremaining.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank very much the Senator from \nArizona for yielding. I appreciate his comments. It is gratifying to \nknow the Senator, not only on this bill but many other bills that come \nthrough here, is dogged in his determination to ferret out \ninappropriate things that are put in bills. I appreciate the Senator's \ncomments on that and congratulate him on his vigor.\n  I wanted to first congratulate the Senator from Oregon, Senator \nHatfield, and the Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, on plain, \ntrue leadership in this bill through the process. They went into the \nconference and they stood by the Senate positions as best they could. \nThey negotiated, I think, a very good bill, a bill that strikes a good \nbalance in a variety of different programs. They provided leadership. \nThey provided leadership. They stood up, fought for what they believed \nin, and they were able to succeed in coming out with a compromise bill \nthat I think will pass overwhelmingly on the Senate floor.\n  I am not surprised by the comments of Senator Hatfield. Senator \nHatfield said that in his entire tenure as a Member of the \nAppropriations Committee--which I am sure spans well over 20 years--\nthat this was the first conference committee that he has been to where \nthe administration had no input, had no one there, was providing no \nguidance, no leadership, no direction as to where to take this \nconference report and how to reduce the budget deficit. Absent, without \nleadership, AWOL again this time on a $16 billion rescissions bill. It \nwas not there.\n  Now, after Senator Hatfield, Senator Byrd, and Chairman Livingston \nover in the House worked so hard, put together and crafted a compromise \nthat they could all live with, the President comes in and waves a white \nflag and, says, ``Oh, no. I do not like this. I know this is bad. Of \nthe $16 billion there, is almost $1 billion I do not like. I cannot \nsign it. I wish you would have told me.''\n  That is not leadership. That is not taking a very serious problem, \nand the problem is the budget deficit, and doing something proactive \ncoming into those conferences and providing direction.\n  So now we see the veto threat coming out, that they are going to veto \nthis bill that passed the House with bipartisan support, and passed the \nSenate with partisan support, and will now go to the President to be \nburied. It is something that did not have to happen.\n  If there is a sad thing about what is going to occur in the next few \ndays, it is it did not have to be this way. The reason it is this way \nis because the President refused to lead. But this should come as no \nshock to anyone in this Chamber.\n  One of the reasons I am here tonight--and I have been for the past \nseveral nights--is to talk about the President's lack of leadership \nwith respect to the budget resolution. Now, 6 days ago, as I add the \nnumber 7 to the chart--7 days ago Senator Domenici's Budget Committee \npresented a balanced budget resolution on the floor of the Senate. It \nhas been 7 days with no proposal to balance the budget from President \nClinton now, a week the President has sat on the sidelines. Yesterday \nwas day 6, a potentially exciting day because there were reports that \nthe President was actually going to come forward with a budget, that he \nsaid in some radio interview with National Public Radio in New \nHampshire that he was really going to work on his 10-year budget plan, \nthat he thought we could get to a balanced budget in 10 years, and he \nwas going to offer something.\n  But, again, not with a great amount of surprise, the President came \nout today, and according to the Washington Post:\n\n       Clinton sidestepped questions about whether he was still \n     committed to the time frame he outlined in a weekend radio \n     interview with four New Hampshire reporters * * *\n\n  He said, you know, I think all Americans should be committed to a \nbalanced budget.\n  That was his new comment that, you know, we should all be for this \nbut, of course, he is not going to put anything forward. In fact, \nMichael McCurry, his spokesperson, his press secretary, said:\n\n       Right now, to come forward [with an alternative budget] \n     would be an idle exercise.\n\n  Now I understand. Leadership, according to the White House, is an \n``idle exercise,'' going to conference committee meetings to discuss \nreducing the budget deficit by $16 billion is an ``idle exercise'' that \nis not worth the President's time. Why should he get involved in \nanything such as cutting money or the balanced budget? This is an \n``idle exercise.'' This, for a President who weeks ago had a debate \nwith himself as to whether he was relevant to the process here in \nWashington.\n  Mr. President, you are answering your own questions by your actions.\n  So while he says, ``Well, I am not now putting together a budget \nbecause it would be an idle exercise to do so,'' we find out from \nsenior spokespeople at the White House that the Office of Management \nand Budget is working on a budget. I do not know whether they are not \ntelling the President they are working on a budget or the President \ndoes not want anybody to know he is working on a budget, or whether, \nyou know, someone is just leaking it out that they are working on a \nbudget so we think they are working on a budget. These are all very \ninteresting things that could be going on.\n  But the bottom line is that it is 7 days and no budget, no plan; 7 \ndays, no leadership, no direction, no ideas, walking away from one of \nthe greatest and most important moments in the last several decades, \nwhich is balancing this budget.\n  I am not surprised, but I am disappointed. As I said before, I am \ngoing to come here every day, every day between now and October 1, and \nchallenge the President to stop it; please, please stop it. Please stop \nme from coming here and having to put this chart up, having to print up \nmore numbers. These get expensive. I do not want to print up more \nnumbers.\n  So I have to keep adding numbers to the chart here about how many \ndays it [[Page S7377]] has been since you have decided not to \nparticipate in the process.\n  Today was an interesting day. It was an interesting day today. We had \nseveral Democratic Senators come forward with their balanced budget \nproposals. After, I am sure, imploring the Chief Executive Officer of \nthe country to propose his budget that balances the budget, they \ndecided to venture out on their own and introduce the budget an hour \nbefore the end of debate on the balanced budget resolution.\n  We had 50 hours of debate on the budget, and 1 hour before the \ntermination of debate, several Democratic Senators rushed to the floor \nwith their idea sketched out--I do not know whether it was on the back \nof the envelope or the front of the envelope--but it was sketched out \nin very vague terms about how they are going to get there. We are going \nto have some tax increases. We knew that. I mean, that was a given. The \nquestion was, how much? They said $230 billion. The Senator from New \nHampshire was suggesting maybe it is more like $400 billion, about a \nthird of what they want to cut the deficit by.\n  They want to do it over 9 years instead of 7. They want to use some \nof our cuts. They want to use some of our savings given by the \nCongressional Budget Office by balancing the budget, none of which has \nbeen scored by the Congressional Budget Office. They just want to throw \nthis together with no specifics, no plan on how to get the $150 billion \nin cuts they want to get out of Medicare, no plan on how they are going \nto restructure any of the programs that they want to cut in domestic \ndiscretionary or defense spending --no specifics, just some numbers, \njust some tax increases, and just a lot of rhetoric about, you know, we \nare for this too, we want to be relevant, too.\n  After sounding somewhat critical, I congratulate them. I congratulate \nthem for at least stepping from behind the shadows and moving forward, \nand saying, ``We believe in a balanced budget, too. Here is how we are \ngoing to get there. We don't believe we should fundamentally \nrestructure Government as much as you think we need to do. We need to \nincrease taxes some more because the American public does not pay \nenough to run this place. So we need to tax them some more.''\n  That is fine, if they believe that. If that is what you believe, then \ncome here and defend it.\n  I congratulate them for having the courage to come up and defend it. \nI am hoping that when this debate is all--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 10 minutes allotted to the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold], is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I rise to thank my good friend, the senior Senator from \nArizona, for his comments regarding various provisions included in the \nconference report of the rescissions bill.\n  Let me first reiterate how pleased I am to be working with the \nSenator on a variety of congressional and budget related reforms. He \nand I share a number of common concerns regarding the impact of special \ninterests on elected Government, and I was delighted when the Senator \nfrom Arizona approached me before this session began to see if I would \nbe interested in working with him on some of those issues.\n  That kind of bipartisan spirit is essential if we are to build \nanything truly meaningful and lasting in the 104th Congress.\n  Without that spirit, all that can be done is to advance an agenda \nthat is hollow and transitory. Despite the understandably partisan tone \nof the statements often made in the Chamber, I know there are people of \ngood will on both sides of the aisle who are willing to try to tackle \nproblems together.\n  I have often mentioned the Kerrey-Brown deficit reduction package \nthat was developed in the last Congress as an example of that kind of \neffort. And I was happy to be a part of that bipartisan effort.\n  I think the effort the Senator from Arizona and I are making is \nanother such example of bipartisan work.\n  There has been some progress made already this year. I was delighted \nthat a measure to clean up the emergency appropriations process, which \nthe Senator from Arizona and I sponsored, was included in the line-item \nveto measure that passed the Senate, and I very much hope that the \nline-item veto conferees will retain that emergency spending provision. \nAnd there will be others as well.\n  Mr. President, one of the ongoing efforts that the Senator from \nArizona and I agreed on was to undertake a look at the earmarked items \nin appropriations bills. The Senator from Arizona has a long history of \nthis already, of certainly some discomfort to some, but I believe it \nhas had an impact. Just the knowledge that the Senator from Arizona \nwill be asking questions about these kinds of appropriations can be a \ndeterrent. I certainly hope this is the case. And I also hope that by \njoining him in this effort on a regular basis, we can discourage even \nmore.\n  So, Mr. President, that brings me to the rescissions bill. It is \nironic that legislation intended to take a first step toward a balanced \nbudget has become again a vehicle for a number of provisions that I \nthink move us in the wrong direction. Not only does the conference \nreport specify new spending, for which there is no compelling or \nimmediate need, it also contains provisions which restore funding \nbeyond the level which passed either House.\n  My friend from Arizona mentioned some of these items. We have all \nread about the various earmarked transportation projects, courthouses \nand other building projects that somehow continue to endure. They are \nkind of like cockroaches; no matter what we throw at them or how many \nwe kill, some of them still survive.\n  Mr. President, there are other programs as well: $12.7 million for a \nNational Swine Research Center. It is my understanding that, as I \nbelieve my friend pointed out, there are already a dozen such centers. \nDo we really need a 13th swine research center? And if we do need a \n13th swine research center, should there not be a competitive process \nto justify where the thing is sited?\n  Another one: $1 million allocated to the Advanced Lead-Acid Battery \nConsortium.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding that one company is the \nprincipal beneficiary of this research funding. This has all the \ntrappings once again of corporate welfare. I question whether we should \nbe dedicating scarce revenues to the kind of applied research for which \nthe private benefits clearly exceed the public benefits.\n  And then, Mr. President, we find the following provision in section \n1008 of the bill. It says:\n\n       The Administrator shall acquire, for no more than $35 \n     million, a certain parcel of land, together with existing \n     facilities, located on the site of the property referred to \n     as the Clear Lake Development Facility, Clear Lake, TX.\n\n  The section goes on to explain that NASA is being directed to buy \nthis property to use as a neutral buoyancy laboratory.\n  One might well ask, Mr. President, what this provision is doing in a \nbill, the main focus of which is to reduce the deficit.\n  But, Mr. President, just when you think you have seen it all, you \nread the very next provision, section 1009, which reads as follows:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law or regulation.* \n     * * NASA shall convey, without reimbursement, to the State of \n     Mississippi, all rights, title and interest of the United \n     States in the property known as the Yellow Creek Facility and \n     consisting of approximately 1,200 acres near the city of \n     Iuka, MS.\n\n  Mr. President, if you can believe it, it gets worse. Further down \nsection 1009 we find the following.\n\n       Provided further that $10 million in appropriated funds \n     otherwise available to NASA shall be transferred to the State \n     of Mississippi to be used in the transition of the facility.\n\n  Not only are we giving away this facility, Mr. President, the Federal \nGovernment is actually throwing in $10 million to sweeten the deal in \nsomething we call a rescissions bill.\n  Mr. President, in two consecutive sessions of the so-called \nrescissions bill, NASA is required to pay $35 million for 13 acres of \nland and facilities in Texas to establish a neutral buoyancy lab and to \ngive away 1,200 acres of land and facilities in Mississippi along with \na bonus of $10 million.\n  My back-of-the-envelop arithmetic suggests that Federal taxpayers \nnetted out losing $45 million and 1,187 acres from just those two \nsections alone. [[Page S7378]] \n  I am sure someone might be able to provide us with some reasons NASA \nis being required to make these deals, but nothing in this legislation \nbefore us suggests anything the least bit urgent about them.\n  Mr. President, should we be asked to swallow these land deals as part \nof legislation intended to give us a good jump-start at deficit \nreduction and to provide emergency funding for some urgent problems? I \ndo not think we should. If there are sound reasons to make these land \ndeals, then those who advocate these arrangements should be willing to \nsubject them to the scrutiny of the regular appropriations or \nauthorization bills. These provisions argue strongly for the reform \nthat the Senator from Arizona and I have introduced and that was \nincluded in the line-item veto measure we passed.\n  Mr. President, by establishing a new point of order against adding \nthese kinds of nonemergency measures to emergency appropriations bills \nand by prohibiting OMB from adjusting spending caps or otherwise \nrelaxing the sequester process for emergency appropriations bills that \ninclude these extraneous measures, our proposal would limit the ability \nof some to circumvent the normal legislative process as I suggest may \nhave occurred here. These provisions also argue for the line-item veto \nmeasure itself, and I very much hope we can make progress in moving \nthat issue along as well.\n  I just want to reiterate any thanks to the Senator from Arizona and \nhis staff for their continuing vigilance on these issues. There are \ntangible costs to that work, as anyone reviewing the list of projects \nthat has been rescinded can divine, but in the end, Mr. President, the \nonly way we will end these abuses is for Members to follow the lead of \nthe Senator from Arizona and reject these special provisions even when \nit means rejecting a project for one's own State.\n  So I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Iowa be allowed 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Senator from Arizona for the 10 minutes.\n  Before I speak to the point that the Senator from Arizona brought up \nabout the national swine center, I want to compliment everyone who \nworked on this rescissions bill which rescinds $16 billion of \nexpenditures, moving us more quickly to a balanced budget than waiting \nuntil the beginning of fiscal year 1996 which starts October 1 of this \nyear.\n  This gives us a 6-month head start on the efforts toward balancing \nthe budget. Everybody, Republican and Democrat, involved in this \nprocess to bring forth this sort of change in the expenditures for our \npresent fiscal year is to be complimented and to be considered fiscally \nresponsible. I applaud them for that.\n  At the same time, I think it is irresponsible for the President to \ntake the position he has when there was so much of an effort in the \nSenate to accommodate the White House in the first instance of the \npassage of this legislation.\n  I hope the President will change his mind, sign the bill and help \nmove us on to a balanced budget much quicker than would otherwise \nhappen.\n  My good friend from Arizona has raised a lot of issues, on this bill \nand on other bills, that raise the question about the wise expenditure \nof public moneys. I compliment him for doing that. He is a responsible \nwatchdog of the taxpayers' money. There are not enough of those in this \ntown.\n  One of the issues that he raised previously was on the National Swine \nResearch Center located at Iowa State University, one of the major \nuniversities in my State. I want to speak to that point, because I \nthink he raised some legitimate questions about it.\n  The first question raised was whether or not it was a conferenceable \nitem--was it in one of the bills before it went to conference or was it \namended in conference?\n  It was a conferenceable item. Under the rules of the House and Senate \nconference, it was something that could have legitimately been dealt \nwith in the conference. It was not something that was added after the \nfact by the conferees in an effort to sneak something through.\n  The next question that was legitimately raised was why a swine \nresearch center and why at Iowa State University?\n  I suppose the latter one is the easiest to answer. It is there \nbecause our State is the leading pork producing State in the Nation. \nAnd some of the best scientists in animal husbandry are there, some of \nthe best researchers. So you put a facility where outstanding people \nare located to do the research when you have a national goal to do \nresearch in a particular area.\n  The whole issue of swine research, the whole issue of agricultural \nresearch, is not questioned any more as a good public policy of our \nGovernment. It is something that has been promoted by the Federal \nGovernment going back to 1862. More specifically, in this century, a \nlot of legislation was passed that has the Federal Government, through \nthe Agriculture Research Service, very much involved in agricultural \nresearch; not to benefit just the farmers, but to make sure that there \nis an adequate supply of food and high-quality food available for \nconsumers.\n  Why do we have a National Swine Research Center? Well, there was \ncareful consideration given to the formation of this. A long time ago, \na national peer panel recommended the establishment of a Swine Research \nCenter. They did it because the needed research was not being conducted \nin any other State or Federal laboratory nationwide. This peer review \npanel made very definite that this program of research not be \nduplicative and they made a determination it would not be duplicative. \nThey did that through defining the mission, the mission of the research \ncenter. That mission is to develop technology to ensure that the U.S. \npork industry operates as an environmentally sound and efficient animal \nproduction system.\n  In that particular statement from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, \nwe ought to put emphasis upon environmentally sound as a lead purpose \nof the swine research center in Iowa as opposed to the other swine \nresearch centers that the Senator from Arizona mentioned in the \nquestion about why, when you have some, do you need others. We need a \nnational swine research center because we have not had adequate \nresearch in that area and we need it.\n  The emphasis, of course, is on the environmental aspects. But also \nlike other research centers, the environmental research and \ndeterminations have something to do with the efficiency of the animal \nproduction system.\n  The U.S. Department of Agriculture, through their directives on this \nparticular National Swine Research Center, says that it will help \nmaintain and increase the competitiveness and efficiency of U.S. pork \nproduction and marketing. These are national goals, as well. \nAgriculture is one of those areas of production in America where we are \nmost efficient and where we are without a doubt competitive with any \nother country in the world.\n  The exports of our agriculture products give us a very positive, \nfavorable trade balance in agriculture. Without that positive favorable \nbalance in agriculture and in food products we would have yet a bigger \ndeficit in our overall trade. So, a research center that is going to \ncontinue to keep us competitive has a very good overall economic \nbenefit to our entire Nation, as we try to keep our trade deficit down.\n  Now this compromise before us allows the laboratory of the national \nswine center to be built at a cost of $12,678,000 by the Agriculture \nResearch Service.\n  Mr. President, we have appropriated these funds in other fiscal years \nfor this project, in fiscal year 1992, $1.8 million; fiscal year 1993, \n$1.5 million; fiscal year 1994, $4.5 million; and fiscal year 1995, \n$6.2 million.\n  Twelve million dollars completes the project. I am sure that the \nSenator from Arizona would not suggest that we should throw the work \nalready done down the drain by not completing this project.\n  Now, the legitimate question is asked by the Senator from Arizona \nabout why is this project given to Iowa State University. \n[[Page S7379]] \n  The pork industry of the United States of America, probably the \nresearchers involved, and Iowa State University, would rather not have \nthis given to Iowa State University. Traditionally, this would continue \nto be a Federal facility with the operation costs paid, because it is a \nnational research center in cooperation with the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture, fulfilling a national service.\n  A lot of those operational costs over the ensuing years would be paid \nfor by the Federal taxpayers. But, it is one of the compromises, in \norder to go ahead and get this facility finished, that Iowa State \nUniversity would assume the operational costs of the laboratory and any \nadditional construction costs above that figure. The Agricultural \nResearch Service, then, would turn the completed structure over to Iowa \nState University.\n  Where continually there would be an ongoing cost every year for \ndecades into the future for the operation of this, the answer to the \nSenator from Arizona is it was given to Iowa State University so that \nthe Federal taxpayers would not be saddled with the operation of it \ninto the future.\n  Iowa State University, the National Pork Producers and even the \nAgriculture Research Service will work to make sure that there is no \nduplication of research other places, that there are efficiencies made \nelsewhere at the other facilities for swine research, and to make sure \nthat we consolidate Federal swine research activities so there is no \nduplication.\n  This was a demand from the chairman, particularly on the House side, \nfor us to meet, to satisfy the leaders on the other side of the Hill \nthat this would not be an ongoing cost and this would be the end of it \nif they completed it. This was all a general agreement to get this \nactivity completed. So it is completed.\n  I hope that I have satisfied the Senator from Arizona--without trying \nto discourage him from asking legitimate questions, which he has--that \nthe completion of this is necessary so that the $12 million is not \nwasted and, in addition, that this will not be an ongoing cost to the \ntaxpayers of the Federal Government. That it was only given in \nownership to Iowa State University, not just because the Federal \nGovernment just gives away things willy-nilly, but because Iowa State \nUniversity is accepting the cost of the operation not for only the \nshort term but long term.\n  I hope that my colleagues see that as a good deal for the taxpayers, \na good deal for agricultural research, a good deal for the pork \nindustry, a good deal for our balance of trade, a good deal to assure \nan adequate supply of quality food to the consumers of America. All of \nthese are good public policy; all of these have been followed in a lot \nof areas of agricultural research in the past, maybe even a lot of \nresearch generally that our National Government conducts.\n  So I ask my colleagues to consider these points of view and let this \nfacility be completed once and for all.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Iowa for \nhis very lucid and informative explanation. I regret we have to go \nthrough this kind of a drill. I think we could probably avoid it in the \nfuture under different circumstances of authorization and \nappropriations process.\n  I also thank my friend and colleague from Wisconsin, Senator \nFeingold, for all he has done and all he will continue to do. I \nappreciate the opportunity of working with him on a bipartisan basis.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I regret that my friend, the senator from \nArizona, has chosen once again to criticize funding for the National \nSwine Research Center. He attacks this conference report because it \ndoes not rescind funding for the center provided in previous measures.\n  Let us be clear that the rescissions bill passed by the Senate did \nnot include any provisions pertaining to the National Swine Research \nCenter. It was only in the measure passed by the House of \nRepresentatives that funding for the center would have been rescinded. \nSo if the senator from Arizona is criticizing the Senate conferees for \nsupporting the Senate's position and not receding to the House on this \npoint, I believe his criticism is misplaced.\n  We debated funding for the center on the floor of the Senate earlier \nthis year. My colleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley, and I discussed \nthe development of plans for the center, the need for the research that \nit will conduct and the justification for construction of this new \nfacility.\n  The Agricultural Research Service has stated that the research at the \nSwine Research Center will not be duplicative of other research. There \nis no other facility now equipped to carry out the research that is \nplanned for the Center. That research will emphasize odor and water \nquality research. The goal is to help the pork industry improve its \ncompetitiveness and efficiency in an environmentally sound manner.\n  This Center was peer reviewed. It has been identified by ARS as a \nhigh priority. It is a product of joint planning by ARS, the National \nPork Producers Council, the Iowa Pork Producers and Iowa State \nUniversity.\n  Because agricultural research is so important to our Nation, and \nbecause pork production is such a large part of our Nation's \nagricultural economy, I believe there is ample justification for using \nFederal funds to construct the National Swine Research Center and to \nsupport the operation of the center and its research in future years.\n  But the House conferees on this bill said that their leadership was \nadamant about not letting the plans for the Swine Research Center go \nforward as originally developed. I strongly disagreed with the position \nof the House conferees, and I worked with them to improve report \nlanguage they had first recommended that would have been quite damaging \nto the future of the center. In the end the House conferees agreed that \nthe $12.678 million which had been appropriated would not be rescinded, \nbut they insisted on report language specifying that once the facility \nat Ames, Iowa is constructed it would be conveyed to Iowa State \nUniversity and further stating that future costs of operating that \nfacility at Ames are expected to be provided by sources other than the \nFederal Government. The language also states that Iowa State University \nshould work in collaboration with the pork industry to cover research \nand additional construction costs associated with the center or to \noffset those costs through the consolidation of Federal research \nactivities. Again, I strongly disagree with the report language \ninsisted upon by the House conferees, but it was the best that could be \nobtained under the circumstances.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I believe I have about 7 minutes \nremaining. I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Rhode \nIsland who has a statement to make.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nArizona for letting me have some time at the final part of this \nevening.\n  It is with some reluctance that I will vote against the conference \nreport on H.R. 1158, the pending rescissions bill. The report has much \nto commend it. It would provide needed disaster relief to Americans \nacross the country who are still recovering from a series of tragedies, \nof course the principal one of those is in Oklahoma City.\n  In addition, the report would provide for more than $16 billion in \nsavings to the Federal Treasury. Although I cannot say I agree with \neach of the places where the report would make these cuts, nonetheless \nit represents a really solid first step toward reversing the pattern of \nunconstrained Federal spending.\n  Mr. President, notwithstanding the benefits of the funding provisions \nof the report, it is the general policy provisions that are the ones \nthat have led me to conclude I cannot support the report. As those who \nhave read the report carefully will note, it is replete with measures \nthat would override or revise substantially environmental laws in a \nvariety of contexts. I am especially concerned about those relating to \nFederal timber sales and the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, \nsometimes referred to as NEPA.\n  My concern with the bill's timber sales provisions have been \nevidenced ever since I voted against a motion to table a substitute \namendment during [[Page S7380]] the floor debate on the Senate version \nof the bill. I recognize the need to address expeditiously risks \narising from the poor health of certain public forests.\n  However, this provides no ground for throwing environmental \nconsiderations overboard. The conference report has only added to my \nconcerns.\n  Why do I say this? First, the report retains so-called ``sufficiency \nlanguage,'' with respect to salvage and option 9 timber sales. This \nlanguage provides that an agency's compliance with certain minimal \nobligations in the carrying out of a sale is ``deemed sufficient'' to \nsatisfy the requirements of all applicable statutes.\n  This language would disallow any meaningful site-specific challenge \nto a sale under the environmental laws, especially given that the \nreport would also would eliminate administrative appeals of timber sale \ndecisions.\n  In addition, Mr. President, another provision in the report expressly \nwould revise the agencies' analytical obligations with respect to \nsalvage timber sales. The provision in question would make the duty to \nconsider environmental effects of salvage timber sales solely \ndiscretionary. I think this is an important point, Mr. President. Under \nthe revisions that have been made in connection with this rescissions \nbill, the agency would make the duty to consider environmental effects \nof salvage timber sales to become discretionary; in other words, you do \nnot have to do it.\n  This approach, I believe, is shortsighted and unwise. Conducting \nenvironmental analysis can be especially important in carrying out \nsalvage sales because candidate sites usually have experienced \nsignificant disturbances. A salvage sale has arisen because there has \nbeen significant disturbances in the area--a tremendous hurricane or \ntornado, earthquake, or something as formidable as an explosion, the \nvolcanic action of a mountain, as took place in the State of Washington \nabout 15 to 18 years ago.\n  Such sites, therefore, are often especially sensitive to further \ndisturbance caused by timber harvests.\n  Is this me talking or some expert? Well, let us see what the dean of \nthe Duke University School of Environment, Norman Christensen, said in \nMarch 23 of 1995, just 2 months ago, in a letter to Appropriations \nCommittee Chairman Hatfield. He explained the possible serious adverse \neffects of poorly carried out salvage sales.\n  This is what he said:\n\n       Improperly used, however, [salvage and thinning] can cause \n     serious, long-lasting damage to resources including soils, \n     streams, wildlife, fish and residual trees. The timing and \n     manner of their application requires at least as careful \n     analysis and monitoring as other types of logging.\n\n  In other words, there is not something unique about salvage sales, \nwinds fall and timber; you can just go in and take it away.\n\n       Done poorly, the productivity and biological integrity of \n     public forests may be permanently compromised.\n\n  And finally, Mr. President, environmental effects of sales \nencompassed by the report could be substantial, particularly in light \nof two factors: No. 1, the conferees extended by a full year the period \nduring which sufficiency language would apply. This extension would \nnearly double the sufficiency period that was in the Senate bill.\n  We passed a bill at a certain length of time. They doubled it in the \nconference, and this could translate into an additional 2 billion to 4 \nbillion board feet of timber being harvested with minimal environmental \nanalysis. This is not a case of rushing in and picking up some timber \nthat has just fallen down in a certain area. This is big activity.\n  No. 2, while numerical timber volume targets have been removed from \nthe bill, the managers' statement includes a so-called ``volume \nrequirements.'' This is a classic example of trying to have it both \nways. The managers' volume numbers exceed by far what agriculture \nSecretary Glickman has said the Forest Service can achieve while \nmeeting substantial requirements of applicable law.\n  Mr. President, I have concerns over what is done to the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act, so-called NEPA. But, Mr. President, in this \nlate period in the evening, I am not going to debate the merits of the \nreport's NEPA provisions as much as to highlight that there has not \nbeen real debate on them at all. These actions take place in the \nAppropriations Committee, and I do not think the Congress should be in \nthe routine of using appropriations bills to bypass or bar compliance \nwith environmental statutes in ways that will have significant \nenvironmental effects. This is an improper practice that must cease. \nFor me, that means now with this report.\n  I want to thank the Chair and yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the conference \nreport to accompany H.R. 1158, the Emergency Supplemental and \nRescission Act. I am proud of the fact that my colleagues and I on the \nHouse and Senate Appropriations Committees have cut more spending in \nthis bill than in any rescission bill in the history of this country. I \nwant to compliment Chairman Hatfield and Chairman Livingston for their \nleadership on this legislation.\n  The bill cuts $16.4 billion in spending and provides supplemental \nfunding for disaster relief and increased anti-terrorism funding to \nrespond to the Oklahoma City bombing. I, for one, am outraged that \nPresident Clinton announced last Wednesday that he intends to veto this \nrescission bill. The President should sign the rescission bill and join \nour efforts to put the Federal Government on a budget like everybody \nelse. When President Clinton vetoes a $16 billion cut in Government \nspending to protect a few pet programs, he is putting the interests of \nhis administration and his part in front of the interests of the people \nof America.\n  I would like to comment briefly on the supplemental funding provided \nfor the FBI and the Justice Department in the Commerce, Justice, State \nsection of the bill. The President requested $71 million for the \nJustice Department's response to the Oklahoma City bombing and to \nenhance Federal law enforcement's ability to respond to domestic \nterrorism. The conferees were concerned that, in many cases, the \nPresident's request failed to provide the true, full-year cost of \nhiring additional FBI and other Justice Department personnel, since the \nPresident assumes that many of these new personnel will be hired late \nin the fiscal year.\n  As a strong supporter of federal law enforcement, I wanted to ensure \nthat the FBI and the Justice Department have the resources they need to \nprosecute and convict the violent criminals who committed the Oklahoma \nCity bombing. I also wanted to begin the process of strengthening \nFederal law enforcement so that we can do everything possible to \nprevent anything like this terrible crime from ever happening again.\n  To accomplish these goals, the conferees have provided $113 million \nfor the Justice Department, including $90 million for the FBI, and an \nadditional $16.6 million for increased security at Federal courthouses. \nThese amounts are within the parameters set for this bill by the full \ncommittee chairmen, and I intend to provide additional resources for \nthese purposes when I present my recommendations for the fiscal year \n1996 Justice Department appropriation.\n  I am dismayed that, in many cases, the additional resources requested \nby the President to respond to the Oklahoma City bombing are for items \npreviously requested by the FBI and the Justice Department in their \nregular budget requests, but previously rejected by the Clinton White \nHouse.\n  Under the Clinton administration, the FBI endured a nearly 2-year \nhiring freeze, while normal attrition reduced the number of special \nagents by 765. The FBI crime laboratory has been forced to curtail the \nservices it provides State and local law enforcement agencies due to \nbudget constraints. As chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee that \nfunds the FBI, I am committed to reversing this trend, and I am \nconfident that these efforts will have the strong support of the \nAmerican people and the vast majority of the Senate.\n  Finally, I am proud that the conference agreement on the Commerce, \nJustice, State section of the bill includes more new spending \nreductions than either of the House- or Senate-passed bills. The budget \nresolution currently under consideration in the Congress will build on \nthe good work of [[Page S7381]] this rescission bill and ultimately \nlead us to the first balanced Federal budget since 1969. When we \ncomplete our work on these measures, we will have fulfilled the promise \nRepublicans made to the American people last November, to put the \nFederal Government on a budget, to say not to more Federal spending, \nand to allow more families to say yes to their own spending priorities \nfor their own children.\n               national korean war veterans armistice day\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, included in H.R. 1158 is language that \nwill designate July 27 of each year, from 1995 until 2003, the 50th \nanniversary of the end of active conflict in the Korean war, as \nNational Korean War Veterans Armistic Day. This important designation \ncould not have been achieved without the assistance of my good friend \nand colleague, the senior Senator from Alaska, Senator Stevens. I would \nalso like to point out that our initiative to put this language in H.R. \n1158 is a one-time exception due to the timeliness of the matter--the \nKorean War Veterans' Memorial will be dedicated this July.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I join with my distinguished colleague, \nthe senior Senator from Virginia, in this proposal to formally honor \nthose brave Americans who fought in the Korean war. This is an \ninitiative which is both important and necessary.\n  On June 25, 1950, without warning, armed forces of the People's \nDemocratic Republic of Korea invaded their neighbors to the south, the \nRepublic of Korea, initiating the Korean war. Shortly thereafter, at \nthe request of the President of the Republic of Korea, President Harry \nS Truman directed American forces to enter into the war. The American \ninvolvement was spearheaded by the Army's Task Force Smith.\n  Subsequently, a U.N. command was created which, by the end of active \ncombat, had incorporated military units from 21 member nations, under \nU.S. leadership, in the struggle. The fighting continued, with American \nforces bearing the brunt of the action, until July 27, 1953, when a \ncease-fire agreement ended active combat.\n  Mr. WARNER. Under the command of General of the Army Douglas \nMacArthur and, later, Gen. Matthew B. Ridgeway, U.N. forces repelled \nthe invasion and restored the integrity of the Republic of Korea along \nwith the freedom and independence of the South Korean people. During 3 \nyears of active hostilities, our Armed Forces, enduring the rigors of \ncombat in the extremes of a hostile climate and the most trying of \nconditions, engaged in some of the most significant battles in our \nNation's history. Those battles included the Inchon landings, the Pusan \nPerimeter breakout, and the battle of the Chosin Reservoir.\n  Over 5.7 million American service people were involved directly or \nindirectly in the war. Of those, 54,246 died; 33,629 of whom died in \nbattle. An additional 103,284 were wounded and 8,177 were listed as \nmissing or prisoners of war. There are 329 American prisoners of war \nstill unaccounted for.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Unfortunately, the Korean war has come to be known as \nAmerica's forgotten war, and our veterans from that era deserve the \nrecognition they earned through their valor and sacrifices. The \nfollowing Senators served in that war: my friend John Warner, as well \nas Ben Nighthorse Campbell, John Chafee, John Glenn, and Arlen Specter.\n  Mr. President, for that reason, the distinguished senior Senator from \nVirginia and I proposed establishing a National Korean War Armistice \nDay. We believe that this Nation should never forget the service \nrendered, and the sacrifices made, by those brave Americans who fought, \nand in particular those who died, in the Korean war.\n  Mr. WARNER. The distinguished senior Senator from Alaska and I are \nalso pleased that, as a result of congressional and Presidential \nauthorizations, the Korean War Veterans Memorial will be built, in \nWashington, DC, to recognize and honor the service and sacrifice of \nthose Americans who participated in the Korean war. By establishing \nJuly 27 as National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day, we will build \nupon and enhance that long-due recognition for Korean war veterans.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise to speak against the conference \nreport that is before us this evening. Six weeks ago, we spent nearly a \nweek here on the Senate floor debating the merits of cutting funding \nfor education. Many believed that the rescission bill made too many \ncuts in important education and training and children's programs that \nbenefit working families and children.\n  After many days of debate, the Senate reached an agreement that \nrearranged the Senate's priorities and restored funding for children \nand for education. Under the leadership of Majority Leader Dole and \nMinority Leader Daschle, the children and education cuts were limited \nto $400 million. In the end, the Senate took a strong position in \nsupport of students and children, a position that we expected would be \nheld in conference.\n  Head Start, WIC, Safe and Drug Free Schools, Title I, Goals 2000, \nSchool to Work, Immigrant Education, Trio, and National Service all \nreceived important infusions of funding that made the final Senate \npackage--with $405 million in education cuts--stand in stark contrast \nto the House package, with $1.6 billion in education cuts. The Senate's \nintention on education could have not been more clear.\n  Two weeks later, 34 Senators, Republican and Democrat, reaffirmed \nthat position, and sent a letter to Senator Hatfield explaining why the \nSenate had made the changes, and asking that ``We strongly urge you to \nsupport students and education and the Senate level of education \nrescissions.'' I ask unanimous consent that this letter be entered into \nthe Record.\n  Despite an unmistakably clear message to the conferees, the \nconference agreement has now come back with $950 million in cuts to \neducation programs and we are being asked once again to cut education.\n  I don't think I need to repeat again the effect of these harsh \nrescissions--reduction or elimination of violence and drug prevention \nprograms for 39 million students; elimination of school reform grants \nto 4,000 schools; reduction in reading and math assistance for 135,000 \nat-risk children; elimination of a promising start on technology in \nschools--all of this and more will be gone if the conference report is \nadopted and the President signs the bill.\n  One point cannot be overemphasized--schools across the country are \ncounting on these funds. States have already been notified of the \namounts they will receive in July. If these rescissions go through, \nchildren will be dropped from services, teachers will be laid off, \ncomputer orders will be canceled.\n  I think the record of the U.S. Senate on education rescissions is \nclear. I urge my colleagues to reject this report, and to vote to \nsustain a veto if President Clinton vetoes this bill, which I believe \nhe should and will.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we have an \norder for the disposition of debate under the rescissions supplemental \nappropriations bill. I wonder if the Senator will permit us to complete \nthat action, and then there will be a period for morning business set \naside for the Senator to speak.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. How much time remains?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Only 3 minutes remain with this Senator. I am advised \nthe Senator from West Virginia has 8 minutes, and he authorized us to \nyield back that time. So the Senator can speak very quickly. We will be \nin morning business very soon.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Very well.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield myself the remainder of the time \nunder the order.\n  Mr. President, the Senators from Wisconsin and Arizona complain about \ntwo provisions in this conference report dealing with NASA. They are \nadministrative provisions, and they are clearly and fully explained in \nthe committee report on pages 132 and 133.\n  Let me add to the Clear Lake development facility issue by saying \nthat the authority to enter into this transaction was previously passed \nby the [[Page S7382]] Senate last year on the NASA authorization bill \non October 5.\n  This purchase saves taxpayers' funds and makes needed facilities \navailable to NASA on a timely basis. It was considered carefully by the \nSenate conferees and was found to be not only in the public interest \nbut in the interests of the Federal Government. That is why it was \nincluded and approved.\n  Insofar as the Yellow Creek Facility in Mississippi is concerned, \ntime does not permit a long narrative to expand on the provisions of \nthis conference report itself, describing the history of this facility.\n  Let me just quickly say from my own personal recollection, the \nFederal Government came into this northeast corner of Mississippi, \ncondemned property to build a huge nuclear facility for TVA. Halfway \nthrough the construction phase, after everybody had been stressed and \nstrained in terms of accommodating the Federal Government's interest or \nthis agency's interest, they canceled the facility, putting a lot of \npeople out of work who had moved to the area who helped build the \nfacility, and finally NASA decided they would take the land.\n  Transfers were authorized by Congress for NASA to build an advanced \nsolid rocket motor facility on the property. People moved into the \narea--scientists, technicians and all the rest--schools were built, \nroads were built, infrastructure developed, by the State, by local \ngovernments, taxes were raised, to help pay for this Federal facility \nand accommodate the interests of the Federal Government.\n  Patriotism was rampant because of the new pride in that part of the \nState to do something for our Federal Government and our space program. \nNASA abandoned ASRM when the House voted it down one night and canceled \nall the authority for the funds. Then they worked out a program to have \na nozzle facility built to take the place of this other facility. Now \nit has been canceled, just recently.\n  Finally, they say in Mississippi, ``Look, get the Federal Government \nout of here. Let the State government try to do something that is \npredictable that makes sense.'' This is after $100 million had been \ninvested by local and State interests, local taxpayers. People have \nlost money building housing in this area, doing things in anticipation \nof the result that would come from these Federal Government activities.\n  Now, finally, we are just saying in this provision, this is an \nemergency supplemental bill, too, not just a rescission bill. It \nprovides funds for disaster assistance, to disaster victims. I \nchallenge anybody to find anyone who has been victimized any more than \nthe people of this part of the State of Mississippi by actions of the \nFederal Government. This provision has been requested by NASA, it was \nconsidered carefully by conferees on both sides. It is included here, \nbecause it is in the public interest. There ought to be more included \nhere to deal with the victims of that disaster.\n  I will not belabor it. I congratulate the Senator from Iowa for his \ncomments about the facility. They complain about being in the bill, in \nthe conference report now. We defended the position of the Senate. The \nSenate authorized this to continue to be a Federal Agriculture Research \nService facility. We had to compromise with the House.\n  The Senator, complaining that we should not have compromised, I \nsuppose. It does not make logical sense to me to complain about the \nactions of the conferees who were bound to defend the position of the \nSenate. The Senate entertained an amendment of the Senator from Arizona \nand voted it down.\n  We are obligated to take up for the Senate and we did. But we had to \ncompromise with the House and we worked it out, and the Senator fully \ndescribed the result.\n  I am proud of the work our conferees did. We worked hard and brought \nback a conference agreement that I hope the Senate will approve when we \nvote on it tomorrow morning.\n  Mr. President, the fiscal year 1995 Agriculture, Rural Development \nand Related Agencies Appropriations Act provided $297 million in cost-\nof-money lending authority for telephone loans of the Rural Utilities \nService, formerly the Rural Electrification Administration, at a \nsubsidy cost of $60,000. There is a 7-percent interest rate cap in that \nprogram, and when rates exceeded that amount at the beginning of the \nfiscal year, the cost-of-money program was substantially curtailed \nbecause of inadequate subsidy. Because of the cap, when long-term \nTreasury rates exceed 7 percent, the interest rates on individual loans \nrequire a subsidy. The $60,000 subsidy was appropriated to satisfy the \nloan loss reserve requirement of the Treasury Department, not to \nsubsidize interest rates.\n  The conference report accompany H.R. 1158, incorporates a provision \nincluded in the Senate-passed bill which removes the interest rate cap \nfor fiscal year 1995 in this program. This action will allow the Rural \nUtilities Service to utilize the entire $297 million in loan authority \nprovided for this program. It is my understanding that the Rural \nUtilities Service has already approved seven loans during this fiscal \nyear, totalling $3.2 million. However, none of the funds on these loans \nhave been drawn down by the borrowers. Since interest rates on these \nloans are fixed at the time of draw down, not at the time of approval, \nthere will be no interest rate subsidy associated with these loans upon \nenactment of H.R. 1158.\n  Fortunately, the long-term Treasury rate is now around 7 percent \nagain, rather than almost 8 percent that existed early in October. This \nmeans that borrowers will receive a reasonable rate of interest at no \ncost to the Treasury for any loan in this program approved during \nfiscal year 1995. However, if interest rates do rise, the program will \nstill continue at the authorized levels, without an interest rate \nsubsidy, as Congress intended.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference \nagreement accompanying H.R. 1158, the second supplemental \nappropriations and rescissions bill for fiscal year 1995.\n  I commend the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee \nfor his efforts to complete congressional action on this bill. I regret \nthat after significant work, the President now states that he will veto \nthe final bill.\n  Such action will even further delay the provision of emergency \ndisaster assistance requested by the President for California and 40 \nother States that have experienced natural disasters.\n  Such action will delay the availability of funding to pursue the \ninvestigation of the tragic Oklahoma City bombing.\n  Such action will delay the provision of funding requested by the \nPresident to fund a new counterterrorism initiative.\n  The funding in this bill to respond to these requests by the \nPresident totals $6.95 billion.\n  These emergency funds include disaster aid of $3.35 billion to be \navailable for the remainder of fiscal year 1995, and $3.35 billion as a \ncontingency appropriation, which can be obligated by the President \nbeginning in fiscal year 1996 with specific notification of the \nCongress.\n  The bill includes rescissions totaling $15.4 billion in budget \nauthority and $0.4 billion in outlay savings for fiscal year 1995 to \nprovide deficit reduction as the Congress seeks to move toward a \nbalanced Federal budget.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill. It will put a downpayment \non the significant deficit reduction that will be required to balance \nthe budget, and begin to alleviate the burden of debt we are leaving to \nour children and future generations.\n  Now is the time for Congress to embark on a serious journey to get \nits fiscal house in order. This bill is but a first step on what will \nbe a long and difficult, but necessary, journey.\n  I urge the adoption of the bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be printed in the \nRecord at this point two tables showing the relationship of this bill \nto the section 602 allocations of the Appropriations Committee and to \nthe current level which displays congressional action to date for \nfiscal year 1995.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                \n[[Page S7383]]\n                                              H.R. 1158, EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL AND RESCISSIONS CONFERENCE                                              \n                                                     [FY 1995, in millions of dollars, CBO scoring]                                                     \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                    Subcommittee      Senate 602(b)      Total comp to  \n                   Subcommittee                            Current status\\1\\     H.R. 1158\\2\\          total            allocation         allocation   \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAgriculture--RD..................................

The President recently announced his intention to veto the \nrescission bill recently agreed to by the joint House-Senate conference \ncommittee. In part, he decried the agreement on the basis of the \nrescissions proposed for HUD. This is outrageous. This President wants \nto take a mouth-full of popular political rhetoric on budget constraint \nand responsibility, but still can't bring himself to inhale. You can't \nstop spending until you halt the growth in programs which generate it. \nThis stuff may be hard to swallow, but unless we get beyond the \npolitical posturing, our Nation and our economy will gag on the unpaid \nbills of our irresponsibility.\n  Some have questioned why HUD is being cut more than $6.3 billion, \nnearly three-quarters of a total rescission of $8.5 billion for the \nSubcommittee. The answer is simple: The cut is roughly proportionate to \nthat Department's available budgetary resources. Although HUD received \nnew appropriations for fiscal year 1995 of $25.7 billion, about 39 \npercent of the funding for our four major agencies, it also carried \ninto this fiscal year $35.2 billion in unobligated prior year balances. \nIn other words, it more than doubled its total available budgetary \nresources with this massive influx of unspent, unobligated funding.\n  We must cut HUD, and we must begin now if there is to be any hope of \nsurviving the very constrained ``freeze-minus'' future for \ndiscretionary spending reflected in both the House and Senate reported \nbudget resolutions. The Congressional Budget Office analysis of the \ncost of the President's original budget submission for subsidized \nhousing demonstrated a 50% expenditure increase over the next five \nyears. Unless we act now to curb the spiraling growth in outlays, we \nwill have to make truly draconian cuts in the near future.\n  The solution is simple: Turn-off the pipeline of new subsidized \nunits. That is the fundamental focus of the rescission bill. We have \nalso restored cuts proposed by the House in CDBG, modernization, and \noperating subsidies, and redirected available resources toward another \nurgent aspect of restoring budgetary sanity to this out of control \nDepartment: demolish the failed housing developments, and put the rest \non a sound footing to survive the competition and subsidy reductions \ncoming down the pike.\n  Amid all the debate over the future of HUD, it's important to keep in \nmind that over 4.8 million families receive Federal housing assistance, \nand over half of them are elderly or disabled. It's also important to \nnote that such housing assistance is expensive, as I said $26 billion \nin fiscal year 1995 outlays, and current costs are rising. In fact with \nthe long-term contractual commitments previously made by HUD, the \nGovernment is currently obligated to pay over $187 billion over the \nlife of these contracts, some stretching out 40 years.\n  Given the long-term nature of these obligations and commitments, \nhalting \n[[Page S7384]] the budgetary growth of the Department can only be \naccomplished with a focused, determined, multi-year effort. Unless we \nbegin now, with this bill, we will lock ourselves into another multi-\nbillion dollar chunk of long-term budget obligations. And this is only \na first step, one of many in which we will go beyond the limited fixes \nand cuts that can be accomplished in a rescission bill. We must enact \nmajor reform legislation later this year, but this is a good, and very \nnecessary beginning.\n  The program reforms and initial reductions contained in the \nrescission bill are desperately needed to avoid a budgetary train wreck \nwith the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n  The President has criticized a number of specific actions contained \nin the conference agreement. Frankly, there are a number of \nrecommendations in the conference report which are troubling to me. But \nthis bill is a compromise with the House-passed measure which contained \nmuch larger rescissions, and I believe the agreement goes a long way \ntowards minimizing adverse program impacts while increasing our \ncontributions to deficit reduction.\n  For example, the rescission agreed to for National Service was \nincreased to $210 million from the $105 million Senate-passed level. \nWhile many of us are dubious of the whole premise of paying people to \nbecome ``volunteers,'' regardless of their financial resources, and we \nhave heard of instances where excessive payments have been made, the \nconferees decided to maintain this program at the pre-existing funding \nlevel established for fiscal year 1994. I might add that the rescission \nis half the House-passed rescission of $416 million.\n  The President's statement also says we cut funding for housing AIDS \nvictims. While a $30 million rescission was approved, it is only a \nsmall fraction of $186 million included in the House bill. Moreover, \nthe rescission simply provides the identical funding level requested by \nthe President for this fiscal year! Since the President didn't request \nthis appropriation in the first place, it is at least ironic that he \nshould now protest its rescission.\n  The conference agreement includes the full $6.7 billion requested by \nthe President for the disaster relief fund. This will enable FEMA to \nrespond to needs in California resulting from the Northridge earthquake \nand disasters in other states.\n  Mr. President, I would also note that citizens of my own State are \nenduring yet another flood on the Missouri River. Thankfully, this \nflood does not compare to the devastation wrought by the Midwest Flood \nof 1993, but a number of communities still have suffered significant \ndamage, and thousands of families have been dislocated. Missouri's \ngovernor already has stated that he anticipates a formal request for \nassistance within days, and that need has been echoed by the many local \nofficials who have contacted my offices in recent weeks.\n  Yet FEMA tells me that they will only be able to respond for a few \nmore weeks without additional funding. Where will that leave the \nvictims of the latest flooding in the Midwest when the President \nchooses politics over people?\n  Mr. President, I would also note that the conference agreement \ncontains $5 million requested by this the Administration to enable FEMA \nto initiate flood mitigation activities authorized by the National \nFlood Insurance Reform Act of 1994. So this bill not only provides the \nresources to help flood victims recover from these disasters, but we \nare also taking steps to help avoid such flood damage in the future.\n  With appropriations contained in this bill, FEMA will also be able to \nmeet all needs arising as a result of the terrorist attack in Oklahoma \nCity. I am pleased that the conference agreement includes $7 million \nfor FEMA to train and plan for any future terrorist incidents, and to \nbeef up security in several locations. We commend FEMA for its \ncompassionate, timely and professional response to the Oklahoma City \nattack. FEMA has earned the confidence and respect of the American \npeople, and has come a long way under the leadership of James Lee Witt.\n  The conferees agreed to rescind $81 million from the Department of \nVeterans Affairs, including $50 million from excess personnel costs and \n$31 million from excess project reserves. This rescission will not \nimpact VA's ability to provide patient care in any way. The rescission \nto personnel costs does not affect staffing. Simply, VA's\n budget included $50 million more than they now estimate they need to \npay salaries. Despite the erroneous assertion in the President's \nstatement, no funding is being rescinded for medical equipment needs of \nVA hospitals and clinics.\n\n  In terms of the construction account, funds are rescinded from \nprojects which are costing less than what was originally appropriated. \nRescinding the funds ensures VA carefully manages its construction \nbudget.\n  The conferees rescinded a total of $1.5 billion from EPA. Of the \ntotal, $1.3 billion is rescinded from the drinking water state \nrevolving fund. Because this program has not been authorized, EPA has \nbeen unable to obligate the funds. While I support the need for this \nprogram, until it is authorized no funds may be spent.\n  Within the Superfund program, $100 million is rescinded. Because EPA \nfails to obligate on average $100 million in Superfund appropriations \neach year, this rescission is not expected to have a dramatic effect on \nprogram activities. On the other hand, it is intended to slow program \nspending pending enactment of major reform legislation which will \nlikely change the scope and nature of clean-up activities previously \nplanned.\n  Although the total rescission for EPA is slightly greater than the \ntotal rescission contained in either the House or Senate versions, the \nconference agreement is entirely within the scope of the differences \nbetween the Houses for each budget account of the agency. No new or \nextraneous items were rescinded.\n  The conference agreement contains a number of legislative provisions \nimpacting EPA programs. Provisions impacting EPA's automobile \ninspection and maintenance program are intended to ensure EPA is \nflexible in reviewing states' plans for I/M programs and considers \nassigning additional credits for effective decentralized programs.\n  Two provisions contained in the Senate-passed version of the bill \nhave been retained: first, a moratorium on new Superfund site listings \nfor the balance of this fiscal year, unless requested by the governor \nor unless reauthorization legislation is enacted, and second, a \nprohibition on EPA from enforcing vehicular trip reduction programs \nwere agreed to in conference.\n  Finally, the White House has indicated that it seeks to restore $14 \nmillion for the $88 million rescission for the yet to be established \nCommunity Development Financial Institutions program. This is despite \nthe fact that the conference agreement adopted the funding level \ncontained in the Daschle democratic leadership compromise amendment.\n  Mr. President, the conference agreement on this supplemental and \nrescission package is a good one. Rescissions for programs under the \njurisdiction of the VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies Subcommittee \ntotal $8.5 billion. The contribution towards deficit reduction is $1.6 \nbillion more than the level originally passed by the Senate, but is \n$800 million less than that passed by the House. It is a compromise, \nbut one which fairly balances the differing priorities of the two \nHouses and still maintains funding for critical activities.\n  Mr. President, I hope the White House reconsiders its ill-advised \ninitial reaction to this bill. If this bill is vetoed, it will mean \nfurther delays which may disrupt timely delivery of assistance to \ndisaster victims in 41 States, including my own, as well as the Federal \nresponse in Oklahoma City. Perhaps equally important, delay also means \nthat Federal agencies will obligate even more of the funds we have \nidentified for rescission, making the task of saving money in low \npriority programs even more difficult.\n  The stated objections of the White House to this emergency \nsupplemental and rescission bill are nothing more than spurious. And \nthe matters that they have demanded be changed can only be described as \na grab-bag of politically appealing items, which aren't needed, or \ncouldn't be effectively utilized, or simply increase current spending \nwhen we all know that spending must be reduced to get our budget back \nin balance. [[Page S7385]] \n  Mr. President, this is a responsible bill. It cuts funding and \ncontributes to deficit reduction. It provides emergency funding which \nis urgently needed to assist victims of disasters. It makes long \noverdue reforms and corrections in programs which need fixing. And this \nbill needs to be enacted without further delay. I urge the White House \nto set politics aside, and begin working with us to make this \nconference agreement law.\n\n\n                   inspection and maintenance program\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would ask the Senator from Missouri \nthree questions about the provisions in this bill on the auto emissions \ninspection and maintenance program required by the Clean Air Act. The \nbill would prevent EPA from apply an automatic 50 percent discount in \nemissions credits for State programs that included test-and-repair, as \nopposed to test-only, stations. It is my understanding that the bill \nrequires EPA to examine each program a State has submitted and assign \nthe appropriate emissions credits. Based on various features of a \nState's program, EPA might assign emissions credits equal to 100 \npercent of a test-only program. Or EPA might find the appropriate \ncredit is only 75 percent or 25 percent, depending on how a State \nprogram is structured. Is that a correct reading of the bill?\n  Mr. BOND. The Senator is correct. EPA is to examine the entirety of \neach State inspection and maintenance program and is to assign the \nappropriate emissions credits based on the actual program the State \nsubmits. No automatic discounting factors should apply and the \ndetermination of the appropriate emissions credits should be based on \ngood science and engineering analysis.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. The report language accompanying this bill indicates that \nEPA may give a State up to 2 years to make a demonstration that \njustifies the credits it is seeking. Is EPA required to grant a 2-year \ndemonstration period to every State that requests it?\n  Mr. BOND. No. The 2-year period to demonstrate the effectiveness of a \nState program may be granted by EPA, if the Agency believes it to be \nreasonable. This allows the Agency to implement the inspection and \nmaintenance requirements in a more flexible way. But unreasonable \nproposals that surely would not merit the emissions credits claimed \nneed not be granted a 2-year demonstration period. It is not an \nautomatic extension for any and all inspection and maintenance programs \nthat may be submitted by the States.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Finally, I would ask whether this provision affects any \nother aspect of the plan submissions and attainment demonstrations that \nStates are to make under the Clean Air Act?\n  Mr. BOND. No. The sole purpose of this language is to prevent EPA \nfrom requiring States to adopt enhanced inspection and maintenance \nprograms based on the I/M240, test-only model and to prevent EPA from \nautomatically discounting programs that use test-and-repair stations by \na factor of 50 percent. The language has no other effect on State \nobligations under the Clean Air Act.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask first of all to yield back the \nbalance of time under the order of the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Does that conclude the authority under the conference \nreport, under the order previously entered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are still 6 minutes for the Senator from \nMinnesota, Mr. Wellstone.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield the time back on behalf of the \nSenator from Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/24/senate-section/article/S7371-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Mr. President, I knew Les Aspin for 25 years. In 1970, \nI was a junior in high school in Janesville, WI, when I signed up as a \nvolunteer on Les' first campaign for the First Congressional District \nseat in Wisconsin. He won that election after a tough recount in the \nprimary, defeated the incumbent Congressman.\n  I then interned in his Janesville, WI, Post Office basement office in \n1971 and in 1972 during the summers. During the next quarter century, \nwe had a continuing friendship, as he carved out a distinguished career \nin the United States House of Representatives, eventually rising to \nbecome the chairman of the Armed Services Committee while I prepared \nfor and began my own career.\n  By temperament and training, Les Aspin was a man who listened to \nideas and demanded facts. His mind was trained at some of the best \neducational institutions in the world: Yale, Oxford, and MIT.\n  Sometimes the conclusions he reached after thoroughly probing a \nproblem were not welcomed by all who heard them, but they were always \nthe product of a rigorous and honest intellectual process. Les Aspin \nenjoyed the successes and endured the setbacks common to all Members \nwho choose a career in public service.\n  His service was marked by unflagging dedication. I believe he always \ndid what he thought was right and he always did his best.\n  One thing was readily apparent. He came from our strong Wisconsin \nreformist tradition. He was long an opponent of waste and fraud and \nabuse in Government, including but certainly not limited, to the \nmilitary.\n  He fought against junk telephone calls as well as junkets. He \nunearthed cost overruns in big-ticket weapons projects, punched holes \nin corporate propaganda campaigns, and dragged some highly questionable \nforeign business practices out into the spotlight.\n  He also criticized the insular environment that enveloped the Defense \nDepartment and the defense industry that fostered the waste of \ntaxpayers' money.\n  Along the way, Les Aspin became recognized as one of the Congress' \nleading experts on military policy. I would say one of the leading \nexperts of any time in the history of our Congress.\n  Les Aspin served his country diligently in many capacities. As an \nArmy captain, he worked as an analyst in the Pentagon; he served on the \nstaff of President John Kennedy's Council of Economic Advisors; he \nrepresented Wisconsinites for 22 years in Congress; he enthusiastically \ntook on the giant task of steering the Defense Department into the \nuncharted waters of the post-cold war era.\n  When Les Aspin suffered his fatal stroke, he was chairing the \nPresident's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, working with his \nfriend and colleague, CIA director John Deutch, on needed reforms in \nour intelligence communities.\n  Mr. President, Les Aspin was a man I deeply respected and admired. As \nI look back at the fact that my own entry into politics began in his \nfirst campaign for office in 1970, I feel a profound sense of loss at \nhis passing. He was a good friend and a dedicated public servant. Far \ntoo soon we have lost an exceptional human being.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/24/senate-section/article/S7385-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

DUANE MEYER\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, today I would like to congratulate a \nMissourian who has dedicated his life to helping students pursue the \nknowledge and gifts of higher education. He is retiring after 40 years \nof service to Southwest Missouri State University, located in my \nhometown of Springfield, MO. Duane G. Meyer has spent his entire \npostgraduate teaching career at Southwest Missouri State University, \nserving as a teacher for 18 years and an administrator for 22 years, \nincluding service from 1971-83 as the sixth president of Southwest \nMissouri State.\n  Dr. Meyer was born on June 29, 1926, in Carroll, IA, and earned a \nbachelor's degree from the University of Dubuque in Dubuque, IA. He \nwent on to earn a master's degree and a Ph.D. from the University of \nIowa. In 1955, Dr. Meyer arrived in Springfield to begin his career as \nan assistant professor and later professor of history. In 1961, he was \nappointed dean of faculties, a post he held until 1971. During that \ntime, Dr. Meyer served as acting president of the university twice, in \n1964 and 1970.\n  In 1971, Duane Meyer was selected to be the sixth president of the \nschool. During his 12 years as president, Southwest Missouri State \nUniversity experienced unprecedented growth and success. The school was \nrenamed Southwest Missouri State University in 1972 through an \nenactment of the Missouri General Assembly. Enrollment increased to all \ntime highs every year of his tenure except one, and SMSU became the \nsecond largest 4-year public institution in the State of Missouri. \nOther notable landmarks of Dr. Meyer's tenure include the\n creation and implementation of an academic master plan, the creation \nof a business school, and the building of a new student event center. \nThe SMSU athletic program began competition in NCAA Division One \ncompetition during his presidency.\n\n  After his retirement as president of the university, Dr. Meyer \ncontinued to serve Southwest Missouri State as a professor of history \nand president emeritus. He served the State of Missouri as a member of \nthe Missouri Council on Public Higher Education Board. My colleague in \nthe Senate, then-governor Kit Bond, appointed Dr. Meyer to serve on the \nMissouri Commission on Higher Education. Dr. Meyer has also written two \ntextbooks that are still used in classrooms today, including ``The \nHeritage of Missouri: A History.''\n  Throughout his 42-year career, Dr. Duane G. Meyer served the students \nand faculty of Southwest Missouri State University and the surrounding \ncommunities with dedication and pride. As a former teaching colleague \nof Dr. Meyer at SMSU, I am grateful to him for his selfless labors and \nsalute his work and the role he played in the education of thousands of \nstudents from Missouri and across America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/24/senate-section/article/S7386-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7386-S7387]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE SPRATLY ISLANDS\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, while the dispute surrounding the Spratly \nIslands in the South China Sea has seemingly disappeared from our \ndomestic press, I would like my colleagues to know that--\nunfortunately--it has not been resolved. On the contrary, the frequency \nand tenor of the hostile rhetoric and minor tiffs between the concerned \nparties have increased since I last spoke about the issue on the floor \non March 30 of this year. This is reflected in the Asian media, and I \nwould like to share here a small representative sampling of those \nreports from just the last 2 weeks with my colleagues to keep them \nabreast of the most recent developments. I ask unanimous consent. That \nseveral editorials be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            Military To ``Firmly'' Defend Territorial Waters\n\n       Hanoi VNA, May 7.--Defending firmly the territorial waters \n     and islands in the East Sea [South China Sea] is an important \n     part in Vietnam's strategic task of safeguarding its national \n     independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, said an \n     article in the Quan Doi Nhan Dan (People's Army) daily on \n     Friday [5 May].\n       The article, run in anticipation of the 40th foundation day \n     of the Vietnam People's Navy (May 7), praised the Navy's \n     feats of arms in the two resistance wars against foreign \n     invaders. Over the past 40 years, the Vietnamese Navy made a \n     big contribution to the struggle for national independence \n     and freedom, particularly in the fight against the enemy's \n     air raids and harbour blockade in the north. The Navy was \n     assigned to set up a `Ho Chi Minh Trail on the sea' to \n     transport military supplies to liberation fighters in the \n     south and actively engaged in the spring 1975 general \n     offensive which liberated the entire South Vietnam including \n     Truong Sa (Spratly) Islands.\n       Vietnam has a coastal line of 3,260 km. It has one million \n     sq. Km of sea under its jurisdiction including two \n     archipelagoes Hoang Sa, Parag Sa (Spratly) and a great number \n     of other islands. Endowed with rich oil and other natural \n     resources, Vietnam is expected to tap 7.7 million tonnes of \n     crude oil this year and about 20-25 million tonnes by the \n     year 2000.\n       Regarding the East Sea issue, during his talks in Seoul \n     last month with South Korean president, party General \n     Secretary Do Muoi said Truong Sa and Hoang Sa belong to \n     Vietnam, and it wants to resolve the disputes through \n     peaceful negotiations on the basis of equality, mutual \n     respect and in line with the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of \n     the Sea. He expressed his wish that joint efforts should be \n     made to build Asia-the Pacific into a region of peace, \n     stability, cooperation and prosperity.\n       For his part, President Le Duc Anh in a recent message to \n     the inhabitants and soldiers on Truong Sa on the occasion of \n     the 20th liberation day of the archipelago stressed that it \n     is the country's sacred territory.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                    Trip Is ``Serious Infringement''\n\n       Beijing, May 16, (XINHUA)--Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen \n     Guofang issued a statement here today.\n       Shen Guofang said: Plotted and organized by the Philippine \n     military, a formation of two Philippine warships and one \n     pleasure-boat carrying Filipino and foreign reporters sailed \n     to Meiji Reef of our country's Nansha Islands [Spratly \n     Islands] on 13 May to engage in so-called ``news-gathering'' \n     activities.

Carlos Tanega, \n     commander of Military Forces in western Philippines, told \n     reporters.\n       ``We were just launching and recovering helicopters . . . \n     and here they are, sometimes blocking our way,'' Tanega \n     pointed out.\n       On Monday, Beijing formally protested Manila's decision to \n     allow foreign journalists to visit the disputed island Chain.\n       Apart from the Philippines and China, Vietnam, Taiwan, \n     Malaysia and Brunei also claim all or portions of the \n     Spratlys, which are believed to be rich in oil and other \n     mineral deposits.\n       The media group, composed mostly of members of the Foreign \n     Correspondents Association of the Philippines, left Manila on \n     [[Page S7387]] May 11 for Puerto Princesa, nearly 600 km \n     southwest of the capital.\n       It returned Tuesday to Manila after observing special \n     municipal elections held Sunday in Pag-Asa, the largest of \n     seven Spratly islands held by the Philippines.\n       After two nights aboard a private cruise ship, the \n     journalists reached Jackson Atoll, about 50 km northwest of \n     Mischief Reef, where they transferred to the World War II \n     vintage Benguet.\n       The first two sorties with 16 journalists on board Vietnam \n     war-era Uhih choppers with ``press'' markings took off at \n     about 11:15 AM when the landing ship was about 30 km off \n     Mischief Reef.\n       Also on board was Tanega, the first Philippine officer to \n     fly over the area since the Chinese built at least 14 \n     structures on four platforms around the reef.\n       Manila has strongly condemned the Chinese occupation of the \n     reef, which Filipino officials stress is well within the \n     country's 200-km exclusive economic zone.\n       Beijing maintains that the reef is part of its territory \n     and claims the structures are ``shelters for fishermen.''\n       Tanega pointed out the two Chinese ships raced back to the \n     reef's lagoon after apparently seeing the choppers, \n     journalists said.\n       But in the second wave of sorties, journalists saw the \n     ships heading toward the Philippine naval ships which were \n     about 24 km off the reef.\n       From the ship's foredeck, journalists saw the Chinese \n     vessels, a small fast boat and a larger ship, assume blocking \n     positions midway between the reef and the Philippine vessels.\n       At that point, about 16 km from the reef, the Benguet \n     stopped to launch the fourth and fifth sorties.\n       ``We stopped because . . . We knew this is the place where \n     we could accomplish the mission in the best, expeditious and \n     safest way,'' said Tanega at a press conference the next day.\n       As the Benguet was ``lying to,'' a naval term to mean that \n     a ship has stopped without dropping anchor, its patrol \n     escort, Miguel Malvar, maneuvered from starboard to a \n     position to port.\n       Tanega said this was done to prevent the bigger Chinese \n     ship from coming closer to the Benguet.\n       The smaller Chinese vessel moved to a position as close as \n     50 meters from the Benguet from where some its crew took \n     photos and filmed the operations of the naval ship.\n       ``The reaction was definitely expected because they did not \n     know what we were doing,'' said Tanega.\n       ``They did not know where the helicopters were taking off . \n     . . They could not surmise how a land-based helicopter could \n     fly 208 km from the nearest land field,'' he pointed out.\n       Tanega said that while the Chinese vessel, whose Chinese \n     markings identified it as belonging to Beijing's Bureau of \n     Fisheries, was ``too close for comfort,'' he was not bothered \n     by its presence.\n       As the choppers were secured on the deck of the Benguet, a \n     Philippine Air Force reconnaissance plane radioed Tanega \n     about the approach of ``two savage fishes.''\n       The plane was referring to Chinese frigates, which \n     journalists learned were 24 km away and racing toward them.\n       Shortly after, at about 2:45 PM, Tanega ordered the Benguet \n     and its escort ship to maneuver out of the area and proceed \n     to Pag-Asa, some 18 hours away.\n       The two Chinese vessels made no attempt to stop the ships \n     and stayed behind while the frigates, whose outlines could be \n     seen on the horizon, appeared to stop.\n       ``What is important here is we did what we had to do \n     because this is our territory. We were eyeball to eyeball. We \n     did not blink,'' said Tanega.\n                                                                    ____\n\n              PRC Stance on Media's Spratlys Tour Analyzed\n\n             (Editorial: ``Manila Scores Versus Beijing'')\n\n       Whatever substance to Beijing's claim that the Chinese \n     structures on Mischief Reef are mere stations of Chinese \n     fishermen has been shown spurious by the celebrated stand-off \n     that took place last Saturday at the Kalayaan Islands. There, \n     two Chinese warships suddenly appeared 15 nautical miles away \n     in apparent support of Chinese vessels blocking a Philippine \n     Navy ship carrying local and foreign journalists.\n       The inspection trip by our Navy would have been enough to \n     impress upon independent journalists that the structures on \n     Mischief Reef could not have been mere fishing stations by \n     ubiquitous Chinese fishermen: the structures are made of \n     metal with parabolic discs all around, giving credence to \n     Manila's claim they could eventually become naval support \n     facilities.\n       But the Chinese, not exactly known for subtlety, betrayed \n     their own intentions; they themselves confirmed Manila's \n     claim. Within minutes after Philippine Navy helicopters \n     started their sorties of Mischief Reef last Saturday, two \n     frigates from the Chinese navy raced to the sight in apparent \n     aid of the Chinese ``fishermen''.\n       The trip has therefore accomplished Manila's objective of \n     proving to the international community that the Chinese are \n     undermining the status quo in the Kalayaan and unnecessarily \n     causing tension there. By arranging for the coverage by \n     foreign journalists, Manila has not only scored a public \n     relations point against Beijing, it has also buttressed its \n     territorial claim to the Kalayaan. As Acting Foreign \n     Secretary Domingo Siazon put it when he turned down Beijing's \n     request that the tour be canceled, the foreign journalists \n     who were coming along for the inspection should be an \n     indication of how they perceived the ``sovereignty issue''.\n       By drawing international opinion to the issue, Manila has \n     hit back at Beijing in the most capable way it could, making \n     full use of the resources of democracy and unmasking in the \n     process China's unneighborly designs in the region. It has \n     billed the trip as a concession to freedom of the press and \n     made it just an item in the larger itinerary of visiting the \n     Filipino settlements in the Kalayaan in order to conduct the \n     elections there. In one fell swoop, the Philippines has been \n     able to demonstrate its democratic character contrast to the \n     authoritarian regime in China as well as the fact that the \n     Kalayaan is hers by virtue of the Filipino living there.\n       The rub is that the confrontation shows China's \n     aggressiveness in pursuing its weak claim on Kalayaan. And \n     with the Philippine military by all accounts standing eyeball \n     to eyeball with the Chinese display of mi last Saturday--the \n     Italian-made jets of the Philippine Air Force screamed \n     overhead during the stand-off to warn theinese--, what has \n     been drummed to the international community is the \n     seriousness of the Kalayaan dispute. In such a t, hostilities \n     in the islands could break out any time.\n       But the tension could be managed by forceful diplomacy and \n     imaginative show of force against Beijing. Manila has been \n     able to compel Washington to issue a statement which voiced \n     United States' interest that ``freedom of maritime \n     investigation'' shall be preserved in the South China Sea, a \n     clear potshot at Beijing over its mischievous incursions. \n     Manila now has to navigate through the contentious domestic \n     dispute over some sort of a military logistical arrangement \n     of the US in the aftermath of the pullout of the Americans \n     from Subic and Clark. Asian capitals and some sectors in \n     thilippine are loath to admit it but the key to controlling \n     China and maintaining Asian security in the future is to \n     America militarily engaged in the region.\n                                                                    ____\n\n            [From the Manila Philippine Daily, May 18, 1995]\n\n            ``Creative'' Policy on Spratlys Leads to Success\n\n       The decision to take on China on the Spratlys is the \n     boldest foreign policy initiative ever taken by the Ramos \n     administration. It is even more remarkable if we consider \n     that he took a stand despite the military and economic \n     weakness of the Philippines. That the Philippines forcefully \n     challenged Chinese creeping expansion in the Spratlys was a \n     shock to China, as well as a surprise to our ASEAN allies. \n     They never expected the ``sick man of Asia'' to take on the \n     Chinese giant on the question of territorial integrity. The \n     diplomatic gamble paid off. It brought to the surface \n     historic fears in Asia about the Chinese threat, which is \n     more magnified by the modernization of its armed forces and \n     its rapidly expanding economy.\n       President Ramos' gamble touched a raw nerve among Asians, \n     and now many of our neighbors have dropped their reluctance \n     to warn against the Chinese threat. The fear and anxieties \n     over the Chinese move on the Spratlys are based on stronger \n     grounds than sovereignty or who should exploit maritime \n     resources supposed to lie underneath the atolls. The larger \n     issue, as pointed out by Goh Chok Tong to Chinese Foreign \n     Minister Li Peng, involves the freedom of navigation in the \n     South China Sea, over which China claims sovereignty based on \n     antiquarian maps.\n       It was the Philippines' actions that proved to be the \n     catalyst of the new-found solidarity among ASEAN and the \n     Asia-Pacific nations, notably Japan and the United States, to \n     forge a common stand in persuading China that it is in her \n     interest to bring the dispute within the framework of \n     multilateral negotiations. The Philippine action proves that \n     tough diplomatic decisions can give us a position of strength \n     if we get international support behind us. This is what we \n     call creative diplomacy.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Let me say in closing, Mr. President, that I am pleased \nthe State Department has finally issued a definitive U.S. position on \nthe Spratlys, with which I heartily agree. I believe that the Foreign \nRelations Committee will take up Senate Resolution 97--a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution on the islands which I sponsored--in the near future \nand move it to the floor soon thereafter.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/24/senate-section/article/S7386-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7387]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/24/senate-section/article/S7387-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7387-S7388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.

Aeronautics and space activities involve 15 \ncontributing departments and agencies of the Federal Government, as \nthis report reflects, and the results of their ongoing research and \ndevelopment affect the Nation as a whole in a variety of ways.\n  Fiscal Year 1994 featured many important developments and changes in \nU.S. aeronautics and space efforts. It included 7 Space Shuttle \nmissions successfully completed, 15 Government launches of Expendable \nLaunch Vehicles (ELVs), and 4 commercial launches from Government \nfacilities. Among notable developments in the ELV area were the launch \nof the Deep Space probe, Clementine, initial use of the Titan IV \nCentaur upper stage, and the first launch of the Taurus launch vehicle. \nHighlights of the Shuttle missions included the highly successful \nservicing mission for the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), which replaced \nseveral faulty parts and installed a sophisticated package of \ncorrective optics to compensate for the spherical aberration in HST's \nprimary mirror. Also, the flight of the Space Radar Laboratory began to \nprovide information on environmental change, and a mission with a \nRussian astronaut, Sergei Krikalev, as a member of the crew signalled \nthe beginning of a three-phased cooperative program in space between \nRussia and the United States.\n  In a year of tremendous accomplishments for the international Space \nStation, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) developed \nan initial set of specifications that included Russian elements as part \nof the design. Russia's agreeing to join the 12 original participating \nnations as a partner resulted in the expansion of the existing Shuttle/\nMir program into Phase I of the international Space Station program, \nwhich officially began with Sergei Krikalev's flight on the Shuttle. \nAll of the partners held a successful systems design review in Texas in \nMarch, and in June, Russia and the United States signed an interim \nagreement on the Space Station and a $400 million contract for Russian \nspace hardware, services, and data. In August, the program completed a \nvehicle architecture review and in September, the Space Station Control \nBoard ratified the recommendations it included. The redesigned Space \nStation costs $5 billion less than Space Station Freedom and still \noffers increased research capability and user flexibility.\n  In aeronautics, activities included development of technologies to \nimprove performance, increase safety, reduce engine noise and other \nenvironmental degradation, improve air traffic management, lower costs, \nand help American industry to be more competitive in the world market. \nFor example, high-speed research continued during Fiscal Year 1994 to \nfocus on resolving critical environmental issues and laying the \ntechnological foundation for an economical, next generation, High Speed \nCivil Transport (HSCT). In this connection, the United States reached \nagreement with Russia to use the Tu-144 supersonic transport as a \ntestbed for HSCT development. In addition, efforts in advanced \nsubsonics focused on reducing aircraft and engine noise levels, on \ndevelopment of wind shear sensing devices, and on creating technologies \nthat will improve general aviation aircraft.\n  In space science, astronomers using HST's revitalized optics \ndiscovered disks of protoplanetary dust orbiting stars in the Orion \nNebula, suggesting that the formation of planets in the Milky Way and \nelsewhere may be relatively common. Also, HST's revelation of helium in \ndistant constellations provides\n valuable information about the conditions in the universe during its \ninitial evolution. The Spacelab Life Sciences-2, U.S. Microgravity \nPayload-2, and International Microgravity Laboratory-2 greatly \nincreased our understanding of the role of gravity on biological, \nphysical, and chemical processes. In biology, we learned that gravity \naffects the function of the neural connections between brain cells; \nthis can have profound implications for rebuilding damaged brain cells \ndue to strokes and disease. In Earth science, the Space Radar \nLaboratories-1 and -2, plus the Lidar In-Space Technology Experiment \npayload, used powerful radar and laser technology to penetrate cloud \ncover and map critical factors on a global scale. Also, the highly \nsuccessful launch of the Clementine Deep Space Probe tested 23 advanced \ntechnologies for high-tech, lightweight missile defense. The relatively \ninexpensive, rapidly-built spececraft constituted a major revolution in \nspacecraft management and design; it also contributed significantly to \nlunar studies by photographing 1.8 million images of the surface of the \nMoon.\n\n  Additionally, on May 5, 1994, the White House announced that the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Department \nof Defense, and NASA were establishing a joint program to effect the \nconvergence of civil and military polar-orbiting operational \nenvironmental satellite systems into a single operational program. \nOther White House announcements during the year included a policy for \nlicensing U.S. firms by the Secretary of Commerce to operate private \nremote sensing systems and sell their images to domestic and foreign \nentities and a national space transportation policy that will sustain \nand revitalize U.S. space transportation capabilities by providing a \ncoherent strategy for supporting and strengthening U.S. space launch \ncapabilities to meet the growth needs of the civilian and national \nsecurity sectors.\n  Thus, Fiscal Year 1994 was a highly successful one for the U.S. \naeronautics and space programs. Efforts in both areas have contributed \nsignificantly to furthering the Nation's scientific and technical \nknowledge, international cooperation, a healthier environment, and a \nmore competitive economy.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend the Child Care and Development Block Grant \nAct of 1990 to consolidate Federal child care programs, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n   the child care and development block grant amendments act of 1995\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Child \nCare and Development Block Grant Amendments Act of 1995 on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Coats, Senator Kennedy, Senator Dodd, Senator Inouye, \nand Senator Jeffords. This legislation reauthorizes the child care and \ndevelopment block grant of 1990 and makes several important changes to \nthe law.\n  The funding and leadership that the Federal Government has provided \nfor child care has played a critical role in assisting low-income \nworking families to maintain stable employment and helping welfare \nrecipients gain independence. As States try to move welfare recipients \ninto employment, the availability of affordable, quality child care \nwill be of even greater importance. If Congress and the States are \ncommitted to having welfare reform succeed, then there needs to be a \npartnership between Federal and State governments to allocate funding \nfor quality child care.\n  The child care and development block grant was enacted in 1990 with \nbipartisan support. Congress recognized that there was a lack of \nadequate child care for many low-income families. This continues to be \na nationwide problem.\n  According to a 1991 report by the Bureau of the Census, 31 million \nchildren under the age of 15 had mothers employed outside the home--\nalmost 2 million of these children were infants under 1 year of age. \nThis trend is continuing, with more and more mothers entering the work \nforce each year. It has become increasingly difficult for low-income \nworking parents to find affordable child care. Despite the significant \ncontributions the child care and development block grant and other \nFederal child care programs have made in assisting families with their \nchild care needs, there are waiting lists for child care subsidies in \nalmost every State. If Congress does not continue to commit Federal \nfunding for child care, these waiting lists will continue to grow, and \nefforts to reform the welfare system will fail.\n  The legislation which my colleagues and I are introducing provides \nStates funding to provide quality child care for low-income families \nthrough a unified child care system. The Child Care and Development \nBlock Grant Amendments Act of 1995 consolidates Federal discretionary \nprograms that provide child care services. The primary goal of this \nbill is to ensure that there is a seamless system of child care where \nit counts the most--at the point where the parent, child, and provider \nmeet.\n  This legislation maintains most of the critical provisions of the \nchild care and development block grant--a program that has been working \nsuccessfully in the States since its enactment. The bill emphasizes \naccess to quality child care, parental choice, and consumer education. \nThe bill continues to minimal health and safety standards established \nin 1990. The 1995 amendments to the act provide States with the \nflexibility to improve the quality and supply of child care, to design \neligibility requirements through a sliding fee scale, and to provide \nbroader access to referral and resource services for parents and \nproviders. Provisions in the legislation ensure that Federal funds that \nStates use for child care will be funneled through the existing State \nsystem designed to implement the child care and development block \ngrant. The legislation also includes several important provisions \ndesigned to improve the availability of quality child care for native \nAmerican families.\n  The Child Care and Development Block Grant Amendments Act of 1995 \nconsolidates two discretionary programs, the State Department Care \nPlanning and Development Grants and the Child Development Associate \nCredential Scholarship Program. The program is authorized for $1 \nbillion in 1996, and such sums as necessary through the year 2000. This \nauthorization level is based on current funding levels for all three \nprograms, with a slight increase for inflation.\n  I invite my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join with \nSenator Coats, Senator Jeffords, Senator Kennedy, Senator Dodd, Senator \nInouye, and me in cosponsoring the Child Care and Development Block \nGrant Amendments Act of 1995. I hope there is as much bipartisan \nsupport for this reauthorization as there was for the original \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n   The Child Care and Development Block Grant Amendments Act of 1995\n\n\n                                summary\n\n       1. Authorization: The Child Care and Development Block \n     Grant (CCDBG) is amended to include two discretionary \n     programs, the State Dependent Care Planning and Development \n     Grants and the Child Development Associate Credential (CDA) \n     Scholarships, into a discretionary block grant with no state \n     match required. This is consistent with the current CCDBG \n     structure. The authorization for fiscal year 1996 is \n     $1,000,000,000 and such sums as necessary through the year \n     2000.\n       II. State Requirements:\n       A. The health and safety standards that were included in \n     the CCDBG when it was enacted in 1990, are maintained. These \n     standards are broadly defined, and states are given \n     discretion in enforcing them. The standards are: (1) the \n     prevention and control of infectious diseases; (2) building \n     and physical premises safety; and (3) minimum health and \n     safety training appropriate to the provider setting. \n     Providers receiving funds from the block grant (via contract \n     or parent voucher) must meet any existing state and local \n     licensing and regulatory requirements.\n       B. The quality set-aside, which is part of the 1990 act, is \n     maintained. However, it is more broadly defined and gives \n     states discretion in how they choose to spend the money. The \n     only required quality activity is that states must provide \n     consumer education to encourage maximum parental choice and \n     improve availability of child care through a comprehensive \n     referral and resource system. The set-aside is 15 percent of \n     the state allotment.\n       C. States are required to submit a plan, similar to what \n     they currently are providing under the CCDBG, which \n     designates a lead agency and outlines procedures that are in \n     place for assuring parental choice of providers, parental \n     complaints, consumer education, and compliance with state and \n     local licensing and health and safety requirements.\n       D. States shall submit a report to the Secretary of HHS \n     every 2 years specifying how they used the money, the number \n     of children who were assisted, activities that were \n     implemented to encourage a public-private partnership, and \n     the extent and manner in which they implemented a resource \n     and referral network.\n       E. States are required to establish a sliding fee scale \n     that ensures a representative distribution of participation \n     among the working poor and welfare recipients.\n       F. States may not expend more than 5 percent on \n     administrative costs.\n       G. If states expend monies for child care from other \n     federal funding sources, then this funding shall be allocated \n     through the CCDBG. This will reduce federal regulations and\n      requirements by establishing one consolidated child care \n     program. This will also provide beneficiaries with more \n     stability in child care since eligibility requirements \n     will be streamlined.\n       III. Enforcement Mechanisms: If a state is determined (via \n     the HHS appeals and hearing process) to have improperly \n     expended the block grant funds, the Secretary is given the \n     option of: (1) imposing additional requirements to ensure \n     state compliance or correct areas of noncompliance with the \n     act; (2) require states to repay funds improperly expended; \n     (3) deduct from the administrative portion of the state \n     allotment an amount less than or equal to the improperly \n     expended funds; (4) or a combination of these options.\n       IV. Indian Tribes: The following provisions have been added \n     for Indian tribes: (1) allowing tribes to use funds for \n     facilities construction if the Secretary of HHS determines \n     that this is a barrier to providing child care (this applies \n     only to Indian tribes); (2) allowing any tribal allotments \n     that are not expended to be redistributed to other tribes, \n     which is similar to what happens with unused state \n     allotments; and (3) exempting tribes from state licensing \n     requirements and allowing the Secretary, in consultation with \n     the tribes, to develop minimum standards for child care \n     providers that takes into account tribes' needs and available \n     resources. The set-aside for Indian tribes of up to 3 \n     percent, which is part of the 1990 law, has been maintained.\n\n\n                      programs to be consolidated\n\n       Child Care and Development Block Grant--discretionary grant \n     program to help low-income parents pay for child care, to \n     expand [[Page S7390]] early childhood development programs to \n     improve the availability and quality of care. No state match \n     is required. (Enacted in 1990 as part of OBRA '90)\n       FY 94 Actual, $893 million.\n       FY 95 Enacted, $935 million.\n       State Dependent Care Planning and Development Grants--\n     discretionary grant program for child care resource and \n     referral and for before- and after-school child care \n     services. Provides a 75 percent federal matching rate to \n     states.\n       FY 94 Actual, $13 million.\n       FY 95 Enacted, $13 million.\n       Child Development Associate Credential (CDA) Scholarships--\n     discretionary grant program to states to provide scholarships \n     to qualified child care workers to cover the cost of the CDA \n     application, assessment, and credentialing. This credential \n     is awarded by the Council for Early Childhood Professional \n     Recognition. No state match is required.\n       FY 94 Actual, $1 million.\n       FY 95 Enacted, $1 million.\n Mr. COATS. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to join Senator \nKassebaum in introducing the Child Care and Development Block Grant \nAmendments Act of 1995. Since its passage in 1990, this program has, \nand continues to enjoy strong bipartisan, community and grassroots \nsupport. With the assistance provided under this act thousands of \nfamilies have, for the first time, been able to work without fearing \nthe placement of their children in less than quality child care \nenvironments.\n  Currently, 55 percent of all working families enroll their children \nin some form of child care. The dramatic increase in labor force \nparticipation of mothers continues to heighten our awareness of the \nneed for child services. And with the imminent passage of welfare \nreform, the need will undoubtedly be even greater.\n  The goals of a Federal child care program are many. First, to ensure \na safe, healthy and stimulating environment for the children. Second, \nto afford parents the maximum amount of choice in the selection of a \nprovider. Third, to assist with the availability of child care slots. \nFourth, to ensure that limited Federal dollars are targeted to those \nmost in need. And fifth, to distribute funds to States in a way that \nmakes sense, eliminates redtape, and ensures maximum use of resources.\n  I believe we have met each of these goals in this legislation.\n  First, we continue the minimum health and safety standards negotiated \nin 1990. These standards are not prescriptive but they do insist that \nchild care providers provide a safe and healthy environment for \nchildren in their care. Second, parents are able to select from a wide \nrange of child care providers through the use of direct grants, \ncontracts, and parent certificates. These include sectarian providers \nand family day care homes which currently are the largest group of \nproviders of child care services. Third, the authorization level \nreflect a continued Federal priority for quality child care services. \nExpansion of available child care slots is important, but is equally \nimportant to maintain quality in our expansion efforts. The Kassebaum-\nCoats bill strikes this important balance in authorizing a 15-percent \nset-aside for quality improvement. Fourth, the bill targets dollars to \nthe working poor by requiring States to establish a sliding fee scale \nfor families up to 100 percent of the State medium income. And finally, \nwe have included language to ensure that Federal resources used for \nchild care are consolidated into one, uniform system.\n  This last point is significant. In recent years, growing concern has \nbeen expressed about the number of Federal child care programs. The \nGeneral Accounting Office reports there are currently 93 different \nchild care programs administered by 11 Federal agencies and 20 offices, \nat a total cost to the taxpayer of at least $11.5 billion, and that \ndoes not include various tax programs targeted at families with \nchildren.\n  The Kassebaum-Coats bill ensures that those dollars will be used in a \nway that meets the goals of our Federal child care policy and not in \nways that contravene it.\n  In addressing child care within the context of the welfare reform \ndebate we must be careful not to force parents to choose between work, \nand quality day care. Many families, especially low-income working \nfamilies, need help with their child care needs. Solutions and welfare \nreform must be pursued with compassionate realism, recognizing our \nbudgetary limitations, but motivated by a concern for children and \ntheir best interests. The Kassebaum-Coats bill, coupled with the block \ngrant and cash assistance program will significantly help those \nentering the work force with their child care needs--and does so in a \nway that is fiscally responsible.\n  I would again like to thank Senator Kassebaum for her leadership in \nthis area, and hope that this legislation receives swift approval in \nthe Senate.\n\n\n

as follows:\n\n       On page 89, strike lines 1 through 17 and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 306. PROHIBITION OF LEGISLATION THAT WOULD INCLUDE A TAX \n                   CUT UNLESS 90 PERCENT OF THE BENEFITS GO TO THE \n                   MIDDLE CLASS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the incomes of middle-class families have stagnated \n     since the early 1980's, with family incomes growing more \n     slowly between 1979 and 1989 than in any other business cycle \n     since World War II; and\n       (2) according to the Department of the Treasury, in 1996, \n     approximately 90 percent of American families will have \n     incomes less than $100,000.\n       (b) Point of Order.--It shall not be in order in the Senate \n     to consider any bill, resolution, amendment, motion, or \n     conference report that contains a reduction in revenues \n     unless at least 90 percent of the benefits of that reduction \n     goes to working families with annual incomes less than \n     $100,000.\n       (c) Appeals.--Appeals in the Senate from decisions of the \n     Chair relating to this section shall be limited to 1 hour, to \n     be equally divided between and controlled by, the appellant \n     and the manager of the bill or resolution, as the case may \n     be. An affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members of the \n     Senate, duly chosen and sworn, shall be required in the \n     Senate to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a \n     point of order raised under this section.\n       (d) Congressional Budget Office Reports.--Whenever the \n     Director of the Congressional Budget Office shall prepare a \n     report pursuant to section 308 of the Congressional Budget \n     Act of 1974 in connection with a bill, resolution, or \n     conference report that contains a reduction in revenues, the \n     Director shall so state in that report, and, to the extent \n     practicable, shall include an estimate of the amount of the \n     reduction in revenues and the percent of the benefits of that \n     reduction in revenue that will go to working families with \n     annual incomes less than $100,000.\n       (e) Estimates.--Solely for the purposes of enforcement of \n     this section on the Senate floor, the percentage of benefits \n     of a reduction in revenues going to working families with \n     annual incomes less than $100,000 shall be determined on the \n     basis of estimates made by the Congressional Budget Office.\n       (f) Sunset.--This section shall expire at the close of the \n     104th Congress.\n                                 ______\n\n                 KERRY (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 1135\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Simon, and Mr. Feingold) submitted an \namendment intended to be proposed by them to the concurrent resolution \nSenate Concurrent Resolution 13, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 64, strike lines 17 through 19 and insert the \n     following; ``$2,000,000 in fiscal year 1996, $37,000,000 for \n     the period of fiscal years 1996 through 2000, and $72,000,000 \n     for the period of fiscal years 1996''\n       On page 66, line 6, decrease the amount by $70,000,000.\n       On page 66, line 13, decrease the amount by $70,000,000.\n       On page 66, line 14, decrease the amount by $28,000,000.\n       On page 66, line 20, decrease the amount by $70,000,000.\n       On page 66, line 21, decrease the amount by $215,000,000.\n       On page 67, line 2, decrease the amount by $70,000,000.\n       On page 67, line 3, decrease the amount by $4,000,000.\n       On page 67, line 9, decrease the amount by $70,000,000.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the Kerry amendment reduces the \nreconciliation [[Page S7393]] instructions to the Rules Committee by \nthe amount attributable to repeal of the existing system of public \nfinancing and spending limits for Presidential campaigns, which the \nRules Committee would be able to meet only by repealing that system. In \norder to offset the budget effect of reducing the instructions to the \nRules Committee to save the amount of funding attributable to the \nPresidential public financing system, the amendment will leave a \nrequirement for the same amount of savings in Function 800--general \ngovernment--without specifying how the savings are to be achieved, but \nwill lower the nondefense discretionary caps beginning in 1999 by the \nequivalent amount. This will have the effect of giving the \nresponsibility to the Appropriations Committee beginning in that year \nto allocate the aggregate amount of approximately $250 million over the \nperiod covered by the budget resolution to administrative and overhead \nsavings in various Federal agencies, leaving the judgment to the \nAppropriations Committee as to which agencies, for what Function 800 \npurposes, and in what amounts to allocate the spending reductions.\n  This leaves the deficit reduction effects of the budget resolution \nunchanged. It means that this amendment is not subject to a point of \norder.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              WELLSTONE (AND FEINGOLD) AMENDMENT NO. 1136\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. WELLSTONE (for himself and Mr. Feingold) submitted an amendment \nintended to be proposed by them to the concurrent resolution Senate \nConcurrent Resolution 13, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 63, line 7, strike the period and insert the \n     following: ``.

SENSE OF THE CONGRESS ON A UNIFORM ACCOUNTING \n                   SYSTEM IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND \n                   NONPARTISAN COMMISSION ON ACCOUNTING AND \n                   BUDGETING.\n\n       (A) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Much effort has been devoted to strengthening Federal \n     internal accounting controls in the past. Although progress \n     has been made in recent years,\n      there still exists no uniform Federal accounting system for \n     Federal Government entities and institutions.\n       (2) As a result, Federal financial management continues to \n     be seriously deficient, and Federal financial management and \n     fiscal practices have failed to identify costs, failed to \n     reflect the total liabilities of congressional actions, and \n     failed to accurately report the financial condition of the \n     Federal Government.\n       (3) Current Federal accounting practices do not adequately \n     report financial problems of the Federal Government or the \n     full cost of programs and activities. The continued use of \n     these practices undermines the Government's ability to \n     provide credible and reliable financial data, contributes to \n     waste and inefficiency, and will not assist in achieving a \n     balanced budget.\n       (4) Waste and inefficiency in Federal Government undermine \n     the confidence of the American people in the Government and \n     reduces the Federal Government's ability to address \n     adequately vital public needs.\n       (5) To rebuild the accountability and credibility of the \n     Federal Government and restore public confidence in the \n     Federal Government, a uniform Federal accounting system, that \n     fully meets the accounting standards and reporting objectives \n     for the Federal Government, must be immediately established \n     so that all assets and liabilities, revenues and expenditures \n     or expenses, and the full cost of programs and activities of \n     the Federal Government can be consistently and accurately \n     recorded, monitored, and uniformly \n     [[Page S7395]] reported throughout all government entities \n     for budgeting and control and management evaluation purposes.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     resolution include the following assumptions:\n       (1) Uniform federal accounting system.--(A) A uniform \n     Federal accounting system should be established to \n     consistently compile financial data across the Federal \n     Government, and to make full disclosure of Federal financial \n     data, including the full cost of Federal programs and \n     activities, to the citizens, the Congress, the President, and \n     agency management.\n       (B) Beginning with fiscal year 1997, the President should \n     require the heads of agencies to--\n       (i) implement and maintain a uniform Federal accounting \n     system; and\n       (ii) provide financial statements;\n\n     in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles \n     applied on a consistent basis and established in accordance \n     with proposed Federal accounting standards and \n     interpretations recommended by the Federal Accounting \n     Standards Advisory Board and other applicable law.\n       (2) Nonpartisan advisory commission on accounting and \n     budgeting.--(A) A temporary advisory commission should be \n     established to make objective and nonpartisan recommendations \n     for the appropriate treatment of capital expenditures under a \n     uniform Federal accounting system that is consistent with \n     generally accepted accounting principles.\n       (B) The Commission should be appointed on a nonpartisan \n     basis, and should be composed of public and private experts \n     in the fields of finance, economics, accounting, and other \n     related professions.\n       (C) The Commission should report to the President and the \n     Congress by August 1, 1995, on its recommendations, and \n     should include in its report a detailed plan for implementing \n     such recommendations.\n                                 ______\n\n                 DOLE (AND SIMPSON) AMENDMENT NO. 1147\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI (for Mr. Dole for himself and Mr. Simpson) proposed an \namendment to the concurrent resolution Senate Concurrent Resolution 13, \nsupra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   .

SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (A) Findings.--The Senate finds as follows:\n       (1) In order to fulfill its responsibility to communities \n     that were adversely affected by Federal activities, the \n     Congress established the Impact Aid program in 1950.\n       (2) The Impact Aid program is intended to ease the burden \n     on local school districts for educating children who live on \n     Federal property. Since Federal property is exempt from local \n     property taxes, such districts are denied the primary source \n     of revenue used to finance elementary and secondary \n     education. Most Impact Aid payments are made for students \n     whose parents are in the uniformed services, or for students \n     who reside on Indian lands or in federally subsidized low-\n     rent housing projects. Over 1,600 local educational agencies \n     enrolling over 17,000,000 children are provided assistance \n     under the Impact Aid program.\n       (3) The Impact Aid program is one of the few Federal \n     education programs where funds are sent directly to the \n     school district. Such funds go directly into the general fund \n     and may be used as the local educational agency decides.\n       (4) The Impact Aid program covers less than half of what it \n     costs to educate each federally connected student in some \n     school districts, requiring local school districts or States \n     to provide the remainder.\n       (5) Added to the burden described in paragraph (4) is the \n     fact that some States do not rely upon an income tax for \n     State funding of education.

Mr. President, I would like to commend the U.S. \nConference of Mayors for their May 16 letter restating their commitment \nto maintaining the Nation's gun control laws. I share their opposition \nto any efforts to weaken current laws, and I am particularly pleased \nwith their restated commitment to the assault weapons ban.\n  Some people have called for the repeal of the assault weapons ban, \neven before it has an opportunity to demonstrate its effectiveness. \nThese are the same people who argued that these weapons, which law \nenforcement officials have testified serve no purpose other than to \nkill as many human beings as quickly as possible, are legitimate \nproducts with a specially protected status in our society. I disagree \nwith this conclusion.\n  In the aftermath of the tragic bombing in Oklahoma City, the push to \nrepeal the ban has temporarily eased. When exposed to the scrutiny of \nthe public eye, the absurdity of the effort to repeal the ban is \nexposed and the American public has had no trouble recognizing the \ninherent inconsistency of responding to terrorism by loosening common \nsense measures to stem the flow of weapons into our communities.\n  I am pleased that the Senate will not be considering a repeal of the \nassault weapons ban, or any other gun control initiatives, in the short \nrun. However, the efforts to repeal these measures need to be \npermanently removed from Congresses' agenda.\n  Those who call for the repeal of gun control laws do not base their \nobjections on substantive flaws with the measure, for when given an \nopportunity they have proven their worth. During its first year, the \nBrady law has made an impressive contribution to crime-fighting \nefforts. The International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) \nreported on the 1-year anniversary of the Brady laws, implementation \nthat in 27 of the States which did not previously meet Brady's \nrequirements, 19,098 prohibited people were denied from purchasing a \nfirearm. And although there is no national reporting requirement, the \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms estimates that background \nchecks in the past year have stopped 70,000 convicted felons and other \nprohibited persons from purchasing weapons.\n  In addition to fulfilling its primary aim: to stop felons from buying \nguns, the Brady law has assisted law enforcement officials in other \nways. In Georgia, one sheriff reported that out of the 60 people denied \nweapons as a result of the Brady check in the first year, 15 had \noutstanding felony warrants and 15 arrests were made. Brady checks \nhelped police in San Antonio, TX catch a suspected drug dealer, and it \nalso led to the arrest of a man in South Carolina who was wanted for \nassaulting a police officer in Florida.\n  The assault weapons ban should also be given an opportunity to \ndemonstrate its effectiveness.\n  The only way to resist the push to repeal these important laws is for \nthe public to join this debate and make its views known. The U.S. \nconference of Mayors has once again joined the chorus of voices \nsupporting our Nation's gun control laws, and I greatly appreciate \ntheir participation in this important debate.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/24/senate-section/article/S7400-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO MARGARET SWIEZYNSKI\n\n Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, today I rise to commend a \ndistinguished citizen of New Hampshire, Margaret Swiezynski, for her \nmany years of outstanding service to the Republican Party of New \nHampshire and her community.\n  Margaret has dedicated her life to her family and in her spare time \nhas selflessly given her time to the Republican Party. Her commitment \nand dedication to her community are to be commended and her involvement \nin the VFW, Lioness Club, and the local St. Patrick's Church has been \ninstrumental in shaping her community.\n  Over the years, Margaret has seen many Presidential candidates come \nand go in New Hampshire, from President Nixon to President Bush. As \nalways, Margaret played a key role in welcoming these candidates to our \nState and contributed to New Hampshire's reputation for being a key \nstop for everyone on the road to higher office. It is citizens like \nMargaret whose commitment and allegiance make New Hampshire such a \nspecial place to live and her many years of service should be applauded \nand certainly not go unnoticed.\n  Margaret is the proud mother and grandmother of three children and \nsix grandchildren and her commitment is another example of her \ndedication to family and community. It is a characteristic that can be \ncherished by her family and Milford, NH, her home of over 40 years.\n  I, along with all the members of the New Hampshire Republican Party \nand the citizens of Milford, NH, whose lives Margaret has touched \nthrough her loyalty and devotion, would like to extend a heartfelt \nthanks and wish her all the best in her future endeavors.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/24/senate-section/article/S7400-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7400-S7401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  JAMES MADISON COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the James Madison \nCommemorative Coin Act, which I joined my senior colleague from \nVirginia, Senator Warner, in introducing on May l9, l995.\n  This legislation requires the Secretary of the Treasury to issue a \ncoin in the year 2001 commemorating the [[Page S7401]] 250th birthday \nof James Madison and honoring his many accomplishments.

Mr. President, Massachusetts is proud to be home to \nthe North American Okinawan Karate-Do Association. Early in this \ncentury, Kanbum Uechi studied this ancient art on the mainland of China \nwhere it was first developed. Returning to his homeland of Okinawa, he \nintroduced it there in 1910 and was the first master of the Okinawan \nKarate-Do system.\n  In 1956, for the first time, American servicemen were accepted as \nstudents in the Okinawan Karate-Do schools. One of them settled in the \nBoston area after his military discharge and began teaching this art \nform to people in the area. Walter Mattson of Framingham, MA, is the \nsenior American instructor.\n  Over the years, there has been a continuing cultural exchange between \nthe Masters on Okinawa and practitioners here in North America. Mr. \nMattson is primarily responsible for this 35-year exchange program. \nThis summer, Senior Instructor Peter McCrae from Plymouth, MA, will be \nstudying on Okinawa with Master Shintoku Takara.\n  Many Americans have found in Okinawan Karate-Do a physical and mental \ndiscipline which promotes positive attitudes, good health, and self-\nmastery. Our young people have found in it an alternative to the \nstreets and, in its instructors, positive role models. We are grateful \nfor this Japanese import and we hope that this positive exchange \nbetween our two countries continues for many years.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/24/senate-section/article/S7401-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n            WILMER JONES-HAM RECEIVES MAHALIA JACKSON AWARD\n\n Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, an issue of the journal entitled \nUniformed Services Journal, May-June 1995, contains an article \nentitled, ``World War II Revisited: A Retrospect Of V-E Day and the \nEvents Leading Up To It.''\n  The article includes recollections of some of the distinguished \nMembers of the Congress who participated in World War II, among them \nSenator Strom Thurmond, Senator Bob Dole, Senator Daniel Inouye, \nCongressmen Tom Bevill, Sam Gibbons, Sonny Montgomery, and others.\n  It is an excellent reminiscence of their experiences and their views \nabout the significance of V-E Day and their personal involvement in the \nevents leading up to that occasion.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the article from the Uniformed \nServices Journal be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nWorld War II Revisited: A Retrospect of V-E Day and the Events Leading \n                                Up To It\n\n                           (By Cathy Lumsden)\n\n       World War II (WW II) represents many things to many people. \n     It represents sacrifice, freedom and hope for a better \n     tomorrow. The road to freedom was paved with death and \n     destruction. Many of you are familiar with Jim Pennington's \n     stories of WW II at retiree recognition programs, chapter \n     events and in the USJ, some more than once. But these stories \n     and memories that follow are more than just stories. In \n     today's climate of historical revisionism and political \n     correctness, they remain as one of the few accurate eye-\n     witness accounts of the making of American history in the \n     Great War that literally saved the world. We cannot forget \n     why we fought WWII, ``the war to end all wars'' or the men \n     and women who fought the war. The thoughts and feelings that \n     follow are real. Take the time to read and understand the \n     contributions these Americans made in the fight for freedom.\n\n\n                         senator strom thurmond\n\n       Sen. Thurmond was serving as a Circuit Judge in his home \n     state when war was declared on Germany. On that day, he \n     called President Roosevelt and volunteered, even though he \n     was exempted from service. Approximately a year later in \n     1943, LTC Thurmond, USA was a member of the 82nd Airborne \n     Division assigned to First Army Headquarters in Europe. He is \n     the only Senator still serving in Congress who participated \n     in the Normandy Invasion on D-Day.\n       He was one of three men who volunteered to land in Normandy \n     aboard a glider. The fire was so heavy that his glider was \n     forced to go north to find a safer spot to land. Instead of \n     it getting safer, it got worse. The glider landed in an apple \n     orchard nearby. He was injured in the landing in the \n     forehead, hand and knee. However, LTC Thurmond still joined \n     the rest of the forces in the subsequent battles of the \n     Invasion. LTC Thurmond would have preferred to have jumped \n     but there wasn't sufficient time to train for the jump. After \n     the invasion, he returned to Army Headquarters just as his \n     unit got ready to go into St-Lo and into Paris.\n       On V-E Day, LTC Thurmond was in Leipzig, Germany when he \n     learned of the end of [[Page S7402]] the war in Europe. He \n     and his unit were disappointed that they were not allowed to \n     take Berlin and had to let the Russians take it. LTC Thurmond \n     was one of the men who uncovered and helped liberate \n     Buchenwald Concentration Camp. He paints a grim picture of \n     what he saw. ``I have never seen anything like it in my life. \n     Bodies stacked up like cord wood, eight to ten feet high, \n     those who had died and those who were still living . . . They \n     killed them in one of three ways; by starving them to death \n     with one bowl of thin pea soup per day . . . inducing them to \n     climb a fence to get out, where they were shot . . . or they \n     (the prisoners) were told to go into a big booth like a \n     telephone booth and wait until the SS guards came in . . . \n     they (prisoners) would go into the front of the booth and the \n     SS Guards would go into the back of the booth and hit them \n     with a mallet and smash their heads and kill them . . . The \n     wife of the Commander was particularly cruel, she would take \n     the skin from anyone who had tatoos to make lamp shades . . \n     .'' Sen. Thurmond was selected to go on to the Pacific. He \n     went to Fort Jackson, SC for a month, then by train to \n     California and then on to the Philippines. LTC Thurmond was \n     in the Philippines when\n      the war ended. He captured a number of Japanese troops. He \n     returned to Fort Bragg, NC and was called back to the \n     Supreme Court of South Carolina. Sen. Thurmond was awarded \n     five Battle Stars with the 82nd Airborne Division. For his \n     military service, he earned 18 decorations, and awards, \n     including the Legion of Merit with Oak Leaf Cluster, \n     Purple Heart, Bronze Star for Valor, Belgian Order of the \n     Crown and the French Croix de Guerre.\n\n\n                        senator bob dole (r-ks)\n\n       Senator Dole shares his thoughts on WW II and V-E Day, we \n     should take a moment to remember America's place in the \n     world. When I witnessed the emotion of those gathered on the \n     beaches of France last summer, memories came flooding back--\n     memories of heroism, sacrifice and the pain men and women \n     suffered. We must never be reluctant about our greatness as a \n     country--nor ashamed of our national strength. There is one \n     responsibility only the federal government has, and that is \n     to protect our freedom. We must stop placing the agenda of \n     the United Nations before the interest of the United States. \n     Let us remember that America has been the greatest force for \n     good the world has ever known. Before visiting France last \n     year, I was in Northern Italy where I served in the Tenth \n     Mountain Division 50 years before. While revisiting the \n     battle sites, I thought about why we had been sent there, \n     about the America we were risking our lives to protect and \n     about the hopes for the generations to follow. As we open the \n     door to another century, we can celebrate the fact that the \n     world is a safer, freer place because of American leadership. \n     We must continue to do what we have always done best--leading \n     by example.\n       Senator Dole was a Platoon Leader with the legendary Tenth \n     Mountain Division. Cpt. Dole was injured while serving in \n     Northern Italy on April 14, 1945. He was awarded two Purple \n     Hearts and one Bronze Star with Oak Leaf Cluster.\n\n\n                      senator daniel inouye (d-hi)\n\n       Sen Inouye was awarded a battlefield commission in Italy as \n     a Second Lieutenant in the United States Army. This occurred \n     just as his unit, the 442nd Regimental Combat Team left to \n     rescue ``The Lost Battalion'' of the 141st Infantry. It had \n     been surrounded and was desperately short of supplies and \n     ammunition.Two days later he left to join his outfit. By the \n     time he reached them, the bloody battle of The Lost Battalion \n     was over. ``My platoon, numbering 20 men when I left, now had \n     11 capable of carrying a weapon--and that included me.'' Lt. \n     Inouye considered himself lucky thanks to two silver dollars \n     that he carried through every campaign. One was bent and the \n     other cracked almost in two from the impact of a German \n     bullet in France. (Sen. Inouye served in both France and \n     Italy.) He carried them in his breast pocket but on the night \n     of April 20, 1945, lost them. Despite his better judgment, he \n     could not shake the fear that something was about to happen.\n       At first light (April 21, 1945), his unit (E Company) \n     jumped. E Company's objective was Colle Musatello, a high and \n     heavily defended ridge. Lt. Inouye's Company managed to make \n     it within 40 yards of the German bunkers then almost at once \n     three machine guns opened up at them. He took a hit in the \n     stomach but still continued to fight. Finally he was close \n     enough to pull the pin on the last grenade. ``As I drew my \n     arm back, a German stood waist-high in the bunker. He was \n     aiming a rifle grenade at me from a range of ten yards. And \n     then as I cocked my arm to throw, he fired, and the grenade \n     smashed into my right elbow. It exploded and all but tore my \n     arm off . . . The German was reloading his rifle, but my \n     grenade blew up in his face. I stumbled to my feet, closing \n     on the bunker, firing my tommy gun lefthanded, the useless \n     right arm slapping red and wet against my side . . . a bullet \n     caught me in the right leg. The German resistance in our \n     sector ended April 23. Nine days later, the war in Italy was \n     over, and a week after that the enemy surrendered \n     unconditionally.'' Senator Inouye was awarded the \n     Distinguished Service Cross, the Purple Heart with Oak Leaf \n     Cluster and the Bronze Star.\n\n\n                   congressman tom bevill (d-4th-al)\n\n       Last year, I participated in the commemoration of the 50th \n     Anniversary of the D-Day Invasion on the coast of Normandy, \n     France. The men who participated in that invasion will always \n     be remembered for their heroism. It brought back many \n     memories for me, although I was not part of the initial \n     invasion. As a new Army Second Lieutenant, I was sent to \n     England in late February of 1944, less than four months \n     before D-Day. I was in a staging area with the 5th Armored \n     Division, where I assisted in drilling the troops who were in \n     the first wave to storm the coast of Normandy. At night we \n     would load the troops on ships with their rifles and \n     ammunition and send them out under cover of darkness. They \n     did not know where they were going. They would land somewhere \n     along the coast of Normandy. I remember how anxious the \n     troops were. I realized it was no drill the day we issued \n     emergency rations to the troops. Suddenly, they were provided \n     kits with a several days' supply of chocolate bars, \n     cigarettes and K-rations. We had never done that before. And, \n     that's how we knew it was the real thing. I will never think \n     of myself as a war hero. I am not. That honor goes to men \n     like my colleague, Congressman Sam Gibbons of Florida, who \n     parachuted behind the German lines on D-Day. That honor goes \n     to men like the late Congressman Bill Nichols of Alabama who \n     lost a leg in WW II. That honor goes to Travis Alvis, my \n     childhood friend from Townley, who was killed in the D-Day \n     Invasion. That honor goes to many, many others who stormed \n     the beaches of Normandy in the name of freedom and democracy.\n\n\n                  congressman sam gibbons (d-11th-fl)\n\n       Congressman Gibbons served in WWII as an Army Captain in \n     the 501st Parachute Infantry of the 101st Airborne. Gibbons \n     was a member of the initial assault force which invaded\n      Normandy on D-Day. He is the only Member of the House of \n     Representatives serving today who participated in the \n     Invasion. He chose to remember V-E Day like this:\n       ``V-E Day was a beautiful, sunny day. The weather was warm \n     where I was in Paris and everyone was absolutely jubliant. I \n     actually drove my jeep down the Champs-Elysees and weaved in \n     and out of people dancing there. I saw V-E Day at the best \n     time, from the best place.''\n\n\n              congressman ``sonny'' montgomery (d-3rd-ms)\n\n       I served in the European Theatre during WW II. I was a \n     Second Lieutenant with the 12th Armored Division which \n     arrived in France in November, 1944. We were assigned to the \n     Seventh Army part of the time and with the Third Army part of \n     the time as we drove through France and Germany. We were in \n     heavy combat during the fall and winter of 1944 and 1945. The \n     toughest battle was against well-entrenched German forces at \n     Herlisheim on January 9-10, 1945. We lost a number of tanks \n     in the fighting there, but we held back a German \n     counterattack and finally broke through enemy defenses. The \n     German resistance began to break up after that and we then \n     moved at a rapid pace toward the Rhine River. Another \n     significant event occurred in April when elements of the \n     Twelfth Armored Division captured the bridge over the Danube \n     River at Dillingen before German demolition men could wreck \n     it. Securing that bridge provided a vital artery for Allied \n     troops to flood into southern Germany and helped speed up our \n     efforts to end the war.\n       We helped liberate a number of concentration camps in \n     Germany as the war neared its end. We drove past hundreds of \n     freed Jewish prisoners walking and sometimes stumbling, along \n     the road. The sight of these improverished people in their \n     tattered clothes is something even the most hardened soldiers \n     can never forget. I was in southern Germany when I heard the \n     Armed Forces Radio broadcast that the war in Europe had \n     ended, but I had little time to celebrate. I got orders a \n     week later to go to the Pacific theater and prepare for the \n     invasion of Japan. That invasion, of course, was averted when \n     we dropped the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\n\n                   radm eugene b. fluckey (usn-ret.)\n\n       Rear Admiral Fluckey, author of Thunder Below was \n     Commanding Officer of the submarine USS Barb. He received the \n     Medal of Honor and four Navy Crosses and is a veteran of \n     eleven war patrols during WW II. RADM Fluckey is credited \n     with the most tonnage sunk by a U.S. skipper in WW II, \n     seventeen ships including a carrier, raider-carrier and a \n     frigate. He is proudest of the fact that no one attached to \n     the Barb received the Purple Heart and that the sub came back \n     ready and eager to fight again. In the Atlantic, he chased \n     German submarines but his biggest contributions were in the \n     Pacific theatre. His contributions there will be highlighted \n     in the upcoming V-J issue of the USI.\n               corporal chase fielding (usa), former pow\n\n       CPL Fielding arrived in Normandy on D+7 as part of the 29th \n     Division going in to replace the 13th Airborne Division. They \n     made it up to St-Lo which was later leveled by the Air Corps. \n     Three days later, he was only one of three men remaining in \n     his platoon, and was taken prisoner on June 30, 1944. Under \n     American artillery fire, he along with two others were taken \n     to Stalag XII A on the outskirts of Limsburg. ``We were fed \n     bread and soup, bread and tea in the morning and water soup \n     the next two meals. . . . Our meat consisted of worms which \n     somehow got in the soup.'' We traveled by train for five days \n     and five nights, forty to fifty men in a small boxcar. We \n     were let out only twice to [[Page S7403]] perform our \n     toilets. Ate, slept and excreted in the same place. It was \n     suffocatingly hot during the day, and with little ventilation \n     and sometimes without water for thirty-six hours, quite a few \n     passed out.\n       Upon arrival in Limsburg, we had our first bath since the \n     middle of July. We left Stalag XII A on August 24 and arrived \n     at 4-B (Muhlburg) on August 26 and were put into barracks. \n     ``The camp was like heaven compared to the others. . . . I \n     met a member of Tito's band, age 15, and (who had been) \n     wounded twice. There was a kid there, a machine-gunner, who \n     was only eleven years old. . . . The Russians were treated \n     horribly. In some Russian barracks cannibalism had occurred. \n     They were like sticks, and when too weak to move were thrown \n     in a lime pit. . . . One huge field there was fertilized with \n     10,000 bodies of Jews.'' On September 14th, CPL Fielding \n     moved out as part of a working party. He passed through \n     Dresden on the 15th and entered Sudatenland that night. On \n     the 16th, the working party was housed at Falkensaw where it \n     worked in coal mines. CPL Fielding went on his first sick \n     call on October 6th due to boils. He was treated by a Serbian \n     doctor in the Russian compound. A week and a half later, he \n     developed an abscess and underwent surgery. A hole the size \n     of an egg was left by a French surgeon purposely to keep him \n     out of the mines for awhile. Mr. Fielding's health worsened \n     in November because of another abscess, swollen tonsils and \n     diphtheria.\n       Later an abscess was removed from the back of his head \n     simply by cutting his head open without any painkiller. About \n     a month later, he was returned to the commando and also to \n     work in the mines. Rumors that Americans were coming closer \n     began in April. Late in April, CPL Fielding and several other \n     prisoners escaped and hid in a bomb shelter. He headed due \n     west. The woods were full of\n      Germans. Picking up information of SS troop movements, the \n     group was able to avoid the SS. On April 27th (officially \n     the 28th) they reached a Yank outpost. CPL Fielding later \n     learned that those prisoners who stayed behind were the \n     last to be liberated in Europe and when found were in such \n     a state that many could hardly walk. A great many had \n     died.\n\n\n                    CAPT FRANK X. RILEY (uscg-ret.)\n\n       Captain Riley graduated from the Coast Guard Academy on \n     June 19, 1942. He was assigned as Executive Officer on LCI \n     323 which was designated as Task Force Command Ship (TFCS) \n     and was the first LCI to leave the States. He served aboard \n     the LCI off the North African, Italian and Sicilian coasts; \n     as Commanding Officer of the vessel, he participated in the \n     Normandy Invasion. During the Invasion at Normandy. Captain \n     Riley remembers that two hundred troops were loaded in the \n     troop compartment. His ship, a salvage vessel saved the lives \n     of 1500 Army personnel and salvaged 30 Landing Craft \n     Personnel Vehicles (LCPV) and 50 larger vessels known as \n     LCMs. Six New York City fire-fighters were put onboard the \n     Landing Craft-Infantry (LCI) to control fires. General Omar \n     Bradley rode the LCI twice, with his second ride being to \n     Omaha Beach.\n\n\n                   CAPT QUENTIN R. WALSH (USCG-RET.)\n\n       Captain Walsh graduated from the Coast Guard Academy in \n     1933. On December 7, 1941, his ship (APA) Joseph Dickman was \n     part of a secret U.S. Navy convoy ``William Sail 12X'' \n     approaching Cape Town South Africa. His ship returned to the \n     United States on February 28, 1942 after having been diverted \n     to India. His ship then became involved in the Battle of the \n     Atlantic, surviving a torpedo attack May 15, 1942. Captain \n     Walsh was assigned to the staff of Commander, U.S. Naval \n     Forces, Europe in the Planning and Logistics Section. He was \n     assigned to the planning for Operation Overlord and Phase \n     Neptune and the logistics requirement for Cherbourg and \n     LeHavre. He organized, trained and commanded U.S. Navy Task \n     Unit 127.2.8 which landed over Beach Utah attached to the 7th \n     Corps, U.S. Army. ``My Task Unit 127.2.8 (from June 26--June \n     29, 1944):\n       1. Cleaned out the last resistance in the Arsenal.\n       2. Plotted and delivered the mine fields in the harbor to \n     the British mine sweepers off the port.\n       3. Established United States Navy Headquarters, Cherbourg.\n       We had to have Cherbourg to sustain the invasion (Normandy) \n     and the Germans knew it.'' Task Unit 127.2.8 entered \n     Cherbourg by going over the top of Fort duRoule with the 79th \n     Division on June 26, 1944. Subsequently, he led a heavily-\n     armed unit, equipped with submachine guns, hand grenades and \n     bazookas the cleaned out the last resistance in the Cherbourg \n     Arsenal, established U.S. Navy Headquarters in Cherbourg, \n     and, by interrogating slave laborers, Free French and German \n     prisoners, obtained and plotted the mine fields in Cherbourg \n     harbor. Captain Walsh carried out the reconnaissance of ports \n     in Brittany from St. Malo to Brest attached to Patton's Third \n     Army, 8th Corps, until ordered to carry out the \n     reconnaissance of LeHavre with the First Canadian Army on \n     September 12, 1944. Captain Walsh considers his three most \n     important contributions to the Invasion of Normandy as; U.S. \n     Navy Task Unit 127.2.8, the capture of German mine fields, \n     Cherbourg and the capture of Fort duHomet.\n       These are just of few of the brave men who along with women \n     saved the world. Without them and others like them, democracy \n     as we know it, would not exist. We thank them for their \n     heroism and salute them one and all.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/24/senate-section/article/S7401-5", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, MAY 25, 1995\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.
