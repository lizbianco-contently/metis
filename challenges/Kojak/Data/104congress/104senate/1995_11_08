Under the previous order, 9:30 a.m. having \narrived, the Senate will now resume consideration of H.R. 1833, which \nthe clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1833) to amend title 18, United States Code, \n     to ban partial-birth abortion.\n\n  The Senate resumed the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                   Motion to Commit With Instructions\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nPennsylvania [Mr. Specter] is recognized to make a motion to commit \nwith the time until 12:30 p.m. equally divided and controlled between \nthe Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Smith] and the Senator from \nPennsylvania [Mr. Specter].\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair. I thank the distinguished President \npro tempore.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of Senators Jeffords, Snowe, Campbell, \nKassebaum, Simpson, and Cohen, I move to commit H.R. 1833 to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary with instructions to hold not less than one \nhearing on this bill and report the bill with amendments, if any, back \nto the Senate within 19 days.\n  The motion to commit with instructions is as follows:\n\n\n                   motion to commit with instructions\n\n       Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, Ms. Snowe, Mr. \n     Campbell, Ms. Kassebaum, Mr. Simpson, and Mr. Cohen) moves to \n     commit the bill H.R. 1833 to the Committee on the Judiciary \n     with instructions to hold not less than one hearing on such \n     bill and report the bill, with amendments (if any), back to \n     the Senate within 19 days.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have selected a bare minimum amount of \ntime, which is really only a 9-day commitment from today, November 8, \nuntil November 17 when the Senate will go out of session under a \npreviously announced recess period by the majority leader. And then \nthere would be an additional 10 days while the Senate is in recess, \nfrom November 17 to November 27, for a total of 19 days. But the \neffective period of this referral, as I say, will only be for 9 days.\n  After considerable thought, I have abbreviated the referral period to \nthis very short time to emphasize to everyone the importance of the \nissue and the need to have very prompt consideration and to allay any \nconcern or reject any argument that this referral is being made to, in \neffect, defeat the bill.\n  Mr. President, I submit that this kind of consideration and this kind \nof a hearing is really indispensable because of the very complex \nmatters which are involved in this issue. I would enumerate them as \nhumanitarian considerations, medical considerations, statutory \ninterpretation considerations, and constitutional considerations.\n  The humanitarian considerations have been broached to a significant \nextent in terms of the circumstances of the mother and the \ncircumstances of the fetus with considerable doubt as to what actually \noccurs during these so-called late-term abortions. It is a very \ncomplicated picture as to what pain and suffering is sustained by the \nfetus, a subject which requires our very thorough consideration because \nof the very serious humanitarian implications on pain and suffering to \nthe fetus during the course of this medical procedure.\n  The matter has had a very, very brief hearing in the House of \nRepresentatives--as I understand it, for less than a full day.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of my \nstatement the full transcript of the hearing before the House of \nRepresentatives may be printed in the Record so that everyone in the \nSenate who will be considering this matter in the course of the next \nday or two, or however long it takes, will have an opportunity to see \nthe brevity of those hearings and the impossibility of consideration of \nthe many complicated issues which are involved in this matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, there is no question about the chilling \neffect \n\n[[Page S 16762]]\nof this medical procedure. It is something that, I submit, has to be \nunderstood thoroughly on all sides.\n  I say candidly that I am not sure what my ultimate judgment would be \non this kind of a medical procedure if, as some claim, it is really \ninfanticide. I have spent a large portion of my career as a district \nattorney being very much concerned about the issue of homicide, which \ntakes many, many forms. And, if we genuinely have an issue of \ninfanticide--the killing of an infant--that is something which existing \nlaw does not tolerate, and that is something which has to be considered \nvery, very carefully on the basic question of whether there is an \ninfant where the medical procedures would take the life of the infant, \nor whether we do not have an infant in the contemplation of the law. \nAnd that is something which has to be considered carefully.\n  There has been considerable controversy as to just what the medical \ncircumstances are with the children who are involved. One case, which I \nhave had referred to me through the media, involved a fetus where the \nbrain had grown outside the skull so that on the medical procedure \ninvolved it was not a question of whether the baby would die, not a \nquestion of whether the fetus would die, but only a question of when \nand how.\n  Other matters that I have heard about involve situations where the \nmothers and the fathers were desperately interested in saving the \npregnancy but the medical facts were such that there was such severe \nbrain damage and heart damage that there really was not a live human \nbeing.\n  There will doubtless be considerable discussion on the floor of the \nSenate today about the status of the fetus on these medical procedures.\n  I suggest that while argument and debate is obviously a very \nimportant part of our process, a more important part of our process \ninvolves the hard medical facts as to what is involved. That really \nrequires medical testimony as opposed to the kinds of arguments which \nare traditionally made on the Senate floor. Those arguments have real \nvalue, but they have to be evaluated and judged in the context of what \nthe hard medical evidence is. On this date of the record, at least from \nthe House hearings, there is not much to go on. So that I think this is \na matter which cries out for that kind of a hearing and the \nestablishment of the evidence to enable the Senate to make a judgment.\n  I find it, candidly, a little hard to understand the procedures which \nbrought this legislation to the floor without a hearing by the \nJudiciary Committee. But facing the procedural posture of this matter, \nthe remedy is to move from the decision of the majority leader to put \nthis matter in the Chamber to having consideration by the full Senate \nas to what is the appropriate course. It is rumored that this is going \nto be a close vote. I do not know whether that is true or not. But if \nwe send this matter to committee for hearings, we may be saving \nconsiderable time because if the vote is close on a motion to commit as \nto having a simple majority, I think it is fair to say it is unlikely \nthere would be the 60 votes present to cut off debate. So that prompt \naction by the Senate in sending the matter to committee may well save \nus time, not only in the long run but in the short run as well.\n  Beyond the considerations of humane treatment for the fetus and the \nmother, we then come to very, very complex questions of statutory \ninterpretation which I submit have not been thought through by the \nproponents of this bill in the House or by the hasty action that it \nwent through in the House and the heavily emotionally charged context.\n  According to the information provided to me, there is a real question \nas to the applicability of this statute in the broader terms of how a \nfetus is delivered. Subsection (b) provides that a partial-birth \nabortion is defined as ``an abortion in which the person performing the \nabortion partially vaginally delivers a living fetus before killing the \nfetus and completing the delivery.''\n  On a note, a statutory interpretation--and again, candidly, I think \nthis needs further verification and further analysis, but according to \nthis definition the prohibition established in H.R. 1833 would not \napply to (1) abortions performed by C section or hysterectomy, that is, \nwhere the fetus is not extracted vaginally, and it would not apply \neither to abortions in which the fetus is acted upon prior to being \nmoved into the birth canal.\n  So what we may realistically be doing here is to be legislating in a \nhalfway manner in the area of vaginal births without other ways of \ndealing with the issue which ought to be dealt with in terms of \neffective legislation, if this is, indeed, an issue with which we feel \nwe ought to deal.\n  Subsection (c) then establishes an affirmative defense to the \nprosecution of a physician performing a partial-birth abortion if it is \nestablished by a preponderance of the evidence that the physician \nreasonably believed that ``the partial-birth abortion was necessary to \nsave the life of the mother; and no other procedure would suffice for \nthat purpose.''\n  As a matter of statutory interpretation, there are very complex \nissues involved where you provide for an affirmative defense as opposed \nto making those elements of proof a part of the prosecutor's case. In a \ncriminal case, the Government has the burden of proving beyond a \nreasonable doubt all of the elements in a prosecution, and it may well \nbe that this language is ineffective as a matter of law to shift the \nburden of proof to the defendant.\n  There are many items which have been affirmative defenses such as \nalibi, not being present at the time the offense was committed, which \nhave been incorporated into the prosecutor's affirmative duty to show \nbeyond a reasonable doubt all elements of the offense. There is no \nindication that any consideration has been given on that complex \nsubject by the House of Representatives.\n  The constitutional issues are present here because the Supreme Court \nof the United States has held that the States may prohibit an abortion \nin late term--``may proscribe an abortion except where it is necessary \nin an appropriate medical judgment for the preservation of the life or \nhealth of the mother,'' language from Roe versus Wade.\n  That involves making the life of the mother an affirmative defense, \nand it also opens a broader context as to whether the health of the \nmother would be an exception to the prohibition against the State's \neliminating late-term abortions.\n  This is a very shorthanded description, in the course of having a \nrelatively limited amount of time available for this issue in this \nChamber because of our crowded calendar, but these are matters which \ncould be taken up in some detail in the course of the 9 days between \nnow and the 17th, when the Senate is in session or when the Judiciary \nCommittee may see fit to interrupt the recess process. And I can speak \nfor myself. I would be glad to be here to take whatever time is \nnecessary on a hearing or hearings so that these matters may be \ninquired into and we may legislate, if at all, in a rational way.\n  There is another consideration involved here that I do not intend to \ndwell on, but that is the consideration which is articulated so \nfrequently in this Chamber. That is the appropriate area of legislation \nfor the Federal Government in terms of federalism generally and in \nterms of the 10th amendment where Members of this body are proud to \npull from their vest pocket the 10th amendment which specifies that all \nmatters not expressly given to the Congress are reserved to the States.\n  Subsection (a) provides:\n\n       Whoever, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, \n     knowingly performs a partial-birth abortion and thereby kills \n     a human fetus shall be fined under this title or imprisoned \n     not more than 2 years or both.\n\n  It raises a real question basically as to whether this is a matter \nappropriately for the Congress. Provisions of the criminal law are \ntraditionally left to the States. Recently, the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States in the Lopez case sharply limited the authority of the \nCongress of the United States to legislate in areas which have long \nbeen viewed as areas where the Congress had authority. So that we do \nhave State legislatures ready, willing, and able to act affirmatively \non the subject.\n  On this date of the record, I do not know what States, if any, have \nmoved to legislate on late-term abortions. But \n\n[[Page S 16763]]\nI think it ought to be at least mentioned with whatever degree of \nemphasis we choose to make on it as to the Federal considerations which \nare involved here.\n  Customarily, when you have issues involving jurisdiction, our pattern \nhas been to move a little fast over any such considerations, as we have \nbeen known to move a little fast over constitutional considerations, \nleaving those matters ultimately for the courts.\n  But where you have a matter of overwhelming importance on the \nconstitutional issue of life of the mother, or health of the mother, \nand especially where even the most restrictive interpretations on \nabortion have always carved out an exception for life of the mother, \nthis statute does not do that.\n  This statute purports to have it raised only as an affirmative \ndefense, which is very different from even under the restrictive \ninterpretations of when an abortion may be performed excepting life of \nthe mother.\n  Then the issue of jurisdiction, again, not often focused on the floor \nof either the Senate or the House of Representatives, is worthy of \nconsideration.\n  But I would say, Mr. President, that the fundamental considerations \nreally here involve the humanitarian considerations: What is actually \nhappening to the fetus? Is the fetus subjected to pain and suffering? \nIf so, is there a way that the legislation could encompass a procedure \nwhich would eliminate that pain and suffering? What are the \nhumanitarian considerations involved for the life of the mother?\n  If it is determined medically that it is preferable to have the fetus \nacted upon vaginally, as opposed to alternatives which are apparently \nnot covered by the statute, a C section, hysterotomy, or where action \nis taken on the fetus prior to removal from the birth canal, why should \nthe Congress of the United States rush to judgment to criminalize a \nmedical procedure which is in the vaginal channel as opposed to a \nhysterotomy or C section or action prior to the entry of the fetus into \nthe vaginal channel, where those matters are really matters for the \nmedical profession as opposed to the Congress? At least should not the \nCongress be informed as to the intricacies of these matters before we \npass judgment on a matter of this great importance?\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\nHearing on Partial-Birth Abortion Before the House of Representatives, \nSubcommittee on the Constitution, Committee on the Judiciary, June 15, \n                                  1995\n\n       The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:23 a.m., in \n     room 2237, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Charles Canady \n     (chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.\n       Present: Representatives Canady, Hyde, Inglis, \n     Sensenbrenner, Hoke, Goodlatte, Frank, Conyers, and \n     Schroeder.\n       Also Present: Representative Jackson Lee.\n       Staff Present: Kathyrn Hazeem, chief counsel; Keri \n     Harrison, counsel; Jennifer Welch, secretary; Jacquelene \n     McKee, secretary; and Robert Raben, minority counsel.\n       Mr. Canady [presiding]. The subcommittee will come to \n     order. I am pleased to have the opportunity to hold this \n     hearing to examine the partial-birth abortion procedure. We \n     will hear primarily from medical experts today. They will \n     describe the partial-birth abortion procedure in which a live \n     baby's entire body, except for the head, is delivered before \n     the baby is killed, after which the practitioner completes \n     the delivery. They will testify regarding whether the baby \n     undergoing this procedure feels pain.\n       We invited two of the abortionists who specialize in and \n     advocate the use of this type of abortion. They agreed to \n     testify. But apparently after further consideration, they \n     found that their position was a position they did not wish to \n     speak to the subcommittee about today. I am very disappointed \n     to report that both practitioners canceled at the last \n     minute.\n       This hearing focuses on partial birth abortion because \n     while every abortion sadly takes a human life, this method \n     takes that life as the baby emerges from the mother's womb \n     while the baby is in the birth canal. The difference between \n     the partial-birth abortion procedure and homicide is a mere \n     three inches.\n       A fundamental principle on which our country was founded is \n     that we are endowed by our creator with the unalienable right \n     to life. Roe v. Wade alienated that right from a powerless \n     group by taking away their legal personhood. Richard John \n     Neuhouse correctly stated that, ``We need never fear the \n     charge of crimes against humanity so long as we hold the \n     power to define who does and who does not belong to \n     humanity.'' The Supreme Court instituted abortion on demand \n     by deciding that unborn human beings do not belong to \n     humanity.\n       Partial-birth abortion procedures go a step beyond abortion \n     on demand. The baby involved is not unborn. His or her life \n     is taken during a breech delivery. A procedure which \n     obstetricians use in some circumstances to bring a healthy \n     child into the world is perverted to result in a dead child. \n     The physician, traditionally trained to do everything in his \n     power to assist and protect both mother and child during the \n     birth process deliberately kills the child in the birth \n     canal.\n       Because we believe it is an inhuman act, Barbara \n     Vucanovich, Tony Hall, Henry Hyde, and I introduced a bill \n     yesterday with 28 of our colleagues to ban the performance of \n     partial-birth abortion. Partial-birth abortion is defined in \n     the bill as, and I quote, ``An abortion in which the person \n     performing the abortion partially vaginally delivers a living \n     fetus before killing the fetus and completing the delivery.''\n       On June 12, the National Abortion Federation sent a letter \n     to Members of Congress in response to a letter Barbara \n     Vucanovich and I sent to inform our colleagues of our \n     intention to introduce the partial-birth abortion ban. The \n     National Abortion Federation letter made a number of claims \n     about the partial-birth abortion procedure that are \n     inconsistent with the statements of Drs. McMahon and Haskell, \n     two abortionists who use and advocate the use of the \n     procedure.\n       The letter claims that the drawings of the partial-birth \n     abortion procedure that we included with our Dear Colleague \n     are highly imaginative and misleading. But Dr. Haskell \n     himself told the American Medical News that the drawings were \n     accurate from a technical point of view.\n       Professor Watson Bowes of the University of North Carolina \n     at Chapel Hill, a distinguished physician and prominent \n     authority on fetal and maternal medicine, and coeditor of the \n     Obstetrical and Gynological Survey, reviewed an article by \n     Dr. Haskell describing a partial-birth abortion procedure and \n     confirmed that the drawings are an accurate representation of \n     the procedure described in the article by Dr. Haskell.\n       The National Abortion Federation letter also claims that \n     the fetal demise is virtually always induced by the \n     combination of steps taken to prepare for the abortion \n     procedure. Both Dr. Haskell and Dr. McMahon, however, told \n     American Medical News that the majority of fetuses aborted \n     this way are alive until the end of the procedure. In a \n     Dayton News interview, Dr. Haskell referred to the scissors \n     thrust that occurs after the baby's entire body is delivered \n     and only the head of the baby is still lodged in the birth \n     canal as the act that kills the baby. He said, and I quote, \n     ``When I do the instrumentation on the skull, it destroys the \n     brain sufficiently so that even if it,'' that is, the baby's \n     head, ``falls out at that point, it definitely is not \n     alive.''\n       After his review of Dr. Haskell's article, Professor Bowes \n     concluded that the fetuses are alive at the time the partial-\n     birth procedure is performed. Indeed, Dr. Bowes notes that \n     Dr. Haskell explicitly contrasts his procedure with other \n     procedures that do induce fetal death within the uterus.\n       The National Abortion Federation letter implies that \n     partial-birth abortions are performed only in unusual \n     circumstances. Neither Dr. Haskell nor Dr. McMahon claims \n     that this technique is used only in limited circumstances. In \n     fact, their writings advocate this method as the preferred \n     method for most late-term abortions. Dr. Haskell prefers the \n     method from 20 to 26 weeks into the pregnancy. Dr. McMahon \n     uses the method throughout the entire 40 weeks of pregnancy. \n     In fact, a previous National Abortion Federation memo to its \n     members counsels them not to apologize for this legal \n     procedure, and states, ``There are many reasons why women \n     have late abortions, life endangerment, fetal indications, \n     lack of money or health insurance, social, psychological \n     crises, lack of knowledge about human reproduction,'' et \n     cetera.\n       It is my hope that we can have a candid debate on the \n     realities of this procedure without disinformation or \n     euphemisms. I believe that when they are informed about the \n     truth about the procedure, my colleagues who value the \n     dignity of human life and believe in common decency, will \n     agree with me that partial-birth abortion is inhuman and \n     should be banned.\n       Mr. Frank.\n       Mr. Frank. Mr. Chairman, I have very strong views on this. \n     But given the importance of this particularly to women, I am \n     going to yield my time to the senior woman in the U.S. \n     Congress, the gentlewoman from Colorado.\n       Mrs. Schroeder. I want to thank the ranking member for \n     yielding. I mean that very sincerely, because as the senior \n     woman in this House, this is a day I had dreaded. I see us \n     really rolling back on women's rights.\n       I think what we are doing here today is bad medicine, it's \n     bad law, it's bad public policy, and it's intrusive \n     Government at its very, very worst.\n       What this bill is doing is saying that doctors should put \n     aside their best medical judgment in favor of some political \n     judgments made my Washington politicians. I do not know of \n     any other area where we go in and legislatively mandate \n     medical practices. In other words, some of the written \n     testimony I have seen on this has said that what we are \n     really doing is legislatively mandating malpractice.\n       First of all, the partial-birth procedure is not a medical \n     term. It is a political term. We all know that what people \n     are really trying to get at here is the fundamental right of \n     women to receive medical treatment that they and their \n     doctors determined to be safest and best for them. That is \n     the essence. That is a constitutional right. That right has \n\n[[Page S 16764]]\n     been around for more than 20 years. Today we are moving to try and \n     tamper with that.\n       Today we are going to try and make a procedure sound so \n     terrible and so awful that only women who are demons would \n     consider doing this. Only doctors who are demons would \n     consider doing this. It is almost reinciting witchcraft of a \n     sort, trying to see women as witches. Well, let's talk about \n     this.\n       There are very, very, very few of these procedures. These \n     procedures are heartbreak procedures. These are procedures \n     that nobody wants to engage in. But sometimes everything goes \n     wrong. Everything goes wrong and it is left to a woman, her \n     spouse, her doctor, to sit down and make hard choices. I do \n     not think we want the Government in Washington taking those \n     choices away.\n       When you hear from some of the women who had to make these \n     hard choices, they came to them by medical science. Things \n     that we thought were progressive. Things such as \n     amniocentesis and many of the procedures now that tell us \n     more about what is happening along the different markers of \n     birth. I must ask, are we going to do away with those things \n     too? Are we going to do away with all medical procedures and \n     go back to the Dark Ages?\n       I remind you that in World War I, more women died in \n     childbirth in this country than American solders died in \n     World War I. We have gone a long way to making all of this \n     safer for women. I hate to see us rolling back.\n       We are going to see a gruesome parade of photos today. That \n     is going to be part of why they are going to say this should \n     all be banned. But I must say that you could do that with \n     almost any medical procedure. All of us are a little \n     squeamish about medical procedures of almost any kind. Do you \n     want to see liver transplants? Do you want to see heart \n     transplants? Do you want to make people squirm? You can start \n     doing all of that.\n       The issue is, is this a valid life-saving medical procedure \n     that a doctor could reach under reasonably difficult \n     situations. I think that we have all agreed, yes.\n       I want to say there are some very brave women that are \n     sitting here in this hearing. I don't know how they are doing \n     it. First there is Vicky Wilson, who is a nurse married to an \n     emergency room physician. She had to end a wanted pregnancy \n     because of devastating fetal malformations. She is standing. \n     I want to say I salute you and your husband for being here \n     and listening to this.\n       There is also Tammy Watts, a California woman, who \n     terminated a wanted pregnancy because the fetus was so \n     horribly deformed and could not live outside the womb. I \n     think you are a very brave woman to be here and stand up to \n     this too.\n       Vicky Smith, who is an Illinois mother of two children ages \n     7 and 11, had to end a wanted pregnancy because again, the \n     fetus was microcephalic, had multiple fetal deformations. \n     Vicky Smith is now pregnant again. Vicky, thank you for \n     having the courage to come here.\n       I also want to say that none of these people engaged in \n     this process lightly. I think that is why they have the \n     courage to come here and say do not demonize them. These were \n     very difficult decisions for them to make and their doctors \n     to make. Who are we, as politicians, to say we know better?\n       Also, I would like to offer for the record a letter from \n     Rabbi Shira Stern and her husband Rabbi Donald Weber. They \n     wrote to count their experience with abortion. They said, you \n     don't have to show us pictures of fetuses in jars. We held \n     our own shortly after the abortion. Don't talk to us of pain. \n     We worked for 5 years as volunteer chaplains on the pediatric \n     floor of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New \n     York, and we watched countless children die in agony. Our \n     baby would have died at birth with pain sensors that were \n     much more sophisticated at its full gestational age than they \n     did at the time of the abortion. We have all sorts of \n     problems. This is very painful.\n       I think because this bill begins the imposition of \n     restrictions on abortion, and that will also increase the \n     medical risks to the life and health of women, it should be \n     considered unconstitutional. I know and I hope that the \n     American women will say this is unacceptable. This is a \n     beginning of chopping away at a right we have spent much too \n     long in trying to ascertain. One of the fundamental rights \n     under the constitution is one, to health care, and to be \n     treated fully as an adult.\n       I must say again, as the only woman, what a sad day this \n     is. I hope that the women in America will wake up, realize \n     what is happening. Your rights are at stake today. My rights \n     are at stake today. Physicians' rights are at stake today. If \n     we want the physicians to treat us to deal with their best \n     medical judgment and not have political judgments slapped all \n     over their training, this is the day to draw the line in the \n     sand and say, ``No more.'' It's our choice. It is not \n     politicians' choice. I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts \n     again for yielding.\n       Mr. Canady. Mr. Hyde.\n       Mr. Hyde. Well, I thank the chairman. It's always \n     instructive to hear the gentlelady from Colorado. I radically \n     disagree with her. She cited some tragic examples of children \n     born with deformities who were aborted because of that. When \n     I hear cases like that I think of Terry Wiles, who was born \n     from a woman who had taken phalitimide. He was born without \n     arms, legs, with one eye, a little lump of flesh left in an \n     ally in London, found by a bobby, and taken to a home run by \n     an eccentric, wealthy woman called The Guild of the Brave \n     Poor Things.\n       Little Terry was there until he was aged 10, when he was \n     adopted by a couple in Britain who had lost their own three \n     children, had been taken away from the mother by the court. \n     She was adjudicated an unfit mother, but she was fit enough \n     to adopt Terry, and her husband, and unemployed war veteran. \n     They became quite a family. Terry wrote a book called, ``On \n     the Shoulders of Giants.'' Prince Phillip comes to visit \n     occasionally to get his spirits bolstered, because this \n     little grotesque lump of flesh was so grateful that his \n     mother permitted him to live, at least didn't exterminate \n     him, which is what abortion is, even though he was a little \n     lump of flesh.\n       I think of Gregory Wattin, whom I watched get an Eagle \n     Scout badge, although he was confined to a wheelchair, \n     profoundly affected by cerebral palsy, could not speak, \n     pointed to letters on an alphabet card. I saw him with a \n     chest full of merit badges I couldn't have earned in the best \n     day of my life, the best year of my life. Hike 10 miles. He \n     crawled on his knees 1 mile, pushed himself 9 miles in a \n     wheelchair.\n       Do we need people like that? People that have gotten the \n     short end of the stick. When we get depressed, when we \n     think the world is piling up on us, people who have been \n     given so little and have done so much. I think so.\n       So for all of these cases, there are other cases that \n     inspire us. Beethoven conducting his premier of the Ninth \n     Symphony in the Vienna Opera House and can't hear a note. He \n     said, ``I am wretched. I cannot hear.'' Yet he wrote and \n     conducted this divine music and had to be turned around to \n     face the audience so he could see what he couldn't hear.\n       So there are cases and there are cases and there are cases, \n     that abortion is the intentional and direct killing of a \n     human life once it has begun. To do that, some people may say \n     is a right. I say for every right there is a responsibility. \n     We have a responsibility to protect human life where and when \n     we can.\n       So this is an endless discussion. It never ends. It goes on \n     and on and on. Perhaps that's a good thing in a democracy. I \n     thank the gentleman.\n       Mrs. Schroeder. Would the gentleman yield?\n       Mr. Hyde. Sure. With pleasure.\n       Mrs. Schroeder. I just want to say that I think all of us \n     would attribute great inspiration to the cases that you talk \n     about. But I hope that we also listen with open ears, and I \n     think we'll find that the women did exercise these rights \n     with great responsibility. Their lives were in jeopardy, or \n     maybe other things. I think there's two, you know, we really \n     need to listen to the whole thing, because there is the \n     woman's life that we are also looking at. I know the \n     gentleman from Illinois----\n       Mr. Hyde. I would say to my dear friend, that a life for a \n     life is certainly an even trade. And that when a mother's \n     life is threatened, that the tradeoff is equal. But when \n     something less than a life is at risk, then I don't think the \n     trade is equal. I stand in awe of the gentlelady of Colorado, \n     who presumes to speak for all women. I certainly wouldn't \n     pretend to speak for----\n       Mrs. Schroeder. Well, if the gentleman will yield further. \n     I don't believe I ever said I spoke for all women. I must say \n     that I do think that when we start talking about how we start \n     measuring rights and responsibilities, those are very serious \n     issues. But one of the great things about this country is \n     that we have tried to keep the Federal Government out of \n     coming down very hard on one side or the other. I think \n     that's what I am----\n       Mr. Hyde. I couldn't agree more with the gentlelady. When \n     they force taxpayers to pay for abortions, they are involving \n     us coercively in something that we abhor. Again, it seems to \n     me the purpose of Government is to protect the weak from the \n     strong. Otherwise, there's no reason for Government.\n       While I am a Republican, I am no libertarian. I believe \n     there is a use for the Government, sometimes a unique use. \n     When a pregnant woman, who should be the natural protector of \n     her child in her womb, becomes her child's deadly adversary, \n     the Government ought to intercede to protect the weak, \n     there's nothing weaker than the defenseless pre-born \n     child, from the strong. But you and I can go on \n     indefinitely. Let's do that some time. We'll hire a----\n       Mrs. Schroeder. Well, Mr. Chairman, I'd be more than happy. \n     Again, let's not demonize.\n       Mr. Canady. Mr. Frank.\n       Mr. Frank. I should note first that everything that \n     gentleman from Illinois has said applies not to partial-birth \n     abortions or however you want to describe them. It applies to \n     all abortions. The gentleman from Illinois has given, with \n     his usual eloquence, his objection to any form of abortion \n     whatsoever.\n       That is relevant because this is the first step in a \n     sincere effort by some people who believe that all abortion \n     should be outlawed, and if they can not be outlawed because \n     the Supreme Court will not be made to change its position, \n     they should be made as unavailable as possible. As I said, \n     this is the first step.\n       People should understand that nothing in what the gentleman \n     from Illinois said differentiates this particular type of \n     abortion from any other. He is consistently and \n     conscientiously against all abortions. This is the first step \n     in that effort.\n       But I have some problems even with it as done. The \n     gentleman from Illinois said when \n\n[[Page S 16765]]\n     the pregnant woman who should be protector turns on the child. Well, \n     why then would you pass a law if you believe that the woman \n     who volunteers to have such an abortion, if you believe that \n     the woman who seeks out a doctor, and by the way, as far as \n     speaking for all women, I believe myself that on this issue, \n     the gentlewoman from Colorado speaks for most women, but the \n     key point is, that none of us are proposing to----\n       Mr. Canady. Let me tell the members of the audience that we \n     appreciate your being here, but no matter which side you are \n     on, we would ask that you not express your approval or \n     disapproval of the statements by the members or of the \n     statements of any of the witnesses. Thank you.\n       Mr. Frank. I think making faces is OK. The key point is \n     this. The gentlewoman from Colorado and I are not proposing a \n     law for all women. We are not presuming to tell all women \n     what to do. We recognize that this choice, the choice that \n     was described of some of the brave people who were here, is a \n     very difficult one. We don't think the Federal Government \n     ought to make it for them. We are not saying all women must \n     do one thing or must do another. We are saying this is the \n     most intimate and difficult choice, and people should make it \n     within their own families and within their own views.\n       But what does this bill say? If you commit an act that \n     people here are describing as a terrible act, if you the \n     woman do that, not only are you subject to no penalty \n     whatsoever, but you can sue the doctor who you asked to \n     perform it. That is in this bill.\n       What about your notions of personal responsibility? We are \n     told on the conservative side that people should be held to a \n     standard of personal responsibility. We are presented with a \n     bill which says you can seek out a doctor, ask that doctor to \n     perform this procedure which you think is a terrible \n     procedure, voluntarily participate in the procedure. Indeed, \n     you are obviously indispensable at procedure. And then turn \n     around and sue the doctor and get money from the doctor who \n     did what you asked him to do, and which you participated in.\n       That goes so contrary to your notions of personal \n     responsibility that it is puzzling. It can only be a \n     recognition that for all the rhetoric, this is obviously not \n     something that you want to really treat as criminal. Why else \n     would you take the woman whose participation is the essential \n     element in all this? The woman who makes the decision, the \n     woman who seeks out the doctor, the woman who goes to the \n     doctor and submits to the procedure. She comes out in this as \n     someone who has a right to sue the doctor who simply did what \n     she wanted.\n       That shows to me a fundamental ambivalence in the minds of \n     the people who say this. Because if it were everything that \n     you said it was, you would be at least punishing, you would \n     be punishing the woman in a logical sense if she has \n     participated in a murder. You certainly would not be \n     empowering her to sue. Now would you be empowering others to \n     sue, and for psychological damages.\n       That is just the other great inconsistency we have here. We \n     have been told on the conservative side that we should return \n     things to the States. This is a matter the States have full \n     jurisdiction over right now. This is not anything preempted \n     by the Federal Government. I am not talking constitutionally \n     now. I am talking about the matter of public policy.\n       How can people who talk about how they want to return \n     things to the States now come and say we're going to have \n     this Federal statute regulating abortion. The States are \n     fully free to do it. If the overwhelming majority in a State \n     think this is a bad thing and they have a way to do it \n     constitutionally, then they can do it. In some States, \n     provisions like this do exist.\n       The argument for doing it on the Federal level is, that \n     there are some States that have chosen not to ban it. My \n     conservative colleagues believe that the States have no \n     business exercising their judgment in this regard. I \n     understand that. I have never claimed to be Thomas Jefferson \n     without the wig. But don't come to me on the one hand and \n     say, ``We're for State's rights. We are going to undo this \n     Federal monolith.'' And then for the first time in my memory, \n     inject intimate decision.\n       So I think that this is flawed in several regards. I \n     would just reaffirm what the gentlewoman from Colorado has \n     said. We are not trying to make any decision for anybody. \n     We are respecting the individual integrity of this very \n     difficult decision, and therefore, I hope that this \n     legislation does not go anywhere.\n       Mr. Conyers. Mr. Chairman.\n       Mr. Canady. Yes.\n       Mr. Conyers. I would like to make a comment or two.\n       Mr. Canady. Well, you will be recognized in turn. Mr. \n     Inglis has been here. I will recognize him now. We'll come \n     back to you.\n       Mr. Conyers. Thank you.\n       Mr. Inglis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I start any comments I \n     make by saying this. That we're now on the probably one of \n     the most volatile issues that we can possibly face. I always \n     try to start that discussion by indicating compassion for the \n     victims of abortion that are walking around today. The fact \n     is, there are a lot of victims of abortion that are alive. \n     They are the women that were deceived, and now realize that \n     they wish they had not had an abortion.\n       If we look in our families, somewhere in the family \n     somebody has had an abortion, a sister, a mother, a cousin, \n     an aunt. Somebody in almost every family has had an abortion. \n     That is why this is such a huge tragedy.\n       So I start anything I say by way of compassion for the \n     victims of abortion who are walking around today, that are \n     still dealing with the guilt of what they now realize they \n     did. With that opening, I would also say that I am really \n     quite disappointed. I thought we might have found some common \n     ground here. I thought that there wouldn't be anybody who \n     would rise in defense of this type of abortion. I guess I'm \n     too Pollyanna. I thought the gentlelady from Colorado, for \n     example, would say well surely this is a case where we can \n     agree, that this is a horrible procedure and one that we \n     should not make legal.\n       But I guess I am finding out just how radical the other \n     side is on this issue. It's a really interesting thing to see \n     the radical nature of someone who would defend a procedure in \n     which a live child is halfway delivered and then killed on \n     the way out. I just can not imagine anything more radical \n     than that position.\n       So I thought really we would find some common ground here \n     and agree that yet this is something that people of good \n     faith can agree on. That surely this is a type of abortion \n     that we can't abide in a civilized society, where a child if \n     it were just literally inches in a different realm, inches \n     away from life, inches away from the protection of the \n     Constitution, is murdered, and a civilized society defends it \n     as some sort of a right.\n       I think what it rises to is it indicates that this is \n     really some sort of sacrament in a very perverted \n     religious system almost. Some sort of a statement that \n     we've got to have abortion and you can't stop us from \n     having it. Some sort of an assertion of--I'm really not \n     sure what it is, but a rather strange assertion that \n     literally inches from life and protection of the \n     Constitution, we murder a child. I am really surprised \n     that we wouldn't have found some common ground, \n     particularly, I look forward to the panelists making it \n     clear that the real world here is that this is not going \n     on that often in the cases that the gentlelady from \n     Colorado cited about people in hard decisions. It is \n     rather going on in people's minds who choose \n     conscientiously to go to a place that is going to, in the \n     gentleman's word from Illinois, exterminate a living human \n     being. They are not involved in a normal healthy delivery. \n     They are going to a place that specializes in the \n     extermination of human life.\n       So in the real world, contrary to what the gentlelady has \n     indicated, the real world, this is happening in abortion \n     chambers. This is happening where people pay another person \n     to exterminate a human being that is literally inches from \n     life and protection of the Constitution.\n       Mrs. Schroeder. Would the gentleman yield?\n       Mr. Inglis. I'd be happy to. Maybe you could explain to me \n     why this isn't radical.\n       Mrs. Schroeder. This is happening by some of our best \n     educated medical minds making a decision that this is the \n     safest procedure for the woman's health. Now I think it's----\n       Mr. Inglis. Let me reclaim my time. Let me reclaim my time \n     because--let me reclaim my time because the gentlelady \n     persists in not living in the real world. The gentlelady is \n     not living in the real world. We are talking places where one \n     consciously decides to go to pay another person----\n       Mrs. Schroeder. A doctor's office.\n       Mr. Inglis. To exterminate.\n       Mrs. Schroeder. A doctor.\n       Mr. Inglis. Another human being.\n       Mr. Frank. Would the gentleman yield?\n       Mr. Inglis. I will not because I'm not finding any common \n     ground. I'm not finding any rationality in what the woman has \n     to say.\n       Mr. Frank. Will the gentleman yield to me?\n       Mrs. Schroeder. You are trying to----\n       Mr. Inglis. Reclaiming my time, I want to make clear that \n     this is a very--I mean, I listened as the gentlelady talked \n     about how hard decisions and medical professionals--you are \n     not in the real world.\n       The real world is that people are going to a place, \n     consciously deciding to engage the services of a specialist \n     who is good at pulling a baby within inches of life and then \n     sucking the brains out of the child. That is not a medical \n     specialist who is involved in a hard decision.\n       Mr. Conyers. Would the gentleman yield?\n       Mr. Inglis. That is a radical procedure.\n       Mr. Canady. The gentleman's time is expired. Mr. Conyers.\n       Mr. Frank. Would the gentleman yield to me for 15 seconds \n     at the outset?\n       Mr. Conyers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I would yield to Mr. \n     Frank.\n       Mr. Frank. I would just then say to my friend from South \n     Carolina, he talks about someone who makes this conscious \n     choice to go and do this, and then apparently he votes for a \n     bill which would allow her to then to sue and get damages for \n     it.\n       So if this is such a terrible decision this woman is \n     making, why are you then going to vote for a bill if you are \n     going to vote for this, which lets her then sue the person? I \n     am just baffled by that evaluation of human life. The person \n     who submits to what you consider murder, who is indispensable \n     to the murder, then makes a profit off it.\n       Mr. Conyers. Ladies and gentleman, it is obvious that this \n     is one of these subjects that are very personally and \n     tenaciously held by people that oppose abortion. It is the \n     law that allows abortion. It is the law that we are \n     examining.\n\n[[Page S 16766]]\n\n       But what we are doing here today is continuing a strategy, \n     an obvious one, of limiting abortion rights since we can't--\n     we don't have the support or the legal justification for \n     changing the law, is that we're going to begin in this new \n     conservative Congress to cut back in every place we can. What \n     more convenient strategy than to start off here in one of the \n     most painful, difficult, unhappy decisions in the abortion \n     arena than this politically claimed decision or title that we \n     have on this subject matter here today.\n       I submit to you that there is no medical term called \n     partial-birth abortion. I am getting drawn further and \n     further into this dispute because I sense the difference \n     between those who fight to curb abortion and their difficulty \n     in helping to deal with the children who are born, who come \n     out of the birth circumstance, and what do we do after they \n     get a life? What do we do in terms of training them and \n     educating them and trying to build up their families? Well, \n     we cut back. That's what we do.\n       We say well, this is an incredible right, that we know when \n     life occurs in the fetus. But after it does, let's abolish \n     the Department of Education. Let's cut back on Aid to \n     Families With Dependent Children. Let's reduce the budgets \n     for the children of the poor. All these wonderful statements \n     that are being made about this period from the beginning of \n     life to the existence as a fetus. Yet we are faced with a \n     society with more and more dysfunctional families, more \n     children that are leading lives of despair, more joblessness. \n     But those are different subjects, these are people alive. But \n     when we get to this, we're going to impose our views on you.\n       So I see this as a strategy. I am prepared to withstand it. \n     I always like to hear people talking about Government \n     funded abortions. Why should taxpayers pay for abortions. \n     Why should taxpayers that don't like war pay for wars? Why \n     should taxpayers that don't like anything else have to pay \n     for it? Because we have determined that is the appropriate \n     way that we have to run a system to raise money for the \n     government.\n       So I don't see any real value in Beethoven not being raised \n     as a case on one side or the other on this issue. I think the \n     fact that he was deaf is totally irrelevant to these \n     proceedings.\n       But it is a sad moment when we are in the biggest frenzy of \n     cutting the funds necessary for children and families and \n     health to flourish in this country, that we are now here \n     meeting in a committee of this importance over a subject \n     which I think is probably very low on the list, Partial-birth \n     Abortion Ban Act of 1995. I deplore it.\n       Mr. Canady. The gentleman's time is expired. Mr. Goodlatte.\n       Mr. Goodlatte. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I very much \n     appreciate you holding these hearings. I appreciate your \n     courage in addressing this issue, because I think it's an \n     issue that every American should be aware of and consider and \n     think about. Quite frankly, I am appalled that there would be \n     objection to not being willing to ban a procedure like this, \n     that if the doctor would bring that baby a few inches further \n     into full delivery, would clearly have the full protection of \n     the law.\n       Mr. Frank and Ms. Schroeder have spoken eloquently about a \n     woman's right to choose. You know, if there were only one \n     right involved, if there were only one life involved, I think \n     there would be nobody in this room who would disagree with \n     that. But therein lies the responsibility of Government, and \n     responsibility of every one of us to have Government \n     intercede when there is more than one right involved. We do \n     have to act responsibly in protecting those who can not \n     protect themselves.\n       One of the individuals on the other side mentioned bringing \n     this up about what could be the most unhappy decision that \n     not only a woman, but hopefully a man too, might be involved \n     in making a decision about this. Well here we have the \n     opportunity to take away what is clearly not only an unhappy \n     decision, but a wrong decision, to be allowed to do something \n     like this. I think that we are clearly on the right track in \n     addressing this issue today. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n       Mr. Canady. Thank you, Mr. Goodlatte. Mr. Hoke.\n       Mr. Hoke. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will be brief because \n     I want to hear the testimony of the witnesses, as do you. I \n     want to thank you as well and commend you for bringing this \n     hearing today. I think it takes a tremendous amount of \n     courage and is the sort of thing that this committee should \n     be doing. I am very grateful that you decided to do it.\n       I also want to make a quick observation regarding the State \n     that I come from, Ohio, where we recently outlawed or made \n     this specific procedure illegal. It was the right thing to do \n     there. It will be the right thing to do here as well.\n       I am particularly looking forward to the testimony of Dr. \n     White, who is one of this Nation's most preeminent \n     neurosurgeons. He is from Cleveland. I mentioned him \n     particularly, because I am interested in not only what he has \n     to say about the ability of a fetus to experience pain, but \n     also because I make the observation that he trained my own \n     father who is also a neurosurgeon, I won't say how many years \n     ago, to protect all of those that are involved.\n       Finally, the other observation I would like to make is that \n     I am particularly appalled at this procedure for the reasons \n     that have been described already, but also because this is a \n     procedure that can only take place, that only takes place \n     after the 20th week, and usually takes place much later than \n     that. I have been consistently opposed to any abortions that \n     would take place in the second or third trimesters, except \n     under the most extraordinary circumstances to save the life \n     of the mother. So I look forward to this hearing, Mr. \n     Chairman. Thank you.\n       Mr. Canady. Thank you, Mr. Hoke. I'd like to now ask that \n     the other witnesses on our first panel please come forward \n     and take their seats. I'll introduce all the members of our \n     panel, and then we'll recognize them in turn.\n       First we will hear from Dr. Pamela Smith, who comes to us \n     today from the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Mt. \n     Sinai Hospital in Chicago, where she is the Director of \n     Medical Education. In addition to serving as president-elect \n     of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and \n     Gynecologists, Dr. Smith has written several articles for \n     medical journals on the subject of pregnancy and issues \n     relating to complications during pregnancy.\n       Second, Dr. J. Courtland Robinson will testify. Dr. \n     Robinson is from the school of hygiene and public health at \n     Johns Hopkins University.\n       Third, we will hear from Dr. Robert J. White. Dr. White is \n     Professor of Neurosurgery at the Case Western Reserve \n     University School of Medicine, and is director of the \n     Division of Neurosurgery and the Brain Research Laboratory at \n     the Metro Health Medical Center. He is internationally known \n     for his expertise in clinical brain surgery. He has been the \n     recipient of several honorary doctorate degrees and visiting \n     professorships.\n       Fourth, we will hear from Ms. Tammy Watts, with us today \n     from California. Ms. Watts has had personal experience with \n     abortion.\n       Finally, Mary Ellen Morton, a nurse specializing in \n     neonatal care will testify. Mrs. Morton has developed a \n     program on neonatal and pediatric pain control that she \n     presents to health care professionals. For the past 5 years \n     she has practiced as a flight nurse with Med Flight, an air \n     medical program in Columbus, OH, where she helps to stabilize \n     and transport premature or ill infants to Columbus Children's \n     Hospital.\n       I would like to ask each of our witnesses to please \n     summarize your testimony in no more than 10 minutes. If you \n     can summarize it in less than 10 minutes, that would also be \n     appreciated. Without objection, the entirety of your prepared \n     statements will be placed in the record.\n       Our first witness, Dr. Smith.\n\n\n statement of pamela smith, director of medical education, mount sinai \n     hospital; accompanied by J. courtland robinson, johns hopkins \n   university, school of hygiene and public health, robert j. white, \nprofessor of surgery, case western reserve university, tammy watts, and \n                 mary ellen morton, neonatal specialist\n\n                       Statement of Pamela Smith\n\n       Dr. Smith. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and honorable members \n     of the subcommittee. Abortion provides claim that \n     participation in intrauterine dismemberment or a D, \n     dilation and evacuation techniques, often cause severe \n     psychological ill effects in counseling staff and surgical \n     providers. Partial-birth abortion techniques, which are \n     distinctly different surgical procedures, compound this \n     problem even further.\n       The partial-birth abortion method is strikingly similar to \n     the technique of internal podalic version, or fetal breech \n     extraction. Breech extraction is a procedure that is utilized \n     by many obstetricians with the intent of delivering a live \n     infant in the management of twin pregnancies, or single \n     infant pregnancies complicated by abnormal positions of the \n     pre-born infant.\n       In fact, when I describe the procedure of partial-birth \n     abortion to physicians and lay persons who I know to be pro-\n     choice, many of them were horrified to learn that such a \n     procedure was even legal.\n       The development and growing use of the partial-birth \n     abortion method is particularly alarming when one considers \n     the recent actions of the Accreditation Council for Graduate \n     Medical Education. This council, whose members include a \n     nonvoting Federal official, has tremendous power. It is \n     responsible for accrediting medical education programs. \n     Nonaccredited programs are not eligible for Federal funding, \n     and students who graduate from nonaccredited programs may not \n     be able to obtain State licenses, hospital privileges, or \n     board certification.\n       ACGME is requiring obstetrics and gynecology residency \n     training programs to provide abortion training either in \n     their own program or at another institution. This policy will \n     undoubtedly be used to coerce individuals and institutions to \n     participate in procedures that violate their moral \n     conscience. Physicians throughout this country therefore will \n     encounter the ethical dilemma of participating in an abortion \n     procedure which under Roe versus Wade is literally seconds \n     and inches away from being classified as a murder by every \n     State in the union. I believe that this factor among others, \n     fully justifies the banning of this particular abortion \n     technique.\n       What I would like to do at this time is to demonstrate for \n     you, using this model, which is a replica of how small the \n     average baby would be that is subjected to this procedure. \n     This is the length and a model of a 19 to 20 week old infant. \n     I would like to just go through this very quickly, the \n     procedure, to \n\n[[Page S 16767]]\n     show you the similarities between this procedure and the procedures \n     that are used by obstetricians not to destroy the baby's \n     life, but to save the baby's life.\n       Breech presentation is when the buttocks or the feet are \n     coming first. This area here is the bottom of the womb of the \n     cervix. Normally, when you are trying to deliver a premature \n     baby that may be breech, what you would like to do is to have \n     the bag of waters intact around the baby, because that serves \n     two things. It can buffer the baby as you are pulling the \n     baby out. It also serves to keep the cervix open, so that the \n     head does not get trapped.\n       When you do partial-birth abortion, however, because you \n     want the head to be trapped, you don't want the bag of waters \n     there, particularly when the baby is premature. So the bag of \n     waters is ruptured.\n       You then grab the feet. If the infant is very small, you \n     would use the forceps that are there. If the infant is \n     larger, you would probably put your hand in, the same way we \n     would do if we did an internal podalic version, grab the feet \n     and start to pull the baby down the cervix and into the \n     vagina.\n       Normally when I do this with the intention of delivering \n     the baby alive, I like to have the back toward the mother's \n     bladder, which would be here, because it will be easier for \n     me once the head gets to the level of a cervix to flex the \n     head and deliver the baby safely.\n       When you do partial-birth abortions, you want the head here \n     in this position, so that you can have access to the neck. \n     Again, when you are delivering a breech baby, cervical \n     entrapment is a complication. It's a complication that we \n     basically handle by either cutting the cervix with a certain \n     kind of incision to release the head, or by doing a cesarian \n     section sometimes. Especially if it's a large baby and that \n     doesn't work.\n       With the abortion technique that we are describing today, \n     however, you want the head to get trapped, because if the \n     baby gets passed there and slips out, then his status changes \n     from an abortus to a living person. So what you do to make \n     sure that the baby does not move the few inches that is \n     required is you hold your hands here. Basically, when you \n     want to deliver the baby live, you use your hands in this \n     position to buttress the baby. Again, you usually have an \n     assistant up here pressing and flexing the mother's abdomen \n     to deliver the head.\n       But when you are doing an abortion technique, you are \n     steadying the baby so that the baby won't slip out. Then you \n     take the Metzenbaum scissors, which are these scissors here. \n     Put them in the back of the baby's head. Push them in to try \n     to sever the cord, the spinal cord, open the scissors up to \n     create a hole big enough to put a catheter in. You then put \n     the catheter in and suck out the baby's brains. That way, the \n     baby is dead. When the baby comes out that ends the abortion \n     technique.\n       Of course when you are doing this to deliver a live baby, \n     the differences are primarily at the level of the cervix. If \n     by change the cervix is floppy or loose and the head slips \n     through, the surgeon will encounter the dreadful complication \n     of delivering a live baby. The surgeon must therefore act \n     quickly to ensure that the baby does not manage to move the \n     inches that are legally required to transform its status from \n     one of an abortus to that of a living human child.\n       Although the defenders of this technique proclaim that it \n     is safe, they have not substantiated these claims. Only two \n     individuals have provided any kind of data to evaluate. \n     Included in this scanty amount of data, there is a report of \n     a hemorrhagic complication that required 100 units of blood \n     to stabilize the patient, along with an infectious cardiac \n     complication that required 6 weeks of antibiotic therapy.\n       I have also been shown a copy of a letter dated June 12, \n     signed by the executive director of the National Abortion \n     Federation. This memo makes a number of remarkable claims \n     regarding the partial-birth abortion method, claims that are \n     flatly inconsistent with the recorded statements made by \n     physicians who specialize in performing these procedures. I \n     will refer to statements made by Dr. Martin Haskell, who \n     wrote a monograph explaining in detail how to perform this \n     type of procedure, which was distributed by the National \n     Abortion Federation in 1992. I will also refer to statements \n     made by Dr. James McMahon in various interviews and in \n     written materials that he has distributed.\n       The National Abortion Federation letter states that fetal \n     demise is virtually always induced by the combination of \n     steps taken to prepare for the abortion procedure. But in \n     interviews with the American Medical News, quoted in an \n     article published on July 5, 1993, edition, both Dr. Haskell \n     and McMahon said that the majority of fetuses aborted this \n     way are alive until the end of the procedure.\n       Dr. Haskell himself further elaborated in an interview \n     published December 10 in the Dayton News, that it was the \n     thrust of the scissors that accomplished the lethal act. I \n     quote him, ``When I do the instrumentation of the skull, it \n     destroys the brain sufficiently so that even if the fetus \n     falls out at that point, it's definitely not alive.''\n       Professor Watson Bowes of the University of North Carolina \n     at Chapel Hill, a prominent authority on fetal and maternal \n     medicine, and coeditor of the Obstetrical and Gynecological \n     Survey, reviewed Dr. Haskell's article and noted that Dr. \n     Haskell quite explicitly contrasts this procedure with other \n     procedures that do induce fetal death within the uterus. \n     Professor Bowes concurred that the fetuses are indeed alive \n     at the time that the procedure is performed.\n       The National Abortion Federation letter also claims \n     that the drawings of the partial-birth procedure \n     distributed by Congressman Canady and others are highly \n     imaginative and misleading. But Dr. Haskell himself \n     validated the accuracy of these drawings, as reported in \n     the American Medical News. Again I quote. ``Dr. Haskell \n     said the drawings were accurate from a technical point of \n     view, but he took issue with the implication that the \n     fetuses were aware and resisting.''\n       Professor Bowes also reviewed the drawings and wrote that \n     they are an accurate representation of the procedure \n     described in the article by Dr. Haskell.\n       I would invite the members of the subcommittee to review \n     the drawing of the fetal breech extraction method that I have \n     attached to my written testimony, reproduced from Williams \n     Obstetrics, a standard textbook. You can see that the method \n     described by Dr. Haskell is an adaptation, or I would rather \n     say a perversion, of the fetal breech extraction and that the \n     textbook drawings are strikingly similar to the disputed \n     drawings of the partial-birth procedure. I would also invite \n     the members of the subcommittee to examine an accurate model \n     of a fetus at 20 weeks and the Metzenbaum surgical scissors \n     that are used in this procedure, and decide for yourselves \n     who is being misleading.\n       The National Abortion Federation letter also suggests that \n     these partial-birth abortions are commonly done in a variety \n     of unusual circumstances, such as when the life of the mother \n     is at grave risk. I have practiced obstetrics and gynecology \n     for 15 years and I work with indigent women. I have never \n     encountered a case in which it would be necessary to \n     deliberately kill the fetus in this manner in order to save \n     the life of the mother.\n       There are cases in which some acute emergency occurs during \n     the second half of pregnancy that makes it necessary to get \n     the baby out fast, even if the baby is too premature to \n     survive. This would include for example, HELLP syndrome, a \n     severe form of preeclampsia that can develop quite suddenly. \n     But no doctor would employ the partial-birth method of \n     abortion, which as Dr. Haskell carefully describes, takes 3 \n     days.\n       Dr. McMahon also lists maternal conditions such as sickle \n     cell trait, uterine prolapse, depression and diabetes as \n     indications for this procedure, when in fact, these \n     conditions are frequently associated with the birth of a \n     totally normal child.\n       The National Abortion Federation letter of June 12 also \n     states, ``This is not a different surgical procedure than \n     D'' This statement is erroneous. The D procedure \n     involves dismemberment of the fetus inside the uterus. It is \n     cruel and violent, but it is quite distinct in some important \n     respects from the partial-birth method. Indeed, Dr. McMahon \n     himself has provided to this subcommittee a fact sheet, that \n     he sends to other physicians in which he goes into a detailed \n     discussion of the distinctions between intrauterine \n     dismemberment procedures, which he calls disruptive D, and \n     the procedure that he performs, which he calls intact D\n       This brings us to another important point. There is no \n     uniformly accepted medical terminology for the method that is \n     the subject of this legislation. Dr. McMahon does not even \n     use the same term as Dr. Haskell, while the National Abortion \n     Federation implausibly argues that there is nothing to \n     distinguish this procedure from D\n       The term you have chosen, partial-birth abortion, is \n     straightforward. Your definition is straightforward, and in \n     my opinion, covers this procedure and no other.\n       Mr. Canady. Doctor, if you could summarize and continue and \n     conclude in another couple of minutes, I'd appreciate it.\n       Dr. Smith. I'll just summarize by saying partial-birth \n     abortions are being heralded by some as safer alternatives to \n     D But advances in this type of technology do not solve the \n     problem. They only compound it. In part because of its \n     similarity to obstetrical techniques that are designed to \n     save a baby's life and not destroy it, this procedure \n     produces a moral dilemma that is even more acute than that \n     encountered in dismemberment techniques. The baby is \n     literally inches away from being declared a legal person by \n     every state in the union. The urgency and seriousness of \n     these matters therefore require appropriate legislative \n     action. Thank you.\n       Mr. Canady. Thank you, Dr. Smith. Dr. Robinson. I will \n     point out before Dr. Robinson's testimony that the two \n     doctors, McMahon and Haskell that Dr. Smith referred to in \n     her testimony, were the doctors we had invited and who had \n     agreed to appear for this hearing, but who canceled at the \n     last minute. We wanted to give them the opportunity to be \n     here to testify and explain the procedure. But they were----\n       Mrs. Schroeder. If the Chairman will yield. I think one of \n     the reasons that we have to be very honest about this, is \n     doctors have been harassed and sometimes don't feel very \n     secure in this environment that we live in. I think it is \n     only fair to put that on the record.\n       Mr. Canady. Thank you. Dr. Robinson.\n\n                   Statement of J. Courtland Robinson\n\n       Dr. Robinson. I would like to thank the Chairman and the \n     members of the subcommittee for inviting me to be here today. \n     My name is J. Courtland Robinson, associate professor on the \n     full-time faculty in the Department of Gynecology and \n     Obstetrics at the Johns Hopkins University School of \n     Medicine, and a joint appointment with the \n\n[[Page S 16768]]\n     Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health.\n       I have been involved in all aspects of reproductive health \n     care for women for over 40 years, including complete \n     obstetrical care, abortion, special oncologic and \n     gynecological care, with an extra interest in family and \n     sterilization. I am here on behalf of the National Abortion \n     Federation, the national professional association of abortion \n     providers.\n       My experience with abortion began in the 1950's, when as a \n     house officer at the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in \n     New York City, I watched women die from abortions that were \n     poorly done. Over a 5-year period when in training at the \n     medical center, many women died before our eyes. Many \n     survived only with aggressive pelvic surgery. On occasion, we \n     did save the very sick.\n       These are not events learned from books, but reality that I \n     painfully experienced and witnessed. This experience with \n     poorly performed abortions was further extended during my 11 \n     years as a medical missionary with the Presbyterian Church \n     while I worked and taught in Korea.\n       In 1971 at Baltimore City Hospital, we were already doing \n     legal first and second trimester abortions before the Roe \n     versus Wade decision came down. We did about 1,000 a year. \n     Thirty percent were second trimester. At that time, the \n     method of management of second-trimester abortions was saline \n     induction. When the saline did not work, it was often my task \n     to carry out an evacuation in order to meet the patient's \n     needs in a safe and timely manner. I have performed abortions \n     in different settings, and have performed second-trimester \n     abortions using different techniques, depending upon the \n     clinical situation.\n       When a woman is faced with a need to terminate a pregnancy, \n     the physician can manage the surgical procedure using a \n     number of techniques, hypotonic glucose, saline, urea, \n     prostoglandins, potossin, suction, D, D We have used \n     different techniques over the years as our skill and \n     understanding of basic physiology has become clearer. As in \n     all of medicine we develop techniques which are more \n     appropriate, study the long-term impacts, and determine which \n     is safer.\n       The physician needs to be able to decide, in consultation \n     with the patient, and based on her specific physical and \n     emotional needs, what is the appropriate methodology. The \n     practice of medicine by committee is neither good for \n     patients or for medicine in general.\n       This legislation appears to be about something you are \n     referring to as partial-birth abortion. I now am beginning to \n     learn a little about what you think it means, but I did not \n     know it until a few days ago. Never in my career have I heard \n     a physician who provides abortions refer to any techniques as \n     a partial-birth abortion. That, I suspect, is because the \n     name did not exist until someone who wanted to ban abortions \n     made it up. Medically, we do not do partial-birth abortion. \n     There is no such thing.\n       When an intact fetus is removed in the process of abortion, \n     as is sometimes done, fetal demise is induced either by an \n     artificial medical means or through the combination of steps \n     taken as the procedure is begun. Thus, in no case is pain \n     induced to the fetus. If neurologic development at the stage \n     of the abortion being performed even made this possible, \n     which in the vast majority of cases it does not, analgesia \n     and anesthesia given to the women neutralizes any pain that \n     may be perceived by the fetus.\n       So when I read in your legislation that you seek to, ``Ban \n     an abortion in which the person performing the abortion \n     partially vaginally delivers a living fetus before killing \n     the fetus and completing the delivery,'' my reaction is that \n     you are banning something that does not happen. To say \n     partially vaginally delivers is vague, not medically \n     oriented, just not correct. In any normal second-trimester \n     abortion procedure done by any method, you may have a point \n     at which a part, an inch of cord, for example, of the fetus \n     passes out of the cervical os, before fetal demise has \n     occurred. This does not mean you are performing a partial \n     birth.\n       I have seen the sketches that have been passed around. I \n     have read your description of a particular physician's method \n     of performing this procedure, a method by the way which is \n     not at all common. It represents a particular surgical \n     decision by that physician, one which works in his practice. \n     The sketches in any case are not particularly correct. They \n     may in a very technical sense represent an approximation of \n     what occurs in some cases, but they do not represent medical \n     or scientific accuracy. Rather, they are designed to be \n     upsetting and inflammatory for the lay person. They do not \n     advance medical practice.\n       The words of the legislation are equally inflammatory. No \n     one doing this procedure is partially delivering a fetus. So \n     then, I have to wonder what you are trying to ban with this \n     legislation. It sounds to me as if you are trying to leave \n     any late abortion open to question, to create a right of \n     action, and in fact, a criminal violation. To force doctors \n     to affirmatively prove that they have not somehow violated \n     such a law.\n       I know that a number of physicians who have performed \n     abortions for years who are experts in the field, look at \n     this legislation and do not understand what you mean or what \n     you are trying to accomplish. It seems as if this vagueness \n     is intentional. I, as a physician, can not countenance a \n     vague law that may or may not cut off an appropriate surgical \n     option for my patient.\n       Women present to us for later abortions for a number of \n     reasons, including congenital anomalies, of which I have a \n     few pictures if necessary. I can tell you from my long \n     experience that women do not appear and ask for any abortion, \n     particularly those that I saw die in the 1950's, particularly \n     a later abortion, cavalierly or lightly. They want an answer. \n     It is a serious and difficult decision and has been for \n     centuries for women to make. It is not my place to judge my \n     patient's reason for ending a pregnancy, or to punish her \n     because circumstances prevented her from obtaining an \n     abortion earlier.\n       It is my place to treat my patient, a woman with a \n     pregnancy she feels certain she cannot continue, to the best \n     of my ability. That includes selecting the most appropriate \n     surgical technique using my skill and knowledge developed \n     from experience, to determine what method is safest for this \n     woman at all times and in all circumstances.\n       Sometimes, as any doctor will tell you, you begin a \n     surgical procedure expecting that it will go one way, only to \n     discover that a unique demand, the case requires you to do \n     something different. Telling a physician that it's illegal \n     for him or her to adapt a certain surgical method for the \n     safety of the patient is absolutely criminal and flies in the \n     face of the standards for the quality of medical care.\n       For many physicians, this law would amount to a ban on D \n     entirely, because they would not undertake a surgery if they \n     were legally prohibited from completing it in the best way \n     they saw fit at the time the procedure was being done. \n     Because the law itself is so vague and bizarre, leaving them \n     to wonder whether they are open to prosecution or not.\n       This means that by banning this very rare technique, you \n     end up banning D, essentially recognized as the safest \n     method of performing secondary-trimester abortions. That \n     means that women will probably die. I know. I have seen it \n     happen.\n       With all due respect, the Congress of the United States is \n     not qualified to stand over my shoulder in the operating room \n     and tell me how to treat my patient. If we are to allow women \n     of this country the right to decide when and whether to bear \n     children, we, as their doctors, must be allowed to be doctors \n     and treat them to the best of our abilities and according to \n     their sense of personal control. Thank you.\n       Mr. Canady. Thank you Doctor. Dr. White.\n\n                      Statement of Robert J. White\n\n       Dr. White. Mr. Chairman, members of this distinguished \n     panel. I am delighted to have the opportunity to testify \n     before you. I appreciate Mr. Hoke's remarks, whether true or \n     otherwise.\n       I come before you as not an obstetrician or an \n     gynecologist. I come before you as a brain surgeon and as a \n     neuro scientist. When I was undergoing my training at Harvard \n     Medical School and was working at Children's Hospital in \n     Boston, when I saw the efforts that the pediatricians and the \n     neonatalogists were putting forward to save children, \n     infants, it had a mark on my consciousness and on my \n     practice. I have been trained through all of my years, \n     including many years at the Mayo Clinic, to save lives. Not \n     to take lives.\n       I go back to a time in American medicine when abortion was \n     abhorred by the medical profession. The things that we have \n     to consider here is we are dealing with a human being, a \n     fetus. By the 20th week of gestation and beyond, has in place \n     the neurocircuitry to appreciate pain. Now I'm not going to \n     bore this distinguished panel by going through the \n     neuroanatomy and the neurochemistry and the studies that are \n     on board that reflect that these fetuses can perceive and \n     appreciate pain. As a matter of fact, there are studies that \n     demonstrate at 8 weeks through 13 weeks, there's enough \n     neurocircuitry present so that pain noxious stimuli could be \n     perceived.\n       It is well to remember at this particular time, beyond the \n     20th week of gestation, that not only are the fiber tracks in \n     place from the surface of the skin in through the spinal cord \n     and to special areas of the brain where pain can be \n     appreciated. But the system which is equally important in the \n     modulation and suppression of pain is not yet as mature as \n     the one conducting pain. Some authorities feel that fetuses \n     at this age can perceive pain to a greater degree than the \n     adult. So I would like to come before you emphasizing that \n     within the framework of the fetus, his nervous system, pain \n     can be perceived and appreciated.\n       Now, I am not an obstetrician. But as I view and understand \n     this particular procedure, the compression, the pulling, the \n     distortion must be a painful experience for the fetus as it \n     is advanced into the birth canal. But for me, what is most \n     disturbing is the procedure itself. You are talking about a \n     brain operation on a fetus who could have reached an age \n     where I would be called upon as someone trained and \n     experienced in pediatric neurosurgery to operate.\n       We operate on preemies within this range, conducting brain \n     surgery to save their lives. We would never consider any \n     procedure giving us access to that preemie's central nervous \n     system without sophisticated anesthesia.\n       As I read as you do that the procedure to terminate the \n     fetus' life requires the opening of the scalp, the entering \n     of the spinal canal. Now interestingly, I am really wondering \n     if these people who conduct this procedure really know what \n     they are doing in a technical way. We operate on infants \n     beyond the 24th week of gestation using magnification. \n\n[[Page S 16769]]\n     Some of the most sophisticated instrumentation allows us to enter these \n     areas.\n       I can conceive that these people eventually sucking out the \n     brain have not even divided the upper cervical cord, which \n     incidentally, and we should think about that, is the area \n     where Mr. Reeves has been injured. We're bringing to bear the \n     greatest technology, and he's being treated by some of the \n     finest neurosurgeons in this country, to save his life.\n       The obstetrician who conducts this type of partial \n     abortion, is attempting to undertake brain surgery. There is \n     no description in any of the doctors' articles or responses \n     who do these procedures, to give me any indication whether \n     they are operating on the upper cervical spine or cord, or on \n     the brain stem.\n       Now it is true, once you sever that area, then of course \n     the capability of respiration and so forth has been \n     separated, as has happened to Mr. Reeves. But I can believe \n     that these are not trained neurosurgeons. In the process of \n     terminating this child by removing its brain, could be even \n     conducted in a poor infant whose pain situation, \n     capabilities, the tracks, the neurocircuitry, could be in \n     place because they are not trained to carry out even this \n     dastardly procedure.\n       Members of the panel, we are talking about a procedure, and \n     I have no idea how often it is conducted, by individuals who \n     are not trained neurosurgeons. We are trained to save lives.\n       Since I became involved in this, as I sit at the operating \n     table, spending hours utilizing intensive medication, special \n     instrumentation, to remove blood from the brain, to direct \n     specially developed hydraulic tubing into the fluid passages \n     of the brain, in infants of this age or perhaps a little \n     older, to save their lives it frankly disgusts me to think \n     that other medical professionals are undertaking these \n     procedures that we have spent years of study and training to \n     undertake to save lives, are being conducted to terminate \n     lives.\n       I would also remind you that the animal rights groups in \n     this country have displayed great concern over animal rights, \n     particularly as it relates to pain and to medical \n     experimentation. It seems to me that we have reached a point \n     where far greater care would have to be exercised by the \n     veterinarian or the medical scientist experimenting on \n     animals in terms of pain reduction or elimination, than is a \n     part of this particular procedure. It is almost as if, from \n     an ethical standpoint, it would be more disturbing, even \n     morally incorrect and inappropriate, to cause pain in a rat \n     than a human fetus.\n       I doubt very much, ladies and gentlemen, if this type of \n     procedure, and as I said before I am not an expert as to how \n     often it would be undertaken, were conducted within the \n     framework of the lower animal, I am sure that the animal \n     rights groups would be able to bring sufficient pressure on \n     Congress and within the media to have it totally eliminated.\n       In conclusion, the fetus is at an age of gestation where he \n     or she can perceive pain and possibly more exquisitely, than \n     he or she would if they were allowed to go on to be born. The \n     procedure itself is a brain operation. But the details of it \n     are so limited and so ghastly, that it seems to me that it is \n     impossible to believe that medical colleagues at another \n     specialty would carry it out. Thank you, ladies and \n     gentlemen.\n\n                 Mr. Canady. Thank you, Dr. Ms. Watts.\n\n                        Statement of Tammy Watts\n\n       Ms. Watts. Good morning. My name is Tammy Watts. I would \n     like to thank the subcommittee for inviting me here today. My \n     story is one of heartbreak, one of tragedy, but also one of \n     compassion.\n       When I found out I was pregnant on October 10, 1994, it was \n     a great day, because on the same day, my nephew, Tanner James \n     Gilbert was born. We were doubly blessed. My husband and I \n     ran through the whole variety of emotions, scared, happy, \n     excited, the whole thing. We immediately started making our \n     plans. We talked about names, what kind of baby's room we \n     wanted, would it be a boy or girl. We told everyone we knew, \n     and I was only 3 weeks pregnant at the time.\n       It was not an easy pregnancy. Almost as soon as my \n     pregnancy was confirmed, I started getting really sick. I had \n     severe morning sickness, and so I took some time off of work \n     to get through that stage. As the pregnancy progressed, I had \n     some spotting, which is common, but my doctor said to take \n     disability leave from work and take things 1 month at a time.\n       During that leave, I had a chance to spend a lot of time \n     with new newborn nephew, Tanner, and his mom, Melanie, my \n     sister-in-law. I watched him grow day by day, sharing all the \n     news with my husband. We made our plans, excited by watching \n     Tanner grow, thinking, ``This is what our baby is going to be \n     like.''\n       Then I had more trouble in January. My husband and I had \n     gone out to dinner, came back and were watching TV when I \n     started having contractions. They lasted for about a half an \n     hour and then they stopped. But then the doctor told me that \n     I should stay out of work for the rest of my pregnancy. I was \n     very disappointed that I couldn't share my pregnancy with the \n     people at work, let me watch me grow. But our excitement just \n     kept growing, and we made our normal plans, everything that \n     prospective parents do.\n       I had had a couple of earlier unltrasounds which turned out \n     fine. I took the alphafetoprotein test, which is supposed to \n     show fetal anomalies, anything like what we later found out \n     we had. Mine came back clean.\n       In March, I went in for a routine seven month untrasound. \n     They were saying this looks good, this looks good. Then \n     suddenly, they got really quiet. The doctor said, ``This is \n     something I did not expect to see.'' My heart dropped. He \n     said he was not sure what it was, and after about an hour of \n     solid ultrasound, he and another doctor decided to send me to \n     a perinatologist. That was also when they told us we were \n     going to have a girl. They said, ``Don't worry. It's probably \n     nothing. It can even be the machine.''\n       So we went home. We were a little bit frightened so we \n     called some family members. My husband's parents were away \n     and wanted to come home, but we told them to wait. The next \n     day the perinatologist did ultrasound for about 2 hours, and \n     said he thought the ultrasound showed a condition in which \n     the intestines grow on the outside of the body, something \n     that is easily corrected with surgery after birth. But \n     just to make sure, he made an appointment for me in San \n     Francisco with a specialist.\n       After another intense ultrasound with the specialist, the \n     doctors met with us along with a genetic counselor. They \n     absolutely did not beat around the bush. They told me, ``Your \n     daughter has no eyes. Six fingers and six toes, and enlarged \n     kidneys which were already failing. The mass on the outside \n     of her stomach involves her bowel and bladder, and her heart \n     and other major organs are also affected.'' This is part of a \n     syndrome called trisomy-13, where on the 13th gene there's an \n     extra chromosome. They told me, ``Almost everything in life, \n     if you've got more of it, it's great, except for this. This \n     is one of the most devastating syndromes, and your child will \n     not live.''\n       My mother-in-law collapsed to her knees. What do you do? \n     What do you say? I remember just looking out the window. I \n     couldn't look at anybody. So my mother-in-law asked, ``Do we \n     go on? Does she have to go on?'' The doctor said, ``no,'' \n     that there was a place in Los Angeles that could help if we \n     could not cope with carrying the pregnancy to term. The \n     genetic counselor explained exactly how the procedure would \n     be done if we chose to end the pregnancy, and we made an \n     appointed for the next day.\n       I had a choice. I could have carried this pregnancy to \n     term, knowing that everything was wrong. I could have gone on \n     for 2 more months doing everything that an expectant mother \n     does, but knowing my baby was going to die, and would \n     probably suffer a great deal before dying. My husband and I \n     would have to endure that knowledge and watch that suffering. \n     We could never have survived that, and so we made the choice \n     together, my husband, and I, to terminate this pregnancy.\n       We came home, packed, and called the rest of our families. \n     At this point, there wasn't a person in the world who didn't \n     know how excited we were about this baby. My sister-in-law \n     and best friend divided up our phone book and called \n     everyone. I didn't want to have to tell anyone. I just wanted \n     it to be over with.\n       On Thursday morning, we started the procedure. It was over \n     about 6 p.m. Friday night. The doctor, nurses, and counselors \n     were absolutely wonderful. While I was going through the most \n     horrible experience of my life, they had more compassion than \n     I have ever felt from anybody. We had wanted this baby so \n     much. We named her Mackenzie. Just because we had to end the \n     pregnancy didn't mean we didn't want to say goodbye. Thanks \n     to the type of procedure that Dr. McMahon uses in terminating \n     these pregnancies, we got to hold her and be with her and \n     love her and have pictures for a couple of hours, which was \n     wonderful and heartbreaking all at once. They had her wrapped \n     in a blanket. We spent some time with her, said our \n     goodbyes, and went back to the hotel.\n       Before we went home, I had a checkup with Dr. McMahon and \n     everything was fine. He said, ``I'm going to tell you two \n     things. First, I never want to see you again. I mean that in \n     a good way. Second, my job isn't done with you yet until I \n     get the news that you have had a healthy baby.'' He gave me \n     hope that this tragedy was not the end, that we could have \n     children just as we had planned.\n       I remember getting on the plane, and as soon as it took \n     off, we began crying because we were leaving our child \n     behind. The really hard part started when I got home. I had \n     to go through my milk coming in and everything you go through \n     if you have a child.\n       I don't know how to explain the heartache. There are no \n     words. There's nothing I can tell you, express or show you, \n     that would allow you to feel what I feel. If you think about \n     the worst thing that has happened to you in your life and \n     multiply it by a million, maybe then you might be close. You \n     do what you can. I couldn't deal with anybody, couldn't see \n     anybody, especially my nephews. It was too heartbreaking. \n     People came to see me, and I don't remember them being there.\n       Eventually, I came around to being able to see and talk to \n     people. I am a whole new person, a whole different person. \n     Things that used to be important now seem silly. My family \n     and my friends are everything to me. My belief in God has \n     strengthened. I never blamed God for this. I am a good \n     Christian woman. However, I did question.\n       Through a lot of prayer and talk with my pastor, I have \n     come to realize that everything happens for a reason, and \n     Mackenzie's life had meaning. I know it would come to \n\n[[Page S 16770]]\n     pass some day that I would find out why it happened, and I think it is \n     for this reason. I am supposed to be here to talk to you and \n     say, you can't take this away from women and families. You \n     can't. It is so important that we be able to make these \n     decisions, because we are the only ones who can.\n       We made another painful decision shortly after the \n     procedure. Dr. McMahon said, ``This will be very difficult, \n     but I have to ask you. Given the anomalies Mackenzie had so \n     vast and different, there is a program at Cedars-Sinai which \n     is trying to find out the cause for why this happens. They \n     would like to accept her into this program.'' I said, ``I \n     know what that means, autopsies and the whole realm of \n     testing.'' But we decided how can we not do this? If I can \n     keep one family from going through what we went through, it \n     would make her life have more meaning. So they are doing the \n     testing now. Because Dr. McMahon does the procedure the way \n     he does, it made the testing possible.\n       I can tell you one thing after our experience, I know more \n     than ever that there is no way to judge what someone else \n     is going through. Until you have walked a mile in my \n     shoes, don't pretend to know what this was like for me. I \n     don't pretend to know what someone else is going through. \n     Everybody has got a reason for doing what they have to do. \n     Nobody should be forced into having to make the wrong \n     decision. That's what you'll be doing if you pass this \n     legislation. Let doctors be free to treat their patients \n     in the way they think is best, like my doctor did for me.\n       I understand this legislation would make my doctor a \n     criminal. My doctor is the furthest thing from a criminal in \n     the world. Many times I have called him my angel. They say \n     there are angels working around the world protecting us, and \n     I know he is one. If I was not led to Mr. McMahon, I don't \n     know how I would have lived through this. I can't imagine \n     where we would be without him. He saved my family, my mental \n     stability, and my life. I could not have made it through this \n     without him and I know there are a great many women out there \n     who feel the same.\n       I have still got my baby's room and her memory cards from \n     her memorial service. Her foot and hand prints. Those are \n     good things and good memories, but she's gone. The best thing \n     I can do for her is continue this fight. I know she would \n     want me to. So for her, for Mackenzie, I respectfully ask you \n     reject this legislation. Thank you.\n       Mr. Canady. Thank you. Mrs. Morton.\n\n                     Statement of Mary Ellen Morton\n\n       Ms. Morton. Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, thank \n     you for the opportunity to testify. With your permission, \n     could I use slides to illustrate my testimony?\n       Mr. Canady. Certainly.\n       Ms. Morton. Could we lower the lights? Thank you. My name \n     is Mary Ellen Morton. I am here today to challenge and to \n     dispel the notion that unborn babies would not feel agonizing \n     pain before they are reduced to human rubble during the \n     partial-birth abortion procedure.\n       Now I have practiced as a nurse for 12 years. Nine of those \n     have been in the neonatal intensive care units. Taking care \n     of babies like this little neonate.\n       [Slide.]\n       Now a neonate is defined as a baby that is born, whether \n     premature or full term, until the time they about 4 weeks of \n     age. As you see, this little baby is about 1\\1/2\\ pounds. He \n     falls right into the time line of when this partial-birth \n     abortion procedure is routinely done. He is not even on life \n     support systems. As you see, that's an adult 02 mask there \n     for size. This little boy, named Al, is just about 26 weeks \n     along at this point along in the picture.\n       As the Chairman stated, I am a flight nurse in Columbus, \n     OH. A portion of my flights is dedicated to picking up the \n     smallest of premature babies and transporting them via air \n     back to Columbus Children's Hospital in an isolet. Viability \n     is an arbitrary term to medical people like myself. The \n     reason for that is, is because it's a measure of the \n     sophistication of the external life supports that is \n     available to us. We know that that is ever changing.\n       [Slide.]\n       In fact, this little boy, Donnie, is in the midst of all \n     that technology. He was born at 24 weeks. He is now at about \n     three pounds. That is him laying on his tummy under an oxygen \n     hood.\n       Now the reason viability is arbitrary, because it varies \n     from institution to institution in my experience. It also \n     varies from baby to baby, because neonatologists, when they \n     call a gram weight or a gestational age as when a baby is \n     viable, you will always have a baby that will prove the \n     definition wrong. It also increases, of course, with our \n     sophisticated technology.\n       [Slide.]\n       Now this little baby, it's kind of hard to see, but she was \n     born at 23 weeks gestation in Columbus, OH. She had multiple \n     operations done. One of them was to restore intestines that \n     were born outside of her tummy. It is the standard of care \n     that a baby like this would receive narcotic analgesics for \n     pain control after surgery. It is also the standard of care \n     that these babies would receive skeletal muscle relaxant \n     drugs, such as valium. Also, that has kind of an amnesic \n     effect, so the baby will not remember the painful experience. \n     Also, an antianxiety effect.\n       It is also the standard of care that these babies receive \n     anesthetic for any kind of surgical procedure. That could be \n     from a central line insertion, chest tube insertion, even to \n     a circumcision. Now the reason we have standards of care, \n     nurses know that it promotes the physical well-being of that \n     baby. More importantly, it is the compassionate thing to do \n     for these little ones, and it holds the medical community \n     accountable for what we do.\n       I fought long and hard for 12 years to get adequate pain \n     control for these little babies. As Dr. White can probably \n     testify, it has been a long time coming. It has been a \n     struggle. But finally, we are using more and more pain \n     technology and we realize that hospitals should not be a \n     place of torture and torment, but use the adequate pain \n     technology available to us.\n       [Slide.]\n       Now I have ample experience as a nurse to assess the pain \n     experience in the smallest of babies. Just to give you an \n     idea from this drawing, there are breathing tubes, there are \n     oral gastric tubes that need to be inserted. We do vena \n     punctures, arterial punctures. We draw blood from the heels \n     of these babies. Their skin, especially the 21 to 23 week \n     babies, they have very sensitive skin. So it requires that we \n     take much caution when we remove electrodes from their skin. \n     We use electrodes for heart monitoring, for oxygen \n     monitoring through the skin, for temperature monitoring. \n     So how is it that nurses know that this little babies are \n     in pain? What it is that I have discovered over the 12 \n     years of taking care of them?\n       [Slide.]\n       Well, this just kind of sums it up for you. But basically, \n     we see differences in their vocalizations. There's different \n     kinds of cries. Even your small babies can actually moan, \n     just like an adult would. The facial expressions. We see chin \n     quivering, eye squeezing, we see eye rolling, all kinds of \n     brow bulge, a square chin when they are experiencing pain \n     activity. We see differences in their sleep wake cycles. We \n     see a lack of consolability. Their sucking ability changes \n     when they are in pain. There general appearance, their color \n     actually deteriorates because they deoxygenate their blood \n     when they are in severe pain. We also see posture motor \n     responses, such as jitteriness and arching, when they are \n     exhibiting a pain stimulus.\n       [Slide.]\n       Now this little girl, Sarah, she's under a pound. She is \n     only 420 grams with 454 grams being 1 pound. When she was \n     born at 23 weeks gestation, it required that she have a \n     medication called Adavan, which is like valium, administered \n     to her, and also she was on a fentanyl drip at different \n     points. That is actually a pain killer for the discomfort of \n     all the technology.\n       [Slide.]\n       This is her a little bit older. As you see, it was very \n     important to even swaddle her while she's on a breathing \n     machine there. It was important for her parents to put a tape \n     into her isolet, where she could be nurtured by the parents \n     verbally. We even gave a pacifier that she can suck on around \n     that breathing tube. We also play internal womb sounds to \n     these babies to kind of console them.\n       [Slide.]\n       Now here she is several years ago with the same little \n     doll. As you can see, she has grown quite a bit. But nurses \n     have known this for years, that babies that have adequate \n     pain control and they have people, whether it just be the \n     nurses or adoptive parents, whoever is caring for the child, \n     to give them emotional care. Those babies fare better. They \n     gain weight better. They have less incidence of inner-cranial \n     bleeds. We see a lot of good outcomes.\n       [Slide.]\n       Now unquestionably as Dr. White has said, the research has \n     shown that these premature babies, they possess full \n     sensation. This is a summary of the research that has been \n     done. I just want to show you that this validates what nurses \n     have always known for years. I have already told you a few of \n     these, eye rolling, breath holding, jitteriness, eye \n     squeezing, chin lip quivering, limb withdrawal. We also \n     see physiological changes. Their heart rates will race \n     when they are in pain. Or small babies, it will go down. \n     Their oxygen levels, they also have stress hormones that \n     go off the wall. Cortisol, adrenalin levels, will increase \n     during pain.\n       [Slide.]\n       Now this is Kelly Thorman of Toledo, OH, born in 1971. As \n     you see, she doesn't require much sophistication of external \n     life supports. In the 1970's, there probably wasn't very \n     much.\n       [Slide.]\n       This is her at 368 grams. That is three-quarters of a \n     pound. That is her nurse's wedding ring on her wrist.\n       [Slide.]\n       Now as depicted on the front of Life Magazine. This is a \n     baby that is the same age and weight as Kelly Thorman, the \n     baby I just showed you. I have to ask, what is the \n     difference? Both of those babies, whether inside or outside \n     the womb, can perceive pain and experience it. But the \n     difference is, the baby outside the womb is required to have \n     humane care inside of the hospital. But this baby inside of \n     the womb can be pulled violently down into a breech position, \n     partially delivered, only to experience an agonizing death.\n       [Slide.]\n       Now this little girl from Columbus, OH, is shown here in \n     two different stages of her life. At 23 weeks gestation and \n     just over a pound, she is full of technology there you can \n     see at \n\n[[Page S 16771]]\n     the bottom. But you know, as a premature neonate at the bottom and also \n     as a pre-schooler, do you know that she can experience the \n     same things. She can breath, digest, swallow, taste, hear. \n     This baby can feel pain at both stages in her life. In fact, \n     at both of these stages in her life, she had a learned \n     response to pain. I will show you one of the reasons we know \n     this.\n       [Slide.]\n       This baby on his 3-month birthday, when he reached about \n     3\\1/2\\ pounds.\n       Mr. Canady. Ms. Morton. There's a vote taking place on the \n     floor. If you could conclude your remarks in about a minute \n     or two. We are going to have to go to the floor to vote.\n       Ms. Morton. I am closing right now. This is the last \n     statement. This baby, before he has blood drawn, it requires \n     that we warm his heel as you see on his right heel. After \n     doing this several times to these babies, they actually know \n     when that pain response is coming, because they will start to \n     become agitated. Their heart rates will race when we put the \n     warm pack on.\n       In closing, as a nurse and also as a mother, I am really \n     disturbed that this abortion procedure could be permitted on \n     these babies. I believe that I have shown that there is \n     unmistakable humanity. I hope with proposed legislation \n     before you, that it will stop that. Thank you.\n       Mr. Canady. Thank you, Mrs. Morton. I want to thank all the \n     members of this panel. As you know, there is a vote taking \n     place on the floor of the House. The members of the \n     subcommittee must go to the floor to vote. We will return and \n     reconvene as soon as the vote is concluded. The committee \n     will now stand in recess.\n       [Recess.]\n       Mr. Canady. The subcommittee will come to order. I \n     apologize to our panel for the interruption. I will also tell \n     you that the subcommittee will have to conclude its \n     proceedings somewhat in advance of 1 o'clock due to the fact \n     that the full Judiciary Committee has a meeting scheduled at \n     that time. I regret that. I wish we could have an extended \n     session here of questions, but that is not going to be \n     possible\n       In light of that, I would like to at this point recognize \n     Mr. Hyde. We're going to switch places, and I'll let Mr. Hyde \n     proceed with questions at this point. Then when it would have \n     been Mr. Hyde's turn, it will be my turn. Mr. Hyde.\n       Mr. Hyde. Well, I thank you for that gesture. Dr. White, I \n     have yet to find a doctor who performs abortions that calls \n     himself an abortionist. They all say they specialize in \n     reproductive health. I have racked my brain and I try to find \n     something reproductive about abortion. It is contrary, \n     reproductive. Of course health is irrelevant for the fetus \n     that has been exterminated. It just seems ironic that this is \n     the surgery that dares not speak its name.\n       Dr. Robinson, over the years, about how many abortions have \n     you performed?\n       Dr. Robinson. I really have great difficulty going back to \n     1953 when in New York City, we didn't do them except under \n     rather limited and special conditions when a committee of \n     four or five physicians would get together and have vote \n     concerning was this a reasonable reason for this young woman \n     to interrupt this pregnancy, just as we had committees to \n     decide whether a woman could have her tubes tied or not. This \n     was all done by committee.\n       In Korea, since I was working with the Presbyterian Church, \n     I was active in teaching, therefore others in the community \n     were doing the abortions.\n       When I came back in 1981 or 1971, then at City Hospital I \n     began getting involved in it. I can't give you any sense. It \n     has not been a major job. On the other hand, I have on many \n     occasions introduced myself at church meetings as an \n     abortionist.\n       Mr. Hyde. You have?\n       Dr. Robinson. Oh, yes.\n       Mr. Hyde. You are the first then.\n       Dr. Robinson. I'm a Christian abortionist.\n       Mr. Hyde. That is an interesting juxtaposition.\n       Dr. Robinson. Well, we have Christian crusaders. We \n     have the Christian inquisition in Spain. We have a lot of \n     Christian militants. We have lots of Christians----\n       Mr. Hyde. Some more nominal than others, I daresay.\n       Dr. Robinson. I daresay.\n       Mr. Hyde. I have read a statement by Dr. Bernard Nathanson, \n     who was one of the founders of the modern abortion movement \n     and who ran the biggest abortion clinic in New York for \n     years. He said that he can't escape the notion, he said, I \n     can't escape the notion that I have presided over 50,000 \n     deaths. Do you think your record could equal that?\n       Dr. Robinson. I doubt it.\n       Mr. Hyde. Or is Dr. Nathanson ahead of you?\n       Dr. Robinson. I doubt if that number--on the other hand, \n     the thing that he left out of his statement is that he found \n     50,000 women who were incredibly pleased.\n       Mr. Hyde. Who were what?\n       Dr. Robinson. Incredibly pleased with the outcome.\n       Mr. Hyde. No doubt.\n       Dr. Robinson. One of the pleasures of doing abortions is \n     that no longer do I have to go to a committee. When women \n     leave on the occasions that I have been involved or where the \n     units do, these are very happy women.\n       Mr. Hyde. Do you ever find that remorse sets in? Do you \n     ever find women who have had an abortion are troubled by it \n     in later years?\n       Dr. Robinson. I find remorse occurs in many women. I do a \n     hysterectomy in women and they grieve later on, because they \n     have lost their ability. Grieving over illness and problems \n     is very common. I think careful studies have indicated that \n     grieving over this issue, as Koop said many years ago as \n     Surgeon General, that this isn't any more common than anybody \n     else. It is an event of life.\n       Mr. Hyde. You have said that you have spent in your medical \n     experience, you have witnessed women who have died from \n     botched abortions. We are aware that that happens. The \n     statistics are there. The mortality rate for the unborn in \n     abortions is 100 percent though. Isn't it?\n       Dr. Robinson. It better be.\n       Mr. Hyde. It had better be?\n       Dr. Robinson. Yes.\n       Mr. Hyde. Thank you Doctor. I have no more questions.\n       Mr. Canady. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to \n     continue, Dr. Robinson, with a couple questions for you.\n       Dr. Martin Haskell prefers an abortion technique which he \n     calls dilation and extraction. Dr. James McMahon prefers a \n     similar technique and calls it intact dilation and \n     evacuation. The same basic technique has also been called \n     interuterine cranial decompression. Are you familiar with the \n     abortion techniques that are used by Dr. Haskell and Dr. \n     McMahon that are referred to by these particular terms?\n       Dr. Robinson. I must confess, Mr. Chairman, that up to \n     about a week ago, I had never heard anything about this at \n     all. I am in an academic center in which varying issues are \n     discussed. I was totally unaware that even people were \n     talking about it.\n       Mr. Canady. Well that was a week ago. So you didn't know \n     anything about the subject you came to testify on today until \n     starting a week ago?\n       Dr. Robinson. I know a lot about abortion. I know a lot \n     about the attempts to describe what is being done. But as a \n     medical piece of information, this is not widely known. It is \n     not generally known. It has not been published in literature. \n     It has not been published in scientific journals. It hasn't \n     even been mentioned in throw-away journals.\n       Mr. Canady. Let me ask you this. Would you consider \n     yourself to be familiar, have some familiarity with the \n     subject now? You have been expressing opinions on it.\n       Dr. Robinson. I am very familiar with the subject right \n     now.\n       Mr. Canady. OK. Very good. Glad to hear that. Now are you \n     familiar with the paper by Dr. Haskell entitled, Second \n     Trimester DNX 20 Weeks and Beyond, which was presented as \n     part of the National Abortion Federation's Second Trimester \n     Abortion From Every Angle Risk Management Seminar held in \n     September of 1992?\n       Dr. Robinson. As I have testified before, I did not attend \n     that particular meeting of NAF. I was not present. I have not \n     seen that publication.\n       Mr. Canady. Oh. You have not seen Dr. Haskell's publication \n     on that subject at all?\n       Dr. Robinson. I have not seen what he has published.\n       Mr. Canady. Have you consulted any other literature on this \n     subject?\n       Dr. Robinson. There is no published literature in what we \n     consider the normal medical literature. If I did a Med-Line \n     search, I would not find this term anywhere in the Med-Line \n     search covering about 6,000 medical journals.\n       Mr. Canady. What term is that?\n       Dr. Robinson. Med-Line search, it's a way----\n       Mr. Canady. No, no, no, no. You said you would not if you \n     did a Med-Line search find this term.\n       Dr. Robinson. The term being used in the legislation.\n       Mr. Canady. I refer to some other terms. Dilation and \n     extraction, intact dilation and evacuation, interuterine \n     cranial decompression. What about those terms?\n       Dr. Robinson. If I was to look up the word dilation and \n     extraction, a standard D, this is an accepted and \n     considered by many one of the safer methods of accomplishing \n     a second trimester abortion. With that I am familiar with and \n     have done it.\n       Mr. Canady. Dilation and extraction?\n       Dr. Robinson. D\n       Mr. Canady. OK. Let me ask you this. Now a letter has been \n     sent out by the National Abortion Federation in which you \n     were quoted as saying that the drawings in some materials \n     that I distributed, which are identical to these drawings on \n     the posters, had little relationship to the truth or to \n     medicine.\n       Now in your prepared testimony, which you submitted to the \n     subcommittee, you said I have seen the sketches that have \n     been passed around. They are medically inaccurate and not \n     designed to advance proper understanding of a surgical \n     procedure. Rather, they are designed to be upsetting and \n     inflammatory to the lay person. Now there you said they were \n     medically inaccurate. When you were giving your testimony a \n     few minutes go, I thought you said something a little \n     different than what is in your written statement. Could you \n     tell me what your current view is of these?\n       Dr. Robinson. I apologize to the committee. Coming down \n     here I took advantage to read what I had prepared and did a \n     little maintaining.\n       Mr. Canady. I have no problem with people changing their \n     minds if they get additional \n\n[[Page S 16772]]\n     information that convinces them that an earlier view is not correct.\n       Dr. Robinson. My view is essentially that those drawings \n     would not appear in a textbook. These drawings would not \n     appear in a journal.\n       Mr. Canady. Do you think they are technically correct?\n       Dr. Robinson. They describe, the first one where he is \n     reaching up there. I think they have taken some artistic \n     license to sort of move things around.\n       Mr. Canady. But you do think they are technically correct?\n       Dr. Robinson. That is exactly probably what is occurring in \n     the hands of the two physicians.\n       Mr. Canady. OK, well, I appreciate that. I think that's a \n     very different thing than what was referred to in the letter \n     sent out by the National Abortion Federation, in which you \n     were quoted as saying they had little relationship to the \n     truth or to medicine. I am glad to clarify that point.\n       Now, there's some controversy here about whether a baby is, \n     in fact, being delivered or whether it is correct to call \n     this partial-birth abortion. I just want to quote this paper \n     you have not seen. I will be happy to provide a copy of it to \n     you, you might find it of interest, that was prepared by Dr. \n     Haskell, in which in describing this procedure he says, \n     ``With the lower extremity in the vagina, the surgeon uses \n     his finger to deliver the opposite lower extremity, then the \n     torso, the shoulders, and the upper extremities.'' The term \n     deliver is specifically used by I think one of the leading \n     practitioners of this particular procedure. I just wanted to \n     note that.\n       I will now turn to Mr. Frank and recognize him.\n       Mr. Frank. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to ask I guess \n     Ms. Smith, Dr. White, Ms. Morton, your opposition to abortion \n     on the various grounds, does that extend beyond this \n     particular procedure, Ms. Smith?\n       Dr. Smith. Dr. Smith, please.\n       Mr. Frank. Sorry. Dr. Smith.\n       Dr. Smith. Excuse me. You want to know whether or not I \n     have a problem with abortion in general?\n       Mr. Frank. Do your objections extend beyond this particular \n     procedure?\n       Dr. Smith. OK. I was asked today to come and speak about \n     this procedure.\n       Mr. Frank. I understand, but I'm asking you to talk about \n     other things.\n       Dr. Smith. As the president of the American Association of \n     Pro-Life OB/GYN's, I think that should be quite obvious that \n     I have a problem with abortion.\n       Mr. Frank. I will be honest with you. I don't always read \n     people's biographies. I like to ask them questions and get \n     answers.\n       Dr. Smith. I'm sorry. I thought you knew. I'm sorry.\n       Mr. Frank. I'm sorry you find that an imposition, but I'm \n     asking you your position. I won't do that again, if that's \n     bothersome. Dr. White.\n       Dr. White. The answer is yes.\n       Mr. Frank. Now do you feel that one of the points you made \n     and I heard Ms. Morton make too, was that the fetus, the \n     baby, feels pain. That is true with regard to other \n     procedures besides this one, I assume? That the fetus would \n     feel pain?\n       Dr. White. I so testified.\n       Mr. Frank. Yes. Again, I apologize. I can't always be \n     everywhere at the same place. So the pain point then applies \n     to others as well. Ms. Morton.\n       Ms. Morton. You are saying the babies, that it would \n     undergo any other surgical procedure?\n       Mr. Frank. Would also feel pain?\n       Ms. Morton. Yes. They certainly do.\n       Mr. Frank. OK. Well, my point then is that if there is \n     consensus that pain is felt in every situation, to my mind \n     that does not become a basis for differentiating between \n     abortion and this situation and abortion elsewhere. I \n     understand there are people who think abortion is wrong. But \n     the question is, why we would single this out.\n       Let me then ask also the three witnesses whom I just \n     addressed. This particular legislation says that not only \n     would the pregnant woman be subject to no penalties \n     whatsoever, but she could, in fact, sue the doctor who \n     performed the procedure.\n       Dr. White, do you think that is appropriate, that a woman \n     who decided to have this done, sought out the doctor, went to \n     the doctor's office voluntarily, submitted to the procedure, \n     and then with no malpractice or anything, we're not talking \n     here about malpractice, because I don't want to get doctors \n     really upset. We are talking only about the doctor who \n     performs the procedure exactly as described and it has \n     exactly the results projected, and the woman then can sue \n     him. Do you agree with that part of the law?\n       Mr. Canady. Could I just----\n       Mr. Frank. If I get extra time.\n       Mr. Canady. Absolutely. You'll get extra time. It is my \n     understanding that under tort law, it is generally the case \n     that it is considered malpractice to perform a procedure \n     which is illegal. I just would point that out.\n       Mr. Frank. Yes. I understand. But this statute, if it was \n     simply general tort law you wouldn't have to do it in the \n     statute. I assume this is not going on my time, because I am \n     responding to the gentleman, but what the gentleman is saying \n     is, please don't pay attention to the law I broke. I mean if \n     that was general tort law, what did you put it in the statute \n     for? You clearly meant to do more than general tort law. \n     That's the principle that is explicitly written in here.\n       So Dr. White, do you think that a woman in that situation \n     should be allowed to recover damages from the doctor who \n     performed the procedure exactly as she asked him to?\n       Dr. White. I'm no legal expert, Mr. Frank.\n       Mr. Frank. This is a matter of policy. It is not a question \n     of what the law is.\n       Dr. White. But I find the procedure so inhumane and so \n     nonscientific, that if this particular part of the bill \n     became law, I could accept it.\n       Mr. Frank. You think the woman should be allowed to sue. \n     Dr. Smith?\n       Dr. Smith. I would like to answer your question. First of \n     all, I don't know how the people who do abortions do their \n     practice. I do know that most of the times when women ask \n     about abortion, and people do come to me and talk to me about \n     it, they don't usually go in saying I want a particular \n     procedure. They usually go in saying I don't want to be \n     pregnant any more, or in a particular case if they find out \n     that they have a baby that has an abnormality that is \n     incompatible with life, they generally don't ask you, do you \n     do D\n       Mr. Frank. What if they do? Ms. Watts said she did, and she \n     had it explained to her.\n       Dr. Smith. I'm telling you----\n       Mr. Frank. I understand, but I am asking the question.\n       Dr. Smith. I am answering your question.\n       Mr. Frank. No, you are not, Dr. Smith.\n       Dr. Smith. Well, let me try to. OK?\n       Mr. Frank. You are not answering it. Let me explain to you \n     why. Maybe I better rephrase the question better. The bill \n     covers every situation. You are talking about there may \n     be situation where the woman was mislead. The bill would \n     allow the woman to sue in situations where it was \n     explained to her exactly, as it apparently was to Ms. \n     Watts.\n       My question to you is, where it was explained to a woman \n     exactly what was going to happen, and that's what happened, \n     should she be allowed, as this bill would allow her, to sue \n     the doctor?\n       Dr. Smith. If the doctor is doing something illegal and he \n     hurts the woman, then first of all, if it's a law, he is \n     breaking the law.\n       Secondly, if he is doing an experimental procedure.\n       Mr. Frank. No----\n       Dr. Smith. I am trying to answer your question. If he is \n     doing an experimental procedure----\n       Mr. Frank. You are not answering my question.\n       Dr. Smith. We must tell the woman that this is what I am \n     doing, and therefore, do you agree to it. Most patients do \n     not ask their doctors for a specific abortion technique.\n       Mr. Frank. You are evading the question.\n       Dr. Smith. They ask, I don't want to be pregnant.\n       Mr. Frank. Yes, Dr. Smith. You are deliberately evading the \n     question.\n       Dr. Smith. I am not evading the question.\n       Mr. Frank. Excuse me, Dr. Smith. I am going to finish. You \n     are deliberating evading the question. I said to you where we \n     have circumstances where the woman explicitly is told by the \n     doctor what is going to happen, it's not experimental, et \n     cetera.\n       Mr. Canady. The gentleman's time is expired.\n       Mr. Frank. With my extra time?\n       Mr. Canady. Yes. I think you got more than the time I took.\n       Dr. Smith. Can I just ask question? Can I ask him a \n     question, please?\n       Mr. Canady. No. I'm sorry. We're going to have to recognize \n     Mr. Inglis at this point. Then we'll have another round of \n     questions. Hopefully, Mr. Frank will have another opportunity \n     on the second round. Mr. Inglis.\n       Mr. Inglis. I would love for you to ask your question.\n       Dr. Smith. I would like to know, you are setting up a \n     situation where you are telling me that my patient is coming \n     in and asking me to do something that I know is against the \n     law? And then you are supposing that the doctor knows this is \n     against the law and then is going to ask, cahoots with the \n     patient to do something that is against the law when they \n     have another alternative to help that person if they don't \n     want to be pregnant not to be pregnant?\n       I guess the reason I didn't understand your question is \n     that I don't assume that doctors break laws that they know \n     they are not supposed to be breaking. So if you are asking me \n     if two people want to conspire together to do something that \n     is criminal, I don't know how to respond to that. You'd \n     have to ask a doctor who does that. I don't do that.\n       Mr. Frank. Would the gentleman yield for me to answer the \n     question?\n       Mr. Inglis. Sure. Just briefly though. I've got another \n     question.\n       Mr. Frank. Well, you yielded to her to ask me a question. \n     It would seem to be only fair.\n       The answer to you is that you seem to think it was a stupid \n     question. But what you really mean is that it is a stupid \n     bill, because I asked you the question that came from the \n     bill. It is the bill that sets up those circumstances. You \n     say you are presuming these circumstances. I am reading from \n     the bill. The bill is the one that assumes that there will be \n     a doctor who will do that and the woman will sue. So your \n     discussion----\n       Mr. Inglis. Let me reclaim my time.\n       Mr. Frank. Is about the bill itself. I was asking you a \n     circumstance from the legislation.\n       Mr. Inglis. I'm going to reclaim my time and yield to the \n     Chairman for a response to that attack on the bill.\n       Mr. Canady. I hope and presume that there will never be any \n     prosecutions under this law \n\n[[Page S 16773]]\n     once it is enacted. I believe that respectable practitioners will not \n     violate this law. So I think what we have in the bill is a \n     mechanism to ensure that there is a consequence if they do. \n     That will encourage their compliance with the law. I will \n     yield back to the gentleman----\n       Mr. Frank. Will the gentleman yield?\n       Mr. Inglis. No, no. I am going with the question. I have \n     got another question. I am very interested in, and understand \n     I am running back and forth between two subcommittee \n     hearings, but I understand that Dr. Robinson, you testified \n     that partial birth is a misnomer, that this is not really \n     what it is. I would ask you, sir, distinguish for me the \n     difference between the child let's say on these charts that \n     is--I'm not a medical expert, but I assume it's about 5 \n     inches, maybe less than that. Maybe 2 inches difference.\n       In other words, when the child is once delivered, which is \n     a matter of inches I take it, can you explain to me the \n     difference in your opinion, between the child that has been \n     delivered and the difference between the child whose head is \n     still in utero?\n       Dr. Robinson. Actually, I am not clear what the question \n     is.\n       Mr. Inglis. You said that there was not a----\n       Dr. Robinson. We have in our tradition we have other terms. \n     I am surprised the word partial extraction was not used. This \n     is a standard term in obstetrics that we use for delivering. \n     That could have been used. The use of the word living, these \n     types of----\n       Mr. Inglis. Let me refine the question a little bit. Do you \n     understand that if you did this procedure it would be legal, \n     but if the child were delivered out of the canal, and you \n     took your same instruments and whacked off its head, do you \n     understand a legal difference between the way you might be \n     treated there?\n       Dr. Robinson. Well, as a younger resident before we had a \n     lot of sophisticated techniques, I was often faced with the \n     delivery of a breech, in which I found the baby at that point \n     still alive, with an enormous head. Yes. I have upon \n     occasion----\n       Mr. Inglis. No, no, no, no, no. You are missing the \n     question. Let me explain the question. I want you to explain \n     to me the difference between the child that you may legally \n     kill inside, with its head inside the canal, and the \n     situation that would occur if you were once it was delivered \n     those last few inches, to whack off its head. What is the \n     difference between what would happen to you?\n       Dr. Robinson. If the law was passed, I have no idea what \n     would happen. The law has not passed. I know that I am under \n     law right now, permitted to meet my patient's needs in \n     providing her an abortion.\n       Mr. Inglis. OK. Let me ask you this. Now we are talking \n     about the legal. Tell me how you justify in your own soul, if \n     you will, the difference in treatment between the last few \n     inches. I mean describe for me the status difference of that \n     human being. What is the difference in status? One, it's \n     almost all out. In fact, I think the shoulders are out, are \n     they not, and the head is simply in. In the other, the head \n     is out.\n       I have witnessed four beautiful births of my four children. \n     I recall that that's a rather triumphant moment. Can you tell \n     me the difference in the status in your own mind, between \n     those children? The one that's head is inside, and the one \n     that's head is outside?\n       Mr. Canady. If you could do so briefly, please, because the \n     gentleman's time is expired.\n       Dr. Robinson. In my situation, I am dealing with a woman \n     who has come to me for reasons that she wants to interrupt \n     her unplanned, unwanted pregnancy. There are congenital \n     anomalies. In some cases, the babies may be partially dead or \n     won't live when it is on the outside. The conditions under \n     which I, my staff, the nurses in which we are delivering \n     this, as was described, the support and the concern.\n       The other than you are describing when I am dealing with a \n     patient who is desperately trying to have a live child, and \n     through the mistake of nature, delivers early, prematurely. \n     In most cases, I would probably not have delivered that baby \n     this way. I would have done a caesarian section.\n       Mr. Canady. The gentleman's time is expired. Mr. Hoke.\n       Mr. Hoke. Dr. Robinson, you had stated that in no case is \n     pain induced to the fetus. The fetus feels no pain at all. We \n     have heard a lot of conflicting testimony regarding that, \n     from a nurse and a neuro scientist.\n       If the baby is alive right up until the very end of the \n     procedure, do you still stand by that testimony?\n       Dr. Robinson. I am not a neuroscientist. I have read some \n     of the literature, although it's not an area that I spend a \n     great deal of time at. I have listened to the nurse testify \n     as to what instinctively she has learned. Instincts, of \n     course, are not the way we learn.\n       Mr. Hoke. What do you base your statement that there is no \n     pain?\n       Dr. Robinson. Because I'm not sure I know what pain is. \n     Spinosa called it a chronic condition. I am an expert in \n     chronic pain. I deal with a lot of people with chronic pelvic \n     pain. What is it, where does it start.\n       Mr. Hoke. How about when like if you took a knife and you \n     were cutting a tomato and you sliced into your finger, would \n     you experience something that you might describe as pain?\n       Dr. Robinson. That would be an acute pain reaction. Yes.\n       Mr. Hoke. Al right. Well then if we can use that \n     definition, which I think is probably one that many people \n     share. Using that kind of definition, are you saying that in \n     no case is that kind of pain induced to the fetus? Is that \n     what you meant by your testimony?\n       Dr. Robinson. I am sure that if you had the fetus outside \n     and had it sophisticated, you would see EKG changes, you \n     would see certain reactions. But this simply the passage of \n     information from a no-susceptive sensor up to the brain. \n     Whether that is pain or not pain, I do not know the answer to \n     that.\n       Mr. Hoke. Well, Dr. White, the testimony that we had heard \n     from Dr. Robinson was that if there was pain, and apparently \n     there is some question in Dr. Robinson's mind about that, \n     whether or not there is pain, that it wouldn't be felt \n     because under the circumstances there's an anesthetic that \n     has been given to the patient, to the woman. Would an \n     anesthesia, would local anesthesia affect the fetus or would \n     the fetus be inside the uterine sack, would it be different, \n     a different set of circumstances?\n       Dr. White. Well, there are certain pharmacological agents \n     that are administered as anesthetics, mainly in the use of \n     general anesthetics, which do transfer through the placenta, \n     and at a significantly reduced amount do reach the child.\n       There isn't the number of studies that we need on that. I \n     think the difficulty is that under these circumstances and \n     the evidence we have in terms of cardiovascular responses, \n     certain chemistries that have been drawn from the fetus under \n     these circumstances, demonstrate the fact that there is \n     considerable stress and indeed, overwhelming pain.\n       There are enough studies in children of this age. Much in \n     the age range that the nurse has demonstrated to us. I think \n     there is really very little argument any longer that the \n     fetuses that we are talking about in the gestational age, the \n     idea is, they do receive pain and appreciate it. I don't want \n     to bore you certainly in the question period, evidence and so \n     forth. I personally think it is incontroversial.\n       But going back to what is said here, that when you actually \n     attempt to divide, and it's not clear whether it's the spinal \n     cord or the brain stem, and then suck out the brain, in a \n     sense, modern medicine feels that the brain is the very \n     essence of human existence. That is what the concept of brain \n     death is based on, equals human death. You might as well cut \n     the head off under those circumstances, because you are \n     destroying the very organ that is the essence of humanhood.\n       But it is the procedure itself. The idea as Dr. Smith has \n     shown, of a scissors being introduced into this area. I doubt \n     these people even know where they are operating. I need a \n     microscope to see this area. So it is very possible they \n     could be removing this brain in this tragic way of \n     extraction, sucking, whatever you want to call it, when the \n     child is still alive under those circumstances.\n       Mr. Hoke. I guess what I don't understand about this when I \n     hear the testimony is why those who are proponents of the \n     procedure are trying to jump through such extraordinary hoops \n     to say that it is not painful or that it is not inhumane, or \n     that somehow there is--I mean, let's call it exactly what it \n     is, and then if in fact under those circumstances it's \n     something that a nation can tolerate, then that's fine. But \n     let's not pretend that somehow this is not grotesquely \n     painful to the fetus that it's been subjected upon.\n       I wanted to, there's one other--yes, Doctor.\n       Dr. White. Sorry to interrupt. You are absolutely correct. \n     Because the two papers that have been cited over and over \n     again, and unfortunately Dr. Robinson hasn't read it, are the \n     two experts in this field that do this sort of abortion. You \n     will note that in their papers they do not stress the fact \n     that because of the anesthesia administered to the mother, if \n     indeed any, that the child, the infant, the fetus, is not \n     suffering pain. That is not a part of their written remarks.\n       Mr. Canady. The gentleman's time has expired. The time for \n     this meeting has about expired. We're going to have to \n     adjourn this hearing.\n       Mrs. Schroeder. Mr. Chairman.\n       Mr. Canady. I'm sorry. There's a----\n       Mr. Frank. Excuse me, Mr. Chairman. I thought we had a 1 \n     o'clock meeting of the full committee. But Mrs. Schroeder not \n     to be able to ask questions, we do have until 1 o'clock.\n       Mr. Canady. The Republicans on the committee have a \n     caucus which we are late for at this point, preliminary to \n     the meeting.\n       Mrs. Schroeder. Mr. Chairman.\n       Mr. Frank. Mr. Chairman, I do have to object. You guys \n     scheduled these two meetings. To deprive our members of a \n     chance to ask questions. Then be a few more minutes late or \n     leave one person behind. But to deprive Ms. Schroeder and Ms. \n     Jackson-Lee of a chance to answer questions while the panel \n     is here, over 10 minutes.\n       Mr. Canady. Mrs. Schroeder, you will be recognized for 5 \n     minutes. I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson-Lee, you are not a member of \n     this subcommittee. We will have to conclude at the end of \n     your 5 minutes. Please proceed.\n       Mrs. Schroeder. Well, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate that. I \n     was a little startled. I am sorry. I had an amendment on the \n     floor so I was a little late getting back.\n       But let me just say my understanding is while I was gone, \n     that the witnesses that testified for the bill said they \n     really were against abortion at any stage. I take it that all \n     of you would agree with the premise that this bill should go \n     forward even if a doctor were to ascertain this medical \n     procedure was \n\n[[Page S 16774]]\n     much better for a woman who was seeking abortion. Is that correct?\n       Dr. Smith. No. First of all, there has been no proof that \n     this procedure is safe for anybody.\n       Mrs. Schroeder. Wait a minute. Let me take back my time. \n     That was not my question. I said if it is proven, and if a \n     doctor says this is safer for the woman, would you still want \n     this to pass? You still want to outlaw this procedure?\n       Dr. White. I don't think that is possible. It is not \n     scientific. I mean, you are going to violate science.\n       Mrs. Schroeder. I mean we have two big views of what \n     science really is. We are hearing about pain. My \n     understanding, birth is also painful for babies.\n       But one of the things I think we should do as we--Dr. \n     Robinson, I understand you had some slides. Is that correct?\n       Dr. Robinson. Just pictures of congenital anomalies such as \n     has already been adequately discussed here. I don't think it \n     would necessarily enhance the proceedings. It would prolong \n     it. They are simply standard pictures of babies in very poor \n     shape.\n       Mrs. Schroeder. Because of the interest. I think it is very \n     important that we have some balance there.\n       Dr. White, when you were talking about humanity comes from \n     a brain. Does that mean if a baby does not have a brain then \n     this procedure would be OK? Is that then not human?\n       Dr. White. Well, even the anacephalic child has a brain \n     stem. While we have a great deal of difficulty defining brain \n     death, as we can do in adults, in children and certainly in \n     infants, it is not true that under ordinary circumstances, a \n     child would be born or would be at these gestational ages, \n     totally without even a brain stem. I mean it's not \n     impossible, but I mean the thing is, in general, the \n     anacephalic child has a brain stem. Therefore, they have a \n     part of a brain.\n       Going to your question, would I consider this appropriate \n     under those circumstances, that is, with the brain stem \n     retained. My answer would be no.\n       Mrs. Schroeder. And then what if it were a mole? Well, \n     never mind.\n       Dr. White. I don't know what you mean.\n       Dr. Smith. He doesn't know what a mole is.\n       Mrs. Schroeder. I guess I feel a lot of pressure because \n     the Chairman doesn't want me to ask questions. I have got \n     many questions that I want to ask here.\n       One of the things I am so troubled by is I think as \n     Congress moves in and starts micromanaging what OB/GYN's can \n     teach, what the medical profession is saying, what kind of \n     procedures are legal and illegal, where is the line, are you \n     going to have Federal people in these operating rooms \n     watching this?\n       You know what I think is going to happen is it is going to \n     be very difficult to get high quality docs ever wanting to \n     deal with women's issues, women's health issues, because who \n     needs this, who needs this. It is the only area of medicine \n     where I know that there is this kind of micromanaging.\n       I see two distinguished members of the medical profession \n     sitting side by side. I think traditionally you would say \n     that they have had very high ethics. You have had your own \n     oath, you have had your own policing.\n       Mr. Canady. There are three physicians here and another \n     medical practitioner.\n       Mrs. Schroeder. Three physicians, I'm sorry. Three sitting \n     side by side and a nurse. So we have four, OK. But let me \n     say, you have had high standards. I don't think we probably \n     need to get Congress into micromanaging down to the details \n     of what is going on. That is why I am very troubled by this \n     beginning, because I see this as a tremendous erosion. I see \n     it as a backsliding.\n       I have talked to many deans of medical schools who are very \n     troubled by this, who say, you know, we're not sure we really \n     want to continue even dealing with obstetrics and \n     gynecology. Long term, I think that hurts all women, \n     because you don't have the safe standards. We know women's \n     health has not been dealt with very well in this country \n     any way. To begin this, I think is very troubling.\n       So, Mr. Chairman, I have a lot of questions that I would \n     like to ask for the record, if that's OK, since you would \n     like me to be quiet. I would like to yield the remaining time \n     to Ms.----\n       Mr. Canady. I have not wanted you to be quiet. As a matter \n     of fact, we recognized you at the beginning of the hearing, \n     and you will have the last word in the hearing as well, \n     because your time is now expired. The full committee is \n     commencing a meeting in about two minutes. In light of that, \n     we're not going to be able to continue with this subcommittee \n     meeting. I wish we could. There's an additional witness. \n     Prof. David Smolin of the Cumberland Law School, who has come \n     for the hearing today. I apologize to you, Professor, that \n     due to this meeting of the full committee, that it was only \n     scheduled yesterday, because of our inability to finish the \n     work we had to conclude yesterday. We will not be able to \n     continue.\n       I want to again thank all of the members of this panel for \n     being here. We appreciate your valuable testimony. The \n     subcommittee is adjourned.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much time remains on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 68\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair and yield the floor to my \ndistinguished colleague from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Who yields time to the Senator from California?\n  Mr. SPECTER. How much time would the Senator--5 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will do my best.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We have a number of Senators who have already requested \ntime. I yield the Senator 5 minutes.\n  I say to my distinguished colleague from California that I wish we \nhad more time, but we have many requests. I think it is important to \nhear the intentions of those in opposition who wish to respond. But I \ndo yield 5 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I rise to support the motion to commit to the \nJudiciary Committee, and I do that as the only woman in the U.S. Senate \non the Judiciary Committee. This is a matter which basically affects \nwomen, and I think it really is appropriate to have the hearings that \nhave been requested and to come to grips with some of the problems that \nare inherent in this legislation.\n  I would like to give you my major reasons for suggesting that \nhearings in the Judiciary Committee are appropriate.\n  I believe that the language in this bill is unduly vague. It is not \nbased on medical terminology. The bill holds a doctor criminally liable \nfor a procedure that is defined not in medical terms but in a \ndescription devised by legislators. I think we need to come to grips \nwith that and find out exactly which procedures would be impacted by \nthis legislation.\n  Second, Roe versus Wade already provides for States to legislate in \nthe third trimester. And, in fact, 41 States do already have statutes \non the books which govern abortions in the third trimester. There are \nalso very strong writings and beliefs that this bill would violate the \nConstitution. I think that is worthy of a hearing.\n  Finally, there is a very real human dilemma in this. Unfortunately, \nthe genetic code which carries out God's creation is sometime's \ntragically faulty. And this produces heartbreaking circumstances in \nwhich children have developed in the fetus without brains, children \nhave developed with the brain outside of the skull, children develop \nwithout eyes or ears, whose stomachs are hollow, and the materials \nhaving to do with intestines and bladder are created outside of the \nphysical structure of the individual.\n  When we consider the nature of these heartbreaking pregnancies, these \nvery dire circumstances, we must also consider the life and health of \nthe mother. So I believe very strongly that this is the correct action \nto take, to have these hearings and to report this bill back to this \nbody within a specified period of time.\n  Let me just very quickly speak to certain issues. In 1973, in Roe \nversus Wade, the Supreme Court established a trimester system to govern \nabortions. In that system, in the first 12 to 15 weeks of a pregnancy, \nwhen 95.5 percent of all abortions occur, and the procedure is \nmedically the safest, the Government may not, under Roe, place an undue \nburden on a woman's right to an abortion.\n  In the second trimester, when the procedure in some situations poses \na greater health risk, States may regulate abortion, but only to \nprotect the health of the mother. This might mean, for example, \nrequiring that an abortion be performed in a hospital or performed by a \nlicensed physician.\n  In the later stages of pregnancy, at the point the fetus becomes \nviable and is able to live independently from the mother, Roe \nrecognizes the State's strong interest in protecting potential human \nlife. On that basis, States are allowed to prohibit abortions, except \nin cases where the abortion is necessary to protect the life or the \nhealth of the woman. I repeat, the life or the health of the woman.\n  Contrary to the many myths put forward by opponents, abortion in the \nlatest stages of pregnancy is extremely rare and performed almost \nexclusively under the most tragic of circumstances--to protect the life \nor health of a woman who very much \n\n[[Page S 16775]]\nwanted that pregnancy, or in the case of a severe and fatally deformed \nfetus.\n  As I said, 41 States have enacted laws restricting abortions in the \nlater stages of pregnancy. Even when such abortions have been \nrestricted, States have, in nearly every case, made exceptions to \nprotect the life and the health of the mother.\n  States such as Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, \nKentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, North \nCarolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and \nUtah--all these States, and many more, have recognized the crucial need \nto consider risks to a woman's health, in addition to risks to a \nwoman's life, in balancing the important considerations of both the \nfetus and the mother. To do otherwise would be to fail to accord \nconsideration to the safety and well-being of our Nation's women. To do \notherwise would be callous, and cruel.\n  Certain States have chosen to remain silent on the issue--most likely \nbecause these abortions are so rare and considered so tragic, that new \nlaws are not necessary to interfere with what many believe is a medical \ndecision between a woman and her doctor.\n\n\n         THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT BE STEPPING IN HERE\n\n  There are several compelling reasons why the Federal Government \nshould not step in and interfere in this medical decision between a \ndoctor and a patient.\n  First, there is no need to. Except in the rarest of cases, abortions \nlate in the pregnancy simply do not occur, and when they do, as I have \nsaid, it is due to the most tragic of circumstances. Only one-half of 1 \npercent of all abortions are performed after the 20th week of \npregnancy. Fewer than four one-hundredths of 1 percent (.04) occur in \nthe third trimester, and nearly all of these are performed due to \nsevere fetal abnormalities or grave risks to the health or life of the \npregnant woman.\n  Many of the people pushing this legislation profess to believe in \nStates' rights, and keeping government off our backs. Why, then, do \nthey suddenly think Big Brother should step in when the issue is \nabortion? Roe versus Wade gave States the authority to regulate and \neven ban abortion after viability. Why, then, is there a compelling \nneed for the Federal Government to interfere?\n  Lets be candid. Although this Congress has seen a host of back-door \nefforts to restrict women's access to abortions, this legislation \nrepresents a direct, and blatant, challenge to Roe versus Wade. \nProponents of this measure openly admit that this is a strategic \nmilestone in the road toward making abortion illegal in this country. \nIf this measure passes and is enacted into law it will be a significant \nvictory for the antichoice forces.\n\n\n                       THIS IS A MEDICAL DECISION\n\n  Finally and most importantly, the reason politicians should stay out \nof this is because this is a medical decision, not a political one. It \nis important to remember that in the heartbreaking cases where medical \nintervention in pregnancy is warranted--these were wanted pregnancies. \nThe decision to have an abortion for these women and their families was \none that they desperately tried to avoid. And the Federal Government \nhas no business making that decision any harder on these families. Take \nthe case of Viki Wilson:\n  Viki Wilson is a nurse who lives in Fresno, CA, with her husband, \nBill, an emergency room physician, and their two children, Jon and \nKaitlyn. Viki and Bill very much wanted more children and she became \npregnant in August 1993 with a baby girl.\n  After what seemed to be a normal, healthy pregnancy filled with baby \nshowers, a freshly painted nursery, and family members touching Viki's \nstomach to feel the baby kick, Viki received the worst imaginable news: \nher beautiful baby girl had a fatal deformity, known as \nencephalocoeles--a condition where the brain forms outside the skull \nand is always, unconditionally, fatal.\n  Viki and Bill would have done anything on Earth to save their baby \ngirl, whom they named Abigail. But she had no chance of survival.\n  Viki was warned that, if she continued the pregnancy, she risked \nrupturing her uterus, or causing a massive infection that would leave \nher unable to have more children. After consulting with their \nphysicians, Viki and Bill decided that the safest thing to do was to \nabort the pregnancy.\n  An abortion at this late stage of pregnancy is not easy, and Viki's \ndoctor recommended a procedure known as intact dilation and evacuation. \nIn layperson's terms, it means attempting to induce cervical dilation \nartificially and removing the fetus intact. In cases such as Viki's, \nthe deformed head of the fetus could not fit through the cervix, and \nfluid had to be extracted in order to complete the delivery safely.\n  This abortion procedure saved Viki Wilson's health and perhaps her \nlife. It is the same procedure that opponents of abortion have called a \n``partial birth abortion,'' in order to mislead people into believing \nthat a live and healthy fetus is being disposed of. Nothing could be \nfurther from the truth.\n  After Viki Wilson's story was published, I received a letter from a \nconstituent of mine who had been through a similar tragedy. She wrote:\n\n       My husband and I lost our baby on March 10, 1995. Our baby \n     was diagnosed with a herniated diaphragm . . . preventing its \n     heart and lungs from growing normally. My husband and I had \n     to make the most devastating decision of our lives during my \n     19th week of pregnancy. This baby was our first child, and we \n     had so much love and excitement for its birth. The doctors \n     gave us two choices: terminate the pregnancy, or continue the \n     pregnancy with surgery in utero, understanding that [the \n     baby] would only live for a few weeks under life support \n     after birth . . . My health was at risk if I carried to term \n     and my baby would not live for even one month on this earth.\n\n  This woman needed the same procedure that Viki Wilson had, the same \nprocedure that this bill would outlaw.\n  And a woman named Karen Ham became critically ill with diabetes \nduring her second trimester and had to be flown 450 miles to a clinic \nin Colorado for an abortion necessary to save her life. When she \narrived, she was in shock and about to go into cardiac failure.\n\n\n                         THE NEED FOR HEARINGS\n\n  This body is attempting to legislate a complicated medical decision \nwithout even so much as an adequate public hearing on the matter. I \nlistened to Senator Smith on the floor some months ago. It was the \nfirst time I had seen photos depicted on C-SPAN full screen. With all \ndue respects, I believe that his presentation was one-sided and fully \nmisleading. If this legislation is to go forward, it is essential that \nthe Judiciary Committee hold hearings on the bill, as this bill would \ncreate criminal liability for doctors who perform this late-term \nprocedure.\n  We need to hear from the experts--the doctors and other health \nprofessionals, and from the parents who have been through this \nprocedure.\n  There are many health risks that women can face during pregnancy, \nrisks that could worsen during pregnancy, requiring a late-term \nabortion: heart disease, cancer, diabetes, just to name a few. These \nrisks cannot be dismissed as we consider legislation that would ban \nwhat may be the only medically safe option to terminate a pregnancy.\n\n\n        S. 939 REPRESENTS A DIRECT CHALLENGE TO ROE VERSUS WADE\n\n  Every Senator in this Chamber should make no mistake about what this \nbill is: This bill is a direct challenge to Roe versus Wade.\n  Roe versus Wade firmly established that, after viability, abortion \nmay be banned as long as an exemption is provided in cases where the \nwoman's life or health is at risk. This provision was explicitly \nreaffirmed by the Court in Planned Parenthood versus Casey.\n  This bill is unconstitutional on its face because it allows for no \nexception in the case where the banned procedure may be necessary to \nprotect a woman's health. Even further, the bill holds the doctor \ncriminally liable unless he or she can prove that the banned procedure \nwas the only one that would have saved a woman's life. The doctor must \ngo to court to prove this. This places an undue burden on access to \nlate-term abortions to save a woman's life under Roe versus Wade.\n  The Smith bill also ignores the viability line established in Roe and \nreaffirmed in Casey. The bill would criminalize use of a particular \nabortion procedure, virtually without exception, even before fetal \nviability. This again constitutes an undue burden--prohibiting a \nprocedure that for some women would be the safest in light of their \nmedical condition. \n\n[[Page S 16776]]\n\n  The proponents of this bill know quite well the challenges to Roe \nthis legislation presents. That is their intent. The magnitude of this \nbill is enormous for the long-term preservation of safe and legal \nabortion in this country. It will have an immediate and direct effect \non the lives of women facing tragic and health-threatening \ncircumstances. This bill needs to be considered thoroughly before it is \nbrought to the floor for a vote.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the motion to commit S. 939 to the \nSenate Judiciary Committee for hearings.\n  I would like to enter into the Record a letter written to the \nAmerican Medical Association by a San Francisco physician, David \nGrimes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. May I have 1 minute?\n  Mr. SPECTER. The Senator may. Let me say we are going to have to \nproceed on a limited basis. I already have requests from about 10 \nSenators to speak. The Senator may have 1 additional minute.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator very much.\n  I would like to enter a letter into the Record from a physician, an \nobstetrician, a surgeon, who served as chief of the Abortion \nSurveillance Branch at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, \nwhere he did some preliminary work in evaluating third-trimester \nabortions, and finds this issue to be largely a smokescreen for those \nopposed to abortion. He points out the rarity of these abortions. He \npoints out that in a study in Atlanta, the rate of third-trimester \nabortions was 4 per 100,000 abortions. I think this letter provides \nsome accurate and vital testimony.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                         University of California,\n\n\n                                                San Francisco,\n\n                              San Francisco, CA, October 11, 1995.\n     Re H.R. 1833/S. 939.\n\n     Ross Rubin, J.D.,\n     Legislative Council, American Medical Association, Chicago, \n         IL.\n       Dear Mr. Rubin: As a member of the AMA and a long-time \n     provider of abortions, I write to express my concern about \n     the reported intention of the AMA to endorse a ban of certain \n     abortion techniques. As background, I have conducted research \n     on the safety of abortion for two decades. Some of that \n     research has appeared in JAMA. I am Board certified in both \n     obstetrics and gynecology (for which I am an Examiner) and in \n     preventive medicine. In the 1980's, I served as Chief of the \n     Abortion Surveillance Branch at the Centers for Disease \n     Control in Atlanta, where I was the principal federal agent \n     responsible for determining the safety of abortion in the \n     U.S. I have served as a consultant to the Planned Parenthood \n     Federation of America and the American College of \n     Obstetricians and Gynecologists concerning abortion issues. I \n     currently chair the Steering Committee for the World Health \n     Organization Task Force on Post-Ovulatory Fertility Control, \n     which studies abortion internationally. I have testified \n     before Congressional subcommittees several times concerning \n     abortion issues.\n       First, the term being used by abortion opponents, ``partial \n     birth abortion,'' is not a medical term. It is not found in \n     any medical dictionary or gynecology text. It was coined to \n     inflame, rather than to illuminate. It lacks a definition.\n       As I understand the term, opponents of abortion are using \n     this phrase to describe one variant of the dilation and \n     evacuation procedure (D), which is the dominant method of \n     second-trimester abortion in the U.S. If one does not use \n     D, the alternative methods of abortion after 12 weeks' \n     gestation are ``total birth abortion:'' labor induction, \n     which is more costly and painful, or hysterotomy, which is \n     still most costly, painful, and hazardous. Given the enviable \n     record of safety of all D methods, as documented by the \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Lawson et al. \n     Abortion mortality, United States, 1972 through 1987. Am J \n     Obstet Gynecol 1994;171:1365-1372), there is no public health \n     justification for any regulation or intervention in a \n     physician's decision-making with the patient.\n       Second, the issue of alleged ``third-trimester abortion'' \n     is largely a smoke screen of those opposed to abortion. \n     Abortions after 24 weeks are exceedingly rare in the U.S. \n     Indeed, my colleagues and I at the Centers for Disease \n     Control investigated two years' worth of reports of such \n     abortions in Georgia. Nearly all were coding errors \n     concerning gestational age or fetal death in utero. We found \n     two uterine evacuations for anencephaly, and one case with \n     inadequate documentation. The rate of third-trimester \n     abortion was 4 per 100,000 abortions. (Spitz et al. Third-\n     trimester induced abortion in Georgia, 1979 and 1980. Am J \n     Public Health 1983;73:594-595)\n       According to Congress Daily, the legislative council felt \n     that some unspecified D variation is not a recognized \n     medical procedure. If so, this may reflect only the \n     composition and medical background of the legislative \n     council. Several variations of the D technique have been \n     widely used in the U.S. over the past twenty years (Grimes et \n     al. Midtrimester abortion by dilation and evacuation: a safe \n     and practical alternative. N Engl J. Med 1977;296:1141-1145) \n     and are well known to gynecologists and others who provide \n     abortions.\n       In summary, abortions after 24 week's gestation are \n     exceedingly uncommon and are done for compelling fetal or \n     maternal indications only. Variations of D are by far the \n     most common means of abortion in the U.S. after 12 weeks' \n     gestation. Outpatient D dramatically reduces medical costs \n     and pa- tient suffering, while having morbidity and mortality \n     comparable to labor induction. From a public health \n     perspective, any intrusion of Congress into this medical \n     issue is both unwarranted and unjustified. I hope that the \n     AMA will strongly oppose any such regulation of the practice \n     of medicine by anti-abortion activists.\n       If I can be of help to the legislative council by providing \n     references or by meeting with your group in Chicago, I would \n     be glad to do so. Thanks very much for your consideration.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                            David A. Grimes, M.D.,\n                                         Professor and Vice Chair.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I yield whatever time I may consume to \nmyself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Smith] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to Senator Specter's \nmotion to refer H.R. 1833 to the Committee on Judiciary.\n  Make no mistake about what this motion is. Let us not kid ourselves. \nIt is a motion made by the opponents of the bill that is intended to \nget the bill off the Senate floor, to get it out of the public \nspotlight, to spare the full membership of this body from having to \nface up to the grisly reality of partial-birth abortions. That is what \nthis motion is all about. Nothing else.\n  They do not want to see what happens in this grisly, disgusting \nprocedure. They do not want the American people to see it. That is why \nthey want to move this bill off the floor and send it back to \nJudiciary.\n  But frankly, Mr. President, the American people are sick and tired of \npoliticians doing just this: Ducking and weaving and dodging. The Ali \nshuffle, that is what it is here in the Senate: Let us not face up to \nreality, do not make the tough choice, do not give us a recorded vote, \ndo not come out here and vote your conscience; shuffle it off to \ncommittee.\n  Originally, the Senator from Pennsylvania was going to make it a 45-\nday motion, which would have taken us to December 23, which means it \nwould have taken us into the next year. Then he surprised us, I \nsuppose, in this element of surprise which is so common here, and he \nnow brought it back to December 7, 19 days, where he says we will \nreport the bill with amendments, if any. Of course, what he does not \nsay is they could report the bill with a recommendation to defeat it. \nHe does not point that out.\n  This is dilatory. It is an act of cowardice. It is a refusal to face \nreality, to face the issue. That is what this is about.\n  I want to make it very clear to my colleagues, I may lose on this \nmotion today. I hope not. I think when we get finished with the debate \nyou will know why I hope not. But if I do, and this motion carries, I \nwant my colleagues to understand that we are going to vote on this. We \nwill vote on it on the next bill that comes in here if it is an hour \nafter this, a day after this, a week after this, a month after this. \nThe next time I can get this amendment attached, it is going on and we \nare going to vote on it because I am not going to let the U.S. Senate \nback off from going on record on this issue.\n  Not tomorrow, not after some hearings. We have already had hearings. \nThe House has had hearings. The House has had a subcommittee markup, a \ncommittee markup, a report. We have had all of that. We have had a \ndebate. Senator Boxer and I debated last night on two national \nprograms. \n\n[[Page S 16777]]\n\n  Everybody knows what happens here, especially the opponents. They \nknow what happens here in this process. I am going to show you what \nhappens here in this process in a few moments. Everybody knows what \nhappens, and you will notice the opponents do not talk about that. \n``What we are talking about here is broad legal concepts, legalese,'' I \nhear from the Senator from Pennsylvania. This is not legalese.\n  Three inches from the head coming into the world with the rest of the \nbaby's body, 3 inches and maybe 3 or 4 seconds, the difference between \nwhen that needle or if that needle, Mr. President, is injected into the \nhead of that child. That is what we are talking about here, I say to my \ncolleagues. That is what the issue is. That is why nobody wants to talk \nabout it on the other side. Of course, they do not want to talk about \nit because it is a horrible, grisly, grotesque, gruesome killing of a \nchild that is 3 inches from completion through the birth canal.\n  So 3 inches and 3 seconds before that happens, you insert the \nscissors in the neck, you open up a wound, you insert the catheter and \nyou suck the brains out. But for 3 more seconds and 3 more inches, that \nchild is under the full protection of the Constitution of the United \nStates and, as the Senator from Pennsylvania pointed out, under the \nprotection of the law. Three seconds and 3 inches; 3 seconds and 3 \ninches.\n  The opponents voted down an effort to send the matter back to the \nRules Committee and did the job the American people sent them here to \ndo in the House of Representatives 288 to 139--288 to 139. The House of \nRepresentatives had the courage to face this issue. It was debated, \nthey had hearings, they had markups, subcommittee and full committee \nhearings, votes, full floor debate, committee report.\n  As if the American people would not know, as if the Senators here do \nnot know what is going on. Does anybody really believe some Senator is \ngoing to change their vote as a result of 19 more days? Give me a \nbreak.\n  I have been called an extremist for pointing this out, I say to my \ncolleagues--an extremist. It was said on the floor yesterday, not \ndirectly attributed to me, but it was said on the floor that those of \nus who support this bill are extremists. Senator Kennedy said it. \nSenator Boxer said it. Others have said it.\n  Well, here is a list of some of those extremists: The Democratic \nleader in the House, Richard Gephardt; Democratic Whip David Bonior; \nRepresentative John Dingell, ranking Democrat on the Commerce \nCommittee; Representative Lee Hamilton, ranking Democrat on \nInternational Relations; Representative David Obey, ranking Democrat on \nAppropriations; Representative Joe Moakley, ranking Democrat on the \nRules Committee; Representative John LaFalce, ranking Democrat on the \nSmall Business Committee; Representative Patrick Kennedy, Democrat of \nRhode Island; Representative Blanche Lambert Lincoln, Democrat of \nArkansas, and on and on and on. Marcy Kaptur, Democrat of Ohio, all \nextremists. Welcome aboard.\n  This is not an extremist issue. If we are extremist for wanting to \nstop this, what are the people who do it, who commit this act? It is \nreally fascinating to hear the defense of this procedure on the floor \nof this Senate.\n  Let me tell you how they defend it. Listen carefully, I say to my \ncolleagues, as you listen to the debate. Find one individual, just one, \nwho will point to these charts that I am going to show you in a minute \nand talk about what happens to this baby when it comes out of the birth \ncanal. Find me one.\n  No, no, we are not going to hear about that. We are going to hear \nabout legal procedure, legalities, hearings. That is what we hear \nabout, because nobody wants to accept reality here, and not only that, \nthey do not even want to vote on it. The Senator from Pennsylvania does \nnot even want to vote on it.\n  I want my colleagues to know what it is. I want them to know what \nthis procedure is and, as I said yesterday on the floor of the Senate, \nI hope this time the press will get it right because last time, in case \nyou missed it--I said this yesterday, I will repeat it--the press \naccused me of showing photographs of aborted fetuses, showing \nphotographs of women giving birth, showing photographs of dead babies. \nNone of it was true but, of course, that does not matter, just put it \nout there.\n  Here is what I am showing you: A medical drawing approved by the \nAmerican Medical Association. A medical drawing.\n  Here is what happens. This is supposed to be an emergency, I hear the \nSenator from California say, and others, to save the life of a mother. \nIf it is an emergency to save the life of the mother, why does the \nprocess take 3 days? Can anybody tell me that? Why is it that when the \nhead is ready to come through the birth canal, the abortionist stops \nthe child from being born by holding it, not letting the child come out \nof the birth canal, and stops it to kill it?\n  Tell me how that helps preserve the life of the mother. My God, this \nis the United States of America. Do we not have more important things \nto do than this? This is not a simple debate about pro-choice and pro-\nlife. There are people who differ on this issue, and I respect that. \nThat is not what this debate is about. This is about a specific, \nbrutal, cruel way to kill a child. But for 3 inches, or 3 seconds, it \nis a child--after 3 inches more and 3 seconds. Here is a fetus that we \ncan destroy.\n  I ask you--anyone, any of my colleagues, any American citizen \nlistening to me now, if tomorrow morning you picked up your newspaper \nand the announcement in your community was on the headline of your \npaper that the local humane society, with a surplus of pets, \nreluctantly had to come to the conclusion to destroy surplus pets \nbecause nobody would adopt them, and they said they would use this \nmethod to destroy them, no anesthetic, open up the back of the skull \nwith a pair of scissors, insert a catheter, suck the brains out of the \ndog or cat or horse, whatever it is; how would you feel about that? You \nwould be outraged. There would be people screaming.\n  But do you know what? Not here on the floor of the U.S. Senate. We \ncannot even get a vote on it. We want to refer it back to committee, \nlet alone stop it.\n  Let us look at what happens. They hate to hear this. I have to say it \nagain, as I said it yesterday, because you are not going to hear this \nfrom the other side, but you need to know. This baby is inside this \nwomb, anywhere from 20 weeks on, snug and warm inside womb. You know \nthat baby has feelings, moves its fingers, its feet, kicks, it hears \nits mother. It is in that womb, snug and warm. Then come the forceps. \nThose forceps go up there and they take the feet of that child and turn \nthe child so that the feet come out first.\n  As you can see in the next picture, why do we do that? Why do we do \nthat? You know why? Because if the child is born head-first, it is \nbreathing, it is alive. Now we have a problem, do we not? We cannot \nhave a live birth. Oh, no, we cannot have that. So the baby, tiny \nlittle legs, moving toes--moving--clamp it on and pull the child from \nthe birth canal.\n  The third illustration. This is the part that is the worst, the most \nsickening. If you think I enjoy standing on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate having to talk about this, you are wrong. If you think I enjoy \nstanding on the floor of the U.S. Senate having to defend against this, \nto stop this, you are wrong. We should not have to be doing this. This \nis a basic right for this little baby to come into this world. It is a \nbasic right.\n  I do not care what Senator Specter says about all his legal jargon. \nThis is a baby. This is not some vague concept about choice. This is a \nbaby. And that doctor, or abortionist--call him what you may--takes \nthat child in his hands and those of you that have had children--and I \nhave witnessed the birth of all three of mine and know what a beautiful \nthing that is--he takes that baby, moving feet, moving legs, moving \nfingers, holds it in his hands, feels the legs, feels the feet, feels \nthat little bottom, soft as they are with these little babies, takes \nthe torso, brings the arms and shoulders out and then stops it--stops \nit firmly, holds it. Do not let the baby be delivered.\n  The next picture. Then what? No anesthetic, no painkiller at all. \nScissors are inserted into the back of the skull, open up the scissors, \ninsert the catheter, and that little moving child is now hanging limp, \ndead--in the United \n\n[[Page S 16778]]\nStates of America. People here on the Senate floor--it is bad enough \nthey would vote not to stop it; they do not want to vote. The Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania and seven of his colleagues do not want to vote on \nit. They want to have more hearings on it. One baby a day dies like \nthis that we know of. So 19 will die by the time we get the bill back \nhere, if we do not stop it.\n  As I said yesterday, 19 babies--who knows who might be in that 19, \nthe first black President, the first woman President, another Senator, \nsomebody who cures cancer or AIDS? Who knows? We will never know, will \nwe? Snuffed out. But that is choice, is it not? That is the nebulous \nconcept of choice. That is what that is.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a brutal procedure that is not \nnecessary. We have statements everywhere that it is not necessary to do \nthis. If it is truly an emergency, why do we stop the baby from being \nborn? Why do we stop it from being born? Why do we hold the head, \nrefuse to allow the head to be delivered? It has nothing to do with the \nlife of the mother--nothing. It has to do with the life of the child \nbecause when this child is born, that is the problem for the \nabortionists.\n  I am absolutely amazed--amazed--at the number of people who have \ntaken the floor and spoken on this issue and have talked about \ndeformities, as if we had the right to play God on deformities. What do \nyou tell a young man or woman today with Down's syndrome, or some other \ndeformity--perhaps a missing limb, perhaps they had some disease and \nthey are in a wheelchair, but they are human beings and they are \ncontributing to their country, making a life for themselves? What do \nthey tell them? ``Gee, if we only thought of this procedure when you \nwere in the uterus, we could have gotten rid of you and would not have \nhad to deal with you.''\n  I am absolutely flabbergasted that we would make those kinds of \ndecisions--that anybody would want to make those kinds of decisions. \nDown's syndrome--what do you use? What is the excuse? Let me be honest \nwith you. Even though the deformity case is a horrible reason, the \ntruth of the matter is that 80 percent of these types of cruel \nabortions--80 percent, and this is testimony from the doctors who \nperform them, not my numbers--80 percent of these types of abortion, \nthey say, are elective. They are elective. It has nothing to do with \ndeformities or anything else. It is just elective. We do not want the \nchild and we are going to do it this way.\n  Now, that is Dr. Haskell himself. He stated, ``I will be quite frank. \nMost of my abortions are elective in that 20-to-24-week range. In my \nparticular case, probably 20 percent are for genetic reasons, and the \nother 80 percent are purely elective.''\n  Pamela Smith said, ``In the situation where a mother's life was in \ndanger, no doctor would employ the partial-birth method of abortion, \nwhich, as Dr. Haskell carefully describes, takes 3 days.''\n  It is all a phony argument. It is a phony argument to keep from \ngetting to the facts of what is happening.\n  I say to my friends who claim to be pro-choice, let me repeat and go \nback to the basic issue here: 3 inches, 3 seconds. That is what we are \ntalking about, the difference between living and dying.\n  What is the difference, Senator Specter, what is the difference \nbetween a child whose head is in the womb 3 inches from birth, 3 \nseconds from birth, and a child whose head is removed from the womb, 3 \ninches and 3 seconds later? Who are we to say that one should live and \none should die? What is the difference?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Does the Senator yield for a response to a question?\n  Mr. SMITH. I yield for a response to that particular question.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The difference is the standards established by the laws \nof the United States as determined by State assemblies, by Congress, \nand permitted by the courts.\n  How does that differ upon a C section? Or how does that differ before \nthe child has gone into the vaginal cavity or the vaginal canal?\n  Does the Senator from New Hampshire say that those late-term \nabortions are satisfactory? There you have a situation where you do not \nhave the 3 inches which you talk about but you have reaching the fetus \nthe same substantive contents, through a C section.\n  I ask the Senator to address that question. If you reach the fetus \nthrough a C section or you reach the fetus some other way before the \nfetus comes into the vaginal cavity, does that make it satisfactory in \nterms of the Senator from New Hampshire?\n  Mr. SMITH. No.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire believes wherever that fetus is, that \nis a life. That is not what we are talking about here.\n  I assume from the Senator's response that he assumes that this \nprocess is acceptable, that this process is acceptable because the head \nstill remains in the vaginal canal; therefore, this is an acceptable \nprocedure.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If I may respond.\n  Mr. SMITH. Is it acceptable?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I have not said it is acceptable. I do not know, and I \ndo not know because I do not know the facts. I describe it as a \nchilling matter.\n  When the Senator from New Hampshire cites two doctors, neither of \nthose doctors has testified, I want to know a little more than the \nshort statement which appears on the chart. That is not enough for this \nSenator to legislate on a matter of great importance. That is just not \nenough.\n  If the Senator from New Hampshire says that it is not acceptable to \nhave a C section on a late-term abortion or not acceptable to have an \nabortion which occurs before going into the vaginal canal, then let us \nmake this legislation effective, if you really want to deal with this \nproblem.\n  Does the Senator from New Hampshire disagree with the conclusions I \nstated in my opening statement, that this legislation would not reach a \nC section on a late-term abortion?\n  Mr. SMITH. This is a very specific, I say to the Senator from \nPennsylvania, this is a very specific procedure that is so cruel in the \nway that it is performed that it ought to be outlawed.\n  The Senator knows, and I think I know his position--he knows mine--on \nthe issue of abortion. That is not what we are talking about here.\n  We are talking about a specific process, procedure, which is cruel, \nwhich is used to abort a child. And indeed, some would say, to kill a \nchild. I say to kill a child. That is the issue.\n  I do agree, I say to the Senator, I believe it is the taking of a \nlife, yes, when it is a C section. That is my personal opinion. I am \nnot engaging in that personal opinion in this debate. I am engaging in \nthe particular procedure that we are talking about.\n  This procedure, when a child is that close to being born, whether or \nnot this is not a cruel procedure to use against an unborn child that \nis 90 percent born, with feeling. That is the issue here.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If the Senator would yield for one final question on \nthis subject, would the Senator not prefer a statute which dealt with a \nlate-term fetus, in the same medical condition which also precluded a C \nsection?\n  Mr. SMITH. The answer to that question is yes, but that is not what \nwe are talking about here.\n  Mr. SPECTER. You may have that if it is referred back to the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  Mr. SMITH. I am smarter than that. I know what will happen when it \ngoes back to the Judiciary Committee. I know full well what the \nSenator's position is.\n  The issue here is whether or not this type of abortion, and indeed \nwhether it is an abortion--is that what we define as an abortion--a \nchild that is brought purposely into the birth canal, 90 percent of \nwhich comes into the world with only 10 to 15 percent of the child \nstill remaining in the birth canal, whether or not that is a birth or \nnot. So we talk about partial birth.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Would the Senator yield for a couple of minutes, and \nbefore yielding, would the Senator read a statement from the registered \nnurse I discussed yesterday? I want to have that read before I make a \ncomment.\n  Mr. SMITH. We have that and are happy to provide that to the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. If the Senator would not mind reading the statement of \nBrenda Shafer.\n  Mr. SMITH. This is a nurse named Brenda Pratt Shafer, an RN who \nassisted Dr. Haskell, I believe, in the clinic, or at least assisted a \ndoctor who performed this. She was so overcome by what she saw that she \nbasically \n\n[[Page S 16779]]\nquit--she quit the clinic where this was performed and then became an \nadvocate against this procedure.\n  What she says is very heartrending, frankly. I will read what she \nsays, and it is up here on the chart.\n\n       The doctor kept the baby's head just inside the uterus. The \n     baby's little fingers were clasping and unclasping, and his \n     feet were kicking. Then the doctor stuck the scissors through \n     the back of his head, and the baby's arms jerked out in a \n     flinch, a startle reaction, like a baby does when he thinks \n     that he might fall.\n\n  Then she goes on to say, ``I'm Brenda Pratt Shafer, a registered \nnurse with 13 years of experience.'' And she goes on to talk about \nbeing there. She said she thought this assignment would be no problem \nfor her to work in this clinic because ``I am pro-choice, but I was \nwrong. I stood at the doctor's side as he performed the partial-birth \nabortion procedure and what I saw is branded in my mind forever.''\n  The mother is 6 months pregnant, the baby's heart beat was clearly \nvisible on the ultrasound. The doctor went in with forceps and grabbed \nthe baby's legs and pulled them into the birth canal. Then he delivered \nthe baby's body and the arms--everything but the head. The doctor kept \nthe baby's head inside the uterus. ``The baby's little fingers were \nclasping and unclasping and his feet were kicking.'' Then the doctor \nput the scissors through the back of the head, the baby's arms jerked \nout and the doctor opened up the scissors, stuck a high-powered suction \ntube into opening and sucked the baby's brains out. Now the baby was \ncompletely limp.\n  The last line, and I yield to the Senator, that the nurse said is \nparticularly compelling: ``I never went back to that clinic. But I am \nstill haunted by the face of that little boy--it was the most perfect \nangelic face I have ever seen.''\n  I yield to the Senator from Oklahoma whatever time he may consume.\n  Mr. INHOFE. First of all, Mr. President, I was not planning to make \nany remark, but as I was presiding a few minutes ago and listening to \nsome of the arguments, I remember that yesterday I had an occasion to \nmeet the registered nurse, Brenda Shafer.\n  What was impressed upon me was that she went into that position as an \nacknowledged pro-choice nurse. That was the way she felt. When she went \nthrough the experience that was just expressed by the Senator from New \nHampshire in such an emotional way--I have a hard time listening to \nthat and maintaining composure--she changed her whole philosophy \nbecause she saw a child, a living child, dying in their hands and she \nwas in some way a part of that.\n  I wish there were a way of getting her on the Senate floor to tell \nthe story she had to tell. I say to the Senator from Pennsylvania, I do \nnot mean this in a personal way, but as I was presiding a few minutes \nago, I have never been so thankful that I am not a lawyer, because to \nhave to try to find provisions in the law where you can almost rejoice \nin saying we found a loophole so we can take this baby's life and \nexpand this whole idea of abortion to someone who is just about to take \nthat first breath. And, when you say perhaps we need--that is the \nsubject of this discussion right now, submitting it to a committee, if \nwe did that.\n\n  Let us just say the committee reported it out and it passed. Let us \nsay it took 3 weeks, that is an average time for something like this. \nWe are talking about 400 more of these little babies who would have \nthis procedure done to them.\n  Then the Senator talked about, under the 10th amendment, this is, \nperhaps, something that should be addressed by the States. I have been \na defender of the 10th amendment. I think it has been abused too much, \nand I agree this is something that should be approached on a State \nlevel. But during that period of time, you are not talking about 4 \nweeks, now. You are talking about months and years. To quantify that in \nlives--I have not done the math yet so I cannot do that. But if you see \none of these procedures, then you do not have to quantify it because \none is enough.\n  Then we talk about how much pain there is. This is something that is \ndifficult to quantify, too. But when you have this procedure taking \nplace, as was described in such an articulate way by the Senator from \nNew Hampshire, you know there is pain. You know the pain would be \nunbearable. But there is a loophole in the law that allows us to \ninflict that pain.\n  My wife and I have four children and we have three grandchildren. \nActually, our third grandchild is not yet born, but it is still a \ngrandchild. I am looking forward to Christmas Day when he will be born.\n  I do not think there has ever been any woman who has gone through a \npregnancy and has reached, say, the 9th month or 8th month and has not \ngone through some degree of depression during that time. Certainly my \nwife did. It is a very difficult thing to go through.\n  I think this particular procedure is one where these people can fall \nprey, because in the event you go through some type of depression and \nyou want to have this procedure, think of what that person must go \nthrough the rest of her life if she realizes what she has done.\n  I will conclude by only saying, if we had read that someplace back in \nancient history, in some barbaric land or sometime in our history, this \nprocedure had been used to perform abortions or to kill young children, \nwe would look back and say, how in the world, back in those paganistic \ndays, could they have taken a life in such a cruel way?\n  I think history, 400 years from now or 500 years from now, will \nreflect back to this moment saying here this body met in a deliberative \nway to stop this barbaric practice.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, before yielding to the distinguished \nSenator from Maine, I want to make a few further comments.\n  I find the comment by the Senator from Oklahoma curious, to put it \nmildly, that he has never been so thankful he is not a lawyer.\n  I hope the Senator from Oklahoma never needs a lawyer. But if he \ndoes, he might like to have a lawyer, especially a good lawyer, to \nprotect his interests and to protect his constitutional rights. \nSometimes we lawyers help to get it right. This is not a matter for \nbroad gestures and grandiose statements. We are dealing here with \nmatters which involve the Constitution. Pardon me----\n  Mr. INHOFE. Does the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SPECTER. No. And, pardon me--and pardon me if we need a lawyer or \njudges to help interpret the Constitution of the United States, which \nprotects the rights of all of us.\n  Now that I finished my sentence, I will be glad to yield if it is on \nthe time of the opponents of the motion.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I do want to respond. I hope I have made it abundantly--\n--\n  Mr. SPECTER. Is it on Senator Smith's time? I will yield on Senator \nSmith's time.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 54 minutes \n30 seconds.\n  Mr. SMITH. I yield the time.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I hope the Senator from Pennsylvania was \nlistening when I said I mean nothing personal about it. I have a great \ndeal of respect for him. When I talk about being thankful that I was \nnot a lawyer at this time, I was talking about looking for ways, \nloopholes around this thing, so this procedure can take place.\n  I acknowledge to the Senator that on two occasions in my 60-year life \nI have needed lawyers and I was thankful to have them at that time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If I may respond----\n  Mr. INHOFE. On your time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am not getting involved now, as to whether I take it \npersonally or not. But it has not just been this lawyer. It is the \nwhole profession. It is the whole profession that somehow comes into \ndisrepute, not just when we are talking about tort reform or product \nliability or medical malpractice--we are talking about the \nConstitution.\n  How about those nine lawyers across the street, the Supreme Court of \nthe United States? How about Justice Thomas? Did Justice Thomas ever \nneed a lawyer? How about all those pro-life Justices whom this Senator \nhas supported because, as a matter of principle, they are lawyers and \nthey have some useful function to perform? \n\n[[Page S 16780]]\n\n  So, when the comment is made that this Senator is engaged in \nlegalese--and now, Mr. President, I will go to my time because I want \nto respond to the Senator from New Hampshire--I am just a little \nconcerned, candidly, about some of the personal invective.\n  When the Senator from New Hampshire says that the Senator from \nPennsylvania does not even want to look to see this, he is wrong. As \nsoon as he puts his chart up, I go down and take a look at it.\n  When the Senator from New Hampshire says, I don't care what Senator \nSpecter says about--legal jargon, I would say to the Senator from New \nHampshire two things. First of all, he ought to be concerned about the \nConstitution. If he wants to call that legal jargon and minimize it, \nthat is up to him. But these are not unimportant matters.\n  And when the Senator from New Hampshire says that there are people \nwho do not want to see this matter come to the vote, that he is ``sick \nand tired of the ducking,'' this Senator does not duck. I have proved \nthat again and again and again.\n  When the Senator from New Hampshire says people do not want to come \nout here and vote their conscience, I object to that. I do vote my \nconscience. And I do not call the Senator from New Hampshire an \nextremist. I do not get involved in those pejorative, name-calling \nmatters. But I do expect that there be an accurate representation, that \nI am not talking legalese when I start off and I say the first two \nconsiderations that I have are the humanitarian matters and the matters \nof the medical procedure. That is before I get to the Constitution, \nbefore I get to statutory interpretation. Not that those matters are \ninsubstantial.\n  I have heard the Senator from New Hampshire say ``grisly'' three \ntimes and ``cruel'' four times and ``brutal'' and ``horrible'' and \n``grotesque'' and ``sickening.''\n  This Senator is very concerned about that. This Senator also \nwitnessed the birth of his two sons, and this Senator held the placenta \nof his older son right after his son was born. And this Senator has a \ngrandchild. And, like the Senator from Oklahoma, this Senator has \nanother grandchild expected in December. And I am very much concerned \nabout the pain and suffering.\n  When the Senator from New Hampshire says that there is no anesthetic, \nno pain killer, he may be right. And if he is right, there ought to be \nsomething done about it. That ought to be done in terms of what this \nbody takes into consideration in the law. If the Senator from New \nHampshire is right that this is an unacceptable procedure, then let us \nnot just limit it to the vaginal canal. Let us cover C sections or let \nus cover conditions before it gets to the vaginal canal, if the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire is right.\n  If he says this Senator changed the 45 days, that is not true. Others \nhad talked about the 45 days. My staff had talked about the 45 days. \nThey do not make decisions for me. When I took a look at it, I said we \nought to do it as fast as possible. And I will be willing to do it in 9 \ndays. Let the Senate report it back by a week from Friday.\n  But the fact is, we are going to be in recess for 10 days beyond that \ntime. So the 10 days do not really hurt anyone. It may be necessary in \nthe hearings to call some other witnesses. We may not be able to get it \nall done in the snap of a finger. It is a matter which may require some \ntime. So what I want to do is find out what this case is all about, \nwhat this statute is all about, and what this medical procedure is all \nabout. I do not want to have it decided on a poster with three \nsentences from two doctors. I want to hear what they have to say. I may \nhave a question or two that I want to ask.\n  When the Senator from New Hampshire and the Senator from Oklahoma say \nwhen the time passes other children are going to be involved--they \ncould have brought this matter to the floor last week, last month, last \nyear if they want to legislate on the subject, if they are concerned \nabout every day. And this Senator is concerned about every day. That is \nwhy I talked about 9 days plus the recess time. So that is what I want \nto accomplish.\n\n  I now yield 5 minutes to my distinguished colleague from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, first of all, I want to thank the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania for offering this motion. I am pleased to join him as \na cosponsor to commit this bill to the Judiciary Committee for where it \nshould be so that we can hold hearings on this legislation. As a Member \nof the Senate, I think it is absolutely critical that we have a hearing \non an issue that raises profound constitutional questions. As a woman, \nI believe the failure of this body to hold hearings on this legislation \nrepresents an appalling disregard for the life and health of the \nmother.\n  I am concerned that all of a sudden we are saying we do not need to \nhave hearings on this very significant piece of legislation. We have \nheard that the House has had hearings. The House had debate. The House \nheard the proponents and the opponents of this legislation. The last \ntime I checked this was the U.S. Senate. We are two distinct bodies, \nand we are entitled to hold our own hearings, to make our own \ndecisions, to ask our own questions on this very, very important \nquestion.\n  To hear the debate, at times I think that people actually believe \nthat women casually and blithely make this decision about having an \nabortion under any circumstances. It is a difficult decision, but even \nmore so when we are talking about late-term abortions. They are rare. \nThey are exceptional. They are there because a woman's health is in \ndanger. So it makes this decision all the more tragic. And it certainly \nis a nightmare for the woman. It is not something that she just does \ncasually.\n  I think it is unfortunate that many have made this sort of impression \nabout how women arrive at their decision. Twenty-two years ago the U.S. \nSupreme Court issued a landmark decision in the form of Roe versus \nWade. It carefully crafted and balanced that decision, and said that a \nwoman's interest in making the decisions about her reproductivity is \nparamount. But it also said that imposed a liability; that the States \nhad the right to prohibit abortion so long as they allowed an exception \nfor when a woman and her health is in danger. That is an important \nexception that this legislation does not allow. No matter what the \nSenator from New Hampshire says, it does not allow it. Oh, sure. Offer \nit as an affirmative defense. Once the doctor performs this procedure \nthe doctor ends up in court and then he has to prove that. That burden \nof proof is going to be enormous.\n  So that is what we are talking about. There is no exception for the \ndoctor making that medical decision. So now we are saying in this \nclimate today where the doctors have already been killed on the issue \nof abortion--with death threats, intimidation, and harassment--they are \nnow saying you are going to face criminal prosecution because you \nperformed a procedure in order to save the life of the mother. That is \nwhat we are saying in this legislation.\n  I think they say, ``Well, what are the alternatives to this?''--which \nis what we should be discussing in the hearings--but what are the \nalternatives? It is easy for them to say the alternative is a Caesarean \nsection, which interestingly enough has four times the risk of death, \nor induce labor, or potentially a life-threatening disorder such as \ncardiac edema, a hysterectomy, which means a woman cannot have any more \nchildren.\n  So that is what we are talking about in terms of tradeoff in this \nlegislation--the life and health of the mother in order to avoid \ncriminal and civil prosecution of her doctor. That is how this \nlegislation is structured.\n  I hope that we will give this matter serious regard and hearings \nbecause this is an unprecedented intrusion in what should be properly a \ndecision made between the doctor and his or her patient on what is a \nvery, very critical decision for a woman having to make in these rare \ninstances. I emphasize that because these are rare instances. And when \nthe Senator from New Hampshire says, ``Well, these are elective \nprocedures, that 80 percent are elective,'' let us talk about that. \nThere is no medical definition for ``elective.'' It is when someone has \nto make the decision.\n  For example, if a person had a heart attack and they are in a coma \nand somebody performed CPR, that is not \n\n[[Page S 16781]]\nelective because they were not involved in the decision. But if a \nperson went to a doctor and the doctor said you have a serious heart \ncondition, if you do not go tomorrow to the hospital and have surgery, \nyou will die, that is elective because that person has made the \ndecision.\n  So I think that there has been a lot of misrepresentation. This is a \nserious issue. We should have hearings. I cannot understand why anybody \nwould be afraid of the facts. Why are we so afraid of the facts? Why \nare we so concerned that we cannot in opposition have hearings and hear \nthe facts, and everybody have a chance to speak before the legislative \ncommittee?\n  So I urge the Members of this Senate to support the motion made by \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty-eight minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Vermont, Senator Jeffords.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords] is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the motion to \ncommit the bill before us to the Judiciary Committee, and in defense of \nthe constitutional right to privacy, as well as to protect the life of \nmother.\n  This bill has not been considered by any Senate committee, nor have \nSenators had the benefit of learning more about this bill from Senate \nhearings. It passed the House less than a week ago. I suggest that we \nneed more time to study the broad-ranging implications of this bill. \nThis motion suggests a time limit of 19 days, a very short time \nconsidering the complexity of this issue. But at least we will have an \nopportunity to learn more about what this procedure is, and why it is \nbeing utilized.\n  Mr. President, for the committee to consider and hold hearings on \nthis far-reaching bill is of critical importance. I am disturbed by the \nmisinformation that is floating around about this bill. This bill \noutlines a particular late-term abortion procedure subjecting the \ndoctor who performs it to both criminal and civil suits. It matters not \nwhether a procedure is medically necessary to save the life or health \nof the woman. That is the critical question here.\n  We all need to be clear about what exactly it is that we are not \nvoting on today. We are not voting on whether or not we believe in the \nsanctity of human life. We are not voting on whether or not certain \nmedical procedures can be described in grisly detail. We are not voting \non whether or not we will intercede between pregnant women and their \ndoctors to determine what medical procedures are or are not personally \nmedically and ethically appropriate for all women in all circumstances. \nNo. The women who have had these procedures speak passionately about \ntheir children, their families, and their sorrow at losing their \npregnancy.\n  They also speak patiently in defense of keeping this procedure, this \nbest of several difficult options for them and their families--to \nkeeping it safe, available, and legal. Their lives were, and their \nlives are at stake.\n  This is an unprecedented intrusion into the practice of medicine. \nCongress has never before acted to ban any medical procedure. The \nAmerican College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists, in writing about the \nbill--and I quote them:\n\n       . . . does not support H.R. 1833, the Partial-Birth \n     Abortion Ban Act of 1995. The college finds it very \n     disturbing that Congress would take any action that would \n     supersede the medical judgment of trained physicians and \n     criminalize medical procedures that may be necessary to save \n     the life of the woman.\n\n  Twenty-two years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court handed down a landmark \ndecision, Roe versus Wade. The Court's decision established, under the \nright to privacy, a woman's right of self-determination in matters \nregarding her pregnancy and reproductive health, and I emphasize \n``especially when her right to life is threatened.'' Since that time, \nwe have seen many challenges to Roe in both Congress and in the courts, \nbut the wisdom and structure of that decision has for the most part \nendured.\n  This bill has been designed as a direct challenge to that historic \ndecision's protection of women's lives and health. While the decision \nacknowledged a State interest in fetuses after viability, the Court \nwisely left restrictions on postviability abortions up to the States. \nThis strikes me as quite consistent with much of the legislation we \nhave recently considered on many other matters, choosing to leave \nregulation to the States.\n  Roe versus Wade had a caveat, though, about these State-imposed \npostviability restrictions. States may not--may not--under any \ncircumstances outlaw abortions necessary to preserve the life or health \nof the woman.\n  Also, subsequent Supreme Court decisions have held that States may \nnot outlaw using specific abortion procedures in cases that endanger \nthe woman's life or health.\n  These court decisions and, in my view, decency and common sense \ndictate that doctors must be able to put the welfare of their patient, \nthe woman, first. Doctors must be able to use whatever procedure will, \nin their professional judgment, be safest for their patients.\n  This is a basic tenet of the practice and regulation of medicine in \nthis country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. There are expert professional licensing boards, \naccreditation councils, and medical associations that guide doctors' \ndecisionmaking in the complicated and difficult matters of life and \ndeath. Let us continue to leave it to the professionals.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields to the Senator from Nebraska?\n  Mr. EXON. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from New Hampshire yield \ntime? Who yields time to the Senator from Nebraska?\n  Mr. SMITH. I yield to the Senator from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank the Chair and I thank my friend. I have been \nfollowing this debate with great and keen interest, and I have listened \nto the ``Nightline'' program last night that featured Senator Boxer and \nSenator Smith. I have listened to the debate this morning as much as I \ncould.\n  After the remarks just made by my great friend and colleague from \nVermont, it leads me to ask this question which is troubling to this \nSenator. I have heard lots of remarks about people's experience in this \nregard in this Chamber. I do not know that I am a champion, but for 25 \nstraight years I have been privileged to represent my constituents in \nhigh public office, and during that 25 years the matter of abortion \nkeeps coming up again and again and again, and here we are again. It is \none of these things that troubles America today. I am not sure that \nregardless of where you fall on the pro-life or pro-choice spectrum, \nanyone is always totally comfortable with their position. But we have \nto make these decisions, and therefore I think this is a very important \nvote.\n  As a father of three and a grandfather of eight, I have had some \nexperience with regard to family and to family values that I hold very, \nvery dear. From the very beginning on abortion, I have held, rightly or \nwrongly, that I was not in support of abortion except to save the life \nof the mother--underline that, save the life of the mother--or in \npromptly reported cases of rape or incest.\n  Now, a lot of people disagree with me, but at least that has been my \nposition from the beginning all the way through these 25 years. What I \ncome back to is the matter of conscience that I am very much dedicated \nto. So I ask this question of my friend and colleague from New \nHampshire with regard to the saving the life of a mother.\n  I have heard the Senator from New Hampshire say on numerous occasions \nthat if the life of the mother is in jeopardy, under the procedures \nthat we are debating right now, there are provisions in the bill that \nwould allow the doctor to proceed even with this late-term abortion, \ncall it what you will, the doctor could do that if the doctor was \nconvinced that this was the only procedure that would likely save the \nlife of the mother if, indeed, the life of the mother was in danger. \n\n[[Page S 16782]]\n\n  Would the Senator from New Hampshire please explain to me if I have \nthis correctly interpreted because it will be a key factor in the way I \nvote on this matter.\n  Mr. SMITH. I respond to the Senator from Nebraska by saying the \nSenator has it exactly right. There is a life-of-the-mother exception \nhere. I will specifically refer to it in a moment. I would just say \nthat in this process, this partial-birth abortion process, a lot of the \nmedical experts that we have have indicated it is a very rare \nopportunity when the mother's life would be in danger, but if it is, we \ntake care of that, and I will point that out in a second.\n  However, the issue here is that where you forcibly stop a birth by \nnot allowing the head to be delivered, it would just seem to me, if the \nmother's life was threatened at that point, you would allow the baby to \nbe born. Whatever happens to the baby after that, if your focus is on \nthe mother, then let the baby be born. I cannot see how keeping the \nbaby from being born and then going through the process that we have \nalready described here helps or enhances the mother's health or life.\n  Mr. EXON. If I might interrupt then, if I understand what the Senator \nis saying, since for all practical purposes under the procedure \noutlined the birth has already taken place and therefore the mother's \nlife could not be more in danger by allowing the head to emerge into \nthe world--in other words, at this particular point it is not a test of \nwhether or not the mother's life is in danger?\n  Mr. SMITH. At that point. Were that to be the case, then there are \nprovisions here, and let me specifically refer to it so that the \nSenator will not have any concerns.\n  If it were to be the case--and I cannot imagine where it would be, \nbut were it to be the case in subsection (e) of the bill, which we have \nhere, it says that if a doctor reasonably believes that a partial-birth \nabortion is necessary to save the life of the mother, then he or she, \nthat doctor, simply proceeds and cannot be convicted of the violation \nof the law, simple as that. So the life of the mother exception is \nthere.\n  Again, I just want to point out that where you have a procedure that \ntakes a period of 3 days, including dilation and anesthesia and all the \nthings in preparation for this, the preparation is for the abortion so \nthis is not an emergency as has been described on the floor by others \nin the sense there is some immediacy to save the life of the mother. \nWere there to be a complication--I am not a doctor, I do not want to \ninterfere with the doctor-patient--this is a matter that the doctor \nwould deal with and simply would not be convicted.\n  We have the right of self-defense. If someone broke into your home \nand you shot them, somebody could accuse you of murder, but you \ncertainly were within your rights to do what you did to protect \nyourself, as a mother would be within her rights to protect her rights \nshould this child, fetus, whatever, be an immediate threat to her life. \nWe protect that.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank my friend for that explanation, and I thank him for \nyielding time to straighten this out to make sure I understood what I \nthought I understood. After listening to the Senator, I think that he \nhas given me a satisfactory explanation of the legitimate concern in \nthis Senator's mind.\n  Mr. SMITH. I appreciate the Senator's inquiry, and I am delighted to \nrespond to it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, no one else at the moment is interested \nin time. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). The Senator from New \nHampshire has 47 minutes, 48 seconds.\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I yield myself whatever time I may \nconsume.\n  I just want to respond to a couple of points; they are minor points \nat this point in the debate. But in response to Senator Specter \nregarding this motion, we received a copy of a motion to commit with 45 \ndays written on it. We came here today on the floor expecting to see \nthat. Then it was changed to 19. It was crossed out. I will accept the \nSenator from Pennsylvania's word that he changed his mind or overruled \nhis staff. That is fine. But this Senator received information from the \nSenator's staff that said 45 days, which would have delayed the bill on \nto the next year.\n  But regardless, in any case, the issue here is still dilatory and it \nis also the issue of killing the bill. You would have to not have any \nsense of humor whatsoever to not realize what is going on here.\n  There was a press conference yesterday with Kate Michelman.\n  Question: ``Do you have any read on the breakdown on the Judiciary \nCommittee if it goes to the Judiciary Committee?'' [That is the bill.] \n``And does it differ from the Senate as a whole? Do you have a better \nshot at getting the kind of changes you might want in it?''\n  Michelman: ``Which is our goal, is to have it end there.''\n  Question: ``What is the read on the committee makeup?''\n  Michelman: ``So the committee, the constitution of the Judiciary \nCommittee and where we hope to see the demise of this legislation \nreally is a mirror of the Senate as a whole. There --I think that there \nare some anti-choice Democrats, some pro-choice Republicans, but I \nthink the committee--I don't remember the whole committee--but I would \nsay it's going to be very close, a very close vote. But it does give us \nthe possibility of really making some very important rational \narguments, presenting some expert testimony that we won't have the \nopportunity to do if this bill comes up today in such a rush, a mad \nrush to pass this legislation.\n  ``So I think there's a great chance of, again, having a more \nmoderating influence over the House-passed legislation if we can get it \nto the committee today.''\n  In other words, it is to kill the bill. That is all there is to it. I \nrespect the right of the Senate to defeat the bill. I respect that. Of \ncourse, I do. That is democracy. But I would also like to have Senators \nstep up to the plate and vote yes or no.\n  I am going to again repeat that this Senate will vote on this before \nwe go out for the Thanksgiving recess. We will vote on it on the debt \nlimit, or on Bosnia, or on anything else that comes hear. The next vote \nthat comes through here that I can get this on, it is going on if this \nthing goes to committee. We are going to vote on it because I want \nSenators on record either saying yes to this procedure or no to this \nprocedure.\n  We are going to have that vote. I make that commitment. I promise you \nwe will have this vote. So I am hopeful that we are not going to have \nthis thing referred to committee to basically repeat a process that has \nbeen going on for weeks and weeks and weeks, months in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  There has been plenty of materials written and plenty of studies, \nbeen plenty of hearings--a hearing in the House, markups, committee \nmeetings, and so forth. So that is not the issue. If we were going to \nuse as a prerequisite in the U.S. Senate not voting on anything that \nhas never had a hearing, we could reduce the votes around here \ndramatically, believe me, probably by as much as 75 percent, because \nabout 75 or 80 percent of our votes are on things we never had hearings \non. So when it comes to something like this, one of the most important \nissues of our time, we want to shuffle it off to committee and try to \nkill it, because that is exactly what the goal is here as stated by \nKate Michelman and other opponents of this bill.\n  Madam President, at this time I yield whatever time the Senator may \nconsume to the Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  I wonder if my colleague from Pennsylvania has a question or----\n  Mr. SPECTER. No.\n  Mr. COATS. I would be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I would be glad to withdraw my request for recognition.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire \nfor yielding. I had asked him for some time, and I appreciate the \nopportunity to speak to this issue.\n  This is not a pleasant issue to debate on the Senate floor. It is not \na comfortable issue to debate on the Senate floor, but we are not \nelected to come here just to discuss and debate pleasant issues. We are \nlikely to face some \n\n[[Page S 16783]]\nof the most difficult issues that the country has to face, face them \nhonestly and openly, and in the end cast our position either for or \nagainst.\n  There probably is no issue that is potentially more divisive and \ncertainly more emotional than the issue of abortion because it goes to \nthe issue of the meaning of life itself. I am a pro-life Senator. I \nhave argued on this floor a number of times that we, as a nation, as \nelected representatives of the American people, as individuals of \nconscience and conviction ultimately need to confront the issue of \nabortion, its impact on the question of life, and the meaning of life, \nto talk about the broader issue itself.\n  Advances in science and medical technology clearly will require that \nwe will confront, both now and in the future, some ethical questions \nand some judgmental questions that are profoundly disturbing and \nprofoundly important.\n  Science and medical technology reveals the unborn child as undeniably \nand uncomfortably human. We treat the unborn as a patient. We provide \nit with blood transfusions. We perform surgery. We know it is sensitive \nto pain. We know that it can be a victim of drug and alcohol abuse. And \nI think all of our best impulses are to reach out to help those that \nare considered the weakest in society.\n  Our history as a nation, our history as a Senate, has been to broaden \naccess to participation in this wonderful experiment in democracy. Our \nhistory has been one of inclusion, not exclusion, and to try the find \nways to incorporate into the human family ever-larger classes, to reach \nout to the disadvantaged and to the weakest. I find it somewhat ironic \nthat some of the most outspoken, courageous, forward leaders of the \nmovement of inclusion takes such a firm stand against inclusion of the \nweakest in our society.\n  And I think that is a debate that we have to pursue and continue. \nHowever the debate today is not on that issue. The debate today is on a \nmuch more specific medical procedure. It has been well-discussed on the \nfloor, well-documented on this floor. It is difficult to discuss, \ndifficult to view the graphic illustration of the procedure itself. Yet \nI think it is necessary. I will not repeat that graphic discussion.\n  But I think it is incumbent on every Senator before they vote to \nfully understand the medical procedure involved, fully understand just \nexactly what is taking place surgically and medically in the partial-\nbirth abortion, or whatever term any Senator wants to place on this \nprocedure. You do not have to call it partial-birth abortion. You do \nnot have to label it at all. But it is extraordinarily important, I \nbelieve, for everyone to at least avail themselves of an understanding \nof what is taking place here medically, what the procedure is, because \nI think an understanding of this procedure, regardless of what label \nyou give it, has to do more than just give us pause. It forces us to \nask ourselves some very basic questions concerning whether or not we, \nas a society, have an obligation to state in law whether or not we \ncondone or support such a procedure.\n\n  If this procedure were done in another country, we would not be \nstanding here labeling it as a violation of human rights. If it were \ndone in a war, we would call it a crime against humanity. But here we \nare trying to calmly, rationally discuss a procedure which is shocking \nin its description and which many have called descent into almost \nbarbarism.\n  Madam President, I do not believe this is just another skirmish in \nthe running debate between left and right. I believe this is an issue \nthat raises some of the most basic questions that ought to be asked in \nany democracy: Who is my neighbor? Who is my brother? Who do I define \nas inferior and cast beyond my sympathy and beyond my protection? Who \ndo I embrace and who do I value in both law and in love?\n  I do not believe this should be a matter of ideology. I think it is a \nmatter and a question of humanity. It should not be a matter of what \nconstituency we ought to side with. This is not just a matter of our \nNation's politics, but a matter of our Nation's soul and how our Nation \nwill be judged by God and by history.\n  In this body, we can agree and disagree on other matters of social \npolicy, yet I think we ought to come together and agree on this: That a \nborn child should not be subject to violence and to death. Surely, \nthere is no disagreement on that. The question is, should an unborn \nchild be subject to the same protection?\n  I hope that at least in this body we could come together, Republicans \nand Democrats, liberals and conservatives, and begin to define those \nsituations in which an unborn, yet almost born, seconds from being \ntechnically born, but clearly a child defined by its physical \nappearance, defined by its medical condition, defined by its very \naliveness can receive some protection from violence, can receive some \nprotection which every other human being in this country receives.\n  Can we at least acknowledge there is a line that we will not cross, a \nline that we can say, ``While we may have disagreement over other \naspects of when life begins, whether abortion is appropriate or not, at \nleast here with this procedure, with this so obvious, visible view of \nthe beginning at least of life that we will not terminate that, that we \nwill refuse as a body to cross that line''?\n  This vote today is an opportunity to take a different path, an \nopportunity for Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives, \neven for those who oppose abortion and those who support it, because by \nvoting for this measure, we can begin to define some common ground: \nthat every child born in America will be embraced by our community; \nthat no one is expendable; that no one will be turned away from \nparticipation in this experiment in freedom and democracy.\n  We are faced with a vote in a short amount of time on a motion to \ncommit. We have all participated in this exercise. We all know what it \nmeans. It means that we do not want to vote, we do not want to vote on \nthe issue itself, we do not want to stand up and be counted on one side \nor the other; it is too politically sensitive, it is too uncomfortable, \nit is too difficult; I do not want to have to deal with this issue. So \nwe are attempting to retreat to a time-honored procedural technique: We \nneed to know more about this; we need to consign this to a committee so \nthat they can study it and they can have hearings.\n  There is not anybody in this body who does not know what we are \ndealing with here. There is not anybody who has not had an opportunity \nto examine the medical procedure, to think through the question, to \ncome to a conclusion. We are not elected to commit difficult issues, \nuncomfortable issues to an abyss of committee consideration that we \nknow will paper over and delay and push a decision to some unknown \npoint in the future. There is no lack of information available to \nMembers. There are no unanswered questions outstanding relative to this \nprocedure. All the materials are available for every Senator to look at \nand to discuss and to examine and to form a conclusion over.\n  So the motion to commit is what it is: It is a procedure to allow us \nto avoid dealing with an uncomfortable subject. Everyone needs to know \nthat a motion to commit is simply an unwillingness to take a stand, to \nlet people know where you stand.\n  There is nothing that is going to be gained by committing this to a \ncommittee so that they can deep six the issue. It is an issue we are \ngoing to be confronted with in the future anyway, so we might as well \ndeal with it now. Let us have some courage to stand on our convictions \none way or the other. Those who have spoken on the floor both for and \nagainst this procedure speak out of conviction. I am not here to \nquestion their motives. I accept their conviction. But we are not \nelected to avoid expressing that conviction by our vote. If cynicism \nexists in our electorate, it is because we keep playing these games.\n  The scriptural injunction is let your yea be yea and your nay be nay. \nDo we not at least have the courage to let our yea be yea and our nay \nbe nay on the most fundamental question and issue probably facing this \nbody, the very issue of the meaning of life? Are we going to take a \npass? Are we going to say that is too tough for us to take? Are we \ngoing to say it is politically too sensitive?\n\n  Now, if we have learned anything about the opinion of the electorate \ntoward this elected body, it is that it has \n\n[[Page S 16784]]\nalmost gotten to the point of dangerous cynicism about our ability to \nstand up and say what we believe and accept the consequences of that. I \nthink what the public is looking for are some people with conviction \none way or another, who are willing to stand up in front of a group of \npeople back home and say, ``Look, this is what I believe. If you \nsupport that, I would like your vote. If you do not support that, that \nis fine, my life does not begin or end on whether or not I am elected \nto this office or any other office.'' But this is what I believe. We \nare not here to bide our time. We are here to express our convictions, \nas supported by the people in our States.\n  If this legislation is passed, it will mean that the circle of \nprotection in our democracy begins to expand just a little bit more. We \nhave brought in people of different ethnic backgrounds, different \nracial backgrounds, people with disabilities, an ever-expanding circle \nof protection provided by a democracy that promotes independence and \nliberty, but also guarantees the right to life.\n  This is a test of a just civilization. I think it is a standard by \nwhich each of us is going to be tested as well.\n  Madam President, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for the time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, before yielding to my colleague from \nMichigan, I want to make a few comments in response to what has been \nargued in opposition to the pending motion.\n  I agree with a good bit of what the distinguished Senator from \nIndiana just had to say, and I think that it is necessary to draw a \nline. I am prepared to do that. I must say that this Senator is not \nunwilling to take a stand. This Senator is not unwilling to have the \ncourage of my convictions. I understand that I have been elected to \ntake stands on tough issues and not to avoid expressing my views. And I \nconcur that on the meaning of life, life does not begin or end on an \nelection to the U.S. Senate. I have lost my share of elections, and I \nam prepared to do so in the future if my constituents do not agree with \nmy views. I intend to express them forcefully and forthrightly.\n  But I point to the calendar here--if I may have the attention of the \nSenator from Indiana--as to what happened. This is not a matter of \ndelay. This is not a matter to kill this bill in the Judiciary \nCommittee. Whatever may be said by others--and the Senator from New \nHampshire has quoted a Miss Michelman, who is not on the committee, and \nthe idea to commit was Arlen Specter's idea. My staff had a lot of \nideas, like for 45 days, but we all know that sometimes Senators make \ntheir own decisions as to how we are going to proceed. The Senator from \nNew Hampshire chuckles, and we agree on one item. Occasionally, it is \nhealthy and helpful for Senators to make decisions instead of staffers.\n  So when the Senator from Indiana talks about sending this to an \nabyss, delay it until some unknown time in the future, that is not what \nis going to happen here. Under the express terms of the motion to \ncommit, it has to be reported back and it has to be reported back, \nreally, what is in 9 days of the life of the Senate. We would go out on \nrecess on the 17th, so it is 9 days from today that we will be in \nsession and 10 days when we come back, and it has to be reported on the \n27th. It may be that in the interim, during Thanksgiving week, we will \nhave hearings on that. I am prepared to do that in the Judiciary \nCommittee. But it will be back in this Chamber, so that when the \nSenator from Indiana talks about the meaning of life, I am prepared to \ncome to terms with that.\n  I would just like to know what the medical profession says about the \npain and suffering, what the medical profession says about \nalternatives, if it is a C section, if it is not in the vaginal canal. \nI am not prepared to accept the debate on ``Nightline.'' I have been on \n``Nightline,'' and sometimes on ``Nightline'' not a whole lot of \nusefulness is accomplished. So that when you have the sequence of \nevents in the House of Representatives--this is really quite a \nsequence--I think we ought to focus on it.\n  This bill was introduced on June 14 in the House. The next day they \nhad a 2\\1/2\\-hour hearing and did not get some medical experts on the \nother side of the issue. They marked it up the same day. That is on \nJune 15. Then we know what our congressional schedule has been. It has \nbeen hectic, to put it mildly. We did have some time off in August and \nin September, and October we have been fully occupied on the \nreconciliation bill and the budget. Then it came up on November 1, \nwhere they voted. That is the state of the record. Now it comes to this \nbody and we are asked to pass upon it without any hearing having been \nheld. I have taken a look at the rules of the Senate--rule XIV and rule \nXV. It was only relatively recently in the life of the Senate that we \nhave had no hearings on a bill. It used to be mandatory that the bill \nbe referred under rule XXV. And now there is more latitude under rule \nXIV. But I question the propriety, or at least the wisdom if not the \npropriety, of putting this bill on the calendar for this kind of \naction. But I am not going to delay.\n  Mr. COATS. Will the Senator yield for an observation?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Yes, on the time of Senator Smith.\n  Mr. COATS. My only observation is that the Senator indicated that a \n45-day procedure is only 9 days of Senate time. Only in the U.S. Senate \ncould an institution take 45 days to accomplish 9 days of work. I \nunderstand that is how this process works.\n  I thank the Senator for his explanation of the procedure in terms of \nthe way this bill will be handled.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague from Indiana for those comments. I \nthink we are entirely too dilatory around here. We had an issue that \ncame to my Judiciary subcommittee on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and \nFirearms, and we had some problems with the Justice Department getting \nthe witnesses in. We got them in and we did it in prompt time. Whenever \nwe could find hearing days, we did it. We are about ready to issue a \nreport. I think we ought to move with dispatch.\n  I am prepared to see us work on the Thanksgiving recess to come to \nterms here. When the Senator from New Hampshire says he is going to get \na vote on it, he may or may not. This may be a matter of filibuster. I \nsuggest we will not lose any time in this commitment.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Michigan.\n  How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 36 minutes. There are 26 \nminutes on the other side.\n  The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend from Pennsylvania. I, too, think the \nSenate should vote, but only after there has been a reasonable length \nof time, and a few weeks is a reasonable length of time for the \nJudiciary Committee to consider and to report back to us on a number of \nvery, very important issues in this case.\n  Under this bill, the Congress would be imposing a determination not \nof when an abortion may be performed, but of how it may be performed. \nThe procedure addressed by this bill would be prohibited from being \nused even in the second trimester.\n  So this is a question of whether or not we should make a particular \nprocedure criminal, whenever it is used. There are a number of \nimportant issues. Why have the States--with, I think, one exception--\nnot criminalized this procedure? Under Roe versus Wade, States are \ngiven the authority to regulate abortions in the third trimester, \nexcept they cannot prohibit an abortion where the life or the health of \nthe mother is at risk. Why have 49 States not made this particular \nprocedure illegal, even in the third trimester?\n  The States are the place where Roe v. Wade says that abortion should \nbe regulated in the third trimester, and yet with, I think, one \nexception States have left this particular procedure legal.\n  Now, this bill not only makes illegal and criminal a procedure that \nis not made criminal in all but one State, this bill leaves legal other \nprocedures which can be used in the third trimester.\n  Are those other procedures as safe for the mother? Are those other \nprocedures different in terms of the vividness as to the impact on the \nfetus? What are those other procedures? Why are they left legal, \nalthough at least \n\n[[Page S 16785]]\narguably, less safe for the mother, while one procedure, which in the \neyes of many doctors is the safest for the mother, is made criminal?\n  Surely, it would be worth spending a few weeks to have a hearing in \nthe Judiciary Committee to find out why one procedure is made criminal \nand other procedures are not. Other procedures, including inducing \nlabor and delivery with drugs, is left legal despite the evidence of \nrisk to the mother. Other procedures, including a Caesarean operation \ncalled a hysterotomy, is left legal even in the third trimester to save \nthe life or protect the health of the mother.\n  Another procedure left legal by this bill is called standard D and E. \nThis procedure does not deliver the fetus intact, but instead removes \nthe fetus from the uterus piece by piece. Again, this procedure is left \nlegal by this bill.\n  Should we not be told by the Judiciary Committee following a hearing \nfrom medical witnesses as to why other procedures, arguably in many \ncases apparently less safe for the mother, are left legal while this \none procedure is made criminal, again, although all but one State has \nleft the procedure at issue in this bill legal? That is worth finding \nout.\n  Of course, we should vote. I happen to agree with my good friend from \nIndiana; we should vote on this issue. But there is something else we \nshould do. We should vote based on information from reliable and \ncredible sources that have had an opportunity to present evidence at a \nhearing before a Judiciary Committee that can explore these kinds of \nissues.\n  There are other issues which I think we can usefully obtain some \nguidance on. One of those is the question of the affirmative defense. \nOf course, affirmative defenses have been approved by the Supreme Court \nin many cases but not in cases where there is a constitutional right as \nexists here, a right to have an abortion even in the third trimester \nwhere the life of the mother is involved.\n  We have a Congressional Research Service opinion on this issue. The \nCongressional Research Service has written us that cases that have \npermitted affirmative defenses have not permitted a Government to turn \na constitutional right into an affirmative defense. If you have a \nconstitutional right to an abortion to save the life of the mother, can \nwe then make it a crime to provide such an abortion unless the doctor \ncarries the burden of proof that he is acting constitutionally? Not \naccording to the cases analyzed by the CRS.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I have printed in the \nRecord at the end of my statement the full report of the CRS on this \nissue and a Department of Justice letter that also addresses this \nissue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. I simply say that there are a number of very important \nissues for which we should have at least some guidance and witnesses in \na report from the Judiciary Committee. This is not a case of trying to \nevade an issue. It is a case of trying to deal with an issue based on a \nrecord of witnesses testifying on some very, very critical issues and \nsome excruciatingly difficult issues for everyone.\n  In the situation we are discussing, the Supreme Court has ruled that \nthe Constitution prohibits the Government from criminalizing abortions \nthat are necessary to save the life of the mother. In the context of \nthis bill Congress cannot constitutionally criminalize the abortion \nprocedure at issue if such abortion were necessary to save the life of \nthe mother.\n  The CRS memo explains it this way:\n\n       In Patterson and Martin [the leading cases authorizing \n     affirmative defenses in criminal cases], the Court \n     specifically noted that the legislature was fully within its \n     legislative authority to establish all the elements of the \n     underlying offense, and that the defenses were established as \n     affirmative grants to a defendant. As one commentator has \n     indicated, a key factor in the Court's holding in Patterson \n     was that the state could have constitutionally criminalized \n     and punished the crime in question as defined, even absent \n     the defense provided.\n\n  The opposite is true here. Under established law the Government \ncannot criminalize an abortion necessary to save the life of the \nmother. It would seem, therefore, that under the applicable Supreme \nCourt cases, the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that \nthe mother's life was not at risk. It cannot, it would seem, shift its \nburden on this element of the case to the defendant the way the bill \nbefore us does. Surely we should at least have the benefit of a hearing \nto address this issue, and the benefit of a Judiciary Committee report.\n  Finally, even if an affirmative defense approach is allowed, the \nvagueness of the bill's affirmative defense language requiring the \ndefendant to prove that no other procedure would suffice, leaves it \nunclear how a physician defendant would prove that no other procedure \nexcept intact D and E would have sufficed. What if the physician \ndefendant could have performed another procedure that would have \ndoubled the risk of death to the mother? Does that suffice? Under the \nbill before us, what is the measure of how much greater risk another \nprocedure would or could impose on the mother's life in order not to \nsuffice?\n  I don't think doctors facing criminal charges when acting to save a \nwoman's life should face such uncertainties. But what do experts think? \nWhat does the Judiciary Committee think? Is it worth taking a few weeks \nto find out? I think so.\n  There are a number of serious issues raised by this legislation. We \nshould send this bill to the Judiciary Committee for prompt hearings \nand report back. We should then vote. The impact of this legislation is \npotentially too grave to do less.\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 7, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert Dole,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: This letter represents the Department's \n     views on H.R. 1833, a bill that would ban what it calls \n     ``partial-birth abortions.'' This legislation violates \n     constitutional standards recently reaffirmed by the Supreme \n     Court. Most significantly, the bill fails to make adequate \n     exception for preservation of a woman's health. Even in the \n     post-viability period, when the government's interest in \n     regulating abortion is at its weightiest, that interest must \n     yield both to preservation of a woman's life and to \n     preservation of a woman's health. Planned Parenthood v. \n     Casey, 112 S. Ct. 2791, 2804, 2821 (1992). This means, first \n     of all, that the government may not deny access to abortion \n     to a woman whose life or health is threatened by pregnancy. \n     Id. It also means that the government may not regulate access \n     to abortion in a manner that effectively ``require[s] the \n     mother to bear an increased medical risk'' in order to serve \n     a state interest. Thornburgh v. American College of \n     Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U.S. 747, 769 (1986) \n     (invalidating restriction on doctor's choice of abortion \n     procedure because could result in increased risk to woman's \n     health). That is, the government may not enforce regulations \n     that make the abortion procedure more dangerous to the \n     woman's health. Id.; see also Planned Parenthood of Missouri \n     v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 79 (9176) (invalidating ban on \n     abortion procedure after first trimester in part because it \n     would force ``a woman and her physician to terminate her \n     pregnancy be methods more dangerous to her health than the \n     method outlawed'').\n       If Congress were to ban this method of abortion, it appears \n     that ``in a large fraction of the cases'' in which the ban \n     would be relevant at all, see Casey, 112 S. Ct. at 2830 \n     (discussing method of constitutional analysis of abortion \n     restrictions), its operation would be inconsistent with this \n     constitutional standard. It has been reported that doctors \n     performing this procedure believe it often poses fewer \n     medical risks for women in the late stages of pregnancy.\\1\\ \n     If this is true, then it is likely that in a ``large \n     fraction'' of the very few cases in which the procedure \n     actually is used, it is the technique most protective of the \n     woman's health. Accordingly, a prohibition on the method, in \n     the absence of an adequate exception covering such cases, \n     impermissibly would require women to ``bear an increased \n     medical risk'' in order to obtain an abortion.\n     \\1\\ See Hearings on H.R. 1833 Before the Subcomm. on the \n     Constitution of the House Judiciary Comm. (June 23, 1995) \n     (statement of James T. McMahon, M.D., Medical Directive, Even \n     Surgical Centers) (procedure shown to be safest surgical \n     alternative late in pregnancy); Id. (June 15, 1995) \n     (statement of J. Cortland Robinson, M.D., M.P.H.) (same); see \n     also Tamar Lewin, Wider Impact is Foreseen for Bill to Ban \n     Type of Abortion, The New York Times, November 6, 1995, at \n     B7; Diane M. Gianelli, Shock-Tactic Ads Target Late-Term \n     Abortion Procedure, American Medical News, July 5, 1993, at \n     3; Karen Hosler, Rare Abortion Method Is New Weapon in \n     Debate, Baltimore Sun, June 17, 1995, at 2A.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       H.R. 1833 would provide for an affirmative defense to \n     criminal prosecution or civil claims when a partial-birth \n     abortion is both (a) necessary to save the life of the woman, \n     and (b) the only method of abortion that would serve that \n     purpose. This provision will not cure the bill's \n     constitutional defects. First, as discussed above, the \n     provision is too narrow in scope, as it fails to reach cases \n     in which a woman's health is at issue. Second, \n\n[[Page S 16786]]\n     the provision does not actually except even life-threatening \n     pregnancies from the statutory bar. Cf. Casey, 112 S. Ct. at \n     2804 (even in post-viability period, abortion restriction \n     must ``contain[] exceptions for pregnancies which endanger a \n     woman's life or health''). Instead, the provision would \n     require a physician facing criminal charges to carry the \n     burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, both \n     that pregnancy threatened the life of the woman and that the \n     method in question was the only one that could save the \n     woman's life. By exposing physicians to the risk of criminal \n     sanction regardless of the circumstances under which they \n     perform the outlawed procedure, the statute undoubtedly would \n     have a chilling effect on physicians;' willingness to perform \n     even those abortions necessary to save women's lives.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Andrew Fois,\n     Assistant Attorney General.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                              Library of Congress,\n\n\n                               Congressional Research Service,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 6, 1995.\n     To: Senator Carl Levin, attention: Peter Levine.\n     From: American Law Division.\n     Subject: Validity of requiring a defendant to bear the burden \n         of persuasion regarding a constitutionally mandated \n         defense.\n\n       This is to respond to your rush request to evaluate the \n     validity of requiring a defendant to bear the burden of \n     persuasion regarding a constitutionally mandated defense. \n     Specifically, you requested an analysis as to the \n     constitutionality of the requirement under S. 939 \\1\\ that, \n     in order to avoid criminal liability, a defendant prove that \n     the performance of a ``partial-abortion'' was necessary to \n     save the life of the mother.\\2\\\n     Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       H.R. 1833 provides that a person who performs a ``partial-\n     birth'' abortion shall be fined or imprisoned not more than \n     two years.\\3\\ If the person can prove, however, that the \n     ``partial-birth'' abortion was necessary to save the life of \n     the mother, and that no other procedure would suffice for \n     that purpose, then the person is relieved of criminal \n     liability.\\4\\ Under the proposed bill, the defendant must \n     carry the burden of persuading the judge or jury of this \n     defense by a preponderance of the evidence.\n       The Supreme Court has held that the Due Process Clause of \n     the Fourteenth Amendment protects a defendant against \n     conviction unless the government establishes every fact \n     necessary to constitute the crime beyond a reasonable \n     doubt.\\5\\ The Court has extended this reasoning to provide \n     that legislation may not impose a burden of persuasion upon a \n     defendant regarding an element of a crime which the \n     government is required under the relevant statute to prove as \n     part of its case.\\6\\ Thus, in the case of Mullaney v. Wilbur, \n     the Court held that because the Maine homicide statute \n     included a requirement of malice aforethought in order to \n     obtain a murder conviction, that the government could not \n     then require a defendant to carry the burden of disproving \n     malice aforethought by showing that a killing occurred in the \n     heat of passion.\\7\\\n       Two years later, however, the Court held that a state could \n     require a defendant accused of murder to carry the burden of \n     persuasion that the defendant had acted under the influence \n     of extreme emotional disturbance. In Patterson v. New York, \n     the Court distinguished the case by noting that the \n     definition of murder under New York law merely required an \n     intentional killing, and did not include a requirement of \n     malice aforethought.\\8\\ Consequently, the defense of extreme \n     emotional disturbance did not go to disproving an element of \n     the underlying crime, but was a separate issue which the \n     defendant could be required to carry as the burden of \n     persuasion.\\9\\\n       The Court reaffirmed this holding in Martin v. Ohio, noting \n     that even if the elements of a case and a defense overlapped, \n     that a statute which did not shift the full burden of that \n     element to the defense would be valid.\\10\\ In Martin, the \n     Court upheld an aggravated murder statute which required that \n     the government prove that the killing had been planned, but \n     which also required a defendant pleading self-defense to \n     carry the burden of proving self-defense.\\11\\ The Court held \n     that, because a defendant could theoretically have planned a \n     murder but then have subsequently killed the victim in self-\n     defense, the defense was not inherently inconsistent with an \n     element of the crime.\\12\\ Thus, the requirement that the \n     defendant prove that the killing was in self-defense was \n     upheld.\n       In the bill in question, it could be argued that the \n     proposed crime of knowingly committing a ``partial-birth'' \n     abortion, like the New York statute, simply forbids the \n     intentional performance of the described procedure. \n     Consequently, the proposed defense, that the procedure was \n     necessary to save the life of the mother, does not appear to \n     require the defendant to negate any of the elements of the \n     proposed crime. Thus, the argument can be made that under \n     Patterson and Martin, the affirmative defense requirement as \n     set forth in S. 939 is constitutional.\n       It would appear, however, that the cases of Patterson and \n     Martin can be distinguished. In Patterson and Martin, the \n     Court specifically noted that the legislature was fully \n     within its legislative authority to establish all the \n     elements of the underlying offense,\\13\\ and that the defenses \n     were established as affirmative grants to a defendant.\\14\\ As \n     one commentator has indicated, a key factor in the Court's \n     holding in Patterson was that the state could have \n     constitutionally criminalized and punished the crime in \n     question as defined, even absent the defense provided.\\15\\ \n     Thus, the question arises as to whether the Congress has the \n     authority to pass S. 939 without including a defense for when \n     a ``partial-birth abortion'' is necessary to save the life of \n     the mother.\n       It would appear that Congress does not have the authority \n     to punish a person for performing a ``partial-birth'' \n     abortion which is necessary to save the life of a mother. In \n     the case of Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court held that the \n     ``privacy'' interest of the Constitution limited the ability \n     of a state to restrict a woman's ability to have an abortion \n     during the first two trimesters, and provided that even in \n     the third trimester a state could not restrict a woman from \n     having an abortion that is necessary to preserve her life and \n     health.\\16\\ Consequently, it would appear that Congress could \n     not pass a statute banning ``partial-birth'' abortions where \n     such an abortion was necessary to save the life of the \n     mother.\n       As the government would appear to be constitutionally \n     required to include an exception for abortions to save the \n     life of the mother, it can be argued that it is a required \n     element of the government's case, and that the reasoning of \n     Patterson and Martin does not apply. Consequently, should a \n     court find that Patterson and Martin are distinguishable, it \n     would appear that the government would be under an obligation \n     to carry the burden of persuasion that a ``partial-birth'' \n     abortion was not necessary to save the life of a mother, and \n     that a requirement that a defendant carry such a burden would \n     be unconstitutional.\n                                                Kenneth R.

Madam President, I am delighted to yield 5 minutes to \nthe Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Madam President, I rise in strong support of the motion offered by my \ncolleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, to commit S. 939 to the \nJudiciary Committee for a public hearing. This legislation deserves \nfull and comprehensive hearings before we vote on it, and I am very \nconcerned about the implications of proceeding without the benefit of a \nfull, open committee process.\n  I was very disturbed by the debate on this bill in the House of \nRepresentatives; the misinformation and factual distortions put forth \nby the proponents of this legislation were staggering. And, now here in \nthis Chamber, there is an effort to bring the bill before the full \nSenate without first going through the traditional committee process.\n  There is no justification for moving ahead without fully examining \nthe consequences of this bill. I appeal to my colleagues to send this \nbill to committee where we can hear from the public \n\n[[Page S 16787]]\nand the experts about its impact and ramifications.\n  Because, make no mistake, this bill has dangerous, far-reaching, and \nprecedent-setting implications.\n  Madam President, this is the first time in our Nation's history that \nCongress is even attempting to get involved in telling physicians what \nmedical procedures are and are not acceptable. And this is the first \ntime in our Nation's history that Congress is considering banning an \nabortion procedure. This bill directly challenges the Supreme Court \nruling, Roe versus Wade. And this bill carries with it severe \nconsequences for the women of this country whose health and lives will \nbe compromised, and possibly even sacrificed, to further the agenda of \nan extreme few.\n  I cannot imagine the U.S. Senate would railroad this bill through \nwithout a single public hearing. To do so would be an appalling \ndisrespect for the legislative process, and for the lives and health of \nthe women involved.\n  This legislation sets a dangerous precedent--it criminalizes doctors \nfor performing a legal, rare, and medically necessary procedure. \nSurely, there is not a Member of this body who could defend the notion \nthat a bill with this intent is not worthy of a committee hearing. \nSurely, I am not the only Member of this Senate with questions, \nconcerns, and reservations.\n  I do not want to get into the details of this bill. We have all seen \nthe graphic photographs; we have heard the vivid and disturbing \nrhetoric. But, what many of us haven't seen or heard are the tragic \nstories of the women who have lived through the tragedy of a difficult \npregnancy, or of a life-threatening complication which required them to \nhave this procedure.\n  And, many of us have not had the benefit of the facts--as presented \nby the doctors and health professionals who can set the record \nstraight.\n  I have spoken with women who had no choice but to give up a baby they \ndesperately wanted to have. I have listened to their tragic stories. \nAnd, I have heard from doctors who are angry and offended by the \nmisrepresentation of facts and mischaracterization of a life-saving, \nemotionally traumatic medical procedure.\n  That is what is at issue here today; we have the ability to ensure \naccess to accurate and complete information. We need to do the right \nthing, and let the public and all the Members of this body have a real \nopportunity to look at this bill, and examine what it will mean for \ndoctors, for women, their lives and their health.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the Specter motion to commit, so \nthat we can have the opportunity to fully understand what this bill \nmeans for our Nation. Madam President, it is the right thing to do.\n  I yield my time back to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SMITH. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 26 minutes \nand 30 seconds; the other side has 25 minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH. In just a moment I will yield to the Senator from Ohio.\n  I might just ask the Senator from Washington while she is here if she \nwishes to respond and answer a question on my time, I am happy to have \nher do it.\n  Does the Senator from Washington support an abortion for the purpose \nof sex selection? If a woman wanted to have an abortion because she was \nhaving a female baby, would the Senator from Washington say that she \nhas a right to do that?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I will comment on the time of the Senator from New \nHampshire and respond to the question that that is not what is being \ndebated on this floor.\n  The procedure that we are debating is a medical procedure that is \ndone at the end of a pregnancy or midterm of a pregnancy when a woman's \nlife is at stake. That is a critical decision that we have not had the \ninformation on to make a decision at this time.\n  Mr. SMITH. Assume she wants to make that decision herself, which you \nsay she has the right to do because it is a female baby, is that all \nright?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I respond to my colleague, the legislation in front of \nus has to do with women making a decision because of a medical \nprocedure that is involved, not because of sex.\n  Mr. SMITH. I am willing respond to the Senator from Washington back \non my time. She did not answer my question, of course, which is typical \nin this debate. This is not a medical procedure that deals with the \nlife of a woman. This is a medical procedure--it is a procedure that \ntakes the life of a child.\n  We have had all kinds of testimony here on the Senate floor saying \nhow one can explain to me--I have not had it explained to me yet--why \npreventing a fetus from being born, literally restraining the fetus \nfrom coming into the world, how that helps the life or protects the \nlife of the mother? I am intrigued by the fact that no one will answer \nthat question. Senator Boxer refused to answer it last night on \n``Nightline,'' and we see it not answered again today on the floor.\n  I will, at this time, yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I have had the opportunity to listen to \nthis debate on the last 2 days. I will try very briefly to respond to a \ncouple of points that have been made on the other side.\n  Yesterday, the senior Senator from Massachusetts very eloquently said \nthe proponents of this bill employ terminology that is not recognized \nby the medical community. He said that the term ``partial-birth \nabortion'' is not found in medical school textbooks or in medical \nschools. I would say he is absolutely correct. I guess he and I come to \na different conclusion, though, as to what relevance this has.\n  The Senator is correct. This procedure does not have an official \nmedical name. The medical schools do not have a name for it. The \nmedical textbooks do not have a name for it and doctors do not call it \nby that name. That really is exactly the point. The reason medical \nauthorities do not have a name for it and the reason schools do not \nteach it is because the procedure is so inappropriate, so medically \nunnecessary, so bad that the medical community never had a reason to \nname it.\n  The doctors, the healers, will not even give it a name. They will not \nput it in their textbooks. They will not described it in their medical \njournals. It is so bad, in fact, that in September the American Medical \nAssociation, council on legislation, described the procedure as \n``basically repulsive,'' and voted unanimously this procedure was ``not \na recognized medical technique.'' That is why the procedure should \nclearly be banned.\n  Let me turn to another point that has been brought up by my friend \nand colleague from Maine as well as my friend and colleague from \nMichigan, that has to do with the affirmative defense issue.\n  It was stated earlier today by my colleague from Maine that having \nthe affirmative defense in this bill creates an enormous burden on the \ndefense. I respectfully disagree. It does not create an enormous \nburden. In fact, we have over 30 examples in the code, in the Federal \nCode, where the affirmative defense is used.\n  I know, as a former prosecutor at the State level and county level, \nit is used in virtually every State in the Union. The burden it places \non the defense is a very, very low burden. It says, basically, in those \ninstances where the defense has a unique capability of knowing and \nunderstanding the facts of what this defense would be, it is peculiarly \nin the knowledge of that person, that they then, after the prosecution \nhas proven everything beyond a reasonable doubt, they have to prove by \na preponderance of the evidence, the defendant does, which basically \nmeans it is more likely than not, that the procedure was in fact \nreasonable.\n  If you do not do it this way and if you place it into the statute, do \nnot have an affirmative defense but put the exception in the statute, \nwhat it means is the prosecution would have to prove beyond a \nreasonable doubt that the partial-birth abortion was not necessary to \nsave the life of the mother and would have to prove beyond a reasonable \ndoubt that it was not true that no other procedure would suffice for \nthat purpose. So this is, in the law, a commonly accepted way of \ndealing with this particular issue.\n  Let me conclude, if I could, by commenting on some of the debate I \nhave heard. It seems to me the debate on the other side of the issue \nhas really been \n\n[[Page S 16788]]\nstretching, really been reaching to try to justify this procedure. \nMaybe a more fair way of describing their argument is not that they \nwere trying to justify the procedure--because I really did not hear \nvery much of that, if any of that--but rather that we just should not \ntalk about it, we just should not deal with it.\n  My reaction to that, to my pro-choice friends, is simply this. Even \nif you are pro-choice, is there some limit to what a civilized society \nwill accept? Is there not something that you view as so bad, so \nrepulsive that in limited cases we say no, you simply cannot do this?\n  Let me just say that we spent a lot of time on this floor. I think my \ncolleague from New Hampshire did a great job of stripping away the \nrhetoric and getting to the facts of this procedure. I would like to do \nthe same thing about this motion to commit. Let no one who comes on \nthis floor in the next hour and votes have any misconception about what \nthis vote is about. This is not a procedural vote. It may be \ntechnically a procedural vote but what it really is, is a vote on the \nmerits. This is the vote. This is the defining moment. As we vote, I \nwould simply ask my colleagues to recall--particularly my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle--one of my favorite quotes.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator is recognized for 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Hubert Humphrey, in 1977, defined the proper role of \nGovernment. This is what he said. I think, when you listen to this, it \nsummarizes very well what this debate is all about.\n\n       It was once said that the moral test of government is how \n     that government treats those who are in the dawn of life, \n     those who are in the twilight of life, and those who are in \n     the shadow of life--the sick, the needy, the handicapped.\n\n  That is what this debate and vote is all about. This is a vote that \nwe will be casting on the merits. It is not just a procedural vote. \nThis vote will determine whether or not this bill moves forward or does \nnot.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I agree totally with the Senator from \nOhio, there should be no misconception what this vote is about. And it \nis not to eliminate the bill. It is to send it to committee where there \nhas been no hearing, and to do so for 9 days plus another 10-day \nrecess. That is what the vote is about.\n  I agree totally with the Senator from Ohio about having a civilized \nsociety. What we are trying to do is to figure out what is an \nappropriate course in terms of humanitarian considerations on this \nmatter. There was a colloquy earlier today about whether there was an \nexception for the life of the mother. I submit that the answer given by \nthe Senator from New Hampshire to the question by the Senator from \nNebraska was not correct. A number of Senators have raised this with me \nin the interim.\n  I have sent for the statute which shows how you make it an exception. \nIn the current bill there is not an exception for the life of the \nmother. It is an affirmative defense, which is totally different. The \nway you provide an exception for the life of the mother is the way it \nwas done in Public Law 103-333, on September 30, 1994, as follows:\n\n       None of the funds appropriated under this Act shall be \n     expended for any abortion except [then some irrelevancies] \n     that such procedure is necessary to save the life of the \n     mother *  *  * That is the way to provide an exception on the \n     life of the mother, not by having it as an affirmative \n     defense.\n\n  Before yielding to the distinguished Senator from Kansas, Madam \nPresident, I inquire as to how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 23 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. How much time would the Senator from Kansas like?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Madam President, if I could have 4 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. So granted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized for 4 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Madam President, I heard earlier today on the floor \nthat those of us who would support the amendment to commit to the \nJudiciary Committee are not willing to take a stand. I would like to \njust say that I do not believe that is the case. This has always been a \nvery difficult and troubling issue. But most of us have taken a stand. \nFor myself, I have always believed abortion should be legal. I also \nthink there should be restrictions. But I have always been really very \nconcerned when the life of the mother and the life and health of the \nmother are at stake.\n  In Kansas, we have a law which bans third trimester abortions except \nfor the health and the life of the mother. I do not have a problem with \nthat personally, and I support the Kansas law, but there is an \nexception for the life and the health of the mother. Those are rare \ncases, and they should be rare cases.\n  It was debated here earlier between Senator Exon and Senator Smith \nabout whether there really is an exception for the life of the mother. \nI would suggest there is not an exception for the life of the mother. \nThere is an affirmative defense after the doctor has been charged with \ncriminal action. The burden of proof then would be on the doctor, as I \nunderstand it, at that point. So there is not an exception. There is \nmerely a matter of legal procedure with affirmative defense.\n  I believe that is an important distinction, Madam President, because \nI think we here in the Congress cannot get into trying to determine \nmedical procedures, no matter how tragic it appears. That should be \nleft to the medical community, and with the consultation of the mother, \nthe family, and the doctor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Texas, Senator Gramm.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Texas, Senator \nGramm.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, let me thank you for the recognition.\n  I want to begin by congratulating our dear colleague, the senior \nSenator from New Hampshire. I want to thank him for his leadership on \nthis issue.\n  I first spoke on this issue when I came over to the floor of the \nSenate to speak on another issue. The distinguished Senator from New \nHampshire was talking about partial-birth abortions. He was explaining \nhow the process worked in its total gruesome details, and another \nSenator rose and talked about how offended that Senator was by the \ndescription that Senator Smith had given. I felt compelled at that \npoint to make what I think is the relevant point. If we are offended by \nthe description of this brutal, violent act that the Senator's bill \nseeks to stop in America, should we not also be offended that the act \nis occurring? If the description of the act is offensive to us, then \nthe fact that it is happening to living babies should be doubly \noffensive to us.\n  I think this is a very fundamental issue, Madam President. We have \nall heard the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire describe the \npartial-birth abortion, but it really comes down to this: This is a \nbaby that is several inches away from the protection of the law. This \nis a baby that is in the process of being delivered. Only its head \nremains in the birth canal. It is several inches away from being \nprotected by the law and by the Constitution as currently interpreted \nby the courts. And at this very moment, when the decision is life or \ndeath, this abortion process occurs which terminates the life of the \nchild and crushes its skull. This is a process that I believe is \noffensive to any civilized society.\n  So the issue we are debating here, it seems to me, can be reduced \ndown to a very simple issue. This is an act that any civilized society \nshould find offensive. Even those who support allowing this to occur \nare offended by its description.\n  I believe America and the civilized world should be offended by the \nfact that it is occurring in our country. I think no civilized society \ncan condone this action. I think it is very clear that if this bill is \nsent to the committee, it is going to be killed. We have an \nopportunity, since the House has acted by an overwhelming vote, to \nadopt this bill and to send it to the President.\n  I want to urge my colleagues to vote against the effort to send this \nbill to a \n\n[[Page S 16789]]\ncommittee where we will not see it again, where we will not have the \nopportunity to vote on it again, and where the righteous indignation of \na civilized people will be thwarted because we do not take action to \nstop what we know is wrong and unacceptable in a civilized society.\n  I want to conclude, Madam President, by again congratulating Senator \nSmith. I think it took great political courage to raise this issue. I \nthink it is always very difficult when you are talking about the kind \nof act that we are debating here today. It is offensive. It is hard to \ntalk about. I do not feel comfortable talking about it. But most \nimportantly, I do not feel comfortable about the fact that it is \nhappening in the United States of America. That is the point.\n  If it is hard for us to talk about in the environment of the greatest \ndeliberative body in the history of the world, it seems to me that it \nought to be hard for us to continue to condone. I do not condone it. I \nwant it to stop. And that is why I am going to vote for the Smith bill. \nThat is why I am going to vote against this motion to kill it.\n  I believe this bill should be passed, and we, as a civilized nation, \nshould say no to these partial-birth abortions.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, if the Senator from California seeks \nrecognition, she may have 5 minutes of our time. But first let me \ninquire how much time remains.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 20 minutes and 40 seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Madam President. I want to thank the \nSenator from Pennsylvania for offering us this very sensible amendment.\n  We have never in this Senate voted to outlaw a medical procedure. We \nhave never, never voted to outlaw a medical procedure. When I was \ndebating this issue with the Senator from New Hampshire, yes, we voted \nto outlaw the mutilation of the genitals of a girl. We voted a sense of \nthe Senate. I was glad to do that. That is a battery; that is not a \nlife-saving procedure. We have never voted to ban a life-saving \nprocedure. And if that is what we are going to do, we are going to \nbecome physicians, and we are going to go down that slope.\n  We ought to have a hearing and have people who know what they are \ntalking about appear before the Judiciary Committee, which is very \nfairly divided between people who vote pro-choice and people who vote \nanti-choice.\n  So what is before us is a bill to outlaw a medical procedure that is \nrare, that is used in the most tragic circumstances. It is not used for \nsex selection.\n  Let me repeat that. It is not used for sex selection. It is not used \nas a whim. It is not used because a woman at the end of her pregnancy \nsaid, ``You know, maybe I shouldn't have done that.''\n  It is a dangerous procedure, a late-term abortion. It is a rare thing \nthat happens. To make it look like it is a whim is a great disservice \nto the families of this country, deeply religious families often, that \nare faced with these terrible circumstances.\n  In Roe v. Wade, the judges in their wisdom knew that late-term \nabortion was a different situation, and so they gave the States full \nauthority to regulate late-term abortions. And what are we doing? We \nare stepping right in, big brother. And of course, it was most of my \nfriends on the other side who said let the States decide everything \nelse. They even voted to repeal nursing home standards, Federal nursing \nhome standards because the States know better. But now they are saying \nwe are going to step over all of these State laws and get into the \noperating room and tell a doctor that he or she cannot use an emergency \nprocedure.\n  There is no exception in this bill for life of the mother. I tell my \nfriends to turn to page 3. We have made exception for life of the \nmother before in Medicaid funding. This is an affirmative defense. In \nother words, you arrest the doctor, charge him if he uses the \nprocedure, and then you tell him:\n\n       Oh, yes, Doctor. By the way, when you are in court, you can \n     use as a defense the fact that this was your only choice, and \n     you have to show a preponderance of evidence and that there \n     was no other procedure.\n\n  Very nice. Very nice way to treat someone who has just saved a life. \nMy friend from Ohio quoted Hubert Humphrey. I love Hubert Humphrey. I \njust got a Hubert Humphrey award. I am so proud of that. The shadow of \nlife, we must think of someone in the shadow of life, and a woman whose \nlife is threatened is in the shadow of life. Whether that call comes in \nto any Senator here, I say to my friends, think about it, that it is \nyour daughter. I am a grandma, and we have a lot of grandmas and \ngrandpas here. It is your baby; it is your daughter who is going to \nhave a child, and the doctor calls in the middle of the night and says, \n``There is a horrible emergency. If I do not end this pregnancy, you \nwill lose your child''--your baby.\n  I got a call yesterday during the debate from a woman from Santa \nBarbara who said, ``Remind these Senators that I have a baby''--yes, \nshe is 36 and she got pregnant--``she is always going to be my baby, \nand we had to make that horrible choice.''\n  People like Viki Wilson, a registered nurse, a practicing Catholic, \nand her husband, Bill, a physician, were the parents of two children \nand planning a third. In the 8th month of pregnancy, they found out the \nbaby's brain was growing outside the skull. The brain was twice the \nsize of her actual head and lodged in Viki's pelvis.\n  May I have unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes off Senator \nSpecter's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The brain was twice the size of her actual head and \nlodged in Viki's pelvis, causing pressure on what little brain the baby \nhad. If Viki had carried Abigail to term--yes, they had a name for the \nbaby--Viki's cervix could not have expelled Abigail. Viki's cervix \nwould have torn or ruptured causing massive hemorrhages and possible \ninfection, and, yes, Viki would have been in the shadow of life. And if \nViki was your daughter and the call came in, you would say to the \ndoctor, ``Did you do everything? Are you sure? Did you check? Did you \ndoublecheck? Is there another way? Can we save the baby? Can we do an \noperation to save the baby?'' And if the answer came back no, I believe \nin my heart, subject to anyone who wants to say anything different, \nthat, yes, you, as a United States Senator, would say, ``By the grace \nof God, save my child.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 2 minutes have expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. We should support the Senator from Pennsylvania. He is \nrational about this. Let us bring forward the people who know about \nthis and then let us vote.\n  I thank my friend.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, in recent weeks, there has been much press \nattention given to a heretofore obscure procedure used to terminate \nlate-term pregnancies. With this attention has come substantial public \ndistress and alarm regarding the nature of this procedure, a discomfort \nthat indeed, I share and understand. I must certainly agree that the \nprocedure, as described by the proponents of the pending legislation, \nis repugnant on its face and one that is hopefully resorted to in only \nthe rarest circumstances.\n  But today as the Senate considers legislation to ban the use of this \nprocedure, we must make sure that our deliberations are thoughtful, \nreasoned, and considered.\n  It is very unfortunate that we are here debating this bill without \nhaving the benefit of the normal, established procedure of committee \nreferral, hearings, and review from which a comprehensive record would \nhave evolved detailing the pros and cons of the many complex and \ncontroversial issues at stake. This is particularly troubling because \nthe issue at hand is so divisive and charged with emotion that, absent \na thorough airing of the issues involved, it would be all too easy to \nretreat to a position on doctrinaire certitude and defiantly declare \nnormal victory regardless of whether or not it is appropriate public \npolicy.\n  The Senate has a long and established tradition of careful \ndeliberation precisely because of its rules and procedures for \nlegislating such difficult issues with thorough and adequate review. It \nis only rarely that we circumvent those procedures and then \n\n[[Page S 16790]]\nonly when the matters are noncontroversial and relatively noncomplex.\n  Here, the bill was introduced and not referred to any Senate \ncommittee. Consequently, no hearings have been held in the Senate \ndespite a myriad of questions that need to be answered about the bill's \nprovisions. These include: What are the alternatives? What are the \nramifications for other abortion procedures as a consequence of the \ncurrent vague definitions in the bill? Is it wise or desirable to \ncreate a Federal criminal statute governing medical procedures? I \nbelieve that it would be premature to attempt to come to a conclusion \nabout whether to support or oppose this legislation without having the \nanswers to these and other troubling questions.\n  Therefore, I intend to support the motion to refer this legislation \nto the Judiciary Committee where I hope it will be thoroughly reviewed \nand made the subject of public hearings to discuss the issues involved. \nAt that point, the Senate will have a much more adequate record than it \ndoes now upon which it can make the reasoned, careful decision that is \nincumbent upon us as elected representatives to make.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the U.S. Government is one of the least \nintrusive governments in the world. We pay the lowest taxes of any \nindustrialized country. We have a constitution that guarantees an \nextensive list of freedoms upon which the government cannot infringe. \nMany believe that one of the causes of the 1994 election results was a \ndesire by the public to minimize government's role in the everyday \nlives of its citizens. Yet Senators have brought a bill to the floor \nthat would require women to risk their lives.\n  Perhaps the sponsors of this bill do not understand the issue at \nhand. The Supreme Court has ruled that abortions are legal. It is \ncompletely legal for a woman who wants to have an abortion to obtain \nthe services of a doctor who is willing to provide an abortion. Now we \nas a legislature are going to start decreeing to both pregnant women \nand their physicians which procedures a woman can choose? This is not \nour role. We are not obstetricians, and we should not insert ourselves \nin this picture.\n  Yet proponents of this bill come to the floor to introduce \nlegislation that would force women whose lives are most at danger, \nwhose fetuses are usually malformed in some way, to either endure the \npainful and life-threatening procedure of birth or to endure another \nform of abortion that may be more dangerous or painful. This is \ntantamount to torture and I am appalled that we are standing here \ndebating this issue.\n  But I know why we are here. In fact, every Member of this body knows \nwhy we are here. We are here because abortion opponents are exploiting \nthis painful, rare surgical procedure to try to convince the public \nthat all abortions are similar to this procedure.\n  Mr. President, any surgical procedure is disgusting if described to a \nlayman. I could stand here and describe any number or legal medical \nprocedures and probably convince someone out there that the procedure \nsounds terrible and wrong. But describing and discouraging a legal \nmedical procedure is not my job. I could also stand here and describe \nthe horrible details of a birth of a malformed fetus that kills both \nthe fetus and the mother and does so in the worst and most chilling \nfashion. But unlike others who have held this floor, I see no benefit \nto scare tactics.\n  Mr. President, proponents of this bill hope that this bill and the \nproceedings surrounding it will further stigmatize abortion and \nhumiliate women who have had or who may someday have legal abortions. \nThey also hope to chip away one piece at a time the constitutional \nright to terminate a pregnancy. Theirs is an unbecoming effort.\n  I believe this effort will fail. I believe that the public knows more \nand is more perceptive than this bill's proponents think. I urge my \ncolleagues to stand in opposition to this bill. Send it to the \nJudiciary Committee when it can be properly analyzed.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, there are very few issues that provoke the \nkind of passionate debate abortion policy continues to provoke. It's \nunfortunate the debate has deteriorated into pro-choice and pro-life \nlabels because, in reality, it is a hugely significant conflict over \nwhen life begins and what life comprises. That's perhaps why it divides \npeople along unpredictable lines; even in my State of Idaho, people of \nlike political beliefs can take different positions on this issue.\n  I mention this because today we are dealing with an aspect of the \nabortion issue that even causes divisions among those who generally \nfind abortion acceptable. What we saw in the House of Representatives \njust a few days ago demonstrated this. The overwhelming vote in support \nof the bill included many who usually identify themselves as pro-\nchoice.\n  Let me repeat that: Even those who accept abortion found this \nparticular procedure so objectionable they voted in favor of banning \nit.\n  A ban is an extraordinary step for Congress to take--but then, this \nis an extreme and hideous abortion procedure. We've heard it described \nin detail; we've seen diagrams that those performing this procedure \nhave certified to be accurate. And Mr. President, I have seen strong \nmen and women look away, to avoid dealing with the reality of this \nprocedure.\n  I urge any of my colleagues who have reservations about this bill to \ntake the time to understand exactly what's involved. Then you will \nunderstand why even abortion proponents draw the line here.\n  To put it simply, we're talking about causing and then stopping a \ndelivery, to kill a baby mere inches and seconds before he or she is \nprotected by our laws as a living human being.\n  Some would like to defend this procedure by claiming it is only used \nwhen the life of the mother is at stake or when the baby is shown to \nhave genetic deformities. However, the testimony from those who perform \nthese late-term abortions contradicts these arguments. Even Dr. Martin \nHaskell, who originated the technique, estimated as many as 80 percent \nof the procedures he performed were elective, not for genetic or life-\nsaving reasons.\n  It's important to note that this bill contains an exception for \nsituations in which the life of the mother truly is at stake and no \nother procedure can save it. Those who are honestly worried about this \nissue should be reassured. But it's also important to note that this \nprocedure is hardly risk-free to the mother; medical professionals \nagree it poses dangers to both the lives and the future reproductive \nhealth of the women involved.\n  Mr. President, we all are thankful for today's life-saving advances \nin medical technology. It's appalling to think this particular \nprocedure twists those advances in a legalistic game, with a human life \nin the balance.\n  In closing, I urge all my colleagues not to let political labels \nblind them to the facts. This radical, barbaric procedure goes much too \nfar. Let's draw the line here, now, and pass the Partial-Birth Abortion \nBan Act.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, during the debate on the partial-birth \nabortion ban, opponents have made claims about this procedure and this \nlegislation that simply are not supported by the facts. I ask unanimous \nconsent that a fact sheet by the National Right to Life entitled \n``Partial-Birth Abortions: A Look Behind the Misinformation'' and a \nletter from Barbara Bolsen of the American Medical News along with the \naccompanying material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Partial-Birth Abortions: A Look Behind the Misinformation\n\n   (Congress is currently considering legislation that would place a \nnational ban on the partial-birth abortion method (H.R. 1833, S. 939). \nThe bill was approved by the House Judiciary Committee on July 18. Pro-\n   abortion lobbying groups have made claims regarding this abortion \nmethod, and about the legislation, that are contradicted by substantial \n evidence. Yet, some of these erroneous claims have been uncritically \nadopted by various editorial commentators and reporters. This factsheet \n addresses some of the major disputed issues. All documents quoted in \n    this factsheet may be obtained from the National Right to Life \n         Committee, Federal Legislative Office, (202) 626-8820)\n\n\n          what type of abortion is banned by h.r. 1833/s. 939?\n\n       H.R. 1833 is sponsored by Congressman Charles Canady (R-\n     Fl.), with 150 House co-sponsors. The companion bill, S. 939, \n     is sponsored by Senator Bob Smith (R-NH). The \n\n[[Page S 16791]]\n     purpose of the legislation is to ban those abortions that are performed \n     by (1) partially delivering a living fetus into the vagina, \n     and then (2) killing him or her. Under the bill, this method \n     of killing a human fetus/baby could only be used if there was \n     no other way to save a woman's life.\n       The bill is aimed at the basic method described and \n     practiced by Dr. Martin Haskell of Dayton, Ohio, and Dr. \n     James McMahon of Los Angeles--and by some other abortionists \n     who have not chosen to widely publicize the fact.\n       The Los Angeles Times accurately described this abortion \n     method in a June 16 news story: ``The procedure requires a \n     physician to extract a fetus, feet first, from the womb and \n     through the birth canal until all but its head is exposed. \n     Then the tips of surgical scissors are thrust into the base \n     of the fetus' skull, and a suction catheter is inserted \n     through the opening and the brain is removed.''\n       In 1992, Dr. Haskell wrote a paper on this abortion method, \n     which was sent out to members of the National Abortion \n     Federation (those being abortionists and abortion clinics). \n     The paper (``Dilation and Extraction for Late Second \n     Trimester Abortion'') described in detail, step-by-step, how \n     to perform the procedure, which Dr. Haskell said that he \n     employed beginning at 20 weeks--4\\1/2\\ months in layman's \n     parlance--through 26 weeks into pregnancy. (Dr. McMahon uses \n     essentially the same procedure to a much later point--in some \n     cases, to 40 weeks, which is full term.) [1]\n       Dr. Haskell's ``how-to-do-it'' paper was obtained and \n     publicized by the National Right to Life Committee. The \n     National Abortion Federation (NAF) quickly claimed that NRLC \n     was making distorted claims about the procedure. During the \n     course of investigating this controversy, the American \n     Medical News--the official newspaper of the American Medical \n     Association--in 1993 conducted tape-recorded interviews with \n     both Dr. McMahon and Dr. Haskell. These interviews originally \n     were quoted in an article titled ``Shock-tactic ads target \n     late-term abortion procedure,'' which appeared in the July 5, \n     1993 edition of American Medical News. The American Medical \n     News article is often quoted by supporters of the proposed \n     legislation; the article is cited several times in this \n     factsheet.\n       Recently, for the first time, the National Abortion \n     Federation and Dr. Haskell attempted to disavow some of the \n     most revealing quotes from the article. In response, on July \n     11, 1995, American Medical News released transcripts of the \n     portions of a tape-recorded 1993 interview to prove that Dr. \n     Haskell was indeed quoted accurately on certain key points \n     (e.g., that ``80%'' of the partial-birth abortions he \n     performs are ``purely elective''), and that the fetuses are \n     usually alive when he performs the procedure on them.\n\n\n              actions by the american medical association\n\n       On September 23, the national Council on Legislation of the \n     American Medical Association (AMA) voted unanimously to \n     recommend AMA endorsement of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban \n     Act (H.R. 1833). (Congress Daily, Oct. 10.) The Council on \n     Legislation is made up of about 12 physicians of different \n     specialities, who are charged with studying proposed federal \n     legislation with respect to its impact on the practice of \n     medicine. According to an October 23 letter from AMA \n     headquarters in Chicago, ``The AMA Board of Trustees has \n     determined that it will not take a position on H.R. 1833 at \n     this time.''\n\n\n                  the case of viki and abigail wilson\n\n       Critics of the bill have relied heavily on the personal \n     account of Viki Wilson, whose unborn daughter Abigail died at \n     the hands of Dr. McMahon during the ninth month of the \n     pregnancy. Abigail's brain had developed partly outside of \n     her skull. Setting aside for the moment all that might be \n     said about the ethics of what was done to Abigail, the \n     procedure utilized in this case, if performed as described in \n     published accounts quoting Mrs. Wilson, would not be banned \n     by the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. That is because the \n     baby's life was ended before the baby was moved into the \n     birth canal (according to Mrs. Wilson); under the bill, this \n     is not a ``partial-birth abortion.'' Moreover, Mrs. Wilson \n     has asserted that continuing the pregnancy ``possibly'' would \n     have endangered her life. H.R. 1833 allows a physician to \n     utilize the defined procedure on the basis of a reasonable \n     belief that no alternative medical intervention would save \n     the mother's life.\n\n\n            how many partial-birth abortions are performed?\n\n       Dr. Haskell said in his 1992 paper that he begins using the \n     procedure at 20 weeks (4\\1/2\\ months). There are 13,000 \n     abortions annually after 4\\1/2\\ months, according to the Alan \n     Guttmacher Institute (New York Times, July 5, 1995), which \n     should be regarded as a conservative estimate. The National \n     Abortion Federation now says that Drs. McMahon and Haskell \n     between them perform about 450 such abortions every year. [2]\n       Both practitioners have been enthusiastic advocates for the \n     method; Dr. Haskell's paper explains in detail how to perform \n     it, and Dr. McMahon is director of abortion training at a \n     major teaching hospital. There is no way to know how many \n     other abortionists are now using the method, but without \n     writing papers or giving interviews on the subject as Drs. \n     Haskell and McMahon have done. The National Abortion \n     Federation acknowledges that the method is probably employed \n     at times by other practitioners, and the 1993 American \n     Medical News report spoke of ``a handful of other doctors'' \n     employing the method. In short, there is insufficient \n     information on which to base a reliable estimate of how many \n     partial-birth abortions are performed in the United States.\n       Even with respect to Drs. Haskell and McMahon alone, the \n     figure of ``450'' may be low. Dr. McMahon has circulated \n     literature in which he refers to having performed a \n     ``series'' of ``more than 2,000'' abortions by the method. \n     However, in the article by Karen Tumulty that appeared in the \n     January 7, 1990 issue of Los Angeles Time Magazine, Dr. \n     McMahon was quoted as saying, ``Frankly, I don't think I was \n     any good at all until I had done 3,000 or 4,000,'' referring \n     to abortions ``in later pregnancies.'' That article also \n     reported that Dr. McMahon performs 400 ``later abortions'' a \n     year. In literature he has circulated seeking abortion \n     referrals, Dr. McMahon strongly advocates the partial-birth \n     method for later abortions, so presumably most of his late \n     abortions are being done using this method.\n       As for Dr. Haskell, he said in his 1992 paper that he had \n     performed ``over 700'' such abortions.\n       His wife recently told an Ohio paper that he performs \n     ``less than 200'' a year.\n       Defenders of partial-birth abortions often stress that they \n     are ``a small percentage'' of all abortions. Yet, for each \n     individual, unique human being who ends up at the pointed \n     end of the surgical scissors, each such procedure is a 100 \n     percent proposition.\n\n\n should the procedure be called the ``partial-birth abortion method,'' \n                         or by some other term?\n\n       In his 1992 paper, Dr. Haskell referred to the method as \n     ``dilation and extraction'' or ``D''--noting that he \n     ``coined the term.'' However, that nomenclature is rejected \n     by Dr. McMahon, who refers to the method as ``intact dilation \n     and evacuation'' and (in an interview in the Los Angeles \n     Times Magazine in 1990) as ``intrauterine cranial \n     decompression.'' There are also some variations in the \n     procedure as performed by the two doctors. Dr. Haskell's 1992 \n     paper refers to Dr. McMahon's approach as ``a conceptually \n     similar technique.''\n       Some critics of the bill, such as the National Abortion \n     Federation (a trade association of abortion providers) \n     complain that the term ``partial-birth abortion'' is ``a non-\n     medical term,'' is ``inaccurate,'' and is ``offensive and \n     upsetting.'' They also insist that it is ``vague.'' It is \n     quite evident, however, that NAF's problem with the term \n     ``partial-birth abortion'' is not that it is too vague, but \n     precisely that it is much too explicit. They prefer \n     euphemistic pseudo-medical jargon that conveys nothing \n     substantive regarding the nature of the procedure.\n       However, none of the terms that the abortion practitioners \n     prefer would be workable as a legal definition. The bill \n     creates a legal definition of ``partial-birth abortion,'' and \n     would ban any variation of that method--no matter what new \n     idiosyncratic name any abortionist may invent to refer to \n     it--so long as it is ``an abortion in which the person \n     performing the abortion partially vaginally delivers a living \n     fetus before killing the fetus and completing the delivery.''\n       Congress establishes such legal definitions all the time--\n     often, in ways not entirely pleasing to the industries or \n     practices being regulated. For example, by act of Congress, \n     firearms that incorporate certain specified features are now \n     legally defined as ``assault weapons,'' even though \n     manufacturers, gunsmiths, and users refer to these same \n     firearms in other fashions. Likewise, if H.R. 1833/S. 939 is \n     enacted, abortions that involve partial vaginal delivery of a \n     live baby, followed by killing, will be legally defined as \n     ``partial-birth abortions,'' even if apologists for late-term \n     abortions would continue to prefer a term that is not so \n     explicitly descriptive.\n       Beyond the legal point, the term ``partial-birth abortion'' \n     is accurate and in no way misleading. In explaining how to \n     perform the procedure in his 1992 instruction paper, Dr. \n     Martin Haskell wrote: ``With a lower [fetal] extremity in the \n     vagina, the surgeon uses his fingers to deliver the opposite \n     lower extremity, then the torso, the shoulders and the upper \n     extremities.'' [Haskell paper at page 30, emphasis added]\n       Dr. J. Courtland Robinson, a self-described ``abortionist'' \n     who testified on behalf of the National Abortion Federation \n     at a June 15 hearing before the House Judiciary Constitution \n     Subcommittee, said, ``Never in my career have I heard a \n     physician who provides abortions refer to any technique as a \n     `partial-birth abortion.' '' But Dr. Robinson's objection \n     seems a mere quibble in light of his later testimony: ``In \n     our tradition we have other terms. I am surprised the word \n     `partial-extraction' was not used. This is a standard term in \n     obstetrics that we use for delivering. That [term] could have \n     been used.''\n       Professor Watson Bowes of University of North Carolina at \n     Chapel Hill School of Medicine, co-editor of the Obstetrical \n     and Gynecological Survey and a leading authority on maternal \n     and fetal medicine, wrote in a letter dated July 11, 1995: \n     ``The term `partial-\n\n[[Page S 16792]]\n     birth abortion' is accurate as applied to the procedure described by \n     Dr. Martin Haskell in his 1992 paper entitled `Dilation and \n     Extraction for Late Second Trimester Abortion,' distributed \n     by the National Abortion Federation. . . There is no standard \n     medical term for this method. The method, as described by Dr. \n     Haskell in his paper, involves dilation of the uterine cervix \n     followed by breech delivery of the fetus up to the point at \n     which only the head of the fetus remains undelivered. At this \n     point surgical scissors are inserted into the brain through \n     the base of the skull, after which a suction catheter is \n     inserted to remove the brain of the fetus. This results in \n     collapse of the fetal skull to facilitate delivery of the \n     fetus. From this description there is nothing misleading \n     about describing this procedure as a `partial-birth \n     abortion,' because in most of the cases the fetus is \n     partially born while alive and then dies as a direct result \n     of the procedure . . . ''\n\n\n      IN what circumstances are partial-birth abortions performed?\n\n       Misinformation: The New York Times (June 19, 1995): ``[H.R. \n     1833/S. 939 is] a bill to outlaw one of the rarest types of \n     abortions--a highly specialized procedure that is used in the \n     latter stages of pregnancy to abort fetuses with severe \n     abnormalities or no chance of surviving long after birth.'' \n     National Public Radio Morning Edition (July 14, 1995): \n     ``Anti-abortion groups call it partial-birth abortions . . . \n     Doctors resort to this rare procedure only for late-term \n     abortions if the fetuses have severe abnormalities and no \n     chance of survival.''\n       Critique: Alarmed by the progress of H.R. 1833 in Congress, \n     lobbying groups representing the abortion industry and pro-\n     abortion advocacy groups have recently claimed that the \n     partial-birth abortion method is used mainly in rare \n     circumstances involving danger to the life of the mother or \n     very grave disorders of the fetus. Many editorial writers and \n     columnists (e.g., Ellen Goodman, Richard Cohen) have \n     uncritically embraced such claims. So have some reporters, \n     such as those quoted above. Indeed, the NPR assertion that \n     the procedure is used ``only . . . if fetuses have severe \n     abnormalities and no chance of survival'' is an even more \n     egregiously erroneous statement than the claims made by the \n     abortion-clinic lobby itself.\n       In truth, there is ample documentation to establish that \n     many--indeed, most--partial-birth abortions do not involve \n     ``severe abnormalities and no chance of survival'' or danger \n     to the life of the mother.\n       In 1992, after NRLC's publicizing of Dr. Haskell's paper \n     engendered considerable controversy, the American Medical \n     News--the official newspaper of the AMA--conducted a tape-\n     recorded interview with Dr. Haskell, in which he said: ``In \n     my particular case, probably 20% [of this procedure] are for \n     genetic reasons. And the other 80% are purely elective.''\n       This single statement from Dr. Haskell's own lips shreds \n     the most widely disseminated piece of disinformation \n     regarding partial-birth abortions. But there is much more.\n       Dr. James McMahon--who has performed at least 2,000 of \n     these procedures--told American Medical News that he also \n     uses the method to perform what he calls ``elective'' \n     abortions up to 26 weeks (six months). Moreover, after the \n     26-week point, Dr. McMahon said, he uses the method to \n     perform ``non-elective'' abortions (all the way to 40 weeks, \n     which is full term). In materials provided in June to the \n     House Judiciary Constitution Subcommittee, Dr. McMahon \n     revealed that his definition of ``non-elective'' is extremely \n     expansive. For example, he listed ``depression'' as the \n     largest single ``maternal indication'' for such so-called \n     ``non-elective'' abortions.\n       Dr. McMahon's materials also show that he uses the method \n     to destroy ``flawed fetuses,'' as he calls them. These \n     include unborn humans with a wide variety of disorders, \n     including conditions compatible with a long life with or \n     without disability (e.g., cleft palate, spina bifida, Down \n     syndrome). True, some of the babies have more profound \n     disorders that will result in death soon after birth. But \n     these unfortunate members of the human family deserve \n     compassion and the best comfort-care that medical science can \n     offer--not a scissors in the back of the head. In some such \n     situations there are good medical reasons to deliver such a \n     child early, after which natural death will follow quickly.\n       After conducting interviews with Dr. McMahon, reporter \n     Karen Tumulty wrote in the Los Angeles Times Magazine \n     (January 7, 1990): ``If there is any other single factor that \n     inflates the number of late abortions, it is youth. Often, \n     teen-agers do not recognize the first signs of pregnancy. \n     Just as frequently, they put off telling anyone as long as \n     they can.''\n       It is also noteworthy that when NRLC originally publicized \n     the partial-birth abortion procedure in 1993, the then-\n     executive director of the National Abortion Federation (NAF) \n     distributed an internal memorandum to the members of that \n     organization which acknowledged that such abortions are \n     performed for ``many reasons'': ``There are many reasons why \n     women have late abortions: life endangerment, \n     fetal indications, lack of money or health insurance, \n     social-psychological crises, lack of knowledge about human \n     reproduction, etc.'' [emphasis added]\n       Likewise, a June 12, 1995 letter from NAF to members of the \n     House of Representatives noted that late abortions are sought \n     by, among others, ``very young teenagers . . . who have not \n     recognized the signs of their pregnancies until too late,'' \n     and by ``women in poverty, who have tried desperately to act \n     responsibly and to end an unplanned pregnancy in the early \n     stages, only to face insurmountable financial barrier.''\n\n\n  does the bill make allowance for jeopardy to the life of the mother?\n\n       The bill contains a provision under which a doctor could \n     utilize the partial-birth abortion method if no other medical \n     procedure would suffice to save the mother's life. Eminent \n     medical authorities, including Prof. Watson Bowes of the \n     University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Dr. Pamela \n     Smith, head of the obstetrics teaching program at Mt. Sinai \n     Hospital in Chicago, have said that no such case would ever \n     arise--nevertheless, the bill makes allowance for such a \n     circumstance. In a letter to Congressman Charles Canady (R-\n     Fl.), prime sponsor of HR 1833, Prof. Bowes said: ``Critics \n     of your bill who say that this legislation will prevent \n     doctors from performing certain procedures which are standard \n     of care, such as cephalocentesis (removal of fluid from the \n     enlarged head of a fetus with most severe form of \n     hydrocephalus) are mistaken. This procedure is not intended \n     to kill the fetus, and, in fact, is usually associated with \n     the birth of a live infant . . . [Also,] the technique of the \n     partial-birth abortion could be used to remove a fetus that \n     had died in utero of natural causes or accident. Such a \n     procedure would not be covered by the definition in your \n     bill, because it would not involve partially delivering a \n     live fetus and then killing it.''\n\n\n  are the drawings of the partial-birth abortion method circulated by \n                 nrlc accurate, or are they misleading?\n\n       Misinformation: On June 12, the National Abortion \n     Federation--an association of abortion providers--sent a \n     letter to House members in which NAF claimed--on the \n     authority of Dr. J. Courtland Robinson of Johns Hopkins \n     Medical School--that the drawings of the partial-birth \n     abortion procedure distributed by Congressman Canady in a \n     letter to House members were ``highly imaginative'' and \n     ``misleading.'' These drawings had earlier been distributed \n     by the National Right to Life Committee.\n       Critique: Three days after the mailing of the letter quoted \n     above, Dr. Robinson testified before the House Judiciary \n     Constitution Subcommittee, representing the National Abortion \n     Federation. However, under questioning from subcommittee \n     chairman Rep. Charles Canady, Dr. Robinson admitted he had \n     not to that day even read Dr. Martin Haskell's unique 1992 \n     paper describing how to perform the procedure. Questioned by \n     Mr. Canady about the drawings--which were displayed in \n     poster size next to the witness table--Dr. Robinson agreed \n     that they were ``technically accurate,'' and added: ``That \n     is exactly probably what is occurring at the hands of the \n     two physicians involved.''\n       Moreover, American Medical News (July 5, 1993) reported: \n     ``Dr. Haskell said the drawings were accurate `from a \n     technical point of view.' But he took issue with the \n     implication that the fetuses were `aware and resisting.'\n       Professor Watson Bowes of the University of North Carolina \n     at Chapel Hill, wrote in a letter to Congressman Canady: \n     ``Having read Dr. Haskell's paper, I can assure you that \n     these drawings accurately represent the procedure described \n     therein. Furthermore, Dr. Haskell is reported as saying that \n     the illustrations were accurate `from a technical point of \n     view.' Firsthand renditions by a professional medical \n     illustrator, or photographs or a video recording of the \n     procedure would no doubt be more vivid, but not necessarily \n     more instructive for a non-medical person who is trying to \n     understand how the procedure is performed.''\n\n\n   is the baby already dead before being pulled into the birth canal \n                         during the procedure?\n\n       In the partial-birth abortion method, a woman visits the \n     abortion clinic on three successive days. On the first two \n     days, her cervix (the opening to the uterus) is mechanically \n     dilated with materials called laminaria. The baby is removed \n     on the third day. American Medical News reported in 1993, \n     after conducting interviews with Drs. Haskell and McMahon, \n     that the doctors ``told AM News that the majority of fetuses \n     aborted this way are alive until the end of the procedure.''\n       Recently, after introduction of the proposed federal ban, \n     Dr. Haskell and NAF for the first time disputed this and \n     other revealing quotes in the American Medical News story. In \n     response, the editor of American Medical News sent a letter \n     to the Judiciary Committee, dated July 11, stating: ``AM News \n     stands behind the accuracy of the report. . . . We have full \n     documentation of these interviews, including tape recordings \n     and transcripts.'' She also released the transcript of the \n     tape recording of the pertinent portions of the interview \n     with Dr. Haskell. The transcript contains the following \n     exchange:\n       American Medical News. Let's talk first about whether or \n     not the fetus is dead beforehand.\n       Dr. Haskell. No it's not. No, it's really not. A percentage \n     are for various numbers of reasons. Some just because of the \n     stress--intrauterine stress during, you know, the two days \n     that the cervix is being dilated [to permit extraction of the \n     fetus]. Sometimes the membranes rupture and it takes a very \n     small superficial infection to kill a fetus in utero when the \n     membranes are broken. And \n\n[[Page S 16793]]\n     so in my case, I would think probably about a third of those are \n     definitely are [sic] dead before I actually start to remove \n     the fetus. And probably the other two-thirds are not.\n       In another interview, quoted in the Dec. 10, 1989 Dayton \n     News, Dr. Haskell again conveyed that the scissors thrust is \n     usually the lethal act: ``When I do the instrumentation on \n     the skull * * * it destroys the brain tissue sufficiently so \n     that even if it (the fetus) falls out at that point, it's \n     definitely not alive, Dr. Haskell said.''\n       On July 9, 1995, Brenda Pratt Shafer, R.N., sent a letter \n     Congressman Tony Hall (D-Ohio), in which she related her \n     experience as a nurse whose agency assigned her to work at \n     Dr. Haskell's Dayton abortion clinic in 1993. Nurse Shafer \n     said she had no difficulty accepting the assignment because \n     she was strongly ``pro-choice.'' But she quit after \n     witnessing three partial-birth abortions close up. ``It was \n     the most horrifying experience of my life,'' she wrote.\n       Here''s how Nurse Shafer described the end of the life of \n     one six-month-old ``fetus'': ``The baby's body was moving. \n     His little fingers were clasping together. He was kicking his \n     feet. All the while his little head was still stuck inside. \n     Dr. Haskell took a pair of scissors and inserted them into \n     the back of the baby's head. Then he opened the scissors up. \n     Then he stuck the high-powered suction tube into the hole and \n     sucked the baby's brains out. I almost threw up as I watched \n     him do these things.''[3]\n       That the babies are generally alive at the time of their \n     ``extraction'' is further supported by the account of an \n     eyewitness very sympathetic to Dr. McMahon: Dr. Dru Elaine \n     Carlson, who is a perinatologist and director of Reproductive \n     Genetics at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. In a \n     June 27, 1995 letter to Congressman Henry Hyde opposing the \n     bill, Dr. Carlson wrote: ``Since I refer Dr. McMahon a large \n     number of families, I have gone to his facility and seen for \n     myself what he does and how he does it * * * Essentially he \n     provides analgesia for the mother that removes anxiety and \n     pain and as a result of this medication the fetus also is \n     sedated. When the cervix is open enough for a safe delivery \n     of the fetus he uses altrasound guidance to gently deliver \n     the fetal body up to the shoulders and then very quickly and \n     expertly performs what is called a cephalocentesis. \n     Essentially this is removal of cerebrospinal fluid from the \n     brain causing instant brain herniation and death'' [emphasis \n     added]\n       It is impossible to reconcile eyewitness accounts such as \n     those of Nurse Shafer and Dr. Carlson with the claim made by \n     NAF in a July 27 letter to Congress that ``fetal demise does \n     in fact occur early on in the [three-day] procedure.''\n\n\n  does the baby feel pain during the partial-birth abortion procedure?\n\n       In his 1992 paper, Dr. Haskell says that he performs the \n     procedure after giving the woman ``local anesthesia'' and \n     nitrous oxide (``laughing gas''), neither of which would \n     prevent pain in the baby.\n       Dr. McMahon says in a June 23 written submission to the \n     House Judiciary Constitution Subcommittee: ``The fetus feels \n     no pain through the entire series of procedures. This is \n     because the mother is given narcotic analgesia at a dose \n     based upon her weight. The narcotic is passed, via the \n     placenta, directly into the fetal bloodstream. Due to the \n     enormous weight difference, a medical coma is induced in the \n     fetus. There is a neurological fetal demise. There is never a \n     live birth.''\n       The New York Times (July 5, 1995) interpreted this \n     statement by Dr. McMahon to mean that the drug causes ``brain \n     death'' in the baby, which does indeed seem to be the \n     impression that Dr. McMahon attempts to convey. But his claim \n     cannot survive critical scrutiny.\n       Dr. Watson Bowes, an internationally recognized authority \n     on maternal and fetal medicine, is a professor of both \n     obstetrics/ gynecology and pediatrics at the University of \n     North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine. In a July \n     11 letter, Professor Bowes wrote: ``Dr. James McMahon states \n     that narcotic analgesic medications given to the mother \n     induce `a medical coma' in the fetus, and he implies that \n     this causes `a neurological fetal demise.' This statement \n     suggests a lack of understanding of maternal/fetal \n     pharmacology. It is a fact that the distribution of analgesic \n     medications given to a pregnant woman result in blood levels \n     of the drugs which are less than those in the mother. Having \n     cared for pregnant women who for one reason or another \n     required surgical procedures in the second trimester, I know \n     that they were often heavily sedated or anesthetized for the \n     procedures, and the fetuses did not die. . . . Although it is \n     true that analgesic medications given to the mother will \n     reach the fetus and presumably provide some degree of pain \n     relief, the extent to which this renders this procedure pain \n     free would be very difficult to document. I have performed \n     in-utero procedures on fetuses in the second trimester, and \n     in these situations the response of the fetuses to painful \n     stimuli, such as needle sticks, suggest that they are capable \n     of experiencing pain.''\n       In June 15 testimony before the House Judiciary \n     Constitution Subcommittee, Professor Robert White, Director \n     of the Division of Neurosurgery and Brain Research Laboratory \n     at Case Western Reserve School of Medicine, said: ``The fetus \n     within this time frame of gestation, 20 weeks and beyond, is \n     fully capable of experiencing pain.'' Prof. White analyzed \n     the partial-birth procedure step-by-step and concluded: \n     ``Without question, all of this is a dreadfully painful \n     experience for any infant subjected to such a surgical \n     procedure.''\n\n\n           does the bill contradict supreme court precedents?\n\n       In written testimony submitted to the House Judiciary \n     Constitution Subcommittee, David Smolin, a professor at \n     Cumberland Law School at Samford University, testified that \n     he believed that the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act could be \n     upheld even under the Supreme Court precedents that block \n     most government limitations on abortion. ``The spectre of \n     partially delivering a fetus, and then suctioning her brains, \n     may mix the physician's disparate roles at childbirth and \n     abortion in such a way as to particularly shock the \n     conscience. . . . It is possible that at least some of the \n     fetuses killed by partial-birth abortions are constitutional \n     persons. The Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade held that the word \n     `person', as used in the Fourteenth Amendment, does not \n     include the unborn.'' The Court, however, has never addressed \n     the constitutional status of those who are ``partially \n     born.'' [Prof. Smolin's complete testimony is available on \n     request.]\n       However, pro-abortion advocacy groups insist that even the \n     partial-birth abortion procedure is completely protected by \n     Roe v. Wade. If this is true, it will be news to a lot of \n     people--and it is a powerful argument for re-examining Roe v. \n     Wade.\n\n\n                                endnotes\n\n       [1] Unfortunately, some lawmakers and some other observers \n     demonstrate bias or ``denial mechanisms'' that resist \n     exposure even to impeccable documentation. For example, after \n     sitting through a July 12 House Judiciary Committee meeting \n     in which many of the documents quoted herein were cited and \n     circulated, Associated Press reporter Nita Lelyveld wrote, \n     ``Opponents of the bill say the scissors method is very rare \n     if it exists at all.'' Actually, however, not even the \n     National Abortion Federation has been audacious enough to \n     suggest that the ``scissors method'' may not ``exist at \n     all.'' Dr. Haskell's readily available paper, which has been \n     provided to Ms. Lelyveld and other reporters, refers five \n     times to the use of scissors. For example, Dr. Haskell \n     writes, ``the surgeon forces the scissors into the base of \n     the skull.'' The scissors are described as a Metzenbaum \n     surgical scissors, which is about seven inches long.\n       [2] Some press accounts have mistakenly reported that the \n     bill would affect only ``third-trimester'' abortions. In \n     fact, the bill would ban use of the partial-birth abortion \n     method in either the second or the third trimester of \n     pregnancy. It is noteworthy that there is a dispute over how \n     many third-trimester abortions, by all methods, are performed \n     every year. American Medical News (July 5, 1993) reported. \n     ``Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, MD, estimated in \n     1984 that 4,000 third-trimester abortions are performed \n     annually. The abortion federation [National Abortion \n     Federation] puts the number at 300 to 500. Dr [Martin] \n     Haskell says that `probably Koop's numbers are more correct.' \n     '' [Emphasis added]\n       [3] At a July 12 meeting of the House Judiciary Committee, \n     Congresswoman Patricia Schroeder (D-Co.) charged, based on a \n     July 12 letter from Dr. Haskell, that Brenda Shafer had never \n     worked at the clinic. Rep. Schroeder abandoned this charge \n     (although without apology) after committee members were \n     provided with copies of the bill sent to Dr. Haskell's clinic \n     by the nursing agency, which contained the nurse's license \n     and social security numbers. Dr. Haskell's letter also \n     disputed Shafer's account of witnessing abortions at 25 and \n     26\\1/2\\ weeks because, he claimed, he observes a ``self-\n     imposed and established limit of 24 weeks.'' But Dr. \n     Haskell's own 1992 paper, explaining how to perform the \n     procedure, said that he employs the method from 20 to 26 \n     weeks into pregnancy.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                        American Medical News,\n\n                                       Chicago, IL, July 11, 1995.\n     Hon. Charles T. Canady,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on the Constitution, Committee on the \n         Judiciary, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative Canady: We have received your July 7 \n     letter outlining allegations of inaccuracies in a July 5, \n     1993, story in American Medical News, ``Shock-tactic ads \n     target late-term abortion procedure.''\n       You noted that in public testimony before your committee, \n     AMNews is alleged to have quoted physicians out of context. \n     You also noted that one such physician submitted testimony \n     contending that AMNews misrepresented his statements. We \n     appreciate your offer of the opportunity to respond to these \n     accusations, which now are part of the permanent subcommittee \n     record.\n       AMNews stands behind the accuracy of the report cited in \n     the testimony. The report was complete, fair, and balanced. \n     The comments and positions expressed by those interviewed and \n     quoted were reported accurately and in-context. The report \n     was based on extensive research and interviews with experts \n     on both sides of the abortion debate, including interviews \n     with two physicians who perform the procedure in question.\n       We have full documentation of these interviews, including \n     tape recordings and transcripts. Enclosed is a transcript of \n     the contested quotes that relate to the allegations of \n     inaccuracies made against AMNews.\n       Let me also note that in the two years since publication of \n     our story, neither the \n\n[[Page S 16794]]\n     organization nor the physician who complained about the report in \n     testimony to your committee has contacted the reporter or any \n     editor of AMNews to complain about it. AMNews has a \n     longstanding reputation for balance, fairness and accuracy in \n     reporting, including reporting on abortion, an issue that is \n     as divisive within medicine as it is within society in \n     general. We believe that the story in question comports \n     entirely with that reputation.\n       Thank you for your letter and the opportunity to clarify \n     this matter.\n           Respectfully yours,\n                                                   Barbara Bolsen,\n     Editor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n       Attachment.\n\n\n                    American Medical News transcript\n\n       AMN.

And probably the other two-thirds are not.\n       AMN. Is the skull procedure also done to make sure that the \n     fetus is dead so you're not going to have the problem of a \n     live birth?\n       Haskell. It's immaterial. If you can't get it out, you \n     can't get it out.\n       AMN. I mean, you couldn't dilate further? Or is that \n     riskier?\n       Haskell. Well, you could dilate further over a period of \n     days.\n       AMN. Would that just make it . . . would it go from a 3-day \n     procedure to a 4- or 5-?\n       Haskell. Exactly. the point here is to effect a safe legal \n     abortion. I mean, you could say the same thing about the D \n     procedure. You know, why do you do the D procedure? Why do \n     you crush the fetus up inside the womb? to kill it before you \n     take it out?\n       Well, that happens, yes. But that's not why you do it. You \n     do it to get it out. I could do the same thing with a D \n     procedure. I could put dilapan in for four or five days and \n     say I'm doing a D procedure and the fetus could just fall \n     out. But that's not really the point. He point here is you're \n     attempting to do an abortion. And that's the goal of your \n     work, is to complete an abortion. Not to see how do I \n     manipulate the situation so that I get a live birth instead.\n       AMN, wrapping up the Interview. I want to make sure I have \n     both you and (Dr.) McMahon saying `No' then. That this is \n     misinformation, these letters to the editor saying it's only \n     done when the baby's already dead, in case of fetal demise \n     and you have to do an autopsy. But some of them are saying \n     they're getting that misinformation from NAF. Have you talked \n     to Barbara Radford or anyone over there? I called Barbara and \n     she called back, but I haven't gotten back to her.\n       Haskell. Well, I had heard that they were giving that \n     information, somebody over there might be giving information \n     like that out. The people that staff the NAF office are not \n     medical people. And many of them when I gave my paper, many \n     of them came in, I learned later, to watch my paper because \n     many of them have nver seen an abortion performed of any \n     kind.\n       AMN. Did you also show a video when you did that?\n       Haskell. Yeah. I taped a procedure a couple of years ago, a \n     very brief video, that simply showed the technique. The old \n     story about a picture's worth a thousand words.\n       AMN. As National right to Life will tell you.\n       Haskell. Afterwards they were just amazed. They just had no \n     idea. And here they're rabid supporters of abortion. They \n     work in the office there. And . . . some of them have never \n     seen one performed.\n       Comments on elective vs. non-elective abortions:\n       Haskell. And I'll be quite frank: most of my abortions are \n     elective in that 20-24 week range . . .

Gianelli)\n\n       Washington.--In an attempt to derail an abortion-rights \n     bill maneuvering toward a congressional showdown, opponents \n     have launched a full-scale campaign against late-term \n     abortions.\n       The centerpieces of the effort are newspaper advertisements \n     and brochures that graphically illustrate a technique used in \n     some second- and third-trimester abortions. A handful of \n     newspapers have run the ads so far, and the National Right to \n     Life Committee has distributed 4 million of the brochures, \n     which were inserted into about a dozen other papers.\n       By depicting a procedure expected to make most readers \n     squeamish, campaign sponsors hope to convince voters and \n     elected officials that a proposed federal abortion-rights \n     bill is so extreme that states would have no authority to \n     limit abortions--even on potentially viable fetuses.\n       According to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a research \n     group affiliated with Planned Parenthood, about 10% of the \n     estimated 1.6 million abortions done each year are in the \n     second and third trimesters.\n       Barbara Radford of the National Abortion Federation \n     denounced the ad campaign as disingenuous, saying its ``real \n     agenda is to outlaw virtually all abortions, not just late-\n     term ones.'' But she acknowledged it is having an impact, \n     reporting scores of calls from congressional staffers and \n     others who have seen the ads and brochures and are asking \n     pointed questions about the procedure depicted.\n       The Minneapolis Star-Tribune ran the ad May 12, on its op-\n     ed page. The anti-abortion group Minnesota Citizens Concerned \n     for Life paid for it.\n       In a series of drawings, the ad illustrates a procedure \n     called `'dilation and extraction,'' or D, in which forceps \n     are used to remove second- and third-trimester fetuses from \n     the uterus intact, with only the head remaining inside the \n     uterus.\n       The surgeon is then shown jamming scissors into the skull. \n     The ad says this is done to create an opening large enough to \n     insert a catheter that suctions the brain, while at the same \n     time making the skull small enough to pull through the \n     cervix.\n       ``Do these drawings shock you?'' the ad reads. ``We're \n     sorry, but we think you should know the truth.''\n       The ad quotes Martin Haskell, MD, who described the \n     procedure at a September 1992 abortion-federation meeting, as \n     saying he personally has performed 700 of them. It then \n     states that the proposed ``Freedom of Choice Act'' now moving \n     through Congress would ``protect the practice of abortion at \n     all stages and would lead to an increase in the use of this \n     grisly procedure.''\n\n\n                          accuracy questioned\n\n       Some abortion-rights advocates have questioned the ad's \n     accuracy.\n       A letter to the Star-Tribune said the procedure shown ``is \n     only performed after fetal death when an autopsy is necessary \n     or to save the life of the mother.'' And the Morrisville, \n     Vt., Transcript, which said in an editorial that it allowed \n     the brochure to be inserted in its paper only because it \n     feared legal action if it refused, quoted the abortion \n     federation as providing similar information. ``The fetus is \n     dead 24 hours before the pictured procedure is undertaken,'' \n     the editorial stated.\n       But Dr. Haskell and another doctor who routinely use the \n     procedure for late-term abortions told AMNews that the \n     majority of fetuses aborted this way are alive until the end \n     of the procedure.\n       Dr. Haskell said the drawing were accurate ``from a \n     technical point of view.'' But he took issue with the \n     implication that the fetuses were ``aware and resisting.''\n       Radford also acknowledged that the information her group \n     was quoted as providing was inaccurate. She has since sent a \n     letter to federation members, outlining guidelines for \n     discussing the matter. Among the points:\n       Don't apologize: this is a legal procedure.\n       No abortion method is acceptable to abortion opponents.\n       The language and graphics in the ads are disturbing to some \n     readers. ``Much of the negative reaction, however, is the \n     same reaction that might be invoked if one were to listen to \n     a surgeon describing step-by-step almost any other surgical \n     procedure involving blood, human tissue, etc.''\n\n\n                       late-abortion specialists\n\n       Only Dr. Haskell, James T. McMahon, MD, of Los Angeles, and \n     a handful of other doctors perform the D procedure, which \n     Dr. McMahon refers to as ``intact D'' The more common \n     late-term abortion methods are the classic D and induction, \n     which usually involves injecting digoxin or another substance \n     into the fetal heart to kill it, then dilating the cervix and \n     inducing labor.\n       Dr. Haskell, who owns abortion clinics in Cincinnati and \n     Dayton, said he started performing D for late abortions \n     out of necessity. Local hospitals did not allow inductions \n     past 18 weeks, and he had no place to keep patients overnight \n     while doing the procedure.\n       But the classic D, in which the fetus is broken apart \n     inside the womb, carries the risk of perforation, tearing and \n     hemorrhaging, he said, So he turned to the D, which he says \n     is far less risky to the mother.\n       Dr. McMahon acknowledged that the procedure he, Dr. Haskell \n     and a handful of other doctors use makes some people queasy. \n     But he defends it. ``Once you decide the uterus must be \n     emptied, you then have to have 100% allegiance to maternal \n     risk. There's no justification to doing a more dangerous \n     procedure because somehow this doesn't offend you \n     sensibilities as much.''\n\n\n                        brochure cites n.y. case\n\n       The four-page anti-abortion brochures also include a \n     graphic depiction of the D procedure. But the cover \n     features a photograph of 16-month-old Ana Rosa Rodriquez, \n     whose right arm was severed during an abortion attempt when \n     her mother was 7 months pregnant.\n       The child was born two days later, at 32 to 34 weeks' \n     gestation. Abu Hayat, MD, of New York, was convicted of \n     assault and performing an illegal abortion. He was sentenced \n     to up to 29 years in prison for this and another related \n     offense.\n       New York law bans abortions after 24 weeks, except to save \n     the mother's life. The \n\n[[Page S 16795]]\n     brochure states that Dr. Hayat never would have been prosecuted if the \n     Federal ``Freedom of Choice Act'' were in effect, because the \n     act would invalidate the New York statute.\n       The proposed law would allow abortion for any reason until \n     viability. But it would leave it up to individual \n     practitioners--not the state--to define that point. \n     Postviability abortions, however, could not be restricted if \n     done to save a woman's life or health, including emotional \n     health.\n       The abortion federation's Radford called the Hayat case \n     ``an aberration'' and stressed that the vast majority of \n     abortions occur within the first trimester. She also said \n     that later abortions usually are done for reasons of fetal \n     abnormality or material health.\n       But Douglas Johnson of the National Right to Life Committee \n     called that suggestion ``blatantly false.''\n       ``The abortion practitioners themselves will admit the \n     majority of their late-term abortions are elective,'' he \n     said. ``People like Dr. Haskell are just trying to reach \n     others how to do it more efficiently.''\n\n\n                              numbers game\n\n       Accurate figures on second- and third-trimester abortions \n     are elusive because a number of states don't require doctors \n     to report abortion statistics. For example, one-third of all \n     abortions are said to occur in California, but the state has \n     no reporting requirements. The Guttmacher Institute estimates \n     there were nearly 168,000 second- and third-trimester \n     abortions in 1988, the last year for which figures are \n     available.\n       About 60,000 of those occurred in the 16- to 20-week \n     period, with 10,660 at week 21 and beyond, the institute \n     says. Estimates were based on actual gestational age, as \n     opposed to last menstrual period.\n       There is particular debate over the number of third-\n     trimester abortions. Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, \n     MD, estimated in 1984 that 4,000 are performed annually. The \n     abortion federation puts the number at 300 to 500. Dr. \n     Haskell says that ``probably Koop's numbers are more \n     correct.''\n       Dr. Haskell said he performs abortions ``up until about 25 \n     weeks'' gestation, most of them elective. Dr. McMahon does \n     abortions through all 40 weeks of pregnancy, but said he \n     won't do an elective procedure after 26 weeks. About 80% of \n     those he does after 21 weeks are nonelective, he said.\n\n\n                             mixed feelings\n\n       Dr. McMahon admits having mixed feelings about the \n     procedure in which he has chosen to specialize.\n       ``I have two positions that may be internally inconsistent, \n     and that's probably why I fight with this all the time,'' he \n     said.\n       ``I do have moral compunctions. And if I see a case that's \n     later, like 20 weeks where it frankly is a child to me, I \n     really agonize over it because the potential is so imminently \n     there. I think, `Gee, it's too bad that this child couldn't \n     be adopted.'\n       ``On the other hand, I have another position, which I think \n     is superior in the hierarchy of questions, and that is: `Who \n     owns the child?' It's got to be the mother.''\n       Dr. McMahon says he doesn't want to ``hold patients hostage \n     to my technical skill. I can say, `No, I won't do that,' and \n     then they're stuck with either some criminal solution or some \n     other desperate maneuver.''\n       Dr. Haskell, however, says whatever qualms he has about \n     third-trimester abortions are ``only for technical reasons, \n     not for emotional reasons of fetal development.''\n       ``I think it's important to distinguish the two,'' he says, \n     adding that his cut-off point is within the viability \n     threshold noted in Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision \n     that legalized abortion. The decision said that point usually \n     occurred at 28 weeks ``but may occur earlier, even at 24 \n     weeks.''\n       Viability is generally accepted to be ``somewhere between \n     25 and 26 weeks,'' said Dr. Haskell. ``It just depends on who \n     you talk to.\n       ``We don't have a viability law in Ohio. In New York they \n     have a 24-week limitation. That's how Dr. Hayat got in \n     trouble. If somebody tells me I have to use 22 weeks, that's \n     fine. . . . I'm not a trailblazer or activist trying to \n     constantly press the limits.''\n\n\n                       campaign's impact debated\n\n       Whether the ad and brochures will have the full impact \n     abortion opponents intend is yet to be seen.\n       Congress has yet to schedule a final showdown on the bill. \n     Although it has already passed through the necessary \n     committees, supporters are reluctant to move it for a full \n     House and Senate vote until they are sure they can win.\n       In fact, House Speaker Tom Foley (D, Wash.) has said he \n     wants to bring the bill for a vote under a ``closed rule'' \n     procedure, which would prohibit consideration of amendments.\n       But opponents are lobbying heavily against Foley's plan. \n     Among the amendments they wish to offer is one that would \n     allow, but not require, states to restrict abortion--except \n     to save the mother's life--after 24 weeks.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, today, as it has been since the \nlandmark 1973 Supreme Court Decision of Roe versus Wade, the concept of \nreproductive freedom is under assault.\n  Choice is a matter of freedom. Choice is a fundamental issue of the \nrelationship of female citizens to their Government. Choice is a \nbarometer of equality and a measure of fairness. Choice is central to \nour liberty. While I do not believe in abortion, I do believe, \nfundamentally, in choice.\n  In spite of the fact that the majority of the American people embrace \nthe freedom to choose reproduction, the efforts to use Government \nintervention as a bar to the right to choice have taken on a new \nferocity. And today, some in the U.S. Senate would prevent Senators and \ncitizens alike from the chance to even hold hearings on the latest \nassault on a woman's right to choose.\n  The newest assault is H.R. 1833/S. 939, an unconstitutional, vague \nban on a rare medical procedure used to terminate pregnancies late in \nthe term, when the life or health of the mother is at risk, and or when \nthe fetus has severe abnormalities.\n  The procedure that is the intended focus of this bill involves giving \nanesthesia to a mother over a period of days while gradually dilating \nher cervix--the fetus dies during the first dose of anesthesia--then \ndraining the brain fluid after death so that the cervix is forced to \nwithstand less trauma as the fetus is removed, preserving the woman's \nability to conceive.\n  H.R. 1833/S. 939 would make it a criminal offense to perform certain \ntypes of late term abortions. A doctor who performed such an abortion \nwould face up to 2 years in prison and fines.\n  The doctor and the hospital or clinic where he or she worked would \nalso be liable for civil action brought by the father of a fetus or the \nmaternal parents of the woman if she was under 18.\n  Instead of providing an exception for cases where the banned \nprocedure is used to save the life of the mother, doctors would be \nrequired, after being reasonably believed that no other method would \nhave saved the woman's life.\n  Before I talk about the constitutional and policy implications of \nH.R. 1833/S. 939, I want to tell the story of Vikki, she is from \nNaperville, in my home State of Illinois.\n  Vikki and her husband were expecting their third child. At 20 weeks \nshe went for a sonogram and was told by her doctor that she and her \nchild were healthy. She named the boy Anthony.\n  At 32 weeks Vikki took her two daughters with her to watch their \nbrother on the sonogram. The technician did not say a word during the \nsonogram and then asked Vikki to come upstairs to talk with the doctor. \nVikki thought maybe it was because the baby was breach. She is a \ndiabetic and any complications could be serious.\n  The doctor was too busy to see Vikki, but called at 7 a.m. the next \nmorning to say that the femurs--leg bones--seemed a little short. He \nassured her that there was a 99 percent chance that nothing was wrong, \nbut asked her to come in for a level 2 ultrasound.\n  Vikki and her husband found out that their child had no brain. There \nwere eight abnormalities in all.\n  Vikki had to make the hardest decision of her life. This is how she \nexplained it: ``I had to remove my son from life support --that was \nme.''\n  For Vikki, the hardest thing for a parent to do is to watch her child \nhurt. It is hard enough just watching a child get teased at the bus \nstop.\n  The procedure took four visits to the doctor. She received anesthesia \non the first visit. Her son stopped moving the first night. She knew he \nwas gone. This was before the procedure to remove the fetus took place.\n  Having an D procedure was particularly important because Vikki \nwanted to know if this was something that she would pass on to her two \ndaughters.--With a D an autopsy can be performed.--Luckily, it was \njust one of those things and her girls will be able to have children of \ntheir own.\n  Vikki's D was the closest thing for her body to natural birth. She \nwas able to preserve her fertility, and I am happy to say is now 30 \nweeks pregnant. The baby looks fine.\n  I wanted to tell my colleagues that story, because it is true, it is \nabout a real woman, and it is about a family handling an awful, \nhorrible situation in the best way that it can.\n  This is the kind of case where my colleagues want to substitute their \njudgement for the judgement of the family and their doctor. \n\n[[Page S 16796]]\n\n  Now what are the implications for banning these abortions, beyond the \naffect that it would have on the lives of women like Vikki and their \nfamilies?\n  Doctors are going to be too scared to perform legal abortions and \nmedically necessary abortions because of the threat of criminal or \ncivil prosecution. H.R. 1833/S. 939 is vague. The definition of \nabortions covered under this legislation is ``partial-birth.'' That is \na term used for its shock value, not its medical value. There is no \nsuch medical term and doctors cannot agree on what the legislation is \nintended to ban.\n  Women are going to face life and health risks as well as the loss of \nfertility as they undergo more dangerous procedures. H.R. 1833/S. 939 \nis dangerous. If a doctor chooses to perform an abortion covered by \nthis bill, it is because he or she considers the procedure to be the \nmost medically sound for the woman. By choosing to arbitrarily prohibit \none type of procedure, but not others, regardless of which procedure \nmost protects the life, health, and fertility of the woman, Congress is \nmicro-managing decisions best made in a doctor's office.\n  Women's constitutional rights will be taken away. H.R. 1833/S. 939 is \nunconstitutional. Under Roe versus Wade and Planned Parenthood versus \nCasey, the Supreme Court standard is that a state may not prohibit \npost-viability abortions necessary to preserve the life or health of a \nwoman. Under H.R. 1833/S. 939, there is an exception only for life and \nthen only by way of an affirmative defense.\n  While H.R. 1833/S. 939 is focused on late-term abortions, doctors who \nperform early-term abortions by the loosely defined means covered by \nthe bill are subject to the same liability. Choosing to have an \nabortion when the fetus is not yet viable is clearly a constitutionally \nprotected right under Roe versus Wade.\n  These are some of the policy implications of H.R. 1833/S. 939. This \nthreat to a doctor's ability to care for his or her patient, disregard \nof a woman's health, and attack on a woman's constitutional rights are \nall part of a broader attack on choice.\n  The 104th Congress has already seen a dramatic erosion in the right \nof a woman to choice.\n  First came the Hyde amendment. Poor women were limited in their \nreproductive choices because Government contributed to payment of their \nhealth care. Their rights became more than their pocketbooks could \nprotect.\n  Then came the battle of parental notification. Very young women were \nlimited in their reproductive choices, except in cases of rape or \nincest, because of their age--not their condition--teens became the \nvictims of bad timing and thus the State asserted a right to intervene.\n  Then came the women in the military--who by virtue of their own \ndecision, or that of their spouse, to serve their country, would be \nlimited in their reproductive choices.\n  Then came legislation earlier this year, which eliminated abortion \ncoverage from Federal health insurance. Employee benefits for Federal \nworkers are now restricted in ways which, I hope, would be unthinkable \nin the private sector.\n  Now comes a bill to fine or jail doctors who perform abortions for \nwomen who need them late in their term because their life and health \nare in danger or because of the severity of the deformities of their \nfetus.\n  These actions remind me of a famous poem by Martin Niemoller, a \nProtestant minister interred in a German concentration camp for 7 \nyears. I would like to read you my own, more contemporary version of \nhis parable. I call it ``The Assault on Reproductive Rights.''\n\n     First they came for poor women\n     and I did not speak out--\n     because I was not a poor woman.\n     Then they came for the teenagers\n     and I did not speak out--\n     because I was no longer a teenager.\n     Then they came for women in the military\n     and I did not speak out--\n     because I was not in the military.\n     Then they came for women in the federal government\n     and I did not speak out--\n     because I did not work for the government.\n     Then they came for the doctors\n     and I did not speak out\n     because I was not a doctor.\n     Then they came for me--\n     and there was no one left\n     to speak out for me.\n\n  What we are faced with here today is another attempt to erode a \nwoman's right to choose. And we must remember, the fight for choice is \na quintessential fight for freedom.\n  I do not favor abortion. My own religious beliefs hold life dear, and \nI would prefer that every potential child have a chance to be born.\n  But I am not prepared to substitute the Government's judgement for \nthe judgements of women, their families, and their doctors in this most \npersonal of all decisions.\n  When Vikki made the decision to remove her child from life support--\nher body--she made a decision, with the help of her husband and her \ndoctor, that only she could make.\n  And the fact that the Senate would even consider placing our \njudgement above hers without holding hearings--without fully \nunderstanding the consequences of our actions, without hearing from \nwomen, their families, and their doctors first hand--is appalling.\n  For the first time in history, the Senate is attempting to make a \nspecific medical procedure criminal, and none of the work has been \ndone. The Senate is attempting to prohibit a woman from undergoing a \nmedical procedure that could save her life and her ability to conceive, \nand none of the work has been done. Well I say, we must do the work.\n  The State has no right to intervene in this relationship between a \nwoman and her body, her doctor, and her God.\n  At the very least, I urge my colleagues to support Senator Specter's \nmotion to commit this legislation to the Judiciary Committee.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to speak as a cosponsor of the \nmotion made by my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, to \ncommit this bill to the Senate Judiciary Committee for hearings.\n  I rise to speak because I am deeply concerned that we stand here on \nthe floor today to discuss legislation on such a serious issue, without \never having held any hearings on the matter.\n  As a Member of the Senate, I am deeply concerned that hearings have \nnot been held on this legislation which raises significant \nconstitutional questions.\n  But as a woman, I believe that the failure of this body to hold \nhearings demonstrates an appalling disregard for the lives and health \nof women across this Nation.\n  There is no question that any abortion is an emotional, wrenching \ndecision for a woman and her family under any circumstance. When a \nwoman must confront this decision during the later stages of a \npregnancy because she knows that the pregnancy presents a direct threat \nto her own life, such a decision becomes a nightmare.\n  Mr. President, 22 years ago, the Supreme Court issued a landmark \ndecision in Roe versus Wade, carefully crafted to be both balanced and \nresponsible while holding the rights of women in America paramount in \nreproductive decisions.\n  This decision held that women have a constitutional right to \nabortion, but after viability, States could ban abortions as long as \nthey allowed exceptions for cases in which a woman's life or health is \nendangered.\n  Let me repeat--as long as they allowed exceptions for cases in which \na woman's life or health is endangered.\n  The Supreme Court has reaffirmed this decision time and time and time \nagain. And to date, 41 States--including my home State of Maine--have \nexercised their right to impose restrictions on post-viability \nabortions. All, of course, provide exceptions for the life or health of \nthe mother, as constitutionally required by Roe.\n  H.R. 1833, however, does not provide an exception for the life or \nhealth of the mother. Let me repeat, it does not provide an exception \nfor the life or health of the mother. And, as a result, it represents a \ndirect, frontal assault on Roe and on the reproductive rights of women \neverywhere.\n  And despite the apparent unconstitutionality of this legislation, the \nSenate has not held hearings on the subject. Not in the Judiciary \nCommittee. And not in the Labor and Human Resources Committee.\n  I find the Senate's lack of hearings on this issue deeply disturbing \nfor another reason as well. Not since prior to Roe versus Wade has \nthere been efforts to criminalize a medical procedure in this country. \nBut that's exactly what this bill does. \n\n[[Page S 16797]]\n\n  This legislation is an unprecedented expansion of congressional \nregulation of women's health care. Never before has Congress intruded \ndirectly into the practice of medicine by banning a safe and legal \nmedical procedure that is absolutely vital to protect the health or \nlives of women.\n  In effect, the Senate is clearly attempting to substitute \ncongressional judgment for that of a medical doctor regarding the \nappropriateness of a medical procedure.\n  As quoted in the New York Times, one doctor said: ``I don't want to \nmake medical decisions based on congressional language. I do not want \nto be that vulnerable. And it is not what I want for my patients.'' He \nis right.\n  This legislation sets new, frightening precedents for congressional \naction to limit on a wide range of medical procedures. It is open to \neven wider legal interpretations that may have an even broader impact \non women's lives.\n  Because of the vagueness of the bill, doctors across the Nation may \ninterpret the language differently at the expense of the health and \nlife of the mother involved.\n  Now, some of my colleagues may rise to insist that the legislation \nsomehow contains an exception for the life of the mother. However, this \nis simply untrue, and I urge my colleagues not to be misled by this \nrhetoric.\n  As it now reads, the legislation only provides doctors with a so-\ncalled affirmative defense. I say so-called because there is nothing \naffirmative about this law for doctors. And there is no genuine defense \nallowed for them under this legislation because the guilty verdict is \nrendered the moment they attempt the medical procedure.\n  It means that a doctor cannot avoid criminal prosecution if he or she \nuses their best medical judgment and decides that it is necessary to \nperform this procedure to save the life of a patient.\n  Mr. President, it is only after that doctor is on trial that he is \nfinally given an opportunity to prove that the procedure was necessary \nto save the life of that patient and that no other procedure would have \nsufficed--an almost impossible burden to prove. But that is exactly the \nintent of this bill.\n  In other words--in a twisted angle on one of our most cherished \njudicial tenets--these doctors are presumed guilty until proven \ninnocent. Thus, doctors will refuse to perform this procedure, which \nthey know to be medically safer for their patient, even when the \nwoman's life is threatened.\n  Not only that, but doctors would also be subject to civil lawsuits \nbrought on by the parents of the mother who undergoes the procedure or \nby the father. This opens up an entire new realm of judicial \nproceedings and civil lawsuits.\n  Even if a doctor is able to survive the trial phase of affirmative \ndefense, then he or she would be subjected to a further judicial hurdle \nof civil lawsuits. The possibilities go on and on.\n  But--in the larger context--look at what this legislation does \noverall, and its intent is perfectly clear: First, intimidate doctors \nwith prison terms.\n  Second, threaten them with horrendous Federal fines in the vicinity \nof $250,000. Third, harass them with possibility of civil lawsuits--and \nthat should keep anyone from wanting to perform any kind of medical \nprocedure involving women's reproductive health.\n  We're going to do this in a climate where--according to a recent \nstatistic--94 percent of all American counties no longer have or never \nhad a provider of full reproductive services for women. We're going to \ndo this in a climate where doctors already face demonstrations, death \nthreats against them and their family, and even violence.\n  Now, we are telling them they must face the additional concern of \ncriminal prosecution, jail, and costly trials. We are doing this to \ndoctors who are only really trying to save the lives of women in dire \ncircumstances to the best of their medical expertise. In this sense, it \nis a chilling frontal assault on every women's rights.\n  How chilling? The proponents of this legislation are willing to risk \nthe lives and health of women facing medical emergencies.\n  My opponents will say that a number of other alternatives are \navailable to these women.\n  What alternatives? The only alternatives I know of are far more \ndangerous and traumatic. Has anyone asked the physicians? Has anyone \nlooked at the medical evidence? This is another reason why we should be \nholding hearings:\n  Are C-sections, which cause twice as much bleeding and carries four \ntimes the risk of death as a vaginal delivery--really an option?\n  Is induced labor, which carries its own potentially life-threatening \nrisks such as cardiac edema--really an option?\n  Are hysterectomies, which leave women permanently unable to \nconceive--really an option?\n  In the end, this legislation would order doctors to set aside the \nparamount interests of the woman's health, and to trade-off her health \nand life and future fertility in order to avoid the possibility of \ncriminal prosecution.\n  Yes, despite these significant risks to a woman's life and health \ncreated by this legislation--and despite the historic new precedents \nthat are set--the Senate has never held hearings on this subject.\n  We enter this debate today on H.R. 1833 with profound and critically \nimportant questions--legal, moral, and medical--unanswered and \nunconsidered. Why the rush? Why the hurry?\n  That's why hearings deserve to be held. And that's the course of \naction that this Chamber must take. No one truly knows the legal \nramifications. No one here truly knows the medical statistics or facts. \nNo one has had the time to ask questions and receive answers. No one \nhas anticipated the court challenges that will ensue.\n  Doctors will be threatened. Physicians will be intimidated. The \nmedical profession will wonder where the next assault on health care by \nthe Federal Government will come from or where it will be felt.\n  And what about the women? Who has thought about them? They will be \nmore scared than ever before. Their rights will be more restricted than \never before. Their lives--their lives--will be more threatened than \never before.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to think of the women who are \nfaced with this procedure. I urge my colleagues to consider the effect \non doctors. And I urge my colleagues to support the motion to commit \nthis bill to the Judiciary Committee.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator from New Hampshire yield some time to me?\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 12 minutes, 45 seconds.\n  Mr. SMITH. How much time does the Senator need?\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will yield 5 minutes, I will try to \nconserve that.\n  Mr. SMITH. I will yield 5 minutes to the distinguished chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my dear friend.\n  Mr. President, a number of my colleagues have inquired of my view \ntoward referring the pending bill to the Judiciary Committee. I have no \nobjection to the full Senate taking up H.R. 1833 at this time, and I \nintend to vote against this motion.\n  The Senate over the years has conducted a lot of hearings on the \nsubject of abortion. The other body has done the same. There is nothing \nunique about this bill except its approach toward what really amounts \nto third trimester abortions, something that I have trouble \nunderstanding why anybody would fight.\n  I remind my colleagues that on February 10, 1964, the other body \noverwhelmingly voted in favor of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a \nsweeping landmark civil rights bill--one that I would have voted for \nhad I been here at the time. Then-Senate majority leader Mike Mansfield \nplaced the bill on the Senate Calendar, just like this one was. A \nmotion was made to refer the bill to the Judiciary Committee. The \nSenate rejected the motion. Why? Because it was sincerely believed that \nsuch a referral would kill a landmark civil rights bill.\n  Today, the strategy for killing the pending measure is the same--send \nit to the committee. As a matter of procedure, if the Senate could take \nup the sweeping Civil Rights Act of 1964 directly from the Senate \nCalendar, it can today do the same with a bill that addresses one \naspect of the whole abortion issue. \n\n[[Page S 16798]]\n\n  My present purpose in mentioning the procedural precedent of the 1964 \nCivil Rights Act is not to engage in a comparison of the rights at \nstake then and the ones at stake in the Chamber today.\n  I understand that there are strong views on both sides of the \nunderlying issue. I respect those who disagree with my views on this \nissue. But many of us believe that the rights of the unborn present \nimportant enough issues to justify a procedure allowing the Senate to \nvote up and down on the merits of H.R. 1833. There is, indeed, Senate \nprecedent for doing so if the cause is urgent enough.\n  I believe the cause is sufficiently urgent, and I ask my colleagues \nto keep in mind we are talking about one particular abortion procedure \nthat kills the fetus in the most heinous way by sucking the brain out \nof the baby. It is hard for me to understand why anybody would fight \nthis bill. We are not even talking about the entire framework of \nabortion rights here, but just one procedure.\n  Let me also say that if I had my way, we would abolish all late-term \nabortions except to save the life of the mother. There are between \n14,000 and 20,000 of those abortions a year. I think morally it is very \ndifficult to justify that type of a thing.\n  One final thing. As the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I must \ncorrect a legal misunderstanding being expressed here. The Clinton \nadministration and other opponents of this bill claim that this bill is \nunconstitutional because it permits a doctor to justify a partial-birth \nabortion only as an affirmative defense to a prosecution. The fact that \nthe bill provides the exception required by the case law in an \naffirmative defense does not unduly burden the right to an abortion.\n  Many of our constitutional rights arise only as an affirmative \ndefense. Many of the protections of the Bill of Rights--freedom of \nspeech, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly, freedom of petition, \nthe right to bear arms, freedom from unreasonable searches and \nseizures, the right to grand jury, the right against double jeopardy, \nthe right against self-incrimination, the right to a speedy trial, the \nright to indictment, the right to assistance of counsel--sometimes can \nonly be raised as a defense to a prosecution. Indeed, any of us may be \ninnocent of a crime and prosecuted and make our claim of innocence only \nas a defense in court.\n  To claim that the right to an abortion is not protected by an \naffirmative defense demeans the explicit protections of the Bill of \nRights, and it raises abortion above any right mentioned in the \nConstitution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has spoken for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that I be given another 1 minute.\n  Mr. SMITH. I yield 1 more minute.\n  Mr. HATCH. Accordingly, I will vote against the motion to commit to \nthe Judiciary Committee this bill that I believe is fully legal under \nthe true meaning of the Constitution and under the Supreme Court's \ncurrent abortion jurisprudence.\n  To me it is amoral, except to save the life of the mother, to kill \nthese infants in this way. We are talking about children after 20 weeks \nin the mother's womb, most of whom are capable of living outside the \nwomb. We are not talking about when the spirit comes into the body or \nany of the other questions that have arisen concerning the abortion \nissue. We are talking about fully developed children.\n  Now, I can understand both sides of the abortion issue. I know how \nsincere are those who are on the other side. But on this issue I have \ntrouble understanding the logic that they are using. I know my \ncolleague from Pennsylvania is sincere in his motion here today, but I \ndo not see any reason why we need to go to that motion. I think we \nought to face it, and vote up or down. Everybody understands this \nissue. We ought to face it right here and now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator from Wisconsin?\n  Mr. SPECTER. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 13 minutes 47 seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. President, I support the motion to commit this bill to the \nJudiciary Committee for hearings before the Senate acts upon this \nmeasure. And I want to particularly thank the senior Senator from \nPennsylvania and the junior Senator from California for their \nleadership and courage in trying to do the right thing on this issue, \nmaking sure that there is a proper hearing in the Judiciary Committee \non the matter.\n  This bill, as it is currently drafted, would criminalize the actions \nof physicians who perform medical procedures which they believe may be \nnecessary to save the life or protect the health of their patient. It \nis a very serious matter that the Senate ought not to act upon without \ndeliberation and consideration.\n  There have been no Senate hearings on this measure. The chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee refers to hearings on abortion as a general \nsubject. But there have been no hearings on this particular and very \ndifficult topic. The bill before us was simply placed on the Senate \nCalendar.\n  Unfortunately, there has been a fair amount of misinformation \ncommunicated concerning the nature of the procedure being considered. \nThere has been little focus by the proponents of the bill on the risk \nto the health of women if this alternative is not available, the types \nof health problems that compel late-term abortions in the first place, \nand the important question of the constitutional implications of \nwithholding access to a procedure that may, in fact, be necessary to \nsave the life or preserve the health of a pregnant woman facing a \ntragic pregnancy.\n  Mr. President, let me stress that I have very grave reservations \nabout the wisdom of this body acting upon a measure that would insert \nthe Federal Government into the decisionmaking process of physicians as \nto what medical procedures are appropriate in a particular case.\n  In just this last Congress we had an extensive and heated debate over \nwhether Congress or the Federal Government ought to be designing a \nnational health care system. Yet today many of the very same \nindividuals who argued strenuously against the Federal Government's \nrole in health care policy are now urging that we literally legislate \nthe specific procedure that a doctor may choose in dealing with a very \ndifficult and painful pregnancy. I think the decision about abortion \nought to remain a private and personal decision between a woman and her \ndoctor.\n  I recognize that this is a tremendously divisive and emotional area. \nAnd I do respect the views of people on both sides of the issue. But, \nfundamentally, I do not think we should be substituting the judgment of \nMembers of Congress for the judgment of those directly involved, \nparticularly where issues of the life and health of the woman are at \nstake.\n  Late-term abortions under Roe versus Wade can be restricted to those \ncases where the woman's life or health are at stake. That means that \nthe procedures at issue take place in those most tragic circumstances \nwhere a pregnancy threatens a woman's life or health. For the Senate \ntoday to step into this area and legislate without even the benefit of \nhearings, where all sides of this issue can be heard, seems, to me, to \nbe irresponsible at a minimum.\n  It is particularly important that we exercise caution in this area \nthat is so emotionally charged. The proponents of this measure have \nmade assertions about the procedures at issue that have been \nstrenuously challenged by the opponents. And the opponents have raised \na number of serious issues about the circumstances under which \nalternative procedures will increase the risk to the woman's life or \nhealth. These are important questions that actually should be addressed \nbefore we vote. If the Senate decides to legislate in this area, it \ncertainly ought to do so only on the basis of a significant record \nwhich thoroughly explores these issues.\n  For example, Mr. President, we need to know what alternatives, if \nany, would be available to women who must have a late-term abortion. \nWhat are the increased risks for these alternative procedures for the \nsurvival of the woman or her future ability to bear children? Those are \njust a couple of the \n\n[[Page S 16799]]\nquestions that, at a minimum, must be asked before the Senate acts upon \nthis measure. It is also important that a record be developed which \nsets out the reason why late-term abortions are performed in the first \nplace. It is estimated we are talking about roughly 600 abortions per \nyear that take place under the most dire circumstances.\n  Now, some of the proponents of this legislation have distorted the \ndebate by asserting that the majority of late-term abortions are \nelective, misusing medical terminology to imply that the termination of \npregnancy at this stage is somehow by choice. In fact, these abortions \ntake place only when the life or health of the woman is at risk. We \nneed to be fully aware of the pain and suffering that is endured by \nthese families when a much-wanted pregnancy turns into a nightmare. We \nneed to be careful that the Federal Government does not make these \ntragic situations even more difficult and painful for these families.\n  Mr. President, let me also say that if the motion to commit this bill \nto the committee fails, I will support amendments to be offered that \nwill make it clear that this legislation is not to be construed to \nprohibit any physician from carrying out any medical procedure which \nthe physician in his or her medical judgment determines necessary to \npreserve the life or health of a woman.\n  At a minimum, no physician should be placed in a position where he \nmust sacrifice the life or health of his patient, because the Federal \nGovernment has chosen to substitute its judgment for professional \nmedical judgment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes 28 seconds.\n  Mr. SMITH. I will yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you.\n  Abortion is, and always has been, one of the most divisive moral \nissues of our day. It strikes at the very core of who we are as a \npeople and as a nation. It challenges us to define life and to measure \nliberty--difficult things both. But it is an issue that will not go \naway and so it demands of us civil debate and reasoned discourse. And \nso I rise to speak today in tempered tones about the untempered terror \nof partial-birth abortions.\n  Lest there be any confusion, what we are talking about is an abortion \nprocedure that allows a child to be partially removed from the mother's \nwomb only to have its skull crushed and brain extracted by a doctor \npledged to ``do no harm.''\n  What message do we send by allowing this slaughter of innocents to \ncontinue? What does it say about who we are? What does it say about the \nmoral condition of America when people of faith are unfaithful to the \nmost vulnerable among us? I would suggest that a nation that allow this \nmindless brutality to continue is a nation out of touch with the most \nbasic dictates of humanity.\n  The procedure in question is so cruel and so inhumane as to defy \nrational, reasoned support. Advocates of partial-birth abortions are \nattempting to defend the indefensible--and they cannot. So, instead, \nthey raise the specter of confusion, introduce rhetorical nonsense, and \nobfuscate with absurdity. We are almost tempted to forget that which we \nare debating. This amendment is not about the right of choice, it is \nabout the right of this Nation to act in a manner befitting its \nfounding. It is about the right of America to say that it will not \nallow the brutality of partial-birth abortions to continue.\n  Over 30 million lives have perished since Roe versus Wade became the \nlaw of the land. An almost incomprehensible number. I am pained to my \ncore by this tragedy and stand ready to reverse it. We can begin by \nputting an end to a medical procedure which takes an unborn child, one \nable to be sustained outside the womb, and kills it.\n  The question is simple: Do we want to continue to allow that \nprocedure or do we want to outlaw it? The American people clearly want \nthe latter. They overwhelmingly oppose this barbarism. They know to be \ntrue that which we are forced to debate. Namely, that this procedure \nhas no place in a civilized society.\n  A final point. There is a legitimate place for hearings. They can be \nimportant. They can be illustrative. They can be used for probing areas \nof uncertainty. Mr. President, there is no uncertainty here. We do not \nneed hearings to determine that partial-birth abortions are the \nmonstrous, barbaric, and hideous destruction of human life. We do not \nneed hearings to say, ``No more partial-birth abortions.''\n  The House of Representatives passed this measure last week with 288 \nvotes. Let us lend our voice to their cause. For our party must be \nabout more than a higher standard of living. It must also be about a \nhigher standard of character.\n  The task before us is a simple one. It is to reaffirm humanity, \nreject brutality, and ban partial-birth abortions.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Pennsylvania \nhas 8 minutes. The Senator from New Hampshire has 2 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, there have been requests from other \nSenators to speak in support of the motion. I remind my colleagues that \nif they choose to do so, we are in the last stage of the debate--it is \nnow 12:22--under a 3-hour time agreement, with the time having started \nat 9:30.\n  In the absence of any of my colleagues who choose to speak, I will \nmake a comment or two with respect to the issue on the life of the \nmother.\n  I tried to write down what the Senator from Missouri had said \ncontemporaneously with his statement when he said the issue of the life \nof a mother is nonsense, I believe he put it. I strenuously disagree \nwith him about that. The life of the mother has been a recognized \nexception to any prohibition on abortion of all time, and the current \nlegislation does not provide for an exception for the life of a mother.\n  There is a major difference between having an affirmative defense and \nbetween having an exception. The customary language that is used in the \nappropriations bill was cited earlier and illustrated by Public Law \n103-333, September 30, 1994, where there is an exception. The language \nis plain:\n\n       None of the funds appropriated under this act shall be \n     expended for any abortion except--\n\n  And then irrelevant language, but commenting on any abortion except--\n\n       . . . that procedure is necessary to save the life of a \n     mother.\n\n  In the pending legislation, there is no such exception. There is a \nprovision only for an affirmative defense so that the criminal \nprosecution can be brought against the doctor under this statute, \nbecause there is no exception for the life of a mother.\n  After the criminal prosecution is brought, then it is a matter of \naffirmative defense which has to be proved by the defendant doctor as \nopposed to having an exception in the statute.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes twenty seconds. The Senator from \nNew Hampshire has 2 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in the absence of any other Senator \nseeking recognition, permit me to summarize briefly, and I yield myself \n2 minutes, reserving the remainder of the time for others.\n  What we have here is a bill which has been placed on the calendar in \nan unusual way. Until relatively recently, the provisions of rule XXV \nof the Senate require a referral to committee. That has been changed by \nan interpretation of rule XIV, but I question the propriety and \nespecially the wisdom of having this matter proceed without having a \nhearing.\n  In the House of Representatives, the bill was introduced on June 14 \nand one day later, there was a hearing, and on the same day there was a \nmarkup. Very limited testimony was presented.\n  The House was then engaged virtually continuously on the budget \nmatters, except for the August recess. They took the matter up on \nNovember 1, and they passed the bill. Then it came to the Senate, and \nnow we are on November 8, just 7 days later, when action is requested \non this bill without any hearing in the Judiciary Committee. \n\n[[Page S 16800]]\n\n  I have made a motion for referral to committee on a very limited \nbasis, really for 9 days, between today, November 8, and November 10 \nwhen the Senate is scheduled to go out of session, and then the \nextended time over the recess for 10 more days, from November 17 until \nNovember 27.\n  There are very important considerations which we need to inquire into \non humanitarian grounds. The question has been raised of anesthetic, \nwhich has to be fairly taken up, a very substantial controversy on the \nmedical evidence, complex issues on medical procedures, as well as the \nhumanitarian concept, and then the formulation of the law itself, since \nthis statute can be circumvented in a number of ways on medical \nprocedures through C section or otherwise.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes thirty seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes twenty-five seconds.\n  Mr. SMITH. I yield the remainder of my time to the only physician in \nthe U.S. Senate, Dr. Frist.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the partial-\nbirth abortion ban and against the motion to refer this bill to \ncommittee. I have had the opportunity over the last several weeks to \nconsult with a number of my colleagues in obstetrics and gynecology, \nand with those at academic health care centers and tertiary health care \ncenters who would most likely be faced with performing this procedure. \nAnd I can say after these consultations that I know of no doctor who \nuses or approves of this procedure as described in this bill.\n  Among these colleagues that I contacted are people who perform \nabortions in the third trimester under very selected circumstances, and \nthey have told me that they condemn this procedure. They tell me that \nit is an unnecessary procedure and has no place in the medical \narmamentarium.\n  Mr. President, it is understandable that over the last 2 days a \nnumber of people have expressed concern for the life of the mother. But \nthis bill provides for the mother. It only requires a doctor to show \nthat he or she reasonably believed that this procedure was necessary to \nsave the mother's life. I will repeat, this bill does not endanger the \nlife of a mother in any way.\n  I do not want new laws. As a physician, I can tell you that \nphysicians do not want new laws dictating their practice in any way. No \nphysician does. But this procedure is so brutal, so uncalled for, so \ninhumane, and so unnecessary that this ban is justified.\n  We have broad bipartisan support for this bill, both pro-life and \npro-choice, and I think that shows this is an important issue that goes \nbeyond the debates of pro-life and pro-choice. We have that support \nbecause the partial-birth abortion procedure, as described specifically \nin the bill, deeply offends our sensibilities as human beings, and as \npeople who care for one another and feel people deserve to be treated \nwith respect, dignity, and compassion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nmay ask for additional time with consent.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 1 minute.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object. I \nwant to make sure that I can ask my friend a question before he gets \nthe additional minute. I ask unanimous consent to make it a 2-minute \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, he said he talked to a lot of \ndoctors--gynecologists and obstetricians. Is he aware that the American \nCollege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has written a letter to \nSenator Dole objecting very strenuously to this bill?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes, he is.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this procedure, as described, is a brutal \nprocedure. It is a procedure that I consider inhumane, as do a number \nof people, including obstetricians. I just got off the telephone with \none who, again, performs abortions in that third trimester. He told me, \npoint blank, that ``it is unnecessary.''\n  Those of us who oppose this procedure do care deeply about women, \nabout their health care, and about the horrific circumstances and \nsituations they face. But how can we answer to our children, to our \npatients, to our constituents, and to others if we continue to allow \nbabies to be aborted through this unnecessarily brutal partial-birth \nprocedure?\n  Mr. President, it is with compassion, but with steadfast resolve, \nthat I register my support for the partial-birth abortion ban.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 2 minutes 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I express my very high regard for the \ndistinguished Senator from Tennessee, who is our only doctor in the \nSenate. I can understand the consultations which he has had, but I \nemphasize as forcefully as I can that consultations that anyone has are \nnot the same as having hearings. The Senate has had no hearing on this \nmatter. The House had only one limited hearing, and the pending motion \nis a very limited one, for 9 working days in the Senate, from today, \nNovember 8, until November 17, including the weekend and then the \nrecess period. I think the comprehensive answer to the submission by \nSenator Frist is from the American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists, who wrote to Senator Dole on November 6.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          The American College of,\n\n\n                              Obstetricians and Gynecologists,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 6, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert Dole,\n     Majority Leader,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Dole: The American College of \n     Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), an organization \n     representing more than 35,000 physicians dedicated to \n     improving women's health care, does not support HR 1833, the \n     Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1995. The College finds \n     very disturbing that Congress would take any action that \n     would supersede the medical judgment of trained physicians \n     and criminalize medical procedures that may be necessary to \n     save the life of a woman. Moreover, in defining what medical \n     procedures doctors may or may not perform, HR 1833 employs \n     terminology that is not even recognized in the medical \n     community--demonstrating why Congressional opinion should \n     never be substituted for professional medical judgment.\n       Thank you for considering our views on this important \n     matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Ralph W. Hale, MD,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the opinion \nof the U.S. Department of Justice that the pending legislation is \nunconstitutional be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 7, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert Dole,\n     Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: This letter represents the Department's \n     views on H.R. 1833, a bill that would ban what it calls \n     ``partial-birth abortions.'' This legislation violates \n     constitutional standards recently reaffirmed by the Supreme \n     Court. Most significantly, the bill fails to make an adequate \n     exception for preservation of a woman's health. Even in the \n     post-viability period, when the government's interest in \n     regulating abortion is at its weightiest, that interest must \n     yield both to preservation of a woman's life and to \n     preservation of a woman's health. Planned Parenthood v. \n     Casey, 112 S. Ct. 2791, 2804, 2821 (1992). This means, first \n     of all, that the government may not deny access to abortion \n     to a woman whose life or health is threatened by pregnancy. \n     Id. It also means that the government may not regulate access \n     to abortion in a manner that effectively ``require[s] the \n     mother to bear in increased medical risk'' in order to serve \n     a state interest. Thornburgh v. American College of \n     Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U.S. 747, 769 (1986) \n     (invalidating restriction on doctor's choice of abortion \n     procedure because could result in increased risk to woman's \n     health). That is, the government may not enforce regulations \n     that make the make the abortion procedure more dangerous to \n     the woman's health. Id,; see also Planned Parenthood of \n     Missouri v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 79 (1976) (invalidating \n     ban on abortion procedure after first trimester in part \n     because would force ``a woman and her physician to terminate \n     her pregnancy by methods more dangerous to her health than \n     the method outlawed'').\n       If Congress were to ban this method of abortion, it appears \n     that ``in large fraction \n\n[[Page S 16801]]\n     of the cases'' in which the ban would be relevant at all, see Casey 112 \n     S. Ct. at 2830 (discussing method of constitutional analysis \n     of abortion restrictions), its operation would be \n     inconsistent with this constitutional standard. It has been \n     reported that doctors performing this procedure believe it \n     often poses fewer medical risks for women in the late stages \n     of pregnancy.\\1\\ If this is true, then it is likely that \n     in a ``large fraction'' of the very cases in which the \n     procedure actually is used, it is the technique most \n     protective of the woman's health. Accordingly, a \n     prohibition on the method, in the absence of an adequate \n     exception covering such cases, impermissibly would require \n     women to ``bear an increased medical risk'' in order to \n     obtain an abortion.\n     \\1\\ See Hearings on H.R. 1833 Before the Subcomm. on the \n     Constitution of the House Judiciary Comm. (June 23, 1995) \n     (statement of James T. McMahon, M.D., Medical Director, Eve \n     Surgical Centers) (procedure shown to be safest surgical \n     alternative late in pregnancy); id. (June 15, 1995) \n     (statement of J. Cortland Robinson, M.D., M.P.H.) (same); see \n     also Tamar Lewin, Wider Impact is Foreseen for Bill to Ban \n     Type of Abortion, The New York Times, November 6, 1995, at \n     B7; Diane M. Gianelli, Shock-Tactic Ads Target Late-Term \n     Abortion Procedure, American Medical News, July 5, 1993, at \n     3; Karen Hosler, Rare Abortion Method Is New Weapon in \n     Debate, Baltimore Sun, June 17, 1995, at 2A.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       H.R. 1833 would provide for an affirmative defense to \n     criminal prosecution or civil claims when a partial-birth \n     abortion is both (a) necessary to save the life of the woman, \n     and (b) the only method of abortion that would serve that \n     purpose. This provision will not cure the bill's \n     constitutional defects. First, as discussed above, the \n     provision is too narrow in scope, as it fails to reach cases \n     in which a woman's health is at issue. Second, the provision \n     does not actually except even life-threatening pregnancies \n     from the statutory bar. Cf. Casey, 112 S. Ct. at 2804 (even \n     in post-viability period, abortion restrictions must \n     ``contain [] exceptions for pregnancies which endanger a \n     woman's life or health''). Instead, the provision would \n     require a physician facing criminal charges to carry the \n     burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, both \n     that pregnancy threatened the life of the woman and that the \n     method in question was the only one that could save the \n     woman's life. By exposing physicians to the risk of criminal \n     sanction regardless of the circumstances under which they \n     perform the outlawed procedure, the statute undoubtedly would \n     have a chilling effect on physicians' willingness to perform \n     even those abortions necessary to save women's lives.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Andrew Fois,\n                                       Assistant Attorney General.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on a matter of this enormous import, \nwhere we are talking about the meaning of life, as articulated by the \nSenator from Indiana earlier, we ought to have a hearing in a limited \nperiod of time.

This is \na matter which could have been brought to the floor at any earlier \ntime, and certainly for the world's greatest deliberative body, it is \nnot asking too much to have a very brief period of time--some 19 days--\nfor the Judiciary Committee to hold hearings, report this matter back, \nand then the Senate could express its will in accordance with Senate \nprocedures.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss existing and \nemerging air service opportunities on the European Continent for U.S. \npassenger and cargo carriers. These opportunities include not only \nserving destinations within Europe, but also points beyond such as the \nMiddle East and Asia-Pacific markets. As the British continue to refuse \nto open their skies to our carriers, developments in other countries \nrepresent alternatives that are increasingly attractive and are taking \non greater significance.\n  Unfortunately, recent negotiations with the United Kingdom seeking to \nliberalize our air service relationship with that country have hit an \nimpasse. At this time, it is unclear whether that impasse is \ninsurmountable. As is often the case with the British, the primary \nsticking point is our request for greater access to London Heathrow \nAirport, the main hub of British Airways. Access to Heathrow is \nparticularly important to our carriers since it is an international \ngateway airport offering connecting service opportunities beyond the \nUnited Kingdom to markets virtually worldwide.\n  Another key and often overlooked area of disagreement is our request \nfor full liberalization of air cargo services between and, importantly, \nbeyond our two countries. Currently, the ability of our cargo carriers \nto serve the United Kingdom, load additional freight there, and fly on \nto other countries is severely limited by the United States-United \nKingdom bilateral aviation agreement. British negotiators continue to \nreject our requests for fully liberalized air cargo opportunities, \ndespite a March 1994 recommendation by the House of Commons Transport \nCommittee to that effect. What does all this mean?\n  The answer to that question is contained in the insights of one \naviation authority who wrote recently ``[a]irlines and passengers are \nfree agents. If extra capacity is not developed at Heathrow, the \nairport will not be able to satisfy demand and airlines will expand \ntheir business at continental airports.'' The author added ``if \nairlines are denied the opportunity to grow at Heathrow, many will \nchoose Paris, Frankfurt, or Amsterdam.''\n  Mr. President, this is not rhetoric. It is not a threat by U.S. \ninterests designed to gain negotiating leverage. To the contrary, the \nauthor of these quotes is BAA plc, the British company that owns and \noperates Heathrow as well as other United Kingdom airports. BAA is very \nperceptive. Obviously, BAA recognizes that in today's global economy \nthe long-term consequence of protecting one's air service market \namounts to little more than the stimulation of competitive \nopportunities elsewhere. One need only look across the English Channel \nto continental Europe to confirm that already is taking place.\n  There was a time when geographic factors and the limited range of \ncommercial aircraft made the United Kingdom the international gateway \nof necessity for United States carriers serving Europe and beyond. \nTimes have changed. New generation long-range aircraft have made the \noption of overflying the United Kingdom viable from both an operational \nand economic standpoint. Simply put, if the British do not want the \nbusiness of our air carriers, United States carriers can and will look \nto the European Continent for new gateway airport opportunities. Today, \nI wish to discuss a few of these existing, emerging, and potential air \nservice opportunities.\n  First, there is tremendous growth in international passenger traffic \nat Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport. This is \n\n[[Page S 16802]]\ndue, in large part, to the successful alliance between Northwest \nAirlines and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, and clearly demonstrates BAA's \nprediction already is coming to pass. How did it happen? Recognizing \nthe significant mutual benefits that result from free trade among \nnations, in 1992 the Netherlands signed an open-skies agreement with \nthe United States. That agreement permits the marketplace, not \nGovernment restrictions, to determine air service between the two \ncountries. The results speak very loudly.\n  Between 1992 and 1994, total passenger traffic between the United \nStates and the Netherlands grew an astounding 56 percent while total \npassenger traffic between the United States and the United Kingdom grew \njust 7.5 percent. In 1992, 18.6 million international passengers \narrived and departed from Schiphol. By 1994, that number grew to 22.9 \nmillion passengers--an increase of more than 23 percent. It is \nanticipated this growth will continue with nearly 28 million \ninternational passengers using Schiphol by 2000. What does this \nillustrate? Among other things, it clearly demonstrates Schiphol is \ndrawing passenger traffic originating in the United States away from \nUnited Kingdom airports, particularly Heathrow.\n  Cargo opportunities also are booming at Schiphol. In 1992, nearly \n725,000 metric tons of international cargo were loaded and unloaded at \nthe airport. By 1994, that number grew to 838,127 metric tons, an \nincrease of nearly 12 percent. By the year 2000, it is estimated 1.2 \nmillion metric tons of international air cargo will pass through \nSchiphol.\n  Consistent with that forward-looking view of aviation relations, the \nDutch also have in place a long-term airport growth plan to enable \nSchiphol to accommodate the rapidly expanding traffic the United \nStates-Netherlands open skies has spurred. The goal is no less than \nmaking Schiphol one of the major European hubs for intercontinental \npassenger and cargo traffic. By the year 2015, that plan calls for \nSchiphol to have the capacity to serve up to approximately 56 million \npassengers and 4 million metric tons of cargo annually.\n  Mr. President, the Dutch clearly want the business of United States \ncarriers. Based on the growth of international passenger and cargo \ntraffic at Schiphol, it is clear U.S. carriers are responding to this \nmessage.\n  Second, our recently completed nine-nation European open-skies \ninitiative should stimulate additional new continental gateway airport \nopportunities. The nine European countries with which the United States \nrecently signed open-skies agreements are Austria, Belgium, Denmark, \nFinland, Iceland, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland.\n  Brussels Zaventem Airport illustrates my point well. Even before the \nUnited States-Belgium open-skies agreement was signed a few months ago, \ninternational passenger and cargo growth at Brussels Airport was \nimpressive. For instance, between 1993 and 1994 international passenger \ntraffic grew to more than 11 million, a 12-percent increase. During the \nsame period, international freight passing through Brussels Airport \nrose a remarkable 24 percent to more than 380,568 metric tons.\n  No question, Brussels Airport is emerging as an important European \ngateway airport for intercontinental traffic. The recent open-skies \nagreement should cause existing growth to accelerate. To ensure this \ncomes to pass, the Belgians recently expanded Brussels Airport to put \nit in a position to fully capitalize on new service opportunities. \nEarlier this year, a new terminal opened at Brussels Airport which has \nmore than doubled the airport's capacity from 10.5 to 21 million \npassengers annually. This terminal expansion initiative, coupled with \nsignificant runway capacity, will make Brussels very attractive to U.S. \ncarriers.\n  Indeed, a number of U.S. passenger carriers already provide nonstop \nservice from the United States to Brussels. Delta Air Lines, through \nits code-sharing alliance with the Belgian national carrier Sabena, \nalso provides nonstop service from key United States gateway cities \nincluding New York, Boston, and Chicago.\n  One clear indication the United States-Belgium open-skies agreement \nwill be a catalyst for increased transatlantic service from the United \nStates to Belgium appeared in a recently filed application by Delta \nseeking antitrust immunity for its alliances with Sabena as well as \nSwissair and Austrian Airlines. In that filing, Delta indicated it \nplans no less than to use the Delta-Sabena alliance to make Brussels \nAirport one of a multihub network in continental Europe. No wonder, \nBrussels Airport is regarded as Europe's only true hub-and-spoke \noperation.\n  Third, a potentially tremendous opportunity for United States \ncarriers may soon emerge in Germany. The United States and Germany \ncommenced air service negotiations in July which I very much hope will \nresult in an open-skies agreement. It is my understanding those talks \nare progressing well.\n  What would an open-skies agreement with Germany mean for United \nStates carriers? In short, it would mean significant new air service \nopportunities for our carriers between the United States and Germany. \nEqually important, German airports would provide well-situated gateway \nopportunities for our carriers to serve points beyond Germany such as \nthe booming Asia-Pacific market.\n  One such opportunity is the airport in Frankfurt which already is \nbeing used by some U.S. carriers as an alternative to Heathrow. \nFrankfurt-Main Airport's ideal location in Europe already has fueled \ntremendous growth for that facility. As a matter of fact, it already \nranks as the second busiest airport in Europe next to Heathrow. Last \nyear, for instance, 27.6 million international passengers passed \nthrough Frankfurt as well as more than 1.2 million metric tons of air \nfreight. Each total represented nearly a 10-percent increase over 1993 \ntraffic levels.\n  Frankfurt Airport is not resting on its laurels. In fact, the Germans \nhave ambitious plans to ensure Frankfurt Airport can meet rapidly \nexpanding demand. Last year, a new terminal complex was completed which \nenables the airport to handle an additional 12 million passengers \nannually. In addition, the runways at Frankfurt Airport already have \nthe capacity to handle nearly as many aircraft movements per hour as \nthose at Heathrow.\n  By the year 2010, forecasts indicate Frankfurt Airport will handle \napproximately 53 million passengers. As far as air cargo is concerned, \nnew freight facilities are expected to more than double air cargo \npassing through Frankfurt from its current level of 1.2 million metric \ntons. Unquestionably--particularly under an open-skies regime--\nFrankfurt represents an attractive option for U.S. carriers who are \nfrustrated by their inability to gain or expand access at Heathrow.\n  There also are other important air service opportunities elsewhere in \nGermany. Last year, 8.3 million international passengers passed through \nthe airport in Munich. Plans by Lufthansa to make Munich its second \nlargest hub, including using it as a gateway for some Asia-Pacific \nservice, should spur additional international passenger growth at the \nairport. An additional option is Dusseldorf's Rhine-Ruhr Airport which \nlast year served 10.3 million international passengers.\n  A United States-Germany open-skies agreement undoubtedly will foster \nadditional growth in the number of international passengers using the \nairports in Frankfurt, Munich, and Dusseldorf. Also, it could \naccelerate construction of a planned new airport in Berlin. The new \nBerlin-Brandenburg airport would offer yet another gateway opportunity \nfor U.S. carriers.\n  Mr. President, as I have said on other occasions in statements to \nthis body, we must continue pressing for a liberalized air service \nagreement with the United Kingdom. We owe that to consumers on both \nsides of the Atlantic who unquestionably would be the biggest winners \nif such an agreement were reached.\n  Concurrently, however, I believe we should intensify our efforts to \nsecure an open skies agreement with Germany. In combination with \nexisting and emerging opportunities for United States carriers in \ncontinental Europe, such an agreement would put tremendous competitive \npressure on the British to open Heathrow to United States carriers. \nMoreover, if the British doubt that the restrictive United States-\nUnited Kingdom bilateral agreement is forcing United States carriers to \n\n\n[[Page S 16803]]\noverfly the United Kingdom to European continental airports, an open-\nskies agreement with Germany that furthers the exodus of United States \nflights to the continent would dramatically make this point. If Britain \ndoes not want our business, clearly there are other nations who do.\n  Mr. President, may I proceed for 2 more minutes on the same subject?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  No objection is heard. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized for 2 additional minutes.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, to summarize what I have said, as a \nchairman of the Commerce Committee and a member of the Aviation \nSubcommittee, I am very eager to see us move forward on efforts to \nliberalize our bilateral aviation agreement with the United Kingdom. I \nam very concerned about the problem of access to Heathrow and resulting \nlimitations on the ability of our carriers to serve markets beyond the \nUnited Kingdom. Also, I am disturbed by British restrictions on the \nbeyond rights of our cargo carriers. Similarly, I am also concerned \nabout attempts by the Government of Japan to prevent our carriers from \nfully participating in the booming Asia-Pacific market beyond Tokyo.\n  Very frankly, what these countries try to do is they have a system to \nblock out U.S. passenger and cargo carriers as well as to prevent our \ncarriers from serving beyond markets. I believe we should put the \nemphasis on jumping over Heathrow if the British are unwilling to \ncooperate by opening their skies to United States carriers. I have \nurged our Secretary of Transportation, Secretary Pena, who I think does \na good job in international aviation negotiations, to treat \ninternational aviation as a trade issue and to focus on maximizing \neconomic benefits for our country. I understand this is very difficult \nfor Secretary Pena to do since each time he attempts to follow this \ncourse, a group of Senators and Representatives who represent a certain \nairline criticize what he is doing. We have to support our Secretary of \nTransportation when he is trying to negotiate these difficult \nagreements. We need to put the interests of the U.S. economy first.\n  The situation with the British is very frustrating and unacceptable. \nBritain is dragging its feet on liberalizing our air service agreement. \nThey are stalling. I think we should make it very clear to the British \nif they continue to severely restrict opportunities for our carriers to \nserve the United Kingdom and points beyond, United States passenger and \ncargo carriers will turn to Germany and Amsterdam and other points in \nEurope. I would hope that continued progress in liberalizing our \naviation relations with countries in continental Europe, and the \ncontinued exodus of United States carriers to capitalize on these \nopportunities, will drive home this point. Simply put, our carriers are \nnot being treated fairly by the British. Unfortunately, the same is \ntrue in Japan where the Government of Japan is trying to prevent our \ncarriers from fully participating in the rapidly expanding Asia-Pacific \nmarket.\n  I hope our Secretary of Transportation stands firm with the British \nand the Japanese. I support him, and I urge the Members of this body to \ndo so. He is doing a good job in international aviation matters under \ndifficult circumstances.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to \ncontinue as in morning business, not in reference to the pending \nbusiness, but another matter, with the understanding that, if there is \nsomeone seeking recognition not under the same standard, then we return \nto a quorum call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/08/senate-section/article/S16801-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16803-S16804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO YITZHAK RABIN\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, my wife and I were in California visiting \nmy youngest son and his wife this past weekend. After what had been a \nvery pleasant day out hiking and walking about, we came back to their \nhome, and there were a series of messages for me from the White House \nand my chief of staff. I called back and heard the terrible news about \nYitzhak Rabin. I was also asked if it would be possible to make the \nconnection back to Washington in time to accompany the President and \nthe others to Israel.\n  Mr. President, like so many millions of people, I turned to the radio \nand the television in disbelief. I hoped, even though the first news \nwas so discouraging, that somehow he had survived the assassin's \nbullet. It seemed inconceivable that an old soldier who had survived so \nmuch, who had risked his life so many times, could be struck down this \nway, following a rally for peace.\n  Those unable to attend the ceremony in Jerusalem watched it and wept. \nFor all the reasons said so eloquently by so many people--and I think \nof our own President, President Clinton, Jordan's King Hussein, the man \nwho had a close personal relationship, one based on trust and respect, \nwith Prime Minister Rabin, and Egypt's President Mubarak, and perhaps \nmost of all Prime Minister Rabin's granddaughter Noa. We listened to \nthem and know we will not forget Yitzhak Rabin.\n  Prime Minister Rabin was a man of great courage, of great vision, of \ngreat warmth, and, above all, great love for his country. In fact, for \nme it is almost impossible to think of Israel without thinking of him. \nMy heart's hopes go out, not only to his family, but to Shimon Peres, \nwho now takes on the awesome duties of Prime Minister at such a \ndifficult time. To him I offer my support with the deep respect he \nknows I feel for him.\n  In remembering Prime Minister Rabin, it was his undying love for \nIsrael, his absolute commitment to Israel's survival, that enabled him \nto change course, to choose the path of peace in his final years. It \nwas a choice and a challenge for all of us, but especially the people \nof the Middle East. It was a choice that was embraced by a majority of \nIsraelis and Palestinians. It was spurned only by those too blinded by \nhate to see the historic opportunity that Yitzhak Rabin had seized.\n  Like so many others in the Senate, I was fortunate to know Yitzhak \nRabin, for nearly a generation. I am going to miss him very, very much. \nI will miss that great and wonderful voice, and his strength and his \nwisdom which you could feel just standing next to him.\n  I had the privilege to accompany President Clinton to Aqabah last \nOctober, a year ago, for the signing of the Israeli-Jordanian peace \nagreement. I remember standing there in 110 degree heat, the wind \nblowing across the desert, as I listened to those two soldiers, Yitzhak \nRabin and King Hussein, men who had fought against each other but who \nnow stood with voices filled with emotion speaking of the need for \npeace.\n  I knew from my private conversations both with Prime Minister Rabin \nand with King Hussein that these were men who could rely totally and \nutterly on each other's words, on each other's commitment, on each \nother's integrity and on each other's ability for leadership. And when \nthe ceremony ended and the grandchildren of those who had fallen in the \nwar, Jordanians and Israelis, came and presented flowers to the \nleaders, you knew that it was the leadership of Yitzhak Rabin and those \nwho joined with him made that moment possible.\n  Israel and the world have suffered a terrible and irreplaceable loss. \nWe all remember the immeasurable loss after the assassination of \nPresident John Kennedy. I was not old enough to vote for President \nKennedy. I was a student here in Washington when he died. And like \neverybody else who was old enough to know that day, I remember \nprecisely where I was, exactly what I was doing, and the emotions I had \nat the time. And like so many other Americans, I wondered how we might \ngo on.\n  I know that there are those same feelings in the minds of people in \nIsrael today. But I do not fear for Israel because we can find hope in \nthe outpouring of love and respect for Yitzhak Rabin's memory by Jews, \nby Arabs, by people of all faiths around the world, because more than \nanything, it was Yitzhak Rabin's commitment to peace that inspired that \noutpouring of love and respect. So many generations have yearned for \nit, but it was Yitzhak Rabin who defied the prejudice, hatred, and \nviolence of the past to make it possible for us to believe that peace \nis possible in the Middle East. That was the message of the handshake \non the White House lawn. It is our challenge and our \n\n[[Page S 16804]]\nduty to complete Prime Minister Rabin's vision.\n\n  The Congress can be a potent force for peace. Too often we have seen \nsome Members of Congress make fervent speeches and sponsor amendments \nthat may have won points with constituencies here or at home but \nactually serve to sow divisiveness and undermine progress toward peace \nin the Middle East.\n  Just as Prime Minister Rabin pleaded so passionately at the White \nHouse for an end to blood and tears, let us put an end to partisan \npolitical maneuvering on a subject so important and fragile as peace in \nthe Middle East. Let us stop conceiving of ways to legislate obstacles \nto the very policies of those who are risking their lives for peace. \nLet us remind ourselves that even though we might get some short-term \npolitical gain by trifling legislatively with the peace process in the \nMiddle East, we do it here in the safety of this Chamber, we do it in \nthe safety of our home States, but it is the lives and the aspirations \nand the hopes and the dreams of the people in the Middle East who are \naffected. Let us put an end to these political games and wholeheartedly \nsupport peace in the Middle East.\n  Let us do that for the memory of Yitzhak Rabin. Let us be united in \ncontinuing his legacy. Let each of us join the millions of Israelis who \nput their faith in him to prove the enemies of peace wrong. Let us \nlisten to the words of Leah Rabin, his wife of so many decades, that \nwonderful woman who calls on us to unite in support of peace.\n  Mr. President, it was only a couple of weeks ago, here in this \nbuilding, that I and Leah Gluskoter of my office last spoke with Prime \nMinister Rabin. I remember him coming over and putting his arm around \nme and we chatted as the friends I was proud we had become.\n  We talked a little bit about a longer conversation we had a couple of \nweeks before. In that conversation, he had thanked me for something I \nhad been able to do for him that he felt helped the peace process. He \nsaid I had taken some political risks. I said, ``Mr. Prime Minister, \nyou are the one who takes the real political risk. You risk your \npolitical life every day.'' I paused and I said, ``No, you risk your \nlife, your actual life every day.''\n  In that deep and wonderful voice, he responded he did not worry about \nthat. He really did not fear for his life. He only feared for the \ncontinuation of the peace process. This is a man whose own political \nlife, his own future, his own actual life was secondary to what he was \ntrying to accomplish.\n  I told him in that conversation that I felt when the history of this \ncentury is written, there will be a handful of people who will stand \nout as true peacemakers of this century, and he will be among them. He \nwill be one of the most noted, certainly, of my lifetime.\n  Now he is gone, and it is our job to go forward. Let me say again \nthat we can give the greatest respect to Yitzhak Rabin's memory by \nsupporting those who believe, as he did, that Israel and its Arab \nneighbors have seen enough of hatred, of occupation, of bloodshed, and \nthat there is another way. The other way is the peace process he began \nand which will now be carried on by acting Prime Minister Shimon Peres. \nOur country remains a partner with Israelis and Arabs in this effort. \nLet us go forward in the memory of a great man who gave his life for \nit.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a vote on the \npending question occur on the motion to commit at 3:30 this afternoon, \nand that the time divided between now and then be equally divided in \nthe usual form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, at this time, I will say for my colleagues \nthat Senator Specter is en route to the floor.\n  At this point, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and ask unanimous \nconsent that the time be equally divided between the two sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, so much has already been said about the \npending legislation, but, prior to the vote, I want to very briefly \narticulate my position and urge my colleagues to express themselves in \nthe vote at 3:30 in opposition to the legislation as currently drafted \nand in support of the Specter motion to refer the bill to Judiciary and \nreport back in 19 days.\n  I say that for a couple of very important reasons. First of all, \nthere are extraordinarily complex issues surrounding this medical \nprocedure that ought to be explored through the normal hearing process.\n  There are medical issues. There is the need to hear from physicians \nand others on the ramifications of a strict ban on late-term abortions. \nThis is an emergency medical procedure reserved for cases where the \nlife and health of the mother could be endangered or where severe fetal \nabnormalities are a major factor in the decision made by a woman and \nher physician. Whether or not we can delineate very clearly and \nlegislatively when a doctor should and should not perform that very \ndifficult procedure is something that ought to be explored in ways \nother than those we have employed so far on the Senate floor. So, \nclearly there are medical issues that this debate simply does not allow \nus to discuss and consider adequately prior to making a fundamental \ndecision about the legality or justifiability of this procedure in \nvarious cases.\n  Second, there are constitutional issues. As the distinguished Senator \nfrom California and others have laid out very clearly, this is a \nchallenge to the fundamental decision made in Roe versus Wade. \nDecisions relating to whether or not States ought to have the ability \nto restrict late-term abortions in cases where the life and health of \nthe mother is endangered--that, to me, is a question that ought to be \npursued much more carefully, much more deliberately, much more clearly \nthan we have done in the debate in the last couple of days.\n  Finally, there are legal issues. This bill would criminalize a \nmedical procedure for the first time. There ought not be any mistake \nabout that. It would be an unprecedented intrusion by Congress into the \npractice of medicine. If a doctor is convinced it is an emergency \nprocedure needed to save the life of the mother, he can use that \naffirmative defense only in the context of a criminal prosecution. \nShould doctors be prosecuted for saving a woman's life? I do not think \nso. In an emergency situation, do we want doctors hesitating to perform \nlife-saving measures because they fear they will face criminal \nprosecution for doing so? I do not think we ought to put any doctor, or \nany woman, in that position.\n  So there clearly are situations here where we owe it to doctors, we \nowe it to mothers, we owe it to women, we owe it to the American \npeople, to explore far more carefully than we have so far the far-\nreaching implications of this legislation. So, for those reasons if \nnothing else, this legislation ought to be referred to the committee \nfor very, very careful consideration.\n  Second, Madam President, if the procedure is being abused, then we \nshould consider restricting it. But it is unclear that it is being \nabused. There is a lot of confusion and misinformation about this \nprocedure. We need hearings to clarify whether or not abuse has ever \nbeen documented and, if so, how best to stop it.\n  There have been no hearings in the Senate and only one hearing in the \nHouse. Without having had the opportunity to listen to one expert, \nevery Senator in this Chamber is being asked \n\n[[Page S 16805]]\nto make a decision that I do not think they are prepared to make. I am \nnot prepared to make it.\n  I doubt that anyone, regardless of whether they have read the record \nor not, is capable of deciding today whether in these extraordinary \ncircumstances a woman is going to be protected from life-threatening \ncircumstances, a doctor is going to be protected from criminal \nprosecution for saving a life, and the rights of all Americans are \ngoing to be considered.\n\n  So let us let the experts give us their guidance. Let us make a \nconsidered decision, not a rush to judgment.\n  The motion to refer to the Judiciary Committee is completely \nreasonable. But if the facts show that restrictions are necessary, we \ncan base our actions on those facts at that time. Let us take time to \nget the facts and consider the implications.\n  All we are asking is for the bill to be considered in the next 19 \ndays. Is that too much to ask? Is it too much to ask to give the Senate \n19 days to consider this issue more carefully, to bring in the experts, \nto look at each one of these concerns, and make a decision? There is \nnothing wrong--in fact, there is everything right--with delaying our \ndecision to make sure we get it right.\n  That is what this vote is all about at 3:30. That is why it is so \nimportant that the majority of Members of this body now support the \nSpecter motion. And that is why I strongly support it this afternoon.\n  With that, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two and one-half minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH. As I said yesterday, this bill is a straightforward and \nmuch needed remedy to a procedure that deserves to be condemned. \nSenator Dole and I believe, as many of my colleagues do, that this \nprocedure cannot be defended on its merits. But as I understand it, \nopponents of this bill are arguing that they need a hearing in \ncommittee to explore the issues involved here.\n  Senator Dole and I have discussed this. While neither one of us think \nthis is necessary, we do think it may not be a bad idea in that the \nmore one learns about this horrible procedure the harder it is to \ndefend it. So our view is that we are willing to be fair. Let us go \nahead and hold a hearing. After that, this bill will return to the \ncalendar in 19 days, and we can consider it again.\n  Senator Dole and I hope to take the bill up again, and I hope that \nthe opponents of this bill will be as fair to us as we are being to \nthem. And, when the time comes, I hope they will allow us to have an \nup-or-down vote on the merits and not engage in procedural tactics \ndesigned to kill this important bill.\n  So with that, Madam President, in behalf of Senator Dole and myself, \nwe are asking our colleagues to support the Specter amendment.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask for a couple of minutes of leader \ntime to respond to the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire.\n  I am very pleased with this announcement. This comes as somewhat of a \nsurprise. But I think it confirms what we have said--that, obviously, \nhaving the opportunity to listen more carefully to the experts, to \nconsider more carefully the ramifications of something that is \ncertainly in everyone's best interests, there is an acknowledgment of \nthat on both sides of the aisle.\n  I expect now a unanimous vote. I want to thank him, thank the \nmajority leader, and thank those, including the distinguished Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania and the Senator from California, for their work on \nthis effort in the last couple of days.\n  I yield to the distinguished Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. SMITH. Parliamentary inquiry. How much time is remaining?\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate minority leader has minority leader \ntime.\n  Mr. SMITH. Did the minority leader yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the distinguished Democratic leader for yielding. \nI thank my friend from New Hampshire. I think what happened as a result \nof this is we avoided a very, very difficult split in this Senate, a \nsplit that really was not along party lines at all.\n  I think this is a wise decision. I think with a hearing in the \nJudiciary Committee, which is really equally divided on this issue, \nwhich is important, every side would be heard. Physicians who deal with \nthis will come forward and testify to this; nurses; families who have \ngone through the tragedy; and then all of us can make a far more \nreasoned judgment.\n  I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter], for his \nextraordinarily courageous leadership on this issue. I think the way he \nhandled debate was exemplary. I also want to say to my friend from New \nHampshire, we are friends, and we were never disagreeable. We just \ndisagreed. This is, I think, a good thing for the Senate.\n  I thank again the Democratic leader for yielding me this time. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is now on agreeing to the motion.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays, if they \nhave not been ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ncommit. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, on November 6, 1995, one of the leading \nperiodicals in our country hit the newsstands--U.S. News & World \nReport. It says ``The Democrats: Is the Party Over?'' It is one of \nthose stories about ``the Democrats are dead.''\n  Well, I encourage the U.S. News & World Report to get some airline \ntickets for some of those reporters and move them around the country \ntoday and ask what happened in the country yesterday. I suggest that \nthey go to Kentucky, go to Maine, travel to New Jersey, visit with some \nfolks who have pitched their tents on principles, once again, and see \nthe campfires all around this country of Democrats, who stand for \nthings that are important to the future of this country.\n  I think it was Mark Twain who said, in response to a report in the \nnewspaper that he had died, ``The reports of my death are greatly \nexaggerated.'' Well, those who, for months, have been dancing around \nthe bonfire chanting about ``the death of the Democratic Party,'' the \nresurrection of the Republican Party, and the lasting control of the \nRepublicans in the American political system, might want to take a deep \nbreath and look around at the results of yesterday's elections in our \ncountry.\n  Yes, it is true that yesterday, as is almost always the case, the \nDemocrats were badly outspent. In many cases in these races, it was 4-\nto-1, 6-to-1, 8-to-1. The Republicans had more money. But the Democrats \nwere never outworked, and never will be in our political system. \nYesterday, county to county, town to town, all across this country, \nDemocrats sent a message that we are alive, well, fighting, and \nwinning, for things that are important to our country's future.\n  I think part of it yesterday was the American people responding again \nto our agenda about creating a growing economy, building good jobs with \ngood incomes, educating our children in the world's finest schools, \ncleaning up our environment, and standing for the values and virtues \nthat made this a great country and will make it a great country in the \nfuture. And, yes, even more than that, people from Kentucky, to Maine, \nto New Jersey, to the west coast, yesterday, also stood up and not only \nspoke for Democratic candidates--candidates who ran on a platform of \nhope and opportunity, a platform of building for the future, \nunderstanding we have always had the burden of being the builders.\n  If you look at almost anything that has been built in this country \nthat represents hope and progress, it has been the Democrats who \ndecided that is what ought to be done for America's future. We have had \nfolks that always had seat belts on saying, no, we do not want to move \nahead, do not want to do this or do that.\n  I am proud of our legacy and heritage, and I am proud to note that \nalthough we may be outspent, we are not outworked, and there are lots \nof Democrats across this country who are willing to stand for and fight \nfor the kind of policies that will build a better future in America.\n  Yesterday, voters also spoke, in my judgment, about another agenda, \nthe agenda of the new Speaker, Mr. Gingrich, the Contract With \nAmerica, and leadership in that direction.\n\n  I think the American people rejected yesterday an agenda that has as \nits centerfold tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and budget cuts \nfor the rest of Americans; an agenda that says we do not have enough \nmoney to provide an entitlement for a poor kid to have a hot lunch at \nschool, that says we do not have enough money for health care for the \nelderly and the poor, but an agenda that says we have plenty of money \nfor star wars, we have plenty of money for B-2 bombers nobody ordered, \nF-16's and F-15's that nobody asked for, for planes, ships, and \nsubmarines that nobody wanted. We have lots of money for those things, \nbut we do not have enough money for the 55,000 kids now on Head Start \nwho get kicked off.\n  That is what the voters were saying. Those priorities are out of \nwhack. Those are not mainstream values. Those are extreme kinds of \npositions that the voters have told Speaker Gingrich and others we \nreject.\n  I am proud, today, proud that so many around our country, men and \nwomen, State after State, were willing to stand up and speak out as \npart of our political process and stand for the values and the things \nthat we believe in as Democrats--fought and won, in many cases, against \nthe odds. When you are outspent, when the other side has more \nresources, you have to work harder.\n  I say in the context of this, I am proud of everybody that \nparticipates in this political process, Republicans and Democrats. The \neasiest thing for people to do is do nothing and complain about it. The \ntoughest thing is to stand in the ring and stand up and speak out for \nthings you believe in.\n  I believe everyone who participates is owed a debt of thanks in our \nsystem, but I am especially proud in light of the kind of things we see \nin our country, written about a party that I am proud of, things that \nsay the Democrats maybe are dead; the Democratic Party, the party is \nover for you folks.\n  I am particularly proud yesterday that all across this country we had \npeople, American people--yes, Democrats--sending a message back to \nthose who pronounced our death, and say, as Mark Twain did, ``Reports \nof our death are greatly exaggerated.''\n  We believe in something special for the future of this country. We \npreach hope and opportunity. We preach values and virtue. We preach a \nreturn to the days in this country where everybody can understand that \nwe are doing things for America as a whole.\n  We believed, in North Dakota years ago when the wagon trains forged \nWest, we believed in that lesson that was learned the hard way, that no \nwagon train ever moves ahead by leaving some wagons behind.\n  We have a policy in this country these days by those who have the \nvotes to enforce it that says some folks are out of fashion. If you are \npoor, tough luck. If you are old, that is even tougher luck. Somehow if \nyou did not make your way, you are left behind.\n  That is not the best of our country. Our country will be strongest \nand our country will meet the future with the kind of opportunity we \nshould have forever, when we decide that public policies that invest in \njobs, expanded opportunities and education are the kind of policies \nthat will come out of the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate.\n  In the coming weeks and months, my hope is the American people, \nhaving sent a message yesterday through the ballot box, my hope is the \nAmerican people will see the best of this political system. The best of \nthis system will provide that those on the Republican side of the aisle \nand those on the Democratic side of the aisle will offer their best \nideas and will choose from those good ideas, that menu of good news \nthat comes from all sides, and then use those ideas to move America \nahead. That will be the best our political system can offer to the \nAmerican people. It is my hope for the coming months.\n  I wanted to take the floor today to say that yesterday, at least for \nme, was wonderful news. I think for our country it was good news. Our \ncountry needs a healthy two-party system. Those who believe somehow \nthat on this side of the aisle we do not have the strength, vitality or \nideas to compete in America's political system any more are dead wrong. \nThat was proved yesterday in the elections across America, and it will \nbe proved again and again leading up to the Presidential elections and \n\n[[Page S 16807]]\nelections for Congress and State and local offices all across this \ncountry in November 1996.\n  Then, I think U.S. News and other periodicals will write another \nheadline, another cover page. I have a hunch I know what that cover \npage will be. I hope to come on the floor with a broad smile and say \nthat happy days are here again and the vision and the hope and the \ndreams of Democrats for a better America will be realized again and \nagain and again in the future.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM.

Mr. President, on Friday of last week and again \nyesterday, I began a series of talks on the Medicaid Program. In my \nfirst discussion, I pointed out to the successes of Medicaid --\nsuccesses at reducing infant mortality by 21 percent in this Nation \nbetween 1984 and 1992.\n  Yesterday, I discussed trends that have led to the growth in Medicaid \nspending. These included: demographic changes, including the fact that \nour population is living longer and that this greater longevity means \nmore people are relying on Medicaid for longer periods; problematic \nchanges that have expanded coverage to combat infant mortality among \nour Nation's children and to provide long-term care for our Nation's \nfrail elderly and disabled; and the loss of private-sector health \ninsurance, the fact that a shrinking percentage of America's children \nare insured through their parents' employer.\n  This last point, Mr. President, was reaffirmed in today's Journal of \nthe American Medical Association, which says that 3 million children \nlost private health insurance between 1992 and 1993.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that today's article in the \nWashington Post, entitled ``Medicaid's Safety Net for Children Could Be \nImperiled,'' be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. These, Mr. President, are major factors that have \ncontributed and will contribute to Medicaid growth.\n  Today, I want to talk about the policies of the Senate which have \nbeen adopted for the future of Medicaid.\n  Mr. President, Halloween came early this year. In the dark of night, \nimmediately prior to the passage of the Budget Reconciliation Act on \nthe Friday before Halloween, the Medicaid formula was written by the \narchitects on the reconciliation package.\n  Amazingly, the rewritten, revised Senate bill handed out treats--\ntreats in the form of $10.2 billion mainly to States that were the \nprime abusers of Medicaid disproportionate share hospital funds in \nrecent years. The Senate is preparing to reward States that have \nmanipulated the Medicaid system by making permanent their past \nmisdeeds.\n  How did the authors of this amendment pay for these treats dished out \non the Friday night before Halloween? They imposed trickery on the \nelderly by raiding $12 billion from the Social Security trust fund.\n  What are these Medicaid misdeeds that are about to be rewarded and \nmade permanent? They are what is referred to in Medicaid as the \ndisproportionate share hospital program, known as DSH.\n  What is disproportionate share? The intent of the disproportionate \nshare hospital payments originally enacted in 1981 is to assist \nhospitals that treat high volumes of Medicaid and low-income uninsured \npatients with special needs. Recognizing that these hospitals would \nhave a small private insured patient base with which to recover funding \nfor the cost of treating these uninsured, Congress intended that these \ndisproportionate share hospitals receive payments to supplement their \nother Medicaid payments.\n  In fiscal year 1989, Federal funding for Medicaid DSH payments was \njust $400 million.\n  However, in coming up with their share of those funds, some States \nbegin to see the huge potential in the use of donations and provider \ntax revenue as the State share of Medicaid expenditures.\n  Provider taxes and donations allowed States to draw down Federal \nMedicaid funds while backing out of providing their State matching \nshare and sometimes effectively pocketing the Federal share of money \nmeant for disproportionate share hospitals.\n  The original good intention, to meet the special need of hospitals, \nwas creatively abused by States across the Nation.\n  Abuse was so great that, between fiscal year 1989 and fiscal year \n1993, Federal spending for Medicaid disproportionate share hospital \npayments grew, if you can believe this, from $400 million in 1989 to \n$14.4 billion in 1993, a 3600-percent increase.\n  By 1993, DSH payments amounted to one-of-every-seven Medicaid \ndollars.\n  According to the Kaiser Commission on the Future of Medicaid, DSH \npayments were roughly equal to the sum of Medicaid spending for all \nphysician, laboratory, x ray, outpatient, and clinic services that \nyear.\n  In Alabama, Connecticut, Louisiana, Maine, Missouri, New Hampshire, \nand South Carolina, Medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments \nactually exceeded regular Medicaid payments for inpatient hospital \nservices.\n  This rapid growth, a 3,600-percent increase in just 4 years, was a \nmajor factor in the overall Medicaid growth from 1989 to 1993.\n  I discussed that issue in more detail in my remarks delivered \nyesterday.\n  The Urban Institute, in a 1994 publication, estimated that between \n1990 and 1991, DSH payments accounted for 20 percent of all Medicaid \nspending growth. In that 1-year period, DSH payments were 20 percent. \nBut, between 1991 and 1992, DSH payments were responsible for 51 \npercent of Medicaid spending growth.\n  How did this occur? According to the Health and Human Services \nInspector General Richard Kusserow, who served during the \nadministration of President Bush, in a report dated July 25, 1991:\n\n       The growing popularity of provider [tax and donation] \n     programs, in our opinion, is due to States' awareness that a \n     window of opportunity exists for them to alleviate their own \n     budget programs to the expense of the Federal Government.\n       States are fully aware that they had better take advantage \n     of this opportunity while it exists.\n       One State official went so far to say that ``State \n     officials might be regarded as derelict if they did not take \n     advantage of the Federal law.''\n\n  Incredibly, this occurred in a manner that, although named the \ndisproportionate share hospital program, provided some heavily impacted \nMedicaid hospitals with little or no benefit.\n  This and other types of scams by States were detailed by the \nProspective Payment Assessment Commission in a report requested by \nCongress and completed on January 1, 1994.\n  As the Commission noted,\n\n       Although State Medicaid programs reported spending $20 \n     billion more in fiscal year 1992 than in fiscal year 1990 for \n     inpatient services in short-term hospitals, these hospitals \n     received substantially less than a $20 billion increase in \n     Medicaid revenue. Part of this discrepancy is attributable to \n     situations in which state Medicaid programs allocate DSH \n     payments to hospitals that never actually received or \n     controlled the payment as revenue.\n\n  In an April 1995 report, the General Accounting Office noted that \nStates often churned or even laundered Federal Medicaid dollars through \nState hospitals.\n  The GAO report said:\n\n       State hospitals received $4.8 billion in DSH payments. \n     However, hospital officials indicated that only a small share \n     of the gains were actually retained and available to pay for \n     health care services, such as uncompensated care. Instead, \n     most of the gains were transferred back to state general \n     revenue accounts.\n\n  In sum, paper transactions without paper money.\n  In fact, researchers at the Urban Institute concluded that:\n\n       [A] high share of the funds are being diverted from direct \n     health care to general \n\n[[Page S 16808]]\n     state coffers. It is reasonable to ask if Medicaid is an appropriate \n     vehicle for general revenue sharing between the Federal \n     Government and the States.\n\n  In reviewing such scams, analysts at the Health Care Financing \nAdministration have estimated that the actual Federal share of Medicaid \nfunds in 1993 was 64.5 percent instead of the reported 57.3 percent, \nprimarily because of the manipulation of the DSH Program.\n  Good news: As a result of these scams, illusory tactics, and raids on \nthe Federal treasury, Congress enacted legislation in 1991 and again in \n1993 to create State-specific ceiling limits on each State's spending \nfor DSH payment adjustments to 12 percent of the State's total Medicaid \nspending for the year. That is, no State could have more than 12 \npercent of its total Medicaid in the category of disproportionate share \nhospitals.\n  This limit, combined with other changes to the amount of money a \nsingle hospital can receive and the definition of what constitutes a \nprovider tax, have been effective at controlling these costs.\n  In fact, the 20 States that have 12 percent of their overall Medicaid \nspending in DSH payments are capped at the absolute dollars they \nreceived in 1993.\n  For example, New Hampshire, which has over 50 percent of its entire \nMedicaid Program budget included in disproportionate share payments, is \ncapped at a Federal disproportionate share payment of $196 million.\n  As a result, according to CBO estimates, Federal Medicaid DSH \npayments increased slightly from $9.6 billion in 1993 to $9.8 billion \nin 1994.\n  In fiscal year 1995, CBO projects that Federal DSH spending to drop \nto $8.5 billion, then increase by approximately half a billion dollars \nannually over the next 5 years. That is the good news. The Congress saw \nthe problem. Congress acted. The actions tended to suture the \nhemorrhage.\n  Now the bad news. Incredibly, Congress is prepared to reward and make \npermanent the raids made on the Federal treasury in the past.\n  How was this done?\n  This was accomplished in the dead of night on the Friday before \nHalloween in an amendment that trimmed the Federal reduction in \nMedicaid from $187 billion to $176 billion.\n  Some of the winners and losers are well known by now.\n  Approximately $11.2 billion in additional Medicaid dollars will be \ndistributed to States with two Republican Senators over the next 7 \nyears, in the Senate proposal, while States with two Democratic \nSenators will lose an additional $3.6 billion. That has been well \nreported.\n  Less well known is the fact that States which have excessive Medicaid \ndisproportionate share programs in the past are also the big winners.\n  New Hampshire and Louisiana, the most renowned examples of excess, \nhave special fixes in the Senate bill which allows those two States to \nnot have to fully match the Federal funding they will receive over the \nnext few years.\n  Meanwhile, nine other States--Texas, Missouri, Connecticut, Kansas, \nAlabama, New Jersey, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Michigan--all which \nhave disproportionate share programs that far exceed the national \naverage and some that have been well documented as having schemed the \nFederal treasury in the past, those nine States will receive $14.8 \nbillion in increased Medicaid funding over the next 7 years as a result \nof the late Friday evening deal, that currently would cap these ``high-\nDSH'' States' programs.\n  The Senate Finance Committee bill would have cut off excessive \ndisproportionate share payments above 9 percent of overall Medicaid \nProgram costs.\n  That was the bill that we had on the floor on that Friday before the \nlate night raid which eliminated that constraint on the use of \ndisproportionate share, and resulted in $14.8 billion flowing to those \nStates that had been the primary abusers of the disproportionate share \nprogram.\n  However, the late evening deal would allow these States to not only \nkeep what they had in the past and make it permanent, but would also \nallow them to increase that money annually, based on the larger base \nyear funding which the inclusion of their full disproportionate share \namounts allowed them to have. Thus, the $14.8 billion windfall for nine \nhigh DSH States.\n  The rest of the Nation's States--mostly low-DSH States--will lose \nanother $3.6 billion from an amendment that added $10.2 billion to the \nMedicaid Program.\n  This is a perverse Washington logic where spending is saving--where \nbad is good--and locking in the past is heralded as reform.\n  But rewarding some States that had abused the disproportionate share \nof the hospital program was not enough bad policy for one night. The \nFriday night raid went on. The Senate made it worse by paying for these \nsupplemental Medicaid allocations through mandating a 2.6 percent cost-\nof-living adjustment for 1996.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a Washington Post \neditorial on this subject entitled ``Medipork'' printed on November 6 \nbe printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, under the Roth amendment that we adopted \non that Friday night before Halloween, the money to fund the additional \npayments, largely to the States which had previously abused the \nMedicaid system, this money was found when the Government declared that \nthe cost-of-living adjustment for 1996 would be 2.6 percent, which was \nlower than the 3.1 percent projected when the budget bills began moving \nthrough Congress last spring.\n  The result of the lower cost-of-living factor, said proponents, would \nbe lower outlays for programs tied to the Consumer Price Index such as \nSocial Security.\n  Mr. President, at first glance that sounds reasonable. Upon closer \ninspection, however, the logic fails, and it becomes clear that we have \ntwo choices. Either the funding is phony, nonexistent and, therefore, \ncontributes to an additional deficit by spending funds without an \nequivalent additional source of revenue or--what I am afraid is the \nmore likely alternative--a raid on the Social Security trust fund.\n  In order to understand this, I want to briefly discuss how the \nFederal budget is scored.\n  In March of this year, the Congress established an economic baseline. \nThis baseline forecasts the level of Federal revenues and expenditures \nfor the next 7 years predicated on current law and current and \nprojected economic data. In making these economic projections, the \nCongressional Budget Office makes assumptions regarding a number of \nfactors. The factors that are included in the assessment of the \neconomic baseline include inflation, interest rates, number of \nqualified beneficiaries for the principal programs such as the number \nof beneficiaries for Social Security, the gross domestic product, \nrevenues, and court decisions that might affect Federal policy.\n  Those are some of the factors which are included in arriving at the \neconomic baseline.\n  From that baseline, the Congressional Budget Office can estimate the \nimpact that changes in law will have on Federal revenues or \nexpenditures.\n  Almost 8 months have passed since the economic baseline was \nestablished. Some of the assumptions turned out to be too high; others \ntoo low. For example, inflation has been lower than expected. The gross \ndomestic product has been slightly higher than expected. Interest rates \nhave been higher than projected. Obviously, if the economic baseline \nwas updated to reflect actual experience in the last 8 months, we would \nobtain a more accurate picture of our Federal income statement and \nbalance sheet for the next 7 years.\n  Mr. President, that was not what was done. Instead, we reached in and \ntook just one economic factor--the fact that the Consumer Price Index \nincreased only 2.6 percent and we require that legislation follow this \nmonofactor directive. The Congressional Budget Office says it does not \nupdate its economic baseline unless it takes into account all economic \nand other factors--not just one.\n  The reason? If it could pick and choose, then Congress would cherry \npick the positive economic changes and ignore the negatives. The result \nwould be a budget deficit much greater than anticipated because we had \npredicated \n\n[[Page S 16809]]\nour economic actions on unsound assumptions because the only economic \nchanges unclaimed would be those generating higher outlays and lower \nrevenues than expected.\n  In fact, if on October 27 the Congressional Budget Office had taken \nall economic factors into account--gross domestic product, interest \nrate, court decisions affecting Federal obligations and inflation--the \ndeficit in the year 2002 would have been higher than anticipated last \nMarch. We would not have had a $12 billion false figure to use to \nfinance additional Medicaid payments. We would actually have had to \nfind additional revenue because, taking into account all of those \nfactors, the Congressional Budget Office would have said our deficit \nhad grown--not diminished--since March.\n  In other words, while the 1996 cost-of-living will be 2.6 percent \nrather than 3.1 percent resulting in $13 billion in lower outlays, this \nwill be more than offset by other factors, such as higher interest \nrates, that increase outlays or decrease revenues.\n  That is why some would say that the Senate's financing of the \nadditional Medicaid funds is phony. That is why I asked Senator \nDomenici on the floor whether these savings were real or not. He \nresponded, ``they are real dollars.'' And I assume that the Republicans \nintended that they use real money to finance their changes and to \nfinance the additional spending through Medicaid.\n  So assuming that these funds are not phony, where does this money \ncome from? Let us look at the language of the Roth amendment which was \nadopted on that Friday night.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in the case of \n     any program within the jurisdiction of the Committee on \n     Finance of the United States Senate which is adjusted for any \n     increase in the consumer price index for all urban wage \n     earners and clerical workers (CPI-W) for United States city \n     average for all items, any such adjustment which takes effect \n     during fiscal year 1996 shall be equal to 2.6 percent.\n\n  Mr. President, this clearly specifies that the money comes from \nprograms or outlays. Exactly what outlay programs are we talking about? \nAre we talking about the Pentagon, the Department of Defense outlays? \nNo. Those are not under the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee. Are \nwe talking about funding for roads and bridges? Are we talking about \nfunding for foreign aid? No. Those programs are not under the \njurisdiction of the Finance Committee. Just what outlays are within the \njurisdiction of the Finance Committee?\n  There happen to be a number of those programs. But I am afraid that I \nmust report that the overwhelming majority of dollars in those \nprograms--$12 billion of the $13 billion removed--is Social Security.\n  So the only conclusion is that the Senate has taken $12 billion from \nthe Social Security trust fund to pay for more Medicaid allocations to \na selected few States--States which in large numbers had been those \nthat had abused the Medicaid system in the past.\n  How can that be, you ask? How can a half of 1-percent reduction in \nthe CPI constitute a raid on the Social Security trust fund? Let us \nlook more closely still.\n  The Roth amendment takes into account only outlays impacted by the \nlower 2.6 percent cost-of-living adjustment. But there are other \nramifications of the lower cost of living. For example, many workers' \nsalaries are tied to the Consumer Price Index, and if those salaries \nonly rise by 2.6 percent rather than the previous estimated 3.1 \npercent, then what happens to payroll? What happens to payroll taxes? \nThey are both lower, and, therefore, less money will flow into the \nSocial Security trust fund than would have flowed had the cost of \nliving been at the earlier projected 3.1 percent.\n  The correct question is not how will a lower cost of living impact \nSocial Security outlays. The proper question is what is the net effect \nof all of the economic changes this year to the Social Security trust \nfund?\n  The answer has two components: outlays, expenditures, and revenues.\n  The Social Security outlays will be reduced by a total of $18 \nbillion--$12 billion from the COLA reduction, the 2.6 percent, and $6 \nbillion from other changes.\n  But the economic data accumulated since March also will affect \nrevenues going into the Social Security trust fund, and according to \nthe Congressional Budget Office updating the economic baseline will \nresult in a $62 billion decrease--decrease--in Social Security trust \nfund revenues over the next 7 years.\n  Accordingly, the net effect to the Social Security trust fund of \nrevising congressional economic estimates is not to increase the size \nof the trust fund but, rather, to decrease it by $44 billion.\n  So if we want to face economic reality, the Social Security trust \nfund will have $44 billion less in it than our budget assumes. And \nwhile the Social Security trust fund is losing $44 billion as a result \nof economic changes since March, the Senate has approved diverting an \nadditional $12 billion from the Social Security trust fund.\n  It is difficult for me to believe that this Senate actually wants to \nraid the Social Security trust fund to pay for anything. Just \nyesterday, House Republicans were threatening to attach provisions to a \nlimited debt ceiling extension that would have had the effect of \nprecluding the Secretary of the Treasury from utilizing Social Security \ntrust funds for anything other than Social Security obligations.\n  I am afraid this sounds like selective enforcement.\n  It is ironic that the House Republicans would be so concerned about \nthe Social Security trust fund that they would tie Secretary of the \nTreasury Rubin's hands to preclude him from even borrowing from the \ntrust fund, but at the same time the Senate Republicans seem quite \nwilling to raid the Social Security trust fund to finance additional \nMedicaid allocations.\n  We cannot have it both ways. If the reduction in the cost of living \nis not a real cut in spending but merely reflecting reality, then it \ndoes not represent savings and should not qualify to offset real new \nMedicaid spending. If, however, the reduction in the cost of living is \nreal, then it constitutes a diversion of funds from the Social Security \ntrust fund.\n  Either conclusion justifies jettisoning this midnight amendment that \nchanged the Medicaid funding formula, rewarding the States that abused \nthe disproportionate share hospital program.\n  Mr. President, I conclude by saying we should look instead for an \nalternative allocation solution, and I will present that alternative \nsolution tomorrow and urge careful consideration of a better way to \nachieve our goal of fiscal responsibility and fairness.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Nov. 7, 1995]\n\n  Medicaid's Safety Net for Children Could Be Imperiled, Reports Warn\n\n\n   Changes May Cut Coverage to Some if Parents Lose Private Insurance\n\n                           (By Spencer Rich)\n\n       For years Medicaid has picked up the slack when children \n     lost health insurance based on changes in their parents' \n     employment situation, but that safety net could be weakened \n     substantially by Medicaid changes moving rapidly through \n     Congress, according to today's Journal of the American \n     Medical Association.\n       The result could be highly damaging to the health of \n     children and also could eventually increase health costs per \n     child, according to articles in the association journal.\n       ``From 1992 to 1993 an estimated 3 million children lost \n     private health insurance'' as people lost jobs or employers \n     stopped providing health insurance, Paul Newacheck of the \n     University of California and five co-authors said in one \n     journal article.\n       But until now, increases in Medicaid coverage, resulting \n     from past legislation that broadened eligibility and from \n     more people sinking into poverty and becoming eligible, \n     ``largely offset the changes that occurred in private health \n     insurance coverage,'' the authors said.\n       Statistics developed by the Urban Institute for the Kaiser \n     Commission on Medicaid support this assertion. In 1988, 66 \n     percent of all children under age 18 had health insurance \n     based on the employment of a family member, and 16 percent \n     were covered by Medicaid. But in 1994, the share with \n     employer-based insurance had dropped to 59 percent and the \n     Medicaid percent had jumped to 26 percent.\n       However, now that situation is about to end as Republican-\n     sponsored Medicaid changes already approved by both chambers \n     of Congress in different form impose a ``cap'' that would cut \n     the growth of program spending from about 10 percent a year \n     to 4 percent, and give states far more latitude than now in \n     deciding whom to cover, Newacheck and his co-authors said.\n       ``If federal spending is capped as proposed,'' they said, \n     ``states, at a minimum, will have to reduce the scope of \n     their existing Medicaid program'' and will be unable to keep \n\n[[Page S 16810]]\n     picking up children who have lost employer-based coverage.\n       Passage of the Medicaid proposals, said physician Stephen \n     Berman in an editorial, would ``reduce the capacity of the \n     public sector to absorb the increasing number of children \n     losing private insurance [and] would swell the number of \n     uninsured children.'' The impact of gaps in health insurance \n     for children was sketched out in a third journal article, \n     written by Michael D. Kogan of the Centers for Disease \n     Control and Prevention and six others.\n       The article did not address the current legislative \n     proposals but reported on a nationally representative sample \n     of 8,129 children whose mothers were interviewed in 1991 when \n     the children were about 3 years old.\n       Based on the survey, the article said, ``About one-quarter \n     of U.S. children (22.6 percent) were without health insurance \n     for at least one month during their first three years of \n     life. Over half of these children had a health insurance gap \n     of more than six months.''\n       About 40 percent of the children, estimated conservatively, \n     did not receive care continuously at a single site--for \n     example, the office of a family doctor--and breaks in \n     insurance coverage are often the cause of sporadic medical \n     care at this critical stage of physical development.\n       ``Children are in particular need of primary care providers \n     who can track developmental milestones, assure the \n     maintenance of immunization and other health maintenance \n     schedules, monitor abnormal conditions and serve as the first \n     contact of care,'' wrote Kogan and his co-authors, especially \n     in finding and treating ``emerging disabilities, chronic \n     illnesses or birth defects'' and in providing preventive \n     care.\n       ``A schedule of routine primary care is much easier and \n     usually more cost-effective when these activities are carried \n     out in an organized manner over time with successive office \n     visits at the same site,'' they said.\n       Berman said, ``Having a regular source of care has been \n     shown to reduce child expenditures by 21.7 percent compared \n     with not having a regular source of care.''\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Nov. 6, 1995]\n\n                                Medipork\n\n       When the current Congress set out on the path of turning \n     the major programs for the poor into block grants, Sen. \n     Daniel P. Moynihan (D-N.Y.) issued an interesting warning. \n     Once Washington gives up on making policy and instead just \n     ships off billions and billions to state governments, he \n     said, politics will turn away from substance and instead \n     become one big formula fight as states and regions battle \n     over who will get the biggest pots of cash.\n       His prediction has become fact, as a report in The Post by \n     Judith Havermann and Helen Dewar documented last week. In the \n     scramble to pass their budget, Republican leaders in the \n     Senate found they had to pass around billions of extra \n     dollars in Medicaid payments to states to buy the votes of--\n     pardon us, we mean secure the support of--Republican \n     senators. It seems that many senators are worried about the \n     impact of the Medicaid proposal on their state budgets.\n       They should be. The pressure this budget puts on the \n     program that serves the poor and many among the elderly and \n     the disabled is simply too much. Facing potential rebellion, \n     the leadership kept rejiggering the formula to please \n     wavering senators. And given that the leadership knew it \n     would have to find votes for its budget from Republican \n     senators, guess what? The increases largely went to states \n     represented by Republicans. The cuts were mostly reallocated \n     to states with Democratic senators whose votes the leadership \n     knew it couldn't win anyway.\n       Thus, an analysis by Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.) found that \n     states with two Democratic senators lost a net of $3.6 \n     billion in the Medicaid reshuffling; states with two \n     Republican senators gained $11.2 billion. Texas alone (with \n     two Republican senators) gained about $5 billion; California \n     (represented by two Democrats) lost $4 billion.\n       Ginny Koops, a Senate Finance Committee aide, had it about \n     right when she said: ``This formula will be redone again in \n     conference and again and again. It is just incredibly \n     difficult to come up with something that makes 5 states \n     happy; somebody always complains.''\n       Ms. Koops' comment goes to the heart of what's wrong with \n     his whole Medicaid approach: Of course many will keep \n     complaining about the formulas of a so-called reform that \n     dumps upon the states the responsibilities of running \n     Medicaid and then asks them do do that job with huge cuts in \n     the rate of expected growth in the program.\n       Medicaid costs do need to be contained; the Republicans are \n     right about that part. But this budget's approach to Medicaid \n     will not only keep producing comical mathematical games; it \n     will also cause real harm to the states and to the medical \n     care of many among the most vulnerable Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/08/senate-section/article/S16807-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16810]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     GREAT FALLS CHURCH DESECRATION\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

I am proud \nof them, and like the vast majority of Montanans, I am with them in our \nState's fight against hate groups. On my next visit to Montana, I hope \nto attend services at Mount Olive.\n  The desecration of Mount Olive is a sickening event and one which \nshows that as a State and a country, we still have a long way to go in \nour fight against hate. But its aftermath also shows us something else. \nMany Americans are concerned, and rightly so, about a decline of civic \nspirit, a growing indifference to our neighbors, and a general loss of \nmoral values in our country.\n  However, the rally this Monday showed us that our courage, our \nwillingness to meet our responsibilities as citizens, and our basic \ndecency are stronger than the pessimists admit.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/08/senate-section/article/S16810-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16810-S16811]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              MIKE WALLACE CAN DISH IT OUT BUT NOT TAKE IT\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, for 27 years, Mike Wallace has been a \nhard-hitting, pull-no-punches investigative journalist primarily on \n``60 Minutes.'' Relentless in pursuing a story, there are few tactics \nhe will not employ--bullying, insults, confrontation, ambush \njournalism.\n  That is fine, because however you feel about Mr. Wallace, he works in \nAmerica, and here in America the first amendment secures our right to \nfree speech. We Americans can say or write just about anything we like, \nand, no matter how offensive it may be, how distasteful, repugnant, \nhowever uncomfortable it may be to others, we have the right to express \nour views. Mike Wallace has the inestimable privilege of expressing \nthose views on network television to tens of millions of people.\n  I had been under the impression that, given his profession and his \nunorthodox modus operandi, Mr. Wallace was a first amendment advocate, \nbut in today's Washington Post we find evidence that suggests the \nvenerable Mr. Wallace has a peculiarly narrow devotion to free speech.\n  Yesterday, Marlin Fitzwater, a long-time spokesman for Presidents \nReagan and Bush, was waiting to appear on the cable television show \n``Politically Incorrect.'' Mr. Fitzwater has just published his memoirs \nof his time in the White House, and in that book he offers some mild \ncriticism of both ``60 Minutes,'' calling it ``liberal'' and always \nframed in terms of ``good versus evil,'' and of Mr. Wallace himself. I \nquote:\n\n       As a small boy . . . I would watch Mike Wallace . . . as he \n     insulted his talk show guests, drove women to cry and \n     performed his pioneering version of talk show extremism.\n\n  Mr. Fitzwater's book also mentions Mr. Wallace's son, ABC reporter \nChris Wallace, criticizing the younger Wallace for his privileged \nbackground.\n  All this is prefatory to the main event. The studio in which the \ncable show ``Politically Incorrect'' is taped is located in the CBS \nbuilding in New York. While Mr. Fitzwater was waiting to go on the air, \nMr. Wallace called Mr. Fitzwater in the studio and began shouting at \nhim and then swearing at him over his book. A few minutes later, the \nPost reports, Mr. Wallace stormed into the studio and continued with \nthe shouting and swearing and obscenities. Mr. Fitzwater, wisely, I \nbelieve, and astounded, left the studio posthaste.\n  Now, as they say, Mr. President, what is the deal? What is going on? \nThe Lexis-Nexis system would blow a fuse if you tried to reach all the \ntimes Mr. Wallace criticized others on the air. After all the years \nthat he has been in this peculiarly tough field of journalism, you \nwould think he would be accustomed to criticism. A few years ago, for \nexample, ``60 Minutes'' ran a program on the pesticide Alar and helped \n\n[[Page S 16811]]\ndestroy the living of a significant number of Washington State apple \ngrowers without justification.\n  I see no evidence that that bothered Mr. Wallace in the least. But \nnow he throws a temper tantrum over a mere slight. Indeed, Mr. \nPresident, after all the hard-hitting pieces Mr. Wallace has run on \npeople, institutions, and even whole governments, one is amazed at his \nvitriol and verbal attacks on Marlin Fitzwater.\n  Perhaps, Mr. President, Mr. Wallace's support for the first amendment \nis a single-edged sword. He can use it, but it cannot be used against \nhim. Perhaps Mr. Fitzwater's criticisms struck a raw nerve. Either way, \none fact is certain. Mike Wallace can dish it out, but he cannot take \nit. Shameful, Mr. President, but funny at the same time.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, a century ago, a college was opened in the \ncity of Bluefield, West Virginia. For the past 100 years, Bluefield \nState College and its antecedents have performed an outstanding service \nin providing a reasonably priced and quality education for thousands of \nstudents from Southern West Virginia, Southwestern Virginia, and other \nStates throughout our country as well as many foreign nations. Today, I \njoin the alumni, students, the faculty, parents, and admirers of \nBluefield State in hailing its 100th anniversary as a premier \ninstitution of higher education--an institution oriented toward, and \ndedicated to, the preparation of men and women of widely separated age \ngroups for quality careers in health care, education, business, and \nother important occupations.\n  Following its inception a century ago, Bluefield State College \nquickly gained acclaim as one of the country's outstanding \ntraditionally black colleges. Bluefield State has built upon its early \nstrengths and has become a major center of practical education in \nSouthern West Virginia and Southwestern Virginia. The college is a \nfully accredited coeducational institution offering a variety of \nprograms at the associate and baccalaureate degree levels and provides \nready educational opportunities to people impacted by the declining \ncoalfields.\n  Bluefield State College attracts students from a broad segment of the \npopulation and helps make the American Dream real for many of them. \nThis institution attracts large numbers of adult students with its \nextensive evening program, and it provides reasonably priced education \nwith quality standards and quality outcomes, with an emphasis on \npreparing its students for a solid future.\n  Created to provide better educational services for black Americans in \nthe area, the college later expanded its regional influence by \nenhancing its curriculum to provide formal teacher training. In the \nensuing years, to keep up with the ever-changing job market, new \nacademic areas such as engineering technology, computer science, \nbusiness administration, and health science were added to the \ncurriculum.\n  I particularly salute Dr. Robert Moore for the outstanding leadership \nthat he has provided to this educational institution in my home State, \nand I congratulate the faculty and staff of Bluefield State for the \nprofessional and caring fashion in which they teach and guide their \nstudents. In those areas served by graduates of Bluefield State \nCollege, the reputation of the graduates of this school is one of \ngrowing admiration and esteem--hallmarks of the well-grounded and \npragmatic performances being rendered by the alumni of Bluefield State \nCollege.\n  Too often, unfortunately, colleges and universities set themselves \nabove the needs of the communities and the students whom they were \ninstituted to serve. The growing favor that is developing for Bluefield \nState College throughout its service area is an indication that \nBluefield State has not fallen into the trap of academic pride. Rather, \nBluefield State has dedicated itself to preparing industrious men and \nwomen to play productive and profitable roles in whatever walks of \nAmerican life they enter, and to contribute patriotically and \nunselfishly to the upbuilding, both economically and morally, of the \ncities, towns, counties, and States in which those graduates find \nthemselves.\n  Again, Mr. President, I congratulate Bluefield State College, \nBluefield, WV, as it celebrates its centennial year, and I know that I \nspeak for citizens throughout Southern West Virginia and Southwestern \nVirginia in expressing my admiration for this institution of higher \neducation and my appreciation for all that it has come to mean to the \npeople of the Southern Appalachian Highlands. Since its founding in \n1895, this fine institution has flourished, and I hope that the next \n100 years will prove to be as prosperous and as beneficial.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise with Senator Byrd today to \nrecognize Bluefield State College as it celebrates its centennial.\n  Since its founding in 1895, Bluefield State College has been \ncommitted to providing quality education in southern West Virginia. \nThese many years are a heroic story of hard-won and remarkable \nachievement, truly an inspiring legacy.\n  Founded to improve education for African-American students in the \nregion, the college began as the Bluefield Colored Institute [BCI]. It \nserved the segregated schools of turn-of-the-century coal camps. \nThrough the dedication of local citizens and its first president, \nHamilton Hatter, BCI flourished, even operating for 2 years without \nState funds.\n  As time went on, the school established formal teacher instructions. \nBy 1954, Bluefield became an integrated school serving all students in \nsouthern West Virginia.\n  Over the years, the school has worked to strengthen the institution \nand to expand its curricula to serve the changing needs of its \nstudents. Recent efforts include expanding Bluefield State College's \ndegree program into areas including engineering technology, computer \nscience, business administration, and the health sciences. These new \nfields of studies are designed to prepare the students of today for the \nchallenges of the 21st century.\n  Mr. President, as Bluefield State College celebrates its centennial, \nSenator Byrd and I think it is fitting to praise its dedicated faculty \nand staff, including current President Robert Moore, for their \neducational vision and creative spirit.\n  Bluefield State College, proud of its strong past, stands ready to \nmeet the changing needs of an expanding and dynamic region of the \nState. It has done an exemplary job of offering educational \nopportunities to many students in southern West Virginia. We join every \nWest Virginian in congratulating Bluefield State College for 100 years \nof dedicated education and community leadership. We wish it continued \nsuccess for the next century. This fine institution has made all of us \nvery proud.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/08/senate-section/article/S16811-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16812-S16813]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S 16812]]\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO YITZHAK RABIN\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, before the events of the last few days \nfade from memory, and the recollection of the assassination of Prime \nMinister Yitzhak Rabin gets obscured by other events in the world, I \nwant to take this opportunity to reflect somewhat on my visit there \nduring the funeral and just to discuss, for a moment, my view of this \nman, this great man, someone I knew very well for a period of more than \n25 years.\n  Mr. President, the world now knows so well that the Israeli people \nhave lost a courageous, visionary leader, and the world has lost a \npeacemaker. As Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was laid to rest on Monday \nin the holy city of his birth, Jerusalem, millions witnessed the \nfuneral and grieved at the loss. His brutal assassination represents \nthe worst of so many tragedies in Israel's recent history. It \ndemonstrated too vividly the depths to which intolerance can drag the \nhuman spirit. The people of Israel are in shock, stunned and saddened \nby the senseless, cold-blooded murder of their unique leader, soldier \nturned peacemaker.\n  Many felt the pain of the bullet that took away their Prime Minister, \nand that the assassin tore asunder at the same moment the spirit and \nthe soul of Israel. The residents of the community, and those that know \nthe Jewish people, cannot comprehend how one Jew could kill another in \nthe name of God, when all, at times, have been victims.\n  I, along with millions of Americans, share their grief and sense of \nloss. At this delicate time in Israel's history, the United States \nGovernment must remain unequivocal in showing its strong support for \nthe Government of Israel and in its leader, acting Prime Minister \nPeres, as the head of the Government. He has the credentials to ably \nlead the people of Israel in the tumultuous days ahead. The United \nStates commitment to Israel will remain strong. It cannot be shattered \nby an assassin's bullet.\n  Mr. President, during the decades in which Yitzhak Rabin faithfully \nserved his government, the American people observed, with great \nadmiration, his evolution from soldier to statesman to politician to \npeacemaker. Always, he had our respect as an outstanding leader.\n  Yitzhak Rabin was a man of great courage and determination. His \nconcern, to his last moments, was for the security of the people of \nIsrael and the attainment of peace. Though his life was cut short by \nthe bullet of an intolerant, self-righteous assassin, his legacy of \npeace will live on with his countrymen in future generations of Israeli \ncitizens. In his memory, I believe that the peace process will continue \nto move forward at, perhaps, an even faster pace. Because the Jewish \nextremists took up arms against the peace process, Israel must not be \ndissuaded from pursuing and strengthening regional peace. To abandon \nthe process now would give succor to the extremists and terrorists of \nall religious persuasion.\n  Because Rabin was a man of such character and courage and so deeply \ncommitted to peace, dignitaries and government officials from 80 \ndifferent nations came to his funeral in Israel to pay him their last \nrespects. Five thousand guests were invited from all around the world. \nPresident Clinton and former Presidents Bush and Carter attended the \nfuneral, along with Secretary of State Christopher and former \nSecretaries Vance and Shultz. Thirty-five Members of Congress attended.\n  Heads of State, Cabinet Ministers, and government officials from the \ninternational community traveled to Jerusalem to mourn the loss of this \ngreat leader, many of whom did not really know him but knew about him, \nread about him, heard about him, and saw his commitment--unyielding \ncommitment--to his people to show support for continuation of the peace \nprocess.\n  The global gathering at his funeral was testament to the fact that \nunder Rabin's leadership Israel had been welcomed into the \ninternational family of nations as never before. Nowhere was his \naccomplishment in ushering in a new era of acceptance for his country \nmore evident than in the reputation from Middle Eastern countries.\n  Never in their wildest dreams could people imagine that Jordan's King \nHussein would stand in Jerusalem, the city where his grandfather was \nassassinated--which he mentioned in his comments--in 1951 by Islamic \nmilitants, people in his own religion, his own communities, the city \nthat was reunified by Israel in 1967. He came to say farewell to his \nformer foe, Yitzhak Rabin calling him a brother--a brother, a \ncolleague, and a friend. I saw him wiping tears from his eyes.\n  Never did I imagine that the Egyptian President, Hosni Mubarak, who \nhad traveled to Jerusalem to pay Prime Minister Rabin his last \nrespects--even dignitaries from countries like Oman and Qatar, which \nhave no diplomatic relations with Israel, came, beyond their \nformalities, to cross the border to say farewell to this visionary \nleader.\n  I, too, Mr. President, was at the funeral on Mt. Herzl where so many \nof Israel's military and spiritual leaders are buried. As the siren \nsounded throughout the country announcing a 2-minute period of silence \nand mourning for his death, I recalled many of the heroic moments of \nYitzhak Rabin's life.\n  I saw the flag of Israel draped over his coffin and envisioned \nSoldier Rabin leading the fight to keep the supply link between \nJerusalem and the sea in the war of independence. We traveled that road \nfrom the airport to Jerusalem where along the roadbed still were the \nhulk of trucks and tanks and weapons that are left there as a reminder \nof what the price was that was paid to keep that road open and to \ncreate the independent State of Israel.\n  I remembered reading about his exploits and how heroic this very \nyoung man at the time was. He was a brigade commander still in his \nearly twenties.\n  I envisioned Army Chief of Staff Rabin strategizing to recapture the \ncity of Jerusalem and claim victory in the 6-day war of 1967. I recall \nthe Ambassador to the United States Yitzhak Rabin arguing for a strong \nUnited States-Israel relationship from his Embassy office in \nWashington. I could almost sense Minister of Defense, twice Prime \nMinister, Rabin's steely determination in defending the security of the \npeople that he loved so dearly, the people of Israel.\n  Mostly, however, I recalled the day that Prime Minister Rabin did the \ninconceivable and made peace with enemies. I recalled sitting on the \nlawn of the White House and how still the world was as he shook hands \nwith Chairman Arafat after signing the Declaration of Principles, then \nthe day that he and King Hussein of Jordan did the same, in the same \nlocation, after making peace.\n  Those are handshakes of courage and of bravery, of hope for \nattaining, at long last, safety and security through peace as opposed \nto security with weapons.\n  History will say that Yitzhak Rabin, who fought in so many of \nIsrael's wars, gave his life for peace, a task to which he devoted \nhimself completely. It is appropriate, therefore, that his last words \nwere of peace.\n\n       I was a military man for 27 years. I waged war as long as \n     there was no chance for peace. I believe there is now a \n     chance for peace, a great chance, and we must take advantage \n     of it for those who are standing here, and for those who are \n     not here--and they are many. I have always believed that the \n     majority of the people want peace and are ready to take a \n     chance for peace. Violence erodes the basis of Israeli \n     democracy. It should be condemned and wisely expunged and \n     isolated. It is not the way of the State of Israel. There is \n     democracy. There can be disputes but the outcome will be \n     settled by democratic elections.\n\n  He said in his remarks, ``Peace is not only in prayers * * * but it \nis in the desire of the Jewish people. This rally,'' as he addressed \nthe group, ``must broadcast to the Israeli public, to the world Jewish \npublic and many in the Western and outside world, that the people of \nIsrael want peace, support peace.''\n  It is my profound hope that the people of Israel will strive to heal \nthe wound and the national spirit that Yitzhak Rabin's assassination \nhas caused and that they will be able to move forward as a unified \nnation, continuing in the quest for peace.\n  That would be Prime Minister Rabin's greatest legacy and most fitting \ntribute. It is something that the United States and all the nations of \nthe world must strongly support.\n  As I said, I was there to say goodbye to this man who was an old \nfriend, someone who commanded the respect \n\n[[Page S 16813]]\nand affection of millions who did not know him but respected his \ncommitment, respected the fact that he was willing to take the risks \nthat he took, risking his own life.\n  The most disappointing moments of his days, he told me 2\\1/2\\ weeks \nago in New York City, was when people from his own faith, some of them \nreligious leaders, reportedly religious leaders, said he should be a \ntarget for assassination because he was giving away too much of his \ncountry. This man who fought to create the state, this man who gave his \nlife unflinchingly to the well-being of his people, criticized, called \ntraitor, depicted in Nazi uniforms, outrageously berated in his quest \nto secure the safety and well-being of the State of Israel and its \npeople.\n  The messages that came from people who spoke at the funeral, from our \nPresident, President Clinton, who said that he was a man chosen by God. \nKing Hussein, who I mentioned, saluted him, his memory as a pro, and \ncompared the assassination of his grandfather to the assassination of \nYitzhak Rabin. He was standing there, wearing traditional dress, a \nheaddress common to the Arab world, proud of his heritage, but willing \nto recognize that this leader of the Jewish people was someone whom had \nrespected and wanted to acknowledge as a friend.\n  President Mubarak, President of the first Arab nation to make peace \nwith Israel, he was there in his first visit ever to the country. And \nother leaders who spoke--the President of the European Union, the Prime \nMinister of Russia, and then, finally, his family.\n  I think the world listened very attentively as his 17-year-old \ngranddaughter spoke about her grandfather and declared him as a light \nunto nations. It is almost a Biblical intonation. She said her \ngrandfather's life would continue to light the way for peace, but the \nlight that he gave her was extinguished, that she would no longer see \nthe light nor bask in his glow of love and affection. Elegant, elegant \nwords for a 17-year-old, but expressing what so many failed to see \nbecause they did not have the personal contact. But they were reminded \nthat included in the greatness of this individual was a very \nsignificant human side.\n  One of his senior, most dedicated staff members stood, a man named \nEitan Haber, who wrote some of Prime Minister Rabin's speeches. I kind \nof joked with him at a few meetings, because I said I wished that I \ncould find such a speech writer. And he reminded me that the speech \nwriting was the least significant part of a great speech. It took a \ngreat speech deliverer to make a memorable talk.\n  Through his tears, through Mr. Haber's tears as he stood in front of \nthe thousands gathered there and the millions watching across the \nworld, he took out a piece of paper that the prime minister had in his \npocket. As Shimon Peres, now the Acting Prime Minister, said, it was \nthe first time in all the years of public service that Yitzhak Rabin \nhad ever, ever agreed to sing in public, and he joined in a chorus in \nthis rally of more than 100,000 people, singing a song of peace that \nwas written to be sung by those gathered there and throughout the \ncountry. And he sang the song.\n  This was a man who was not comfortable making speeches or in large \npublic gatherings. Even though the greatness that he had internally \nshown through, you could see, when he was with the President or on \npublic platforms, he was always ill-at-ease, always moving around, his \nbody language indicating some insecurity.\n  He sang the song, the first time and last time that he ever sang a \nsong in public. And Mr. Haber, the speech writer, read from that song \nat the funeral ceremony when he took out this blood-spattered song. \nBecause the bullet hit close to where the song was stored in Prime \nMinister Rabin's breast pocket.\n  What an anomaly, this man singing for the first time in public, for \npeace, putting the song, the music for the song in his pocket, and then \nstruck down by a bullet. There is something in the coincidence of those \nmovements that perhaps none of us will ever quite understand, but it \ncertainly is a symbol that will always be remembered.\n  This was quite a week in the history of Israel, the history of \ndemocracy, the history of man. Lessons were taught in a short burst of \ngunfire that must caution us that extremes in language, in gesture, in \ntone, can turn into much more menacing things. Civility has to come \nback to our people, to people across the world, to democratic nations.\n  Mr. President, we see it in the Congress of the United States, where \nanger and rage takes over discussion. It has an effect that pervades \nour society. We should not let it happen and this tragic incident \nshould remind us all that we have to control our speech, our \nrelationships, our view, if our mission is to make peace. One does not \nhave to be in a formal war to want to make peace.\n  So, we say goodbye with heavy hearts to this great man who proved by \nhis own existence, his own experience, that making war could not save \nlives, it could not have people living in peace together, but a serious \neffort at shaking hands across a sea of differences could make the \ndifference.\n  When I saw Chairman Arafat in his traditional dress that I had come \nto despise over the years--he wore a gun on his hip when he went to the \nUnited Nations--I could not forgive him for their terrorist activities. \nBut I forgave him when he came here and shook hands. That was the \nmoment that he earned my respect.\n  So, from that place where it all began in the Middle East, in those \nholy sites, perhaps the time has come when we will be, once again, able \nto make peace with one another. That is the proper place. This is the \nproper time.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/08/senate-section/article/S16812-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16813-S16815]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DIRECT LENDING PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, it so happens that today is the 30th \nanniversary of the signing of the Higher Education Act of 1965 by \nPresident Lyndon Johnson. Everyone knows it was a great step forward.\n  Today, according to press reports, the conferees on reconciliation \nagreed that they would cut back on assistance to higher education and \ndirect lending, which is now used by more than 1,300 colleges and \nuniversities in this Nation, including some colleges and universities \nin Oklahoma, every one of whom wants to keep the system.\n  There is not a college or university that is using direct lending \nthat wants to shift back into the old system. Let me just say, the new \nsystem reduces paperwork, makes it much easier for students and \ncolleges and universities, and the new system is good for taxpayers. \nThe old system has all kinds of paperwork. The old system says, ``If \nyou have a student loan, you have to pay back x number of dollars \nwhether you're employed or unemployed.''\n  The new system permits a student to have an income-contingent loan, \nso that if a student wants to become a teacher and not earn so much, \nthen the student could pay back a smaller percentage or a smaller sum; \nwhile if a student became a lawyer, or a stockbroker, maybe earning \nquite a bit of money, that student would pay back a larger sum. If a \nstudent was unemployed, while that student was unemployed, you would \nnot pay back anything.\n  What happened in conference is they have agreed to cut back from 40 \npercent assistance, 40 percent of the schools, which is the cap now, \ndown to 10 percent.\n  Now, I do not know who is going to tell those students in Oklahoma \nwhich three out of four of them are going to be out of the direct loan \nprogram. I am glad I am not going to have to make that decision. And I \nam pleased that the President, I think, is going to veto this.\n  Who benefits by cutting it back to 10 percent, giving a 90 percent \nmonopoly to the banks and to the guaranty agencies? The banks and the \nguaranty agencies do. The guaranty agencies, incidentally, were created \nby us. These are not free enterprise operations. The guaranty agencies \nhave the Federal Government guarantee. The one in Indianapolis, for \nexample, the chief executive officer of the guaranty agency in \n\n[[Page S 16814]]\nIndianapolis is paid $627,000 a year. We pay the President of the \nUnited States $200,000 a year. And they are spending $750,000 to lobby \nagainst us.\n  It is very interesting, Mr. President, my chief cosponsor on direct \nlending was the distinguished Republican Senator from Minnesota, \nSenator David Durenberger. And Senator Durenberger said in response, \nwhen he was asked about this, ``Shouldn't we let the free enterprise \nsystem work?''--that is what I want; I want to see competition; I want \nto see the schools in Oklahoma and Illinois and every other State have \na choice between the old system and the new system and have \ncompetition--but Senator David Durenberger said, ``This is not the free \nmarket. It is a free lunch.''\n  It is not competition. We say in the law, banks get the Treasury rate \nplus 3.1 percent. We write into the law what their profits are, and \nthey do not want to give it up.\n  Now, if we want to have a banking assistance act, let us call it \nthat. But if we want to have a student assistance act, then let us try \nand see what we can do to help the students.\n  I hear all kinds of speeches about paperwork on both sides of the \naisle. Here is a program that cuts down dramatically on paperwork, and \nwe are going to put it back in. I just do not think it makes sense.\n  There is an article in Rolling Stone. I confess, I am not a regular \nreader of Rolling Stone, Mr. President, but here is an article on this. \nI ask unanimous consent to have this article printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Rolling Stone, Oct. 19, 1995]\n\n                  Student Loans--The Price of Politics\n\n                           (By David Samuels)\n\n       It was a nightmare,'' says Karen Fooks, director of \n     financial aid at the University of Florida, recalling the bad \n     old days of guaranteed student loans. ``We have about 35,000 \n     students, who come from all over the country, and so every \n     time a student came in to find out what was going on with his \n     loan, it became a game of hide-and-seek: Was it a student \n     problem, a bank problem, a guarantee-agency problem? Nobody \n     knew,'' With 8,000 banks making loans and 38 guarantee \n     agencies backing the loans with support from the government, \n     Fooks' confusion is understandable. ``At the beginning of the \n     year,'' says Susan O'Flaherty, acting director of financial \n     aid at the University of Colorado at Boulder, ``we ran a \n     phone bank with six or seven full-time people. And 70 to 80 \n     percent of the calls that came in had something to do with \n     student loans.''\n       Vanishing checks and bureaucratic red tape, however, are \n     only bad memories now at Florida, CU-Boulder and more than \n     100 other schools nationwide, where last year the federal \n     direct-lending program replaced multiple applications, banks \n     and guarantors with a single application and a single lender: \n     the federal government. This fall, direct lending is debuting \n     on an additional 1,400 campuses nationwide and will cover \n     close to 40 percent of all student loans. What should \n     students expect from the new direct-loan system? ``We can \n     answer students' questions,'' O'Flaherty says. ``And our \n     counseling staff was like `Wow! We're not spending all our \n     time chasing paper. We're actually talking to students.' '' \n     Karen Fooks is more enthusiastic still. ``Students understand \n     it; we understand it; the money comes in faster,'' she says. \n     ``We think we died and went to heaven.'' Students have even \n     more reason to like direct lending: They can pay back their \n     loans over 25 years as a percentage of income--between 3 \n     percent and 15 percent, depending on their salary and number \n     of children.\n       If direct lending is a success on campus, however, a very \n     different story is now unfolding in Washington, where \n     Congressional Republicans are threatening this fall to use \n     the budget-reconciliation process to kill what one Colorado \n     State University student called ``the best thing since \n     microwaveable brownies.'' What is odd here is that direct \n     lending is as much the brainchild of Republicans as of \n     Democrats: Direct lending was proposed--and a pilot program \n     implemented--by George Bush's Department of Education; Rep. \n     Tom Petri, R-Wis., has long been direct lending's leading \n     advocate in the House. With the Republican Congress having \n     promised to balance the federal budget, direct lending should \n     be more appealing than ever: Slashing federal subsidies to \n     banks and guarantors will save taxpayers as much as $12 \n     billion during the next five years.\n       Why are Republicans turning against a program they \n     sponsored? One explanation may be what Sen. Paul Simon calls \n     ``pure commercial politics'': What students and taxpayers \n     gain under direct lending, banks and guarantee agencies will \n     lose. Short of high-interest credit cards, guaranteed student \n     loans are the most profitable loans a bank can make, miles \n     ahead of auto loans and home mortgages. The ``guarantee'' in \n     every guaranteed student loan means that it is impossible \n     for the banks to lose money: 98 to 100 percent of every \n     loan is guaranteed by the government, along with a built-\n     in profit of 3.1 percent above the prime lending rate, \n     plus fees and bonuses. The subsidies paid out to guarantee \n     agencies alone--including the interest on $1.8 billion in \n     taxpayer funds they control, a bonus of 27 percent of \n     every defaulted loan on which they collect and borrowers' \n     fees that can climb as high as $80 for every $1,000 in \n     loans--add up to an annual $638 million tax-free gift from \n     the federal government. ``This is not the free market,'' \n     former Republican Sen. Dave Durenberger famously remarked \n     of the guaranteed student loan, ``it's a free lunch.''\n       Students struggling to make ends meet on borrowed dollars \n     will be interested to learn how the guarantee agencies divide \n     their share of the student-loan pie. Assistant Inspector \n     General Steven McNamara, a nonpartisan Education Department \n     employee, has conducted audits of guarantee agencies under \n     presidents Reagan, Bush and Clinton. ``We looked at 12 \n     guarantee agencies, which accounted for 68 percent of new-\n     loan volume,'' McNamara says, citing the inspector general's \n     recent report on the seamier side of the student-loan \n     business. ``Nine of the 12 were affiliated with organizations \n     that they were required by law to monitor, and our conclusion \n     was that these potential conflicts of interest placed about \n     $11 billion in student-loan funds at risk.''\n       State by state, the guarantee agencies' record of fraud, \n     conflict of interest and other abuses demonstrates that they \n     are as cavalier with taxpayer dollars year-round as they are \n     with loan checks at the beginning of the semester:\n       In South Dakota, the directors of the Education Assistance \n     Corp. used federal funds to purchase an office building from \n     themselves for $150,000, while buying furs, artwork and cars \n     for the enjoyment of the corporation staff. Board meetings \n     and retreats were held in such educational locales as the Don \n     CeSar resort, in Florida, and the Marriott Desert Springs \n     resort, in California.\n       Indiana's USA Group built itself a palatial 30-acre \n     headquarters, including a 450-seat employee cafeteria and a \n     150-seat theater--and paid its CEO, Roy Nicholson, $619,949 \n     in 1993. Nicholson's salary is exceeded only by the amount \n     USA plans to spend this year on lobbying Congress--$750,000, \n     according to one published report.\n       In Massachusetts, officers of American Student Assistance \n     set up a corporation that billed their own guarantee agency \n     $540,000, a use of public-sector funds that--under current \n     law--is legal.\n       The Texas Guaranteed Student Loan Corp. gave the Austin law \n     firm of Ray, Wood & Fine a loan-collection contract worth $5 \n     million. Subsequently, the firm contributed at least $10,000 \n     to the reelection campaign of Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock, who sat \n     on the Texas board. ``Buck Wood happens to be a good friend \n     of mine,'' Bullock told the Houston Chronicle. ``I talk to \n     him frequently about a lot of things.'' The inspector \n     general's investigation found that Wood's law firm didn't \n     bother to write the required semiannual collection letter to \n     104 out of 136 randomly selected students. Conflicts of \n     interest at the Texas guaranteed-student-loan agency have \n     reportedly cost taxpayers $178 million.\n       Pennsylvania's state guarantee agency has 2,000 employees--\n     as many as are employed in the Department of Education's \n     headquarters in Washington. Jobs at the agency are such \n     political plums that President Jay Evans was offered a $1 \n     million ``platinum parachute'' to retire so Gov. Robert Casey \n     could put a top aide in the job. When Evans declined to \n     retire, he was given a no-show job with the agency at a \n     salary $20,000 higher than the governor's.\n       Inefficiency and outright fraud are so common under the \n     guaranteed-student-loan system that even some Republicans \n     have broken with their party's traditional support for \n     corporate interests. According to Charles Kolb, assistant \n     secretary for planning, budget and evaluation in the Bush \n     Education Department, ``Conservatives in Congress are being \n     terribly misled'' by loan-industry lobbyists anxious about \n     preserving their profits. ``I'm a conservative Republican,'' \n     Kolb says, ``and I'm a big believer in what Newt Gingrich has \n     done. If what you're trying to do is reduce the role of the \n     government, you ought to be in favor of eliminating the \n     middlemen and all the red tape.'' Asked whether direct \n     lending will replace private enterprise with hundreds of \n     government bureaucrats, as some Republicans have charged, \n     Kolb laughs. ``If socialized profits are private enterprise, \n     then, yeah, maybe, sure.''\n       Rep. William Goodling of Pennsylvania, chairman of the \n     Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities, which \n     will determine the fate of direct lending in the House, has \n     his doubts. ``We have no idea whether the Education \n     Department can be the biggest bank in the country,'' he says, \n     ``and the biggest debt collector as well.'' Legislation that \n     Goodling sponsored last term in the House would have limited \n     direct lending to 40 percent of existing loans; he is now in \n     favor of eliminating direct lending entirely, he says, \n     because he believes it will save money, and because of the \n     ``arrogance'' of the Education Department officials. ``I'm \n     not the person who drove us to this point,'' Goodling says, \n     sounding--in this moment, at least--less like a believer in \n     the merits of the old guaranteed student loan than like a man \n     whose toes have been stepped on once too often. ``It was \n     their president who said to us, bluntly, `You go jump in a \n     lake. We're \n\n[[Page S 16815]]\n     doing this in two years no matter what happens.' ''\n       The fate of direct lending in Congress this fall may have \n     more to do with partisan politics than with the merits of \n     either the old guaranteed student loans or the new direct \n     loans. What Bill Goodling objects to the most, it seems, is \n     what he describes as a White House ploy to turn direct \n     lending into ``the cornerstone of this president's term in \n     office.'' He points to the multimillion-dollar Education \n     Department publicity campaign--including television \n     commercials, print ads and millions of individual letters to \n     borrowers--trumpeting the merits of what it calls ``President \n     Clinton's New Direct Student Loan Program.'' Are the \n     Democrats playing politics with student loans, too? Secretary \n     of Education Richard Riley defends the advertisements, noting \n     that ``if the program was a failure, it would surely be \n     President Clinton's program.''\n       With both Democrats and Republicans intent on turning \n     direct loans into a political football, students may find \n     themselves facedown in the dust. Which is a shame, because, \n     as Richard Riley puts it, ``borrowing is easier and faster, \n     and students I talk to are almost elated about the \n     difference. And it's clearly a savings for taxpayers.'' The \n     banks and guarantee agencies that disagree with Riley are \n     already having their say in Congress; students, so far, have \n     been silent.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, it says:\n\n       State by State, the guarantee agencies' record of fraud, \n     conflict of interest and other abuses demonstrates that they \n     are as cavalier with taxpayer dollars year-round as they are \n     with loan checks at the beginning of the semester.\n\n  Another quotation:\n\n       The fate of direct lending in Congress this fall may have \n     more to do with partisan politics than with the merits of \n     either the old guaranteed student loans or the new direct \n     loans.\n\n  It should not be political. One of the things--and I am sure the \nSenator from Oklahoma, who is presiding, has heard me say this before--\none of the things that is bad about Congress, worse than when I came to \nCongress 21 years ago, is the increasing partisanship on both sides. \nBoth parties are to blame. But this is an issue that should not be \npartisan. It was originally conceived of by Congressman Tom Petri of \nWisconsin, a Republican. I took the idea from him and introduced it in \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  It is interesting, the ``Bond Buyer,'' a publication also I do not \nread regularly, I have to say, Mr. President, talking about this new \nagreement of a 10-percent limit, says:\n\n       This is an important step in the right direction for State \n     guarantee agencies.\n\n  I want to take an important step for students, for colleges and \nuniversities.\n  It also points out that these agencies have tax-exempt bonds for \nthose who are interested in the tax-exempt bond market. One of the \npluses of direct loans is, frankly, they do not use tax-exempt bonds, \nso the Federal Treasury gets additional income, one of the things that \nis not calculated in this skewed calculation we make.\n  This is one program the President of the United States really \nunderstands. He came to my office when he was a candidate, and we \ntalked about this. He gave a speech at Georgetown University about \ndirect lending and how we have to simplify loans and reduce the \npaperwork and do a better job for the students of the United States. He \nspoke about it frequently on the campaign trail. He was down in \nCarbondale, IL, which is near my home, just a few weeks ago at Southern \nIllinois University and spoke about the program. He has spoken about it \nat Rutgers and elsewhere.\n  I hope when we get past the Presidential veto; that we sit down and \nask ourselves, No. 1, what is best for the students; No. 2, what is \nbest for the colleges and universities; and No. 3, what is best for the \ntaxpayers. I think if we ask those three simple questions, then I hope \nwe will come to the conclusion the best way is to give people the \noption: If you want to go with the old program, you can go with the old \nprogram. If you want to go with the new program, you can go with the \nnew program. But to say to the schools in Oklahoma and Illinois, three-\nfourths of you who like the new Direct Loan Program, three-fourths of \nyou are going to have to get rid of that program, I do not think we \nshould do that. Talk about unfunded mandates. They not only reduce \npaperwork, they reduce the work of personnel in colleges and \nuniversities. That is what we ought to be about.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope we do the right thing after we get through \nthis first phase of reconciliation that is going nowhere, and then sit \ndown and work together and come up with what is sensible for the \nstudents, for the future of our country.\n  It is interesting that some years back, prior to your being here or \nmy being here, Mr. President, right after World War II, there was a big \ndebate among veterans organizations. The American Legion wanted to have \nan education program, and the other veterans groups wanted to have a \ncash bonus. Fortunately, the American Legion won out, and we had the GI \nbill, which has been a huge plus for the country. If we had had the \ncash bonus, it would have been frittered away, and we would have gotten \nnothing out of it.\n  We kind of face the same thing now. Do we cut back on assistance to \nstudents, or do we have this tax cut? The tax cut is $345 billion, and \nthe cutback on students is only $10 billion. We can have both, but I do \nnot think you build a better, finer America by cutting back on \neducational opportunities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/08/senate-section/article/S16813-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16815]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION ACT--AN UNHAPPY BIRTHDAY\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, 30 years ago today President Johnson \nsigned into law the Higher Education Act of 1965. I served on the \ncommittee that approved the bill, and it passed the Senate by voice \nvote, without opposition.\n  When he signed the bill at Southwest Texas State College, in San \nMarcos, TX, President Johnson noted that: ``The President's signature \nupon this legislation passed by Congress will swing open a new door for \nthe young people of America. For them, and for this entire land of \nours, it is the most important door that will ever open--the door to \neducation.''\n  Yet today, for the first time in 30 years, we are in danger of \nclosing that door. The Republican budget proposes the largest education \ncuts in the Nation's history--$36 billion over the 7-year budget \nperiod. This is an extraordinarily severe cutback that will harm \nschools and colleges, parents and children across the country.\n  Under the Republican plan, student loans for college will be cut by \n$4.9 billion. The remainder of the cuts will come from Pell grants, \nCollege Work Study, Head Start, Title One, Goals 2000, and other \ninitiatives that Congress has passed with strong bipartisan support.\n  This is no time to cut education. When we passed the Higher Education \nAct, the post-war baby-boom students were entering college in record \nnumbers. In the years ahead, the sons and daughters of that generation \nwill be applying to colleges in record numbers--yet Congress will be \nslamming the door on them.\n  The Republican budget means that 1,000,000 students will lose the \nchance for Pell grants, or see them reduced in value by 40 percent. It \nwill dismantle the direct loan program that has brought lower costs and \nbetter service to students and colleges. It will slash aid to public \nschools across the country. Cutting education as we enter the \ninformation age is like cutting defense at the height of the cold war. \nIt is wrong, and it makes no sense.\n  For 30 years, we have honored the principle that education is the key \nthat unlocks the American dream. On this anniversary, I urge Congress \nto recommit itself to that fundamental principle. There is still time \nto do the right thing for education in the current budget battle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/08/senate-section/article/S16815-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16815-S16816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION ACT\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today marks the 30th anniversary of the \nenactment of the Higher Education Act of 1965 and I am pleased to take \nthis opportunity to comment on what is, in my view, a truly landmark \npiece of legislation in this country.\n  Every nation puts a premium on education in order to develop the \nskills and talents of its people in order to succeed in a modern, \ncomplex economic society. That is true whether the country is governed \nas a democracy or a dictatorship or somewhere in between--each is \nconcerned with enhancing the skills of its people in the workplace. \nImproving the skills of the American worker and providing education \nopportunities for all are goals which epitomize the spirit of what it \n\n[[Page S 16816]]\nmeans to be an American. They are worthwhile, honorable goals that have \nalways been a priority of this Senator.\n  The Higher Education Act, enacted in 1965 to provide disadvantaged \nstudents with greater educational opportunities, recognized the shared \nbenefit of providing every American a chance to maximize his or her \npotential. As a result of the passage of this legislation, doors have \nbeen opened to millions of citizens who otherwise would not have had \nthe access or the resources to obtain a higher education. Although the \nact has been amended over the years through the reauthorization \nprocess, the central purposes of the legislation has remained the \nsame--to ensure access, choice and opportunity in higher education.\n  In light of the tremendous success of this legislation, I am \ndisturbed by the draconian budget cuts being advanced by the current \ncongressional leadership which would effectively undermine the \ndirectives of the Higher Education Act. It is particularly distressing \nwhen you realize that those who are now seeking to draw back from the \nAmerican commitment to education through the cuts included in budget \nreconciliation are, at the same time, propounding the necessity for \nAmerica to compete more successfully in the world's economy. In my \nview, they are asserting a basic contradiction. Our success as a \ncompetitor in the world's economy rests upon educating our future \ngenerations.\n  Republican budget proposals would dramatically decrease educational \nopportunity in order to finance tax cuts for the wealthy and to meet \narbitrary deficit reduction targets. In my view, Republican budget \nproposals clearly renege on our historical commitment to improving \naccess to higher education by placing an undue burden on students and \ntheir families over the next 7 years. It makes little sense to cut \ninvestments in programs which give people the skills to function in a \nmodern, complex society. It makes even less sense to do so in a \ndocument which is repeatedly purported to be a budget for our Nation's \nfuture.\n  As you know, the Senate was successful in eliminating several of the \nmore onerous provisions in the education portion of the budget \nreconciliation--including the .85 percent tax on colleges and \nuniversities on their Federal student loan volume, the 6-month \npost graduation interest-free grace period on student loans, and the \ninterest increase on PLUS loans. However, I remain concerned about what \nwill be contained in the final package.\n\n  I also regret that efforts to retain current law with respect to the \nFederal direct lending program were unsuccessful. The Republican budget \nplan severely curtails the Federal direct lending program by placing a \n20 percent cap on loan volumes. The Department of Education estimates \nthat by the close of the current academic year, direct lending will \nrepresent between 35-40 percent of this year's student loan volume. \nShould this provision become law, nearly half of the students involved \nin the direct loan program will have their financial aid disrupted, \nsubjecting them to additional conversion fees and the tremendous \nanxiety involved in having your financial aid in question.\n  I have heard from students and educators from across Maryland who \nhave expressed their deep concern about proposed modifications to the \ndirect lending program. One of the first campuses to offer direct \nlending to its students is in my hometown of Salisbury. The president \nof Salisbury State University, as well as the chancellor of the \nUniversity of Maryland System--which enrolls more than 130,000 \nstudents, strongly support the direct lending program as beneficial to \nboth students and university administrators.\n  Mr. President, education in this country has always provided an \nessential ladder of opportunity for our people and the Higher Education \nAct has been and continues to be a critical rung in this ladder. In a \nnation which believes that a person's merit and talent should take them \nas far as they can go, we must continue to foster a path which allows \nthem to maximize this potential. Many of us here today have benefited \nfrom this philosophy and have achieved certain levels of success as a \ndirect result of the opportunities afforded by such principles. It is \nironic, at best, that many of those who have utilized these \nopportunities to advance themselves are now trying to severely limit \nthem for others through draconian budget measures.\n  As we commemorate the enactment of the Higher Education Act of 1965, \nit is important to understand that the value of programs authorized by \nthis bill cannot be measured simply in terms of dollars spent. Without \nFederal support, millions of Americans would not have been able to \nattend college or receive the advanced training required to make them \ncontributing, productive members of society. If this Nation is to \ncontinue to thrive in an ever-evolving global economy, we must not \nunderestimate the value of the Federal Government's commitment to \nhigher education. The celebration of the passage of this bill affords \nus the opportunity to reaffirm the Federal role in making certain that \neducation remains a top national priority.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/08/senate-section/article/S16815-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION ACT\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, 30 years ago today, president Lyndon B. \nJohnson signed into law the Higher Education Act. We should not let \nthis anniversary pass without recognizing the profound effect this act \nhas had in opening the doors of higher education for millions of \ndeserving Americans who otherwise would have found a college education \nbeyond their financial reach.\n  I have said many times that education is a capital investment. No \npiece of Federal legislation is more compelling evidence of the benefit \nof that investment than is the Higher Education Act. Every study we \nknow demonstrates that an individual's climb up the economic ladder is \ndirectly related to the amount of education he or she receives. Without \nquestion, the opportunities provided because of the higher Education \nAct and its reauthorizations over the past 30 years demonstrate not \nonly the importance of this investment but also the gains we have made \nbecause of this act.\n  It is through the Higher Education Act that vital programs such as \nguaranteed student loans, aid to developing colleges, and educational \nopportunity grants have developed into the critical initiatives that \nthey are today. It was within the context of this legislation that we \ndeveloped the Pell grant program, which combined with the guaranteed \nloan program, has become far and away the largest source of aid for \nlow- and middle-income students. Today, Federal student aid constitutes \nmore than 75 percent of all aid available to students to pay for a \ncollege education.\n  Over the years, it is unquestionable that without Federal student \naid, literally millions of American students would have been unable to \nattain a college degree and to pursue productive, meaningful careers \nthat otherwise would have been beyond their reach.\n  I am honored to have been here when this act began, and to have \nstrongly supported its establishment. Through my work on the Education \nSubcommittee, I am honored to have played a part in refining it over \nthe years. And I am especially honored to be here today to acknowledge \nits very significant achievements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/08/senate-section/article/S16816-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16816-S16817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, on that evening in 1972 when I first was \nelected to the Senate, I made a commitment to myself that I would never \nfail to see a young person, or a group of young people, who wanted to \nsee me.\n  It has proved enormously beneficial to me because I have been \ninspired by the estimated 60,000 young people with whom I have visited \nduring the nearly 23 years I have been in the Senate.\n  Most of them have been concerned that the total Federal debt which is \nabout $15 billion shy of $5 trillion--which will be exceeded this year. \nOf course, Congress is responsible for creating this monstrosity for \nwhich the coming generations will have to pay.\n  The young people and I almost always discuss the fact that under the \nU.S. Constitution, no President can spend a dime of Federal money that \nhas not first been authorized and appropriated by both the House and \nSenate of the United States. \n\n[[Page S 16817]]\n\n  That is why I began making these daily reports to the Senate on \nFebruary 25, 1992. I wanted to make a matter of daily record the \nprecise size of the Federal debt which as of yesterday, Tuesday, \nNovember 7, stood at $4,985,913,011,032.65 or $18,926.61 for every man, \nwoman, and child in America on a per capita basis.\n  The increase in the national debt since my report yesterday--which \nidentified the total Federal debt as of close of business on Monday, \nNovember 6, 1995--shows an increase of $1,175,550,073.33. That increase \nis equivalent to the amount of money needed by 174,311 students to pay \ntheir college tuitions for 4 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/08/senate-section/article/S16816-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             YITZHAK RABIN\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, Israel and the world have lost one of the \ngreatest leaders of our generation. As so many great men before him, \nYitzhak Rabin lost his life at the hands of an assassin: an angry young \nman, a spoiler of peace, and a traitor to his people and all those who \nsought peace in that troubled region.\n  Yitzhak Rabin was first a military hero and, late in life, a soldier \nfor the cause of peace. It is as this role as peacemaker that we \nAmericans have come to know him best. He was the man who did what none \nwould have thought possible by extending his hand to shake the hand of \nhis long-time enemies, and to begin to deliver peace to his nation and \nto its neighbors.\n  It is the sad reality of a violent world that great men make many \nenemies and the peacemaker is the object of the hatred of those who do \nnot believe in peace. However, this great leader has left a legacy for \nall to carry on and, someday, to reap the rewards. Yitzhak Rabin helped \ngive his nation its first breath of life, and has led his nation toward \na better future. He helped bring flowers to a desert usually covered in \nblood, and has given to future generations the gift of the prospect of \npeace in our time. Yitzhak Rabin will surely be missed by his \ncountrymen and by Americans alike; his family, his country, and those \nwho will carry on his legacy are in our thoughts and prayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/08/senate-section/article/S16817-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DOROTHY HUSTEAD\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Dorothy Hustead, \nthe woman who helped put Wall Drug on maps all over the world. Dorothy, \nwho recently passed away, was a charming and pleasant woman who \ninspired many people. Dorothy was a South Dakota legend in her own \ntime. She took great pride in her work, her family, her community, and \nher faith. She was an example of the commonsense values that are \ntypical of a true South Dakotan.\n  It was Dorothy Hustead who invented the famous ``free ice water'' \nslogan that helped transform a small, struggling drugstore in the \ngeographical center of nowhere into one of South Dakota's top tourist \nattractions, drawing 15,000 to 20,000 people a day during the busy \nsummer months. The Hustead Drugstore, better known simply as Wall Drug, \nofficially opened on December 31, 1931. On a hot Sunday afternoon in \nJuly 1936, Dorothy came up with the idea to use highway signs to \nadvertise free ice water--a scarce item in that decade. Today, 270 \nhighway signs advertise the drugstore, including one strategically \nplaced in my Senate office reception room. It reads, ``1,523 miles to \nWall Drug''.\n  Even though the first 7 years of business were painfully hard, \nDorothy was always optimistic. Success was inevitable with her \nenthusiasm and dedication. Mrs. Hustead once summed up her philosophy: \n``I believe any person with patience, faith, humility, and courage \ncan--by hard work, enthusiasm, and by following a plan--succeed.''\n  Born on August 29, 1904, Dorothy began her rich and fulfilling life \nin the town of Colman, SD. This small town upbringing and her strong \nfamily ties instilled in her a deep respect for traditional values. She \ngraduated from Colman High School and attended the University of \nNebraska at Lincoln, where she was a member of the Delta Delta Delta \nSorority. It was there that she met her husband, Ted Hustead of Aurora, \nNE. Dorothy graduated from the University of Nebraska with a degree in \nEnglish and taught English and drama at Cathedral High School in Sioux \nFalls, SD.\n  The young Husteads lived and worked in several South Dakota towns--\nColman, Dell Rapids, Sioux Falls, Oldham, and Canova--before purchasing \ntheir small drugstore in Wall. Throughout the years, Dorothy worked \nsteadfastly beside Ted as a full partner at Wall Drug, acting as one of \nthe floor managers in charge of receipts. She was on the board of \ndirectors of Wall Drug Inc. until her recent death.\n  Dorothy was a member of the Society of Mayflower Descendants, the \nWall Book Club--of which she was one of the founders--and St. Patrick's \nCatholic Church. She, along with Ted, received the first Ben Black Elk \nAward in 1979, for excellence in the travel industry. November 12, \n1988, was proclaimed by South Dakota Gov. George Mickelson as ``Dorothy \nand Ted Hustead Day''.\n  Dorothy Hustead was a true friend to me and to thousands of other \nSouth Dakotans, as well as visitors to our State. I always will \nremember her fondly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/08/senate-section/article/S16817-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           HENRI TERMEER WINS THE ADL TORCH OF LIBERTY AWARD\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to take this \nopportunity to congratulate Henri Termeer on receiving the Torch of \nLiberty Award from the Anti-Defamation League of the New England \nRegion.\n  As chairman, chief executive officer, and president of Genzyme Corp., \nthe largest biotechnology company in Massachusetts and the fourth \nlargest in the world, Henri Termeer is well known to many of us in \nCongress as a leader of the industry and as chairman of the \nBiotechnology Industry Organization. In the course of his distinguished \ncareer, he has received numerous awards and extensive national \nrecognition for his accomplishments.\n  He also believes very deeply in the importance of public service, and \nhis career is an excellent example to others in the business world. He \nserves as chairman of the Mount Auburn Corporate Fund for Free Care, \nwhich provides free hospital care to homeless citizens and others in \nneed. He is also a director of the Massachusetts Cystic Fibrosis \nFoundation and a member of the Massachusetts Bay Endowment Committee of \nthe United Way.\n  Henri also has a strong commitment to education at all levels. He has \norganized a variety of programs to enhance math and science education \nin public schools in the Boston area. In addition, Genzyme sponsors \nscholarships for local high school students to pursue college studies \nin biotechnology and medicine, and the company conducts an extensive \nsummer internship program for local youths. Genzyme also provides \ngrants to the Tactical Training Initiative Program, which retrains \ndisplaced workers for manufacturing positions in the biotechnology \nindustry.\n  Henri's service as a trustee of the Boston Museum of Science and co-\nchairman of the museum's Biotechnology Committee has emphasized the \npreparation of minority youths for careers in biotechnology. Last year, \nhe received an award from the Biomedical Science Careers Project for \nhis leadership in supporting the education of minorities. The project \nis a cooperative effort of Harvard Medical School, the New England \nBoard of Higher Education, and the Massachusetts Medical Society.\n  In presenting the Torch of Liberty Award, the Anti-Defamation League \nalso praised Henri for his commitment to human rights. As the ADL \nstatement says,\n\n       Henri's leadership on issues of human rights and in the \n     promotion of understanding between people of diverse \n     religious, ethnic, and racial backgrounds makes him an \n     example by which others can be measured. The Anti-Defamation \n     League is proud to honor a man who has demonstrated a \n     lifetime of commitment to the goals and ideals which so \n     closely match the ADL's mission.\n\n  I commend Henri Termeer for this well-deserved award. Massachusetts \nis proud of his leadership, and all of us who know him are honored by \nhis friendship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/08/senate-section/article/S16817-3", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16817-S16818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           THE ASSASSINATION OF PRIME MINISTER YITZHAK RABIN\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, just over 2 years ago, I watched as Chairman \nof the Palestinian Liberation Organization Yasir Arafat and Prime \nMinister \n\n[[Page S 16818]]\nYitzhak Rabin shook hands across a centuries old divide. With that \nhandshake, they shed the weight of the past so they might find strength \nto conceive a different future.\n  Even the desk where they signed the Declaration of Principles \nestablishing Palestinian self-rule was symbolic of the long road they \nhad taken. It was the same desk used in 1979 by Egyptian President \nAnwar Sadat and Israeli Premier Menachem Begin when they signed the \nCamp David Accord.\n  But Saturday's assassination showed us all too painfully that even \nsuch powerful symbols cannot prevent the evil that is borne of \nextremism. They certainly can never prepare us for the deep sense of \nloss that cuts across religious, political and national lines.\n  And too, Rabin's assassination is an unfortunate reminder that all \ntoo often, it is death and crisis, rather than life and peace, that \nbinds us one to the other.\n  A writer for the Washington Post commented that Rabin's casket \n``looked too small somehow to contain the enormity of his passing,'' \nand a store owner in Jerusalem put up a closed sign with the message, \n``We are all orphans now.''\n  They understood the enormity of Rabin's passing, yet it was the \nsmallest voice--the voice of his grandaughter--that reminded all of us \nwhat the universal struggle for peace is all about. She understood that \nour fallen heros are the mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, \nbrothers and sisters of a country. And for those they've left behind, \nthere is no consolation.\n  When she spoke, the world understood that the stain of her \ngrandfather's death would forever cast a shadow over the ultimate goal \nof peace--a chill felt by the millions of others who have lost someone \nin that quest.\n  It was upon his descent into the inferno that Dante said ``I would \nnot have thought, death had undone so many * * *.'' But he might just \nas well have been speaking about Israel as the country mourned the loss \nof a remarkable leader, a remarkable man.\n  Mr. President, let me close by joining the countless others who have \nexpressed their sadness and regret at this senseless loss, and their \nrenewed commitment to the peace process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/08/senate-section/article/S16817-4", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   OSCAR DYSON, A FRIEND OF FISHERIES\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to note with great regret \nthe passing of one of Alaska's most prominent citizens, Oscar Dyson, on \nSaturday, October 28.\n  Oscar Dyson was a true pioneer and an authentic Alaskan sourdough who \nepitomized the can-do spirit of the Last Frontier.\n  Born in Rhode Island, he first came to Alaska in 1940, after working \nhis way across the country. When World War II began, he went to work \nbuilding airstrips for the Army Corps of Engineers. When Japanese \nairplanes attacked Dutch Harbor and invaded the Aleutian Islands, Oscar \nDyson was there.\n  After the war, Oscar truly came into his own. He started commercial \nfishing in 1946, beginning a career that would span generations and \nwould make him one of the most well-known and admired figures in the \nU.S. fishing industry.\n  Over the years, Oscar pioneered fishery after fishery. Starting as a \nsalmon and halibut fisherman after the war, he branched out into \nshrimp, king crab, and ultimately, into groundfish. In 1971, he made \nthe first-ever delivery of Alaska pollock to a shore-based U.S. \nprocessor, starting an industry that now has an annual harvest of over \nthree billion pounds--the largest single fishery in the United States \nand the fourth in value--which now represents a full 30 percent of the \nU.S. commercial harvest.\n  In the 1970's, while remaining an active fisherman, Oscar also \ndiversified, joining with several other fishermen to purchase what \nbecame a highly successful and innovative seafood processing company.\n  Oscar thought of himself--first, last, and always--as a fisherman. \nBut to those of us who knew him, he was far more. He knew that good \ncitizens must be ready to give something back to this great Republic, \nand he was as good as his word. He served 13 years on Alaska's Board of \nFisheries, and three terms on the Federal North Pacific Fishery \nManagement Council. He also served his country as an advisor and \nrepresentative in international fishery negotiations with Japan and \nRussia.\n  He didn't stop there. He was a founding member of the United \nFishermen's Marketing Association and the Alaska Draggers Association. \nHe gave his time to the Kodiak City Council, the Kodiak Community \nCollege, the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute, and the Alaska \nGovernor's Fishery Task Force, to name a few of many. And he worked \ntirelessly toward the goals of the Alaska Fisheries Development \nFoundation, and Kodiak's Fishery Industrial Technology Center. Always, \nhe helped lead his fellow fishermen toward a stronger, sustainable \nfuture.\n  In 1985, Oscar was chosen by National Fisherman magazine to receive \nits prestigious Highliner of the Year awards. And this year, just days \nbefore the fatal accident that took his life, he was made the National \nFisheries Institute's Person of the Year, the institute's highest \nhonor.\n  In all his endeavors, Oscar was strengthened and encouraged by the \nloving support of his wife, Peggy, who is herself known far and wide \nfor radio weather reports that have for years enhanced the safety of \nlife at sea and provided the daily comfort of a familiar and friendly \nvoice to mariners.\n  Finally let me note, and let us all remember, Oscar's strong belief \nin our Nation's youth. Both by example and by application, his \nkindness, humor, understanding, and sage advice guided generations of \nyoung people. He helped them learn the ropes, and they gained the \nconfidence to go out into the world and--like Oscar himself--to make it \nbetter. There can be no greater memorial.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/08/senate-section/article/S16818-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/08/senate-section/article/S16818-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session, the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/08/senate-section/article/S16818-3", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16818-S16820]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REPORT OF THE NOTICE OF THE CONTINUATION OF THE EMERGENCY REGARDING \n     WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 91\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  On November 14, 1994, in light of the dangers of the proliferation of \nnuclear, biological, and chemical weapons (``weapons of mass \ndestruction'') and of the means of delivering such weapons, I issued \nExecutive Order No. 12938, and declared a national emergency under the \nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) \nUnder section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. \n1622(d)), the national emergency terminates on the anniversary date of \nits declaration, unless I publish in the Federal Register and transmit \nto the Congress a notice of its continuation.\n  The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction continues to pose an \nunusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign \npolicy, and economy of the United States. Therefore, I am hereby \nadvising the Congress that the national emergency declared \n\n[[Page S 16819]]\non November 14, 1994, must continue in effect beyond November 14, 1995. \nAccordingly, I have extended the national emergency declared in \nExecutive Order No. 12938 and have sent the attached notice of \nextension to the Federal Register for publication.\n  As I described in the report transmitting Executive Order No. 12938, \nthe Executive order consolidated the functions of and revoked Executive \nOrder No. 12735 of November 16, 1990, which declared a national \nemergency with respect to the proliferation of chemical and biological \nweapons, and Executive Order No. 12930 of September 29, 1994, which \ndeclared a national emergency with respect to nuclear, biological, and \nchemical weapons, and their means of delivery.\n  The following report is made pursuant to section 204 of the \nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1703) and \nsection 401(c) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)), \nregarding activities taken and money spent pursuant to the emergency \ndeclaration. Additional information on nuclear, missile, and/or \nchemical and biological weapons (CBW) nonproliferation efforts is \ncontained in the annual Report on the Proliferation of Missiles and \nEssential Components of Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Weapons, \nprovided to the Congress pursuant to section 1097 of the National \nDefense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993 (Public Law \n102-190), also known as the ``Nonproliferation Report,'' and the annual \nreport provided to the Congress pursuant to section 308 of the Chemical \nand Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act of 1991 \n(Public Law 102-182).\n  The three export control regulations issued under the Enhanced \nProliferation Control Initiative (EPCI) are fully in force and continue \nto be used to control the export of items with potential use in \nchemical or biological weapons or unmanned delivery systems for weapons \nof mass destruction.\n  In the 12 months since I issued Executive Order No. 12938, 26 \nadditional countries ratified the Convention on the Prohibition of the \nDevelopment, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on \nTheir Destruction (CWC) for a total of 42 of the 159 signatories; the \nCWC must be ratified by 65 signatories to enter into force. I must \nreport my disappointment that the United States is not yet among those \nwho have ratified. The CWC is a critical element of U.S. \nnonproliferation policy and an urgent next step in our effort to end \nthe development, production, stockpiling, transfer, and use of chemical \nweapons. As we have seen this year in Japan, chemical weapons can \nthreaten our security and that of our allies, whether as an instrument \nof war or of terrorism. The CWC will make every American safer, and we \nneed it now.\n  The international community is watching. It is vitally important that \nthe United States continue to lead the fight against weapons of mass \ndestruction by being among the first 65 countries to ratify the CWC. \nThe Senate recognized the importance of this agreement by adopting a \nbipartisan amendment on September 5, 1995, expressing the sense of the \nSenate that the United States should promptly ratify the CWC. I urge \nthe Senate to give its advice and consent as soon as possible.\n  In parallel with seeking Senate ratification of the CWC, the United \nStates is working hard in the CWC Preparatory Commission (PrepCom) in \nThe Hague to draft administrative and implementing procedures for the \nCWC and to create a strong organization for verifying compliance once \nthe CWC enters into force.\n  The United States also is working vigorously to end the threat of \nbiological weapons (BW). We are an active participant in the Convention \non the Prohibition of the Development and Stockpiling of \nBacteriological (Biological) and Toxic Weapons and Their Destruction \n(BWC) Ad Hoc Group, which was commissioned September 1994 by the BWC \nSpecial Conference to draft a legally binding instrument to strengthen \nthe effectiveness and improve the implementation of the Convention. The \nGroup convened its first meeting in January 1995 and agreed upon a \nprogram of work for this year. The first substantive meeting took place \nin July, making important progress in outlining the key issues. The \nnext meeting is scheduled for November 27 to December 8, 1995. The U.S. \nobjective is to have a draft protocol for consideration and adoption at \nthe Fourth BWC Review Conference in December 1996.\n  The United States continues to be active in the work of the 29-member \nAustralia Group (AG) CBW nonproliferation regime, and attended the \nOctober 16-19 AG consultations. The Group agreed to a United States \nproposal to ensure the AG export controls and information-sharing \nadequately address the threat of CBW terrorism, a threat that became \nall too apparent in the Tokyo subway nerve gas incident. This U.S. \ninitiative was the AG's first policy-level action on CBW terrorism. \nParticipants also agreed to several amendments to strengthen the AG's \nharmonized export controls on materials and equipment relevant to \nbiological weapons, taking into account new developments since the last \nreview of the biological weapons lists and, in particular, new insights \ninto Iraq's BW activities.\n  The Group also reaffirmed the members' collective belief that full \nadherence to the CWC and the BWC will be the only way to achieve a \npermanent global ban on CBW, and that all states adhering to these \nConventions have an obligation to ensure that their national activities \nsupport these goals.\n  Australia Group participants are taking steps to ensure that all \nrelevant national measures promote the object and purposes of the BWC \nand CWC, and will be fully consistent with the CWC upon its entry into \nforce. The AG considers that national export licensing policies on \nchemical weapons-related items fulfill the obligation established under \nArticle I of the CWC that States Parties never assist, in any way, the \nacquisition of chemical weapons. Moreover, inasmuch as these measures \nare focused solely on preventing activities banned under the CWC, they \nare consistent with the undertaking in Article XI of the CWC to \nfacilitate the fullest possible exchange of chemical materials and \nrelated information for purposes not prohibited by the CWC.\n  The AG agreed to continue its active program of briefings for non-AG \ncountries, and to promote regional consultations on export controls and \nnonproliferation to further awareness and understanding of national \npolicies in these areas.\n  The United States Government determined that two foreign companies--\nMainway Limited and GE Plan--had engaged in chemical weapons \nproliferation activities that required the imposition of sanctions \nagainst them, effective May 18, 1995. Additional information on this \ndetermination is contained in a classified report to the Congress, \nprovided pursuant to the Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and \nWarfare Elimination Act of 1991.\n  The United States carefully controlled exports which could contribute \nto unmanned delivery systems for weapons of mass destruction, \nexercising restraint in considering all such proposed transfers \nconsistent with the Guidelines of the Missile Technology Control Regime \n(MTCR). The MTCR Partners continued to share information about \nproliferation problems with each other and with other possible \nsupplier, consumer, and transshipment states. Partners also emphasized \nthe need for implementing effective export control systems.\n  The United States worked unilaterally and in coordination with its \nMTCR partners in multilateral efforts to combat missile proliferation \nby nonmembers and to encourage non- members to export responsibly and \nto adhere to the MTCR Guidelines. Three new Partners were admitted to \nthe MTCR with U.S. support: Russia, South Africa, and Brazil.\n  In May 1995, the United States participated in an MTCR team visit to \nKiev to discuss missile nonproliferation and MTCR membership criteria. \nUnder Secretary of State Davis met with Ukraine's Deputy Foreign \nMinister Hryshchenko in May, July, and October to discuss \nnonproliferation issues and MTCR membership. As a result of the July \nmeeting, a United States delegation traveled to Kiev in October to \nconduct nonproliferation talks with representatives of Ukraine, brief \nthem on the upcoming MTCR Plenary, and discuss U.S. criteria for MTCR \nmembership. From August 29-September 1, the U.S. participated in \n\n[[Page S 16820]]\nan informal seminar with 18 other MTCR Partners in Montreux, \nSwitzerland, to explore future approaches to strengthening missile \nnonproliferation.\n  The MTCR held its Tenth Plenary Meeting in Bonn October 10-12. The \nPartners reaffirmed their commitment to controlling exports to prevent \nproliferation of delivery systems for weapons of mass destruction. They \nalso reiterated their readiness for international cooperation in \npeaceful space activities consistent with MTCR policies. The Bonn \nPlenary made minor amendments to the MTCR Equipment and Technology \nAnnex in the light of technical developments. Partners also agreed to \nU.S. initiatives to deal more effectively with missile-related aspects \nof regional tensions, coordinate in impeding shipments of missile \nproliferation concern, and deal with the proliferation risks posed by \ntransshipment. Finally, MTCR Partners will increase their efforts to \ndevelop a dialogue with countries outside the Regime to encourage \nvoluntary adherence to the MTCR Guidelines and heightened awareness of \nmissile proliferation risks.\n  The United States has continued to pursue my Administration's nuclear \nnonproliferation goals with success. Parties to the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) agreed last May at the NPT \nReview and Extension Conference to extend the NPT indefinitely and \nwithout conditions. Since the conference, more nations have acceded to \nthe Treaty. There now are 180 parties, making the NPT nearly universal.\n  The Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) continues its efforts to improve \nmember states' export policies and controls. Nuclear Suppliers Group \nmembers have agreed to apply technology controls to all items on the \nnuclear trigger list and to adopt the principle that the intent of the \nNSG Guidelines should not be undermined by the export of parts of \ntrigger list and dual-use items without appropriate controls. In 1995, \nthe NSG agreed to over 30 changes to update and clarify the list of \ncontrolled items in the Nuclear-Related Dual-Use Annex. The NSG also \npursued efforts to enhance information sharing among members by \nestablishment of a permanent Joint Information Exchange group and by \nmoving toward adoption of a United States Department of Energy-supplied \ncomputerized automated information exchange system, which is currently \nbeing tested by most of the members.\n  The increasing number of countries capable of exporting nuclear \ncommodities and technology is a major challenge for the NSG. The \nultimate goal of the NSG is to obtain the agreement of all suppliers, \nincluding nations not members of the regime, to control nuclear exports \nin accordance with the NSG guidelines. Members continued contacts with \nBelarus, Brazil, China, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, the Republic of Korea \n(ROK), and Ukraine regarding NSG activities. Ambassador Patokallio of \nFinland, the current NSG Chair, led a five-member NSG outreach visit to \nBrazil in early November 1995 as part of this effort.\n  As a result of such contacts, the ROK has been accepted as a member \nof the NSG. Ukraine is expected to apply for membership in the near \nfuture. The United States maintains bilateral contacts with emerging \nsuppliers, including the New Independent States of the former Soviet \nUnion, to encourage early adherence to NSG guidelines.\n  Pursuant to section 401(c) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. \n1641(c)), I report that there were no expenses directly attributable to \nthe exercise of authorities conferred by the declaration of the \nnational emergency in Executive Order No. 12938 during the period from \nMay 14, 1995, through November 14, 1995.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation \nAct of 1977 to minimize duplication in regulatory programs and to give \nStates exclusive responsibility under approved States program for \npermitting and enforcement of the provisions of that act with respect \nto surface coal mining and reclamation operations, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n the surface mining control and reclamation act of 1977 amendments act \n                                of 1995\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation in \nbehalf of myself, Senators Thomas, Simpson, Warner, and Hatch to amend \nthe Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977. I encourage my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n  The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act [SMCRA] was signed \ninto law by President Carter in the aftermath of the energy crisis, \nwhen coal regulation was considered crucial to the success of his \nnational energy program. In 1977, when this legislation was passed, \nthere were more than 6,000 operating coal mines. Today, the number of \noperating mines has been reduced approximately to half of the 1977 \nlevel. The questions which were first raised back then regarding the \nStates' abilities to effectively operate regulatory programs have been \nsatisfactorily answered and now is the time that we should reexamine \nthe role of OSM and the effectiveness of the current law.\n  When Congress passed SMCRA, it was agreed that the time had arrived \nfor tougher environmental standards for surface mining operations. \nSMCRA established specific environmental guidelines for surface mines, \nincluding requirements for water and soil treatment and remediation as \nwell as reclamation requirements for old and abandoned mines. It also \nestablished the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund and the Office of \nSurface Mining. Most \n\n[[Page S 16822]]\nimportantly, it established a framework under which States and the \nFederal Government could work in unison to administer this new law.\n  SMCRA was hailed as a model of cooperative State and Federal efforts. \nCongress passed it with the understanding that after an initial phase-\nin period, the States would assume responsibility for administering the \nlaw. It was understood that once States established environmental \nstandards which were equally as tough as Federal standards, States \nwould assume primacy and could administer their own administrative and \nenvironmental programs subject to approval of those programs by the \nOffice of Surface Mining.\n  Today 23 of the 26 coal producing States have assumed the role as the \nSMCRA regulating authority in these States. These primacy States have \ntheir mining programs periodically reviewed by OSM, which has \noccasionally exercised its Federal regulatory authority as necessary \nand expected under the SMCRA agreements.\n  Unfortunately, OSM has not relinquished full administrative oversight \nof SMCRA and still retains a great deal of regulatory authority that \nrightly belongs to the primacy States. The result has been the creation \nof a problematic, dual regulatory scheme in which OSM regularly issues \nnotice of violations [NOV's] directly to coal mine operators in primacy \nStates whenever OSM is dissatisfied with the way these States are \nadministering their own programs. This daily intervention in State \nprogram matters impacts the coal operators most who are often caught in \nbetween Federal-State disputes.\n  For example, the State of Utah obtained primacy for the \nadministration of SMCRA in 1983. We mine 24 million tons of coal \nannually from 13 active mines. These mines operate in compliance with \nthe environmental requirements of the Utah regulatory program and the \nmined lands are being returned to productive nonmining uses. In short, \nthe regulatory program is working and the intent and purpose of SMCRA \nis being fulfilled.\n  Since January 1993, OSM has taken five direct Federal enforcement \nactions against Utah. All five were based on disagreements between OSM \nand the State of Utah over interpretation of the program's language. \nNot one of the five violations concerned any environmental safety or \nenvironmental hazard. Three of the five enforcement actions were \ndismissed by the Department of Interior's own administrative law \njudges. The other two concerned a dispute between OSM and Utah \nconcerning the jurisdictional reach of the regulatory program. Both \nthese disputes concerned coal handling and processing equipment located \nat power plants. One has since been upheld and the other is pending an \nappeal. In each instance, OSM cited the operator for a practice or \ncondition which had already specifically been approved by the Utah \nprogram. Again, none of the violations concerned adverse off-site \nenvironmental impacts.\n  Direct Federal enforcement has not helped protect the citizens of \nUtah or the environment. Instead it has diverted scarce resources away \nfrom other, more productive work conducted by OSM, Utah, and Utah coal \noperators. Longstanding disagreements between OSM and the primacy \nStates have retarded the development of State regulatory programs, and \ncontinue to inhibit effective implementation. While significant \nimprovements have been made by OSM in recent months, several structural \nproblems continue to interfere with effective and efficient \nimplementation of the coal regulatory program. Again, the most \ntroublesome of these problems is the dual enforcement authority. Direct \nFederal enforcement in Utah has not only been ineffective and \nexpensive, it has been counterproductive environmentally.\n  Clearly there is a need to amend SMCRA to return the balance of \nauthority to the primacy States as originally intended by the law. This \nlegislation would make several technical amendments designed to \nacknowledge the role of those States as the primary regulatory agency \nwhere there is an approved State program. These proposed revisions \nwould eliminate the redundancy and confusion that occurs when \nduplicative State and Federal program provisions are applied directly \nto mining operations.\n  This legislation would also clarify that the authority to issue \nnotices of violations [NOV's] in primacy States rests exclusively with \nthe State regulatory authority, unless OSM first determines that the \nState regulatory authority has failed to properly administer the \nprogram, in which case direct Federal authority can be implemented. We \nhave also deleted the redundant reference to the Federal program \nprovisions to avoid any implication of Federal oversight authority to \nsuspend permits in a State with an approved regulatory program. I \nbelieve this clarifies the intent of SMCRA as originally passed.\n  The legislation would clarify that an operator's responsibility is to \nconform his operations to the terms and conditions of the approved \npermit for the mine. It also clarifies the regulatory agency's \nauthority to require revisions to a permit as necessary to ensure \ncompliance with the program requirements. Since many decisions of the \nadministrative law judges remain pending on appeal before the Interior \nBoard of Land Appeals for several years before a decision is issued \nunder the existing format, the legislation would eliminate the \nunnecessary requirement that, as established in OSM's rules, appeals of \ncertain agency decisions proceed through two layers of administrative \nreview prior to seeking judicial review. Finally, this legislation \nwould place a 3-year time limitation upon commencement of actions for \nalleged violations. This would encourage the more prompt initiation of \nany administrative or other actions.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, the coal regulatory program created by \nSMCRA has provided great benefit to the environment, the citizens of \nUtah, and the coal-mining community. The issues raised by this \nlegislation are not the fault of coal regulation itself, but are the \nproducts of an unclear delineation of responsibilities and authorities \nbetween the Federal OSM and the primacy States. These amendments will \nreestablish the intent of SMCRA by reinforcing the role of the States \nin administering their own regulations. This legislation makes good \nsense and I encourage my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. CRAIG (for himself, Mr. Johnston, and Mr. Kempthorne):\n  S. 1402. A bill to amend the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant Land \nWithdrawal Act and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n          The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant Land Withdrawal Act\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.\n  Madam President, today Senators Johnston, Kempthorne, and I are \nintroducing legislation to expedite the opening of the waste isolation \npilot plant. This legislation removes unnecessary and delaying \nbureaucratic requirements, achieves a major environmental objective, \nsaves the taxpayers money and, most significantly for the Nation and \nIdaho, begins the process of successfully cleaning up and \ndecommissioning the nuclear weapons complexes and temporary storage \nfacilities.\n  The waste isolation pilot plant is located in southeast New Mexico. \nIt is truly a unique project. Its specific purpose is to provide for \nthe safe disposal of transuranic radioactive and mixed waste resulting \nfrom defense activities and programs of the U.S. Government. The \nimportance of WIPP, however, extends beyond its stated mission.\n  Idaho currently stores the largest amount of transuranic waste of any \nState in the Union, but Idaho is not alone as a waste storage State. \nWashington, Colorado, South Carolina, and New Mexico also have large \namounts of transuranic waste in temporary storage. Until the WIPP \nopens, little can be done to clean up and close these temporary storage \nsites.\n  The agreement recently negotiated between the State of Idaho, the \nDOE, and the U.S. Navy, states that transuranic waste currently located \nin Idaho will begin to be shipped to WIPP by April 30, 1999. This \nlegislation will assure this commitment is fulfilled.\n  We cannot solve the environmental problems at sites such as Idaho's \nNational Engineering Laboratory, or Rocky Flats Weapons Facility, or \nSavannah River, or others, without this facility in New Mexico. The \nreason is \n\n[[Page S 16823]]\nobvious, Madam President. Without a place to dispose of the waste, \ncleanup is impossible. Without cleanup, further decommissioning cannot \noccur.\n  The goal of this bill is simple: To deliver on Congress' longstanding \ncommitment and open the WIPP facility by 1998.\n  This bill amends the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant Withdrawal Act of \n1992 in several very important and significant ways.\n  It deletes obsolete language of the 1992 act. Of particular \nimportance is the reference and requirements for test-phase activities. \nSince the enactment of the 1992 act, the Department of Energy has \nabandoned the test phase that called for underground testing in favor \nof aboveground laboratory test programs. Thus, the test phase no longer \nexists, as defined in the 1992 law, and needs to be removed so it does \nnot complicate the ongoing WIPP process.\n  Most important, this bill will streamline the process, remove \nduplicative regulations, save taxpayers dollars--repeat, save taxpayers \ndollars, hundreds of millions of dollars--and have the following \neffects:\n  The existing law contains a 180-day waiting period between the time \nthe Secretary of Energy makes a decision to operate the WIPP and the \nactual commencement of disposal operations. My bill eliminates this \nwaiting period. The 180 days constitutes an unnecessary delay. \nEliminating 180 days saves $140 million or more in operational expenses \nduring the waiting period and will start the removal of this type of \nwaste from the aboveground storage in Idaho and other affected States 6 \nmonths earlier than now scheduled.\n  The bill requires the Secretary of Energy to determine if engineered \nor natural barriers in the facility are necessary. This change is \nconsistent with the concept of allowing actions at the WIPP to be based \non the technical needs of the WIPP.\n  Section 7, ``Compliance With Environmental Laws and Regulations,'' \nwill streamline DOE's compliance with applicable environmental laws.\n  In other words, Madam President, we are not stepping aside from the \ncurrent environmental commitment. We are assuring that all of it is \nmet, but that it is met on time and under standard.\n  Section 8 repeals the retrievability requirement which was an \noutgrowth of below-ground testing. With the replacement of the test \nphase by laboratory testing, retrievability no longer is needed. All \ntests are now performed in the laboratory and no transuranic waste is \nused in testing at the WIPP.\n  The bill deletes the need for a decommissioning plan which is a \nduplicative and costly legislative mandate. This plan is covered by the \ndisposal standards of the Land Withdrawal Act of 1992 and thus is not \nneeded.\n  It deletes the requirement for a no-mitigation determination. In a \nletter to Senator Kempthorne and me dated September 8, 1995, the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency started that a no-mitigation variance \nis duplicative because the WIPP is held by the other statutes to a \nhigher standard. EPA states, ``A demonstration of nonmitigation of \nhazardous constituents will not be necessary to adequately protect \nhuman health and the environment.'' Despite this view, EPA further \nstates that unless the current law is amended, the WIPP will be forced \nto comply with the no-mitigation standards. This unnecessary \nduplication would be time consuming and costly.\n  It allows the Secretary of Energy to dispose of a small amount of \nnondefense transuranic waste in the WIPP. In my opinion, this is a cost \neffective and safe way to dispose of a relatively minor amount of \nwaste.\n  But just as important, I would like to make clear what my bill does \nnot do.\n  This bill does not remove EPA as the DOE regulator of the WIPP. DOE \nhas stated numerous times that it does not want to self-regulate. The \nDepartment believes that having EPA as the regular will instill \nadditional public confidence in the certification process and the \nfacility itself, once it opens.\n  I am skeptical regarding EPA. EPA has a poor record of meeting \ndeadlines. The WIPP, as a facility, is ready to operate now and is \nbasically waiting on EPA's final approval. The schedule DOE has \nestablished to meet the opening dates is an aggressive but not entirely \nworkable timetable. It is aggressive only if EPA can accomplish its \ntasks on time. Because of EPA's demonstrated inability to meet \nschedules and to avoid imposing unnecessary large financial burdens on \nthe taxpayer, there is a strong sentiment in the Congress to remove EPA \nfrom the WIPP regulatory role. Based on assurances made to me by the \nEPA, my bill does not follow this course. However, if EPA again \nfalters, I will have to reconsider this position in future legislation.\n  Idaho and the Nation need to have the WIPP opened sooner rather than \nlater. Each day of delay is costly, and the potential dangers to the \nenvironment and human health resulting from the temporary storage of \nthis waste continue.\n  It is time to act. We must, if we are to clean up sites such as \nIdaho's. We must act to dispose of this task permanently and safety for \nfuture generations. This bill clears the way for action.\n  I encourage my colleagues to become cosponsors of this legislation. \nWe hope to move it expeditiously through the necessary committee and \nhearing process so that it can become law.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. INOUYE:\n  S. 1403. a bill to amend the Organic Act of Guam to provide \nrestitution to the people of Guam who suffered atrocities such as \npersonal injury, forced labor, forced marches, internment, and death \nduring the occupation of Guam in World War II, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                      the guam war restitution act\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, on August 14, 1945, Japan signed a \ndeclaration of surrender, facilitating the end of World War II. This \nyear we celebrated Victory Over Japan Day, to commemorate those who \nvaliantly fought for humanity and those who were the victims of \nunspeakable acts of racism, hate, and violence during World War II. We \nmust also remember those who were forced to endure Japanese occupation \nduring World War II. For nearly 3 years, the people of Guam endured \nwar-time atrocities and suffering. As part of Japan's assault against \nthe Pacific, Guam was bombed and invaded by Japanese forces within 3 \ndays of the infamous attack on Pearl Harbor. At that time, Guam was \nadministered by the U.S. Navy under the authority of a Presidential \nExecutive order. It was also populated by then-American nationals. For \nthe first time since the War of 1812, a foreign power invaded U.S. \nsoil.\n  In 1952, when the United States signed a peace treaty with Japan, \nformally ending World War II, it waived the rights of American \nnationals, including those of Guamanians, to present claims against \nJapan. As a result of this action, American nationals were forced to \nseek relief from the Congress of the United States.\n  Today, I rise to introduce the Guam War Restitution Act, which would \namend the Organic Act of Guam and provide restitution to those who \nsuffered atrocities during the occupation of Guam in World War II.\n  The Guam War Restitution Act would establish a Guam Restitution \nClaims Fund, which would provide specific damage awards to those who \nare survivors of the war, and to the heirs of those who died during the \nwar. The specific damage awards would be as follows: First, $20,000 for \nthe category of death; second, $7,000 for the category of personal \ninjury; and third, $5,000 for the categories of forced labor, forced \nmarch, or internment.\n  This act would also establish a Guam Restitution Trust Fund to \nprovide restitution to the heirs of those individuals who sustained \ninjuries during the war but died after the war. Eligible heirs would \nreceive restitution in the form of postsecondary scholarships, first-\ntime home ownership loans, and grants for other suitable purposes. In \naddition, the trust fund could provide research and public educational \nactivities to honor and memorialize the wartime events of Guam.\n  The U.S. Congress previously recognized its moral obligation to the \npeople of Guam and provided reparations relief by enacting the Guam \nMeritorious claims act on November 15, 1945 (Public Law 79-224). \nUnfortunately, the claims act was seriously flawed and did not \nadequately compensate Guam after World War II.\n\n[[Page S 16824]]\n\n  The Claims Act primarily covered compensation for property damage and \nlimited compensation for death or personal injury. Claims for forced \nlabor, forced march, and internment were never compensated because the \nClaims Act excluded these from awardable injuries. The enactment of the \nClaims Act was intended to make Guam whole. The Claims Act, however, \nfailed to specify postwar values as a basis for computing awards, and \nsettled on prewar values, which did not reflect the true postwar \nreplacement costs. Also, all property damage claims in excess of \n$5,000, as well as all death and injury claims, required congressional \nreview and approval. This action caused many eligible claimants to \nsettle for less in order to receive timely compensation. The Claims Act \nalso imposed a 1-year time limit to file claims, which was insufficient \nas massive disruptions still existed following Guam's liberation. In \naddition, English was then a second language to a great many \nGuamanians. While a large number spoke English, few could read it. This \nis particularly important since the Land and War Claims Commission \nrequired written statements and often communicated with claimants in \nwriting.\n  The reparations program was also inadequate because it become \nsecondary to overall reconstruction and the building of permanent \nmilitary bases. In this regard, the Congress enacted the Guam Land \nTransfer Act and the Guam Rehabilitation Act (Public Laws 79-225 and \n79-583) as a means of rehabilitating Guam. The Guam Land Transfer Act \nprovided the means of exchanging excess Federal land for resettlement \npurposes, and the Guam Rehabilitation Act appropriated $6 million to \nconstruct permanent facilities for the civic populace of the island for \ntheir economic rehabilitation.\n  Approximately $8.1 million was paid to 4,356 recipients under the \nGuam Meritorious Claims Act. Of this amount, $4.3 million was paid to \n1,243 individuals for death, injury, and property damage in excess of \n$5,000, and $3.8 million to 3,113 recipients for property damage below \n$5,000.\n  On June 3, 1947, former Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes \ntestified before the House Committee on Public Lands relative to the \nOrganic Act, and strongly criticized the Department of the Navy for \ntheir ``inefficient and even brutal handling of the rehabilitation and \ncompensation and war damage tasks.'' Secretary Ickes termed the \nprocedures as ``shameful results.''\n  In addition, a committee known as the Hopkins Committee was \nestablished by former Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal in 1947 to \nassess the Navy's administration of Guam and American Samoa. An \nanalysis of the Navy's administration of the reparation and \nrehabilitation program was provided to Secretary Forrestal in a March \n25, 1947 letter from the Hopkins Committee. The letter indicated that \nthe Department's confusing policy decisions greatly contributed to the \nprograms' deficiencies and called upon the Congress to pass legislation \nto correct its mistakes and provide reparations to the people of Guam.\n  In 1948, the U.S. Congress enacted the War Claims Act of 1948 (Public \nLaw 80-896), which provided reparation relief to American prisoners of \nwar, internees, religious organizations, and employees of defense \ncontractors. The residents of Guam were deemed ineligible to receive \nreparations under this act because they were American nationals and not \nAmerican citizens. In 1950, the U.S. Congress enacted the Guam Organic \nAct (81-630), granting Guamanians American citizenship and a measure of \nself-government.\n  The Congress, in 1962, amended the War Claims Act to provide for \nclaimants who were nationals at the time of the war and who became \ncitizens. Again, the residents of Guam were specifically excluded. The \nCongress believed that the residents of Guam were provided for under \nthe Guam Meritorious Claims Act. At that time, there was no one to \ndefend Guam, as they had no representation in Congress. The Congress \nalso enacted the Micronesian Claims Act for the Trust Territory of the \nPacific Islands, but again excluded Guam in the settlement.\n  In 1988, the Guam War Reparations Commission documented 3,365 \nunresolved claims. There are potentially 5,000 additional unresolved \nclaims. In 1946, the United States provided over $390 million in \nreparations to the Philippines, and over $10 million to the Micronesian \nIslands in 1971 for atrocities inflicted by Japan. In addition, the \nUnited States provided over $2 billion in postwar aid to Japan from \n1946-51. Further, the United States Government liquidated over $84 \nmillion in Japanese assets in the United States during the war for the \nexpress purpose of compensating claims of its citizens and nationals. \nThe United States did not invoke its authority to seize more assets \nfrom Japan under article 14 of the Treaty of Peace, as other Allied \nPowers had done. The United States, however, did close the door on the \nclaims of the people of Guam.\n  A companion measure to my bill, H.R. 2041, was introduced in the \nHouse of Representatives by Representative Robert Underwood. H.R. 2041, \nhowever, includes a provision assessing a 0.5 percent fee on the sale \nof United States military equipment to Japan. My bill does not include \nthe fee provision because, in my view, it would cause U.S. \nmanufacturers to be less competitive with other foreign manufacturers. \nImposing such a fee could lead to the loss of American jobs, which is \nof concern in light of the decline in defense spending.\n  The issue of reparations for Guam is not a new one for the people of \nGuam and for the U.S. Congress. It has been consistently raised by the \nGuamanian Government through local enactments of legislative bills and \nresolutions, and discussed with congressional leaders over the years.\n  The Guam War Restitution Act cannot fully compensate or erase the \natrocities inflicted upon Guam and its people during the occupation by \nthe Japanese military. However, passage of this act would recognize our \nGovernment's moral obligation to Guam, and bring justice to the people \nof Guam for the atrocities and suffering they endured during World War \nII. I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \ninserted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1403\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to enhance restitution to victims of crime, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n             The victim Restitution Enhancement Act of 1995\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I introduce the Victim \nRestitution Enhancement Act of 1995, an important piece of \nlegislation--called for in the Contract With America--which will help \nvictims of crime. I have long thought that swift and decisive \ncongressional action is needed in order to change some of the basic \ninjustice associated with our criminal justice system. I believe that \nthe way to do this is to change the focus of our energy and time to \nassisting and protecting victims of crime. And some of the bills that \nhave been introduced by Senator Nickels and Senator Hatch do an \nadmirable job of changing the focus.\n  Mr. President, this morning the Judiciary Committee, under the able \nleadership of Senator Hatch, conducted a very thorough hearing on \nmandatory victim restitution. At that hearing, we heard testimony from \na number of excellent witnesses, and one theme was particularly \nevident: We in Congress \n\n[[Page S 16827]]\nneed to make sure that victims can actually receive the restitution \nthey are due.\n  First and foremost, I am a practical man--somebody who looks at the \nway good ideas and good legislation actually functions in reality. My \nconcern with victim restitution is making sure that crime victims \nactually receive the restitution they are entitled to.\n  That is why I am introducing the Victim Restitution Enhancement Act \nto make sure that crime victims receive full restitution from \ncriminals.\n  In drafting this bill, I consulted with former U.S. attorneys and \nothers who have actually participated in the current system for victim \nrestitution. And I have incorporated practical, real world suggestions \nfrom these seasoned professionals.\n  Let me briefly summarize the key provisions of my bill:\n  First, my bill forces criminals to submit sworn affidavits listing \ntheir assets after being convicted. If criminals try to hide their \nassets, or lie about them, they can be prosecuted for perjury, since \ntheir asset listing is under oath.\n  Second, my bill requires that criminals pay off their restitution \ndebts immediately, or at least within 5 years; currently, some \ncriminals have been able to stretch payments over an extended period of \ntime, making victims wait longer for their due.\n  Third, my bill provides that bankruptcy proceedings will not \ndischarge a criminal's duty to pay restitution.\n  Fourth, my bill establishes an automatic lien on all of a criminal's \nassets immediately upon conviction for an offense which gives rise to \nrestitution liability.\n  Fifth, importantly, my bill provides that prisoners who file prisoner \nlawsuits must notify their victims in writing of the lawsuit and turn \nany monetary award over to the victims if the prisoner has not fully \nsatisfied his duty to pay restitution. I think this will help deter \nmany prisoner lawsuits, because criminals will realize that even if \nthey hit the jackpot they can't keep the money.\n  That is what the bill does. It makes sure that good pieces of \nlegislation, like the draft bill circulated by Senator Hatch, will \nreally work in the real world.\n  Mr. President, ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1404\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Victim Restitution \n     Enhancement Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. RESTITUTION.\n\n       Section 3663 of title 18, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (f)--\n       (A) by striking paragraphs (1) through (3);\n       (B) by inserting the following new paragraph:\n       ``(1)(A) The order of restitution shall require the \n     defendant to--\n       ``(i) submit a sworn statement listing all assets owned or \n     controlled by the defendant; and\n       ``(ii) make payment immediately, unless, in the interest of \n     justice, the court provides for payment on a date certain or \n     in installments.\n       ``(B) If the court provides for payment in installments, \n     the installments shall be in equal monthly payments over a \n     payment period prescribed by the court unless the court \n     establishes another schedule.\n       ``(C) If the order of restitution permits other than \n     immediate payment, the payment period shall not exceed 5 \n     years, excluding any term of imprisonment served by the \n     defendant for the offense.'';\n       (C) by redesignating paragraph (4) as paragraph (2); and\n       (D) by amending paragraph (2), as so redesignated, by \n     striking ``under this section,'' and all that follows through \n     the end of the paragraph and inserting ``under this \n     section.'';\n       (2) in subsection (h)--\n       (A) by striking ``(h) An order'' and inserting ``(h)(1) \n     Subject to paragraph (2), an order'';\n       (B) by redesignating paragraphs (1)(A), (1)(B), and (2) as \n     subparagraphs (A)(i), (A)(ii), and (B), respectively; and\n       (C) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(2) Notwithstanding any other law that applies a shorter \n     time limitation, a victim may bring an action to enforce an \n     order of restitution on or until the date that is 20 years \n     after the date of the order.''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following new subsections:\n       ``(j) No discharge of debt pursuant to a bankruptcy \n     proceeding shall render an order of restitution under this \n     section unenforceable or discharge liability to pay \n     restitution.\n       ``(k)(1) An order of restitution imposed pursuant to this \n     section or by any State court is a lien in favor of the \n     designated agent for a victim of crime entitled to \n     restitution by reason of any Federal or State law, or if such \n     victim cannot be identified, in favor the United States or \n     any State agency charged with providing restitution to \n     victims of crime, upon all property belonging to the person \n     against whom restitution is ordered. The lien arises at the \n     time of the entry of the order and continues until the \n     liability is satisfied, remitted, or set aside. The court \n     ordering restitution shall notify all potential claimants \n     entitled to restitution. On application of the person against \n     whom restitution is ordered, the Attorney General or any \n     other person or entity holding a lien pursuant to this \n     section, shall--\n       ``(A) issue a certificate of release, as described in \n     section 6325 of the Internal Revenue Code, of any lien \n     imposed pursuant to this section, upon his acceptance of a \n     bond described in section 6325(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code; or\n       ``(B) issue a certificate of discharge, as described in \n     section 6325 of the Internal Revenue Code, of any part of the \n     person's property subject to a lien imposed pursuant to this \n     subsection, upon his determination that the fair market value \n     of that part of such property remaining subject to and \n     available to satisfy the lien is at least three times the \n     amount of the restitution ordered.\n       ``(2) The provisions of sections 6323, 6331, 6332, 6334 \n     through 6336, 6337(a), 6338 through 6343, 6901, 7402, 7403, \n     7424 through 7426, 7505(a), 7506, 7701, and 7805 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and of section 513 of the Act \n     of October 17, 1940 (54 Stat. 1190), apply to an order of \n     restitution and to the lien imposed by paragraph (1) as if \n     the liability of the person against whom restitution is \n     ordered were for an internal revenue tax assessment where the \n     Attorney General is the lienholder, except to the extent that \n     the application of such statutes is modified by regulations \n     issued by the Attorney General to accord with differences in \n     the nature of the liabilities. For the purposes of this \n     paragraph references in the preceding sections of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to `the Secretary' shall be \n     construed to mean `the Attorney General' and references in \n     those sections to `tax' shall be construed to mean `order of \n     restitution'.\n       ``(3) A notice of the lien imposed by paragraph (1) shall \n     be considered a notice of lien for taxes payable to the \n     United States for the purposes of any State or local law \n     providing for the filing of a notice of a tax lien. The \n     registration, recording, docketing, or indexing, in \n     accordance with section 1962 of title 28, United States Code, \n     of the judgment under which an order of restitution is \n     imposed shall be considered for all purposes as the filing \n     prescribed by section 6323(f)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986.\n       ``(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     subsection, an order of restitution may be enforced by \n     execution against the property of the person against whom it \n     is ordered in like manner as judgments in civil cases.\n       ``(5) No discharge of debts pursuant to a bankruptcy \n     proceeding shall render a lien under this section \n     unenforceable.\n       ``(6)(A) If a person against whom restitution is ordered \n     and whose assets are subject to a lien under this subsection \n     files any civil action seeking money damages, including an \n     action filed during a period of incarceration, such person \n     shall serve notice, at the expense of that person, of the \n     filing of the action upon each person entitled to receive \n     restitution, or the designated agent of such person, and the \n     Attorney General.\n       ``(B) Failure to timely provide actual notice shall be \n     grounds for dismissal of the underlying civil action.\n       ``(C) A person entitled to receive restitution under this \n     section, the Office of Victims of Crime of the Department of \n     Justice, or any agency or instrumentality of any State \n     charged with providing restitution to victims of crime, may \n     intervene in the civil action described in subparagraph (A) \n     if the court determines that such intervention would be in \n     the interests of justice.''.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to eliminate certain benefits for Members of \nCongress; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                    THE CITIZEN CONGRESS ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nCitizen Congress Act of 1995, a bill that ends many of the perks and \nprivileges that separate Members of Congress from the American people.\n  The Founding Fathers envisioned a Congress of citizen legislators who \nwould leave their families and communities for a short time to write \nlegislation and then return home to live under the laws they helped to \npass. Unfortunately, we have strayed far from \n\n[[Page S 16828]]\nthat vision. Enacting term limits would be the best way to recreate a \ncitizen legislature, and I remain committed to passing a term-limits \namendment to the Constitution. In the meantime, reforming congressional \npensions, pay, and perks offers an immediately achievable step toward \nmaking Congress more directly responsible and accountable to the \nAmerican people.\n  A strong perception exists among the American people that elected \nofficials in Washington have placed themselves above the laws and have \nseparated themselves from the public with perks and privileges. With \nenactment of the Congressional Accountability Act and lobbying and gift \nreform earlier this year, we have begun to address this problem in a \nbipartisan way. However, we still have a long way to go. To restore \nconfidence in Congress and our democratic form of Government, we must \nrestore confidence in the lawmakers who serve there.\n  The Citizen Congress Act begins reform of our Government with the \nMembers of Congress themselves.

Mr. President, the budget reconciliation \nlegislation passed by the House of Representatives includes a measure \nthat would generate approximately $10 billion in tax revenue by doing \naway with penalties Congress imposed in 1990 on pension fund \nwithdrawals. The House proposal allows companies to withdraw so-called \nexcess funds from pension plans for any purpose, without informing plan \nparticipants or beneficiaries.\n  As my colleagues know, the Senate on October 27 voted overwhelmingly \nto remove a similar provision from the Senate reconciliation \nlegislation. While the Senate reversion provision was more narrowly \ntailored in many respects than its companion in the House bill, 94 \nmembers of this body voted to remove it.\n  The reason that members of this body rejected that proposal so \nresoundingly, I believe, is because even the more modest provisions \ncontained in the Senate bill would have represented a significant shift \nin pension policy. Moreover, the Senate Committee on Labor and Human \nResources Committee has not considered fully the ramifications of such \na change.\n  And those ramifications are, potentially, tremendous. There are \napproximately 22,000 pension plans covering 11 million workers and 2 \nmillion retirees that have assets in excess of 125 percent of current \nliability, and the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the \npension reversion provisions contained in both the House and Senate \nbills could result in the removal of tens of billions of dollars in \nsurplus assets from these plans.\n  The last time Congress did address the reversion issue, we acted \ndecisively to enact strong measures to protect workers' pensions. In \nresponse to a wave of corporate takeovers and pension raids in the \n1980s, Congress in 1990 imposed a 50 percent excise tax on pension fund \nreversions, except in limited circumstances. The idea was to make it \ncostly for companies to take assets from their pension plans. And, in \nfact, the raids on assets ceased almost entirely. Before this change, \nhowever, about $20 billion was siphoned from pension funds in just a \nfew years, many pension plans were terminated, and thousands of workers \nsaw their pensions replaced by risky annuities that in many cases \nprovided lower benefits.\n  Let me be clear. There may be valid reasons to reconsider this \npolicy. I believe strongly, however, that any changes in this area, and \nof this magnitude, should be made based on sound pension policy and not \nto satisfy budgetary demands. Therefore, I do not believe that changes \nto the current pension reversion policy should be included in budget \nreconciliation and I strongly urge the Senate conferees to insist on \nthe Senate position.\n  Having said that, Mr. President, I realize the difficult task ahead \nfor all budget conferees. While the Finance Committee budget conferees \nhave a strong vote to bolster the Senate position, I realize that the \nHouse will be equally insistent.\n  If pension reversion provisions are to be included in the final \nreconciliation package, they should be carefully and conservatively \nconstructed to ensure--above all--that each pension plan retains a \ncushion sufficient to weather changes in the current business climate, \nand ultimately to meet its obligations to participants and retirees. In \nthis regard, I would like to associate myself with the very excellent \nand thoughtful remarks made on October 26 by Representative Harris W. \nFawell. Representative Fawell is one of the most knowledgeable Members \nof the House on issues regarding employee benefits, and he has been an \noutspoken leader on the issue of pension reversions.\n  Because the threshold beyond which assets may be withdrawn under the \nHouse proposal can be less than the threshold of assets required in the \nevent of an actual plan termination, the House proposal effectively \nwould allow even companies in bankruptcy to terminate a plan or remove \nfunds from a plan with no guarantee that the remaining assets would be \nsufficient to pay for all plan benefits. This clearly is unacceptable.\n  To ensure that pension assets are as safe as possible, it is \nessential that the formula for allowing employers to remove funds from \npension trusts be based on the most conservative of actuarial \nprinciples. Therefore, I believe companies should be required to use a \nminimum asset cushion based on the greater of 125 percent of \ntermination liability based on PBGC assumptions, rather than current \nliability, or accrued liability, whichever is greater.\n  To further ensure that pensions are secure, companies must be \nrequired to use conservative actuarial assumptions for interest, \nmortality, and expected retirement based on the guidelines issued by \nthe Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation [PBGC]. I realize some would \nprefer to leave this calculation to the discretion of a company's \nactuary. However, I do not believe it is prudent to allow absolute \ndiscretion without more fully considering the possible risks that may \nresult from allowing the use of differing assumptions.\n  For example, the PBGC estimates that a plan whose current liability \nis 125 percent funded may in fact be less than 100 percent funded for \npurposes of its liability at plan termination. While the PBGC \ncalculations may not be perfect, the risk to participants and taxpayers \nfrom an underfunded plan dictates that companies taking reversions rely \non these assumptions.\n  In addition, there should be real limits both on the use of excess \npension funds, and on the types of situations in which companies are \nallowed to take reversions. For example, a company generally should not \nbe allowed to withdraw funds for new plant and equipment while it \nleaves another pension plan underfunded or fails to meet its \nobligations toward a defined contribution plan. Nor should a company in \nbankruptcy be allowed to take a reversion without further protections.\n  Finally, as the Senate provision originally provided, plan \nparticipants and beneficiaries must be given notice of pension \nwithdrawals in advance, and must be afforded all the protections \nnormally provided under title I of the Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act [ERISA].\n  Mr. President, let me emphasize again that I strongly prefer that no \nchanges be made in this area--at least until such changes can be \nproperly considered by the Labor Committee. But if, and when, such \nchanges are to be made, they must be crafted carefully and \nconservatively to protect participants, retirees, and taxpayers; they \nmust include protections normally provided to participants and retirees \n\n\n[[Page S 16831]]\nunder title I of ERISA; and, most importantly, they must be premised on \nprinciples of sound, long-term pension policy instead of temporary \nrevenue generation.\n  Because of the extreme complexity of this issue, it is difficult to \nbelieve that all aspects have been appropriately considered. To cite \njust a few examples, there may need to be special consideration given \nto employee contribution plans, and to plans covering a very small \nnumber of participants. Neither the House nor the Senate proposals take \nthese situations into consideration.\n  In closing, therefore, I would like my colleagues to know that the \nLabor and Human Resources Committee may very well consider the issue of \npension reversions early next year. Should a pension reversion proposal \nemerge from the House-Senate reconciliation conference that varies \nmarkedly from the goals I have outlined here, there is a much greater \nlikelihood that the Labor and Human Resources Committee will revisit \nthis issue.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/08/senate-section/article/S16830-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, a constituent of mine who \nteaches at Rutgers University in New Jersey, Adjunct Professor Leonard \nA. Cole, recently joined in organizing an appeal calling on the Senate \nto ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention. I believe the Senate should \ndebate this convention without delay and ask that the text of a letter \nfrom Mr. Cole, along with a news article on the appeal he helped to \norganize be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n                                               Rutgers University,\n\n\n                              Department of Political Science,\n\n                                                       Newark, NJ.\n       Dear Senator: Having organized the effort to produce the \n     enclosed statement in The New York Times, I wanted to bring \n     the matter to your attention. The statement urges support for \n     the Chemical Weapons Convention, a treaty to ban chemical \n     weapons from the face of the earth. It was paid for and \n     signed by 64 leaders from every sector with a close interest \n     in chemical weapons issues--from the scientific, \n     intelligence, military, diplomatic, arms control, and \n     business communities. The list includes eight Nobel \n     laureates.\n       The terms of the treaty were negotiated with scrupulous \n     care by nations around the world, and received input from \n     every affected U.S. interest group. It enjoys broad support. \n     Before the U.S. signed in 1993, 75 senators went on record in \n     favor of the treaty. Nevertheless, as you may know, the \n     chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Jesse Helms, has \n     expressed reluctance to allow a vote on ratification.\n       Current U.S. inaction on the treaty sends a very dangerous \n     message to the rest of the world. By our failing to ratify, \n     other countries can only believe the U.S. does not think \n     banning these weapons important. U.S. leadership is crucial \n     to maintaining a moral atmosphere that does not allow for \n     these weapons. Without the treaty, more and more countries \n     are likely to arm themselves with these low-cost, low-tech \n     weapons of terror and mass destruction.\n       In the interest of this nation, indeed of all humanity, we \n     hope you will join in a vigorous effort to press for \n     ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention. If you would \n     like to talk further about this, please do not hesitate to \n     contact me. Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Leonard A.

The treaty bans the \n     production, use, storage, and distribution of chemical \n     weapons. The U.S. is among 159 countries that have signed the \n     treaty. Forty nations--but not the U.S. or Russia--have \n     ratified it. ``Many countries are waiting for the U.S. to \n     act,'' says Leonard A. Cole; an adjunct professor at Rutgers \n     University. Cole and prominent Harvard University biochemist \n     Matthews S. Meselson, who are among those signing the appeal, \n     spearheaded the ad effort. The treaty has the support of the \n     Clinton Administration, the Pentagon, intelligence community \n     spokesmen such as former CIA Director William E. Colby, arms \n     control experts, and the Chemical Manufacturers Association \n     (CMA). It also has the bipartisan support of a large number \n     of senators. Among the ad's signers are Nobel Laureate \n     chemists David Baltimore, Ronald Hoffmann, and Glenn T. \n     Seaborg, Will D. Carpenter, who represented CMA during treaty \n     negotiations, has also signed the appeal, Sen.

Mr. President, I ask that the attached article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Sept. 7, 1995]\n\n          Keno Game Ushers in New Era of Gambling in New York\n\n                            (By Ian Fisher)\n\n       Bill Fox played the numbers in his birthday, his wife's \n     birthday, the birthday of a grandson, and then for good \n     measure, plucked a few random digits from his head.\n       ``Ahhh, it's a shot,'' he said after betting--and losing--\n     $5 a short time after New York State's new Quick Draw keno \n     game went on line yesterday morning.\n       The little colored balls that bopped around the video \n     screen at the Blarney Stone on Ninth Avenue, and at hundreds \n     of other businesses across the state, bounced New York into a \n     new era of gambling, the most significant expansion in the \n     state lottery's 28-year history. Starting at 10 A.M. \n     yesterday, the state began holding lottery drawings every 5 \n     minutes for 13 hours a day in bars, restaurants, bowling \n     alleys, Offtrack Betting parlors--even a hardware store or \n     two--2,250 by the end of the month, lottery officials \n     project.\n       Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who pushed for the keno game to help \n     close several budget gaps, used to liken it to bingo. Pataki \n     administration officials say it is simply another lottery \n     game, no different from Pick 10. Critics, though, say that \n     the game's pace makes it more akin to casino-style gambling--\n     and more prone to pocket-draining abuse.\n       But Mr. Fox and other newly minted keno players were not \n     interested in moralizing. Although the game seemed to get off \n     to a slow start in the morning, as several bars in Manhattan \n     complained that the equipment did not work or was still not \n     installed, those who played early said they liked Quick Draw \n     precisely because of the promise of a quick reward.\n       ``You don't have to wait,'' said Mr. Fox, a 46-year-old \n     plumber who played a few games at his lunch break. ``It's \n     right there in front of you: you are a winner or a loser.''\n       A small taste of the critics' fears played out at Handyman \n     Hardware and Paint in the Oakwood Shopping Center on Staten \n     Island, where three tables and a dozen chairs became a \n     makeshift keno parlor.\n       ``I came here a half an hour ago to buy milk and diapers,'' \n     said Katherine Petersen, 37, a marine-insurance broker. ``I'm \n     still here. It's addicting.''\n       ``I play the daily number, but you have to wait until 7:30 \n     to know,'' she said. ``This is quicker--five minutes--it's \n     like being in Atlantic City.''\n       ``I won a dollar,'' she said. ``I bet $7. I have no more \n     money for the diapers and the milk. But I had fun.''\n       New York is the eighth state to offer keno, a game that \n     Republicans and Democrats alike had opposed in Albany for \n     years.\n       But it was approved this year with apparent reluctance in \n     the face of a nearly $5 billion deficit, as lawmakers \n     scrambled to find money to prevent increases in college \n     tuition or cuts in welfare and Medicaid. The game is expected \n     to bring in $180 million in its first full year of operation.\n       ``There was a line we were drawing in the sand, and we had \n     to be more open, I should say, to new additional revenue \n     sources,'' said Patricia Lynch, a spokeswoman for Assembly \n     Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat who had been a \n     staunch opponent of keno. ``That's the bottom line.''\n       Lawmakers, especially Democrats, were also courted \n     aggressively by half a dozen lobbyists hired by the Gtech \n     Corporation of West Greenwich, R.I., which runs the game on \n     behalf of the lottery. The company will be paid 1.525 percent \n     of the sales.\n       Except for the pace and setting, Quick Draw is played like \n     any other keno-style lottery game. A player picks 1 to 10 \n     numbers from a field of 80, filling out a card that is fed \n     into a lottery machine by the bartender or other employee. \n     The player bets $1, $2, $3, $4, $5, or $10 each game and may \n     play a maximum of 20 games or $100 on each card. But players \n     can effectively bet whatever they like by simply filling out \n     more than one card.\n       Every five minutes, a central computer at the lottery's \n     headquarters spits out 20 random numbers, which zip through \n     phone lines and are displayed simultaneously on terminals \n     around the state. Players win according to how many numbers \n     they match and how much they bet: the highest prize for a $1 \n     bet is $100,000, if the player bets on 10 numbers and matches \n     all of them. If the player matches five numbers on that bet, \n     he would be paid $2.\n       Like any other lottery game, players can redeem prizes of \n     up to $600 on site. For larger prizes, they must file a \n     claims form and receive their winnings from the lottery \n     department.\n       The businesses that install keno games receive 6 percent of \n     the total sales, with no extra commission for any winning \n     tickets they sell. That percentage is less than what many \n     establishments earn for food and drinks, but many bars and \n     restaurants \n\n[[Page S 16832]]\n     agreed to the game in the hope of attracting customers both to gamble \n     and, they hope, to spend more on food and drink as well.\n       But many bars have turned down Quick Draw, both because of \n     worries it may not pay off financially and because they feel \n     it essentially turns their establishments into betting \n     parlors.\n       ``I think it demeans my restaurant and bar,'' said Don \n     Berger, owner of the Riverrun in TriBeCa. ``It smacks of \n     Atlantic City, honky-tonk and we don't do that, I am not \n     interested in that one bit.''\n       In Massachusetts, which has run a keno game for a year and \n     a half, a debate has ignited over placing keno terminals in \n     convenience stores--which critics say brings gambling into \n     places where children can watch. In New York, the law was \n     written to exclude most convenience stores by requiring \n     outlets to have a minimum of 2,500 square feet. But the game \n     is being installed in some liquor stores, supermarkets, \n     pharmacies and other outlets that do meet the space \n     requirements.\n       It is too early to know whether any strong opposition to \n     Quick Draw will emerge, but if the experience of other states \n     is any guide, the game will probably be popular among those \n     who play.\n       ``People are going to gamble anyway, if not in New York, \n     then in New Jersey,'' said Geno Gulli, a retired barber, as \n     he placed a losing $2 bet in Keenan's bar on 231st Street and \n     Broadway. The profits to the state, he said, were ``good for \n     the state for a good cause.''\n       As he spoke, Bert Patel, a candy store owner, basked in the \n     glow of a $10 win. ``I just got my beer money back,'' he \n     said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/08/senate-section/article/S16831-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                SALE OF POWER MARKETING ADMINISTRATIONS\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, recently during the debate on the \nfiscal year 1997 energy and water appropriations conference report, \nattention was called to some of the fine print within that report \nregarding the sale of power marketing administrations.\n  It was agreed in the conference report to retain the prohibitions \nagainst the six Federal public power authorities from conducting \nstudies related to pricing hydroelectric power and against the \nexecutive branch to study or take other actions to transfer federal \npower marketing authorities out of Federal ownership.\n  I am very pleased that the Senate prevailed in its position and \noverturned efforts within the House of Representatives to forward a bad \nidea that would have had consequences at a bad time for rural America.\n  There simply is no reason for Congress to have to repeatedly say \n``No'' to the sale of our Nation's power marketing administrations. \nSuch sales would be both poor public policy and shortsighted fiscal \npolicy.\n  Yet I am not convinced that the perpetrators of this bad idea have \ngotten the message.\n  Within the report is the following statement:\n\n       The conferees agree that the statutory limitations do not \n     prohibit the Legislative Branch from initiating or conducting \n     studies or collecting information regarding the sale or \n     transfer of the power marketing administrations to non-\n     Federal ownership.\n\n  This statement is factually correct. The prohibitions in law that \nwere retained by the conference report were that neither the power \nmarketing administrations nor the executive branch could use Federal \nfunds to study this bad idea.\n  This language however does not mean that such studies by the \nlegislative branch would be a good idea. This language should not be \ninterpreted as an invitation for the legislative branch to once again \nspend money pursuing a bad idea.\n  Those who would pervert this language as some form of authorization \nfor a study by the legislative branch simply haven't understood the \nmessage.\n  The message is simple--if we prohibit one branch of Government from \nfoolishly spending money pursuing a bad idea, it would be just as \nfoolish for another branch to use tax dollars for similar studies.\n  We do not need any more studies to confirm that this is bad idea, \nwith bad consequences, at a bad time for rural Americans. It is time to \nunderstand the will of Congress and move on and leave this bad idea in \nthe trash can where it belongs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/08/senate-section/article/S16832-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16832-S16834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JIM HAUTMAN\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to \ncongratulate a fellow Minnesotan, Jim Hautman of Plymouth, MN, on \nsubmitting the winning entry for the 1994-95 Federal Duck Stamp Design \nCompetition.\n  What is particularly impressive about the selection of Mr. Hautman's \nentry as the winner of this year's Federal duck stamp competition is \nthat this is the second time he has won the contest, having also \nproduced the winning entry in 1989. In fact, the Hautman family has a \nhistory of submitting winning entries into the competition. Brother Joe \nHautman's entry won the competition in 1991, while brother Bob Hautman \nwon a second place award in 1994.\n  Each year, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service sponsors the duck stamp \ndesign competition to determine the final design of the following \nyear's stamp. The artwork is judged by a panel of art, waterfowl, and \nstamp experts who must select the winning design from up to 1,000 \nentries.\n  The contest is the only annual art competition sponsored by the \nFederal Government, with the winning entry released for sale to \nsportsmen and women and stamp collectors each June 30. The revenues \ngenerated by the sales of each year's winning entry are used by the \nFederal Government to buy or lease habitat lands for migratory \nwaterfowl species.\n  Since the Federal Duck Stamp Design Program was first initiated in \n1934, Minnesota has produced nine winners of the annual competition, \nmore than any other State. As this year's winner, Mr. Hautman not only \ncontinues this impressive tradition of competition winners from \nMinnesota, but also a tradition of producing winning entries within his \nown immediate family. For the Record I am pleased to submit yesterday's \nWashington Post article on the Hautman family's legendary success in \nthe duck stamp contest.\n  Mr. President, as a Senator representing a State which has a proud \nhistory of maintaining and providing waterfowl and wildlife habitat, I \nwant to again congratulate Mr. Hautman on winning this prestigious \ncontest for the second time and also recognize and laud the \nachievements of the Federal Duck Stamp Program in providing habitat for \nmigratory waterfowl species.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From The Washington Post, Nov. 7, 1995]\n\n Quackerjack Artists; For the Stamp Contest, the Hautman Brothers Have \n                          Their Ducks in a Row\n\n                          (By William Souder)\n\n       Plymouth, Minn.--The ducks have pretty much taken over Bob \n     Hautman's house. There are loaded decoy bags in the middle of \n     the living room floor, and loose decoys--fat bluebills and \n     graceful canvasbacks--are scattered about seemingly \n     everywhere. Stuffed ducks, locked in perpetual flight, rest \n     on shelves that are a few weeks between dustings. Out on the \n     driveway a dun-painted duck boat sits on a trailer hooked up \n     to Hautman's car, which is pointed toward the street for an \n     easy pre-dawn exit.\n       ``Fixing these guys up,'' Hautman says, turning over a \n     freshly spray-painted bluebill decoy. He is tall and thin, \n     dressed in jeans and a zippered camouflage sweat shirt. The \n     decoy he is holding is a gamy smudge of black and light gray. \n     ``I was out hunting today, and I thought they looked pretty \n     beat up. I am going out again in the morning.''\n       For Hautman, 36, it is another autumn, another duck season, \n     another chance at waterfowling immortality. He interrupts his \n     hunting this week to come to Washington for the annual \n     federal duck stamp competition--far and away the most \n     prestigious honor in wildlife painting and surely one of the \n     richest art prizes in the world. Hautman is one of 453 \n     wildlife artists from around the country who submitted \n     entries in September, and while many of the others will be \n     too nervous to attend the judging today and tomorrow [see \n     related article, Page E6], Hautman will be right there in the \n     audience waiting to see if his 7-by-10-inch painting will \n     become next year's stamp.\n       And why not? After all, he finished second in last year's \n     contest and came in fourth the three years prior to that. \n     Plus, he is a Hautman--a member of America's ruling duck \n     stamp dynasty--and he is due.\n       The current $15 duck stamp--the one riding around on the \n     backs of more than 1 million hunting licenses--was engraved \n     from a painting of a pair of mallards submitted last year by \n     Hautman's younger brother Jim. That made two wins for Jim, \n     who at the age of 25 had become the youngest winner ever with \n     a painting of black-bellied whistling ducks that appeared on \n     the 1990 stamp. Jim got married earlier this year and moved \n     out of the house on the hill in Plymouth, but he still has \n     studio space there in a cluttered bedroom down the hall from \n     Bob's. Because artists cannot enter the contest for 3 years \n     after a win, Bob will not be competing against Jim this week.\n       But then there is Joe, another Hautman brother, who is back \n     in the hunt this year after winning in 1992 with a spectacled \n     eider. \n\n[[Page S 16833]]\n     Joe, 39, lives in Jackson, N.J., and has a PhD in physics. He gave up \n     science after doing postdoctoral research at the University \n     of Pennsylvania so he could become a full-time wildlife \n     artist, too. Jim and Joe are the only brothers ever to win \n     the federal competition. Joe's submission this year is a \n     Barrow's goldeneye, one of the four ducks the U.S. Fish and \n     Wildlife Service has solicited for the 1996 stamp. Bob, the \n     shyest of the three brothers and the one most anxious about \n     the competition, would not say which bird he painted for the \n     contest.\n       If Joe were to win again, Bob would at least get a chance \n     every other wildlife artist in the country covets, the chance \n     to compete next year without going up against a Hautman.\n       ``We do get calls every year from artists wanting to know \n     if the Hautmans are going to be in the contest,'' says Terry \n     Bell, special events coordinator for the Federal Duck Stamp \n     Program. ``They are all a little intimidated.''\n\n\n                            The Duck Market\n\n       Duck stamp painting is a high-stakes subspecies of wildlife \n     art--itself a genre held in low regard by the fine-art world \n     but adored by millions of sportsmen and collectors. The stamp \n     paintings are intensely realistic--anatomical correctness is \n     required of every entry--but the rewards of winning a stamp \n     competition are decidedly unreal. Officially, the Federal \n     Duck Stamp Program offers the winner only a sheet of stamps \n     and a handshake from the secretary of the interior. But there \n     is a thriving private-sector market for limited-edition \n     prints of the winning painting.\n       That market peaked in the mid-1980s, when winners of the \n     federal competition could count on making a minimum of $1 \n     million in fees and royalties from their prints, not to \n     mention the overnight increase in the value of their other \n     works. For a variety of reasons--including large print runs \n     that glutted the market, careless investments by speculators, \n     and a continuing decline in the number of duck hunters--the \n     payoff for winning the federal contest is not what it used to \n     be, though it remains enormous. This year's winner can expect \n     to earn somewhere between $500,000 and $1 million.\n       ``When you win, the phone does not stop ringing for days,'' \n     says David Maass, another Minnesota artist who's won the \n     federal competition.\n       ``This is the Olympics of wildlife art,'' says Robert \n     Lesino, chief of the Federal Duck Stamp Program. ``No other \n     event in the life of an artist can launch a career like this \n     can. When you win the federal duck stamp, everything \n     changes.''\n\n\n                         Shooting and Sketching\n\n       ``I never really thought the boys showed that much artistic \n     talent,'' says Elaine Hautman of her sons. ``They always had \n     their crayons, and they could always draw nicely. I guess \n     other people thought that was unusual, but to us it was just \n     sort of normal.''\n       Hautman, who worked in the 1940s as a commercial artist in \n     Minneapolis and who remains a sharp-eyed critic of her sons' \n     work, says they got their love of the outdoors from her late \n     husband, Tom, who took them hunting and taught them how to \n     look at game in its natural environment. ``I think by the \n     time they could talk they could already tell one bird from \n     another,'' she says.\n       Joe Hautman says that he, Jim and Bob have never thought of \n     themselves as being unique.\n       ``It seems sort of natural to us,'' he says. ``There are \n     seven kids in the family, so it is not like we are all into \n     this. The three of us have always done art, and I do not \n     think we tend to see ourselves in the same way others see us. \n     I guess it is like the way people in the same family \n     sometimes do not think they look like each other when in fact \n     they do.\n       ``The three of us just got back from a long hunting trip in \n     Minnesota and Manitoba, and in two weeks we did not talk \n     about art at all.''\n       It is one thing to be a genetically predisposed wildlife \n     artist. It is another thing altogether to set out \n     purposefully to win duck stamp competitions. Besides the \n     federal stamps they've illustrated, the brothers Hautman have \n     collectively won 15 State duck or pheasant stamp \n     competitions, and Jim has won the Australian national \n     contest. No wonder other artists are spooked. The Hautmans \n     are not prolific--none of them produces more than a dozen \n     paintings a year, and they publish only a fraction of their \n     output for collectors--but when a bird flies off one of their \n     easels there's a very good chance it will land on a hunting \n     stamp.\n       Everyone into duck art recognizes that the Hautmans share \n     an uncommon natural talent, just as they recognize the \n     brothers' distinctive style--the strong lighting, the stark \n     contrasts so well suited to the engraving process, the \n     meticulous anatomical perfection. But what seems to have \n     really separated them from other artists is their single-\n     mindedness.\n       ``More than any other wildlife artists I know, they are \n     students of duck stamp design,'' says Frank J. Sisser, editor \n     and publisher of U.S. Art magazine in Minneapolis and one of \n     the five judges for the 1992 competition. ``They study what's \n     been successful. And they make no bones about painting \n     primarily for stamp competitions. They are not as distracted \n     by other projects as many artists are.\n       ``But they are also brothers and best friends who serve as \n     each other's harshest critics. If they can survive having \n     their paintings inspected by one another, they are going to \n     have a very good chance at winning.''\n       The Hautmans have traveled to Kodiak Island to observe and \n     shoot species found only near the Bering Sea. They have \n     hunted snow geese and the ubiquitous mallard in the marshes \n     of Manitoba, Canada. They always hunt in Minnesota, and Bob \n     says he wouldn't mind getting down to Texas sometime to look \n     for the little-seen mottled duck, a brown-on-brown bird \n     similar in appearance to a hen mallard and one of the four \n     North American ducks that has never been on the Federal \n     stamp.\n       When the brothers failed to bag a rare spectacled eider in \n     Alaska a few years ago, Joe's research for his winning \n     painting took him to the Philadelphia Zoo, which had a live \n     hen, and to a natural history museum up in Ottawa, which had \n     a collection of dead eiders that had been shot by Eskimos \n     early in this century.\n       ``I thought they would be mounted,'' says Joe, ``but they \n     were just in drawers, kind of laid out flat. The museum let \n     me examine them, and I made a lot of photographs and \n     sketches.''\n       Whenever they can, the Hautmans shoot their own specimens \n     and have them mounted, to study and work from over time. \n     ``You can bend them into whatever pose you want if you work \n     on them when they are still wet from the taxidermist,'' says \n     Jim.\n       Of course, they do not always have to go so far to find \n     them, either. Minnesota lies between two major migratory \n     routes--the Mississippi Flyway on the east side of the State \n     and the Central Flyway on the west. Every fall a great \n     southward movement of birds that breed all the way up to the \n     Arctic Circle sweeps down across Minnesota--thousands of \n     geese and ducks and swans in an immense, colorful profusion. \n     Minnesota is duck country, and, in a way, the capital of \n     American duck culture. Nine Minnesotans, more than from any \n     other State, have won the Federal duck stamp competition, and \n     several of them--including Jim Hautman, David Maass and the \n     legendary Les Kouba--have won twice.\n       The process is meticulous. Bob Hautman says finding the \n     right image involves many false starts and dead ends as he \n     makes preliminary sketches.\n       ``I am trying to find an effect that will make the painting \n     alive as opposed to lifelike,'' he says. ``A photograph looks \n     realistic, but frozen. But with a painting, when you look at \n     it you should see something that looks living.\n       ``Surprisingly, the background is often the hardest part. \n     Sometimes it takes weeks. Sometimes it takes months.''\n       Robert Lesino thinks the Hautmans' methodical approach is \n     not typical of many wildlife artists.\n       ``A lot of the guys who enter the stamp competition wait \n     until the last minute and then hurry the painting to get it \n     in on time,'' Lesino says. ``The Hautmans start a year ahead \n     of time. They just put in more effort than other people do.''\n       ``I start thinking about the next painting right after the \n     contest,'' says Jim. ``I am a slow painter. It takes me a \n     long time.''\n\n\n                              The Paradox\n\n       The results of those long labors are breathtakingly \n     beautiful to duck aficionados and more or less a complete \n     mystery to everyone else. Despite the insistent realism, duck \n     art is variable in its effect. Some stamp images die in front \n     of your eyes--they're accurate but cataleptic. Others are \n     quite arresting. Dan Smith, another Minnesota painter, won \n     the Federal contest in 1988 with a moody, suggestive image of \n     a lone snow goose winging along a foggy lake shore at dawn. \n     The painting was a marvel of depth and technical wizardry. \n     Smith said at the time that painting a snow goose--which is \n     basically a white oval with wings--was ``like trying to paint \n     an egg.''\n       To non-hunters, duck art is contradictory all the way \n     around--an art with no aesthetic. Why shoot a duck so you can \n     paint it to raise money for habitat for more ducks to shoot? \n     The answer, for painters from John James Audubon to the \n     Hautman brothers, is ineffable, but the fundamental \n     assumption--that hunting is heartless and hunters are \n     unfeeling--is problematic. The truth is that hunters are \n     hopeless sentimentalists, filled with nostalgic longing for \n     days spent in frigid sloughs under steely skies. They are \n     touched to the core by images of birds on the wing in \n     blustery weather.\n       ``Some people just cannot relate to duck hunting or to duck \n     hunters,'' says Bob Hautman. ``I understand that. Sometimes \n     when you are out there in a boat in a swamp wringing a duck's \n     neck, I guess you might think to yourself that it is kind of \n     a tough sport. But it is where I start. Wildlife artists are \n     generally hunters first.''\n       Randy Eggenberger, president of Wild Wings, a leading \n     wildlife art publisher based in Lake City, Minn., which has \n     handled the Hautmans' work for 10 years, thinks wildlife art \n     is simply democratic art.\n       ``These are paintings that appeal to the masses,'' he says. \n     ``And that is what I think art should be about--creating \n     something that Joe Blow can hang on his wall and enjoy.''\n       Jim Hautman says whatever it is about duck painting that \n     people like cannot really be analyzed.\n       ``I guess hunting is a paradox to many people,'' he says. \n     ``And what I do is hard to explain. All I can say is that if \n     I did not love ducks, I wouldn't hunt them.''\n     \n[[Page S 16834]]\n\n\n\n                      Duck Tale: Birth of a STAMP\n\n       The Federal Duck Stamp Program was created by Congress in \n     1934 to raise revenue to purchase and manage waterfowl \n     habitat within the National Wildlife Refuge System. The first \n     stamps, which cost $1, were painted by artists commissioned \n     by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Since 1949 the image \n     engraved on the stamp, which now costs $15, has been chosen \n     in an annual open competition. It is the only art competition \n     officially sponsored by the Federal Government, and one of \n     the longest-running and most successful conservation programs \n     in the country. Ninety-eight percent of the revenue from duck \n     stamp sales goes directly to purchase wetlands. Since its \n     inception, the program has generated half a billion dollars \n     in revenue and added more than 4 million acres of wetlands to \n     the refuge system.\n       Federal duck stamps are required on all duck hunting \n     licenses in the United States, and hunters will purchase \n     about 90 percent of roughly 1.5 million stamps that will be \n     sold this year. The remainder are bought by conservationists \n     and stamp collectors.\n       This year's competition opened yesterday, in the auditorium \n     at the Department of the Interior building at 18th and C \n     streets NW, when all 453 entries went on display. Judging \n     begins today, from 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., with an initial \n     in-or-out elimination round that will winnow the entries down \n     to 50 or so paintings. Tomorrow, judges will score the \n     paintings, with announcement of a winner expected around \n     noon. All sessions are free and open to the public.\n       The identity of the five judges, who are picked from all \n     over the country each year, is kept secret before the \n     competition. However, program chief Robert Lesino confirms \n     that one judge this year will be Jane Alexander, chairman of \n     the National Endowment for the Arts.\n       The Fish and Wildlife Service limits the competition in \n     alternating years to those ducks that have never appeared on \n     the Federal stamp--the so-called ``ugly ducks.'' This is an \n     ugly duck year, with the black scoter, surf scoter, Barrow's \n     goldeneye and mottled duck to choose from.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/08/senate-section/article/S16832-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO OUR NATION'S VETERANS\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this Saturday, November 11, 1995, is \nVeterans Day. This is the day when citizens across the country honor \nthe men and women who have served in our Nation's armed services. I \nwould like to take this time to acknowledge the contributions of all \nthose who have served the United States as members of the armed \nservices. In particular, I would like to highlight the achievements of \nthe many women who have served our Nation in the military.\n  This year is especially significant because it marks the 50th \nanniversary of the end of World War II. It was during World War II that \nour Nation's women showed the country what they have to offer to the \nmilitary. While women had always actively supported our Nation's \nmilitary, World War II saw an increased number of women volunteers \nbreaking new ground in the uniformed services. Women served in all four \nbranches of the military and the Coast Guard, filling such varied roles \nas assembly line workers, pilots, and nurses. During World War II, more \nthan 100 women from my State of Michigan volunteered for military \nservice. I thank these women for their response to the call of duty and \ntheir sacrifices on behalf of their country.\n  Over the past 50 years, women have continued to prove that they can \ncontribute to our Nation's military. In order to honor the women who \nserve and have served in the armed services, Women in Military Service \nfor America broke ground on the construction of a memorial this past \nJune. It is the hope of Women in Military Service in America to place \ninto this memorial a comprehensive list of all the women who have \nserved our country.\n  This Veterans Day, when we reflect on the many who have volunteered \nto protect our freedoms, I hope that there will be renewed pride in the \ncontributions women have made. The women who served before them and \nbeside them, those who have paved the way for the achievement gained in \nrank, honor, and respect are highly deserving of our recognition on \nthis day. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/08/senate-section/article/S16834-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16834-S16835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I hereby submit to the Senate the \nbudget scorekeeping report prepared by the Congressional Budget Office \nunder section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974, as amended. This report meets the requirements for \nSenate scorekeeping of section 5 of Senate Concurrent Resolution 32, \nthe first concurrent resolution on the budget for 1986.\n  This report shows the effects of congressional action on the budget \nthrough November 6, 1995. The estimates of budget authority, outlays, \nand revenues, which are consistent with the technical and economic \nassumptions of the 1996 concurrent resolution on the budget, House \nConcurrent Resolution 67, show that current level spending is below the \nbudget resolution by $2.1 billion in budget authority and above the \nbudget resolution by $4.5 billion in outlays. Current level is $44 \nmillion below the revenue floor in 1996 and $0.7 billion below the \nrevenue floor over the 5 years 1996 to 2000. The current estimate of \nthe deficit for purposes of calculating the maximum deficit amount is \n$250.2 billion, $4.6 billion above the maximum deficit amount for 1996 \nof $245.6 billion.\n  Since my last report, dated October 25, 1995, Congress cleared and \nthe President signed the Fishermen's Protective Act Amendments of \n1995--Public Law 104-43. The President has also signed the Alaska \nNative Claims Settlement Act--Public Law 104-42. Congress also cleared \nfor the President's signature the following appropriation bills: Energy \nand Water Development--H.R. 1905, Transportation--H.R. 2002, and \nLegislative Branch--H.R. 2492. These actions changed the current level \nof budget authority and outlays. In addition, the revenue aggregates \nhave been revised to reflect the recommended level in House Concurrent \nResolution 67. My last report had revised the revenue aggregates \npursuant to section 205(b)(2) of House Concurrent Resolution 67 for \npurposes of consideration of S. 1357.\n  The report follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 8, 1995.\n     Hon.

The estimates of \n     budget authority, outlays and revenues are consistent with \n     the technical and economic assumptions of the 1996 Concurrent \n     Resolution on the Budget (H. Con.

These actions changed the current level \n     of budget authority and outlays. In addition, at the request \n     of Budget Committee staff, the revenue aggregates shown for \n     the budget resolution have been changed to reflect the \n     recommended levels in H. Con.

Mr. President, as I speak today, the Republican \nleadership of this Congress is discussing an issue of great importance \nto the family farmers and small businessmen of America: the capital \ngains tax.\n  Current law in the area of capital gains leaves something to be \ndesired. I grew up in a small business family. My father owned his own \nprinting shop, and he poured his heart and soul and countless late \nhours into that business. My father's printing shop was more than his \nlivelihood. It was his investment in his retirement and his family's \nfuture. I know many hardworking Vermonters are in the same position. \nThey work hard all their lives to build up their farms and small \nbusinesses. The capital gains tax, when they decide to sell the farm or \nbusiness to fund their retirements, can be close to punitive.\n  I am receptive to a capital gains reduction that favors Americans who \nsave for retirement by investing in their personal business, primary \nresidence, or family farm. When these taxpayers retire, they sell their \nbusiness, home, or farm to live off their lifetime investment. We ought \nto be encouraging that kind of investment, not punishing it.\n  I am concerned, however, that the Republican plan to reduce taxes on \ncapital gains targets the wrong type of investment and cost too much. \nThe capital gains tax break that the Republican leadership is \ndiscussing will benefit primarily people other than family farmers and \nsmall businessmen.\n  Current law taxes capital gains at a lower rate than other forms of \nincome. Under the 1993 Budget Reconciliation Act, the maximum tax rate \non capital gains remains 28 percent, as compared to 39.6 percent for \nordinary income. In addition to the lower rate, the tax on capital \ngains is deferred until the capital asset is sold and the tax is \nforgiven at death. Given those preferences, and given the fact that \nmost proposals to reduce the capital gains tax benefit mostly very \nwealthy investors, I am very wary of making changes in the tax law \nright now.\n  I agree with the targeted capital gains approach adopted in the 1993 \nBudget Reconciliation Act. The act allows investors who purchase newly \nissued stock in small companies to exclude from their income 50 percent \nof the gain when they sell the stock if it is held for at least 5 \nyears. For stock to qualify for the tax break, the company must have \nless than $50 million in gross assets. This approach encourages long-\nterm investment in small businesses--the engine of job growth in the \n1990's.\n  By contrast, the capital gains tax breaks in the House and Senate \nversions of the Republican budget reconciliation bill are part of \ngigantic tax giveaway packages that will increase the deficit and \nmostly benefit well-heeled Wall Street investors.\n  Under the Senate bill, the corporate capital gains rate is reduced \nfrom 35 percent to 28 percent. Individuals would be able to exclude 50 \npercent of capital gain income from taxation. I voted against the bill \nwhen it was debated in the Senate, but it passed by a vote of 52-47. \nThe House included a larger capital gains reduction in its version of \nthe budget bill. The corporate capital gains rate is reduced to 25 \npercent and the individual rate is capped at 19.8 percent. In addition, \nthe House indexes capital gains for inflation. Let us remember that \naccording to the Congressional Research Service, over half of all \ncapital gains--excluding personal residences--are earned by corporate \nstock and real estate investors. Farmers and small business owners \naccount for a relatively small portion of capital gains.\n  The Treasury Department estimates that the House capital gains \nproposal would cost $170.4 billion over the next 10 years, and would \nmostly benefit people earning over $200,000 a year. The Senate bill is \nnot much better. At a time when the national debt is approaching $5 \ntrillion, we just cannot afford that kind of a tax giveaway going \nmostly to people who do not need it.\n  As House and Senate conferees discuss changes in the capital gains \ntax, I hope they will consider ensuring that it does not mostly benefit \nvery wealthy investors but rather is targeted toward small businessmen \nand family farmers who have poured sweat equity into their \nbusinesses.\n                H_______________________________________\n\n\n                        FOREIGN CURRENCY REPORTS\n\n  In accordance with the appropriate provisions of law, the Secretary \nof the Senate herewith submits the following report(s) of standing \ncommittees of the Senate, certain joint committees of the Congress, \ndelegations and groups, and select and special committees of the \nSenate, relating to expenses incurred in the performance of authorized \nforeign travel:\n\n   CONSOLIDATED REPORT OF EXPENDITURE OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND APPROPRIATED FUNDS FOR FOREIGN TRAVEL BY MEMBERS AND EMPLOYEES OF THE U.S. SENATE, UNDER AUTHORITY OF SEC. 22, P.L. 95-384--22  \n                                                      U.S.C. 1754(b), COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS, FOR TRAVEL FROM APR. 1 TO JUNE 30, 1995                                                      \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                  Per diem               Transportation             Miscellaneous                 Total         \n                                                                                         -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                       U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar\n              Name and country                             Name of currency                 Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent\n                                                                                            currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.  \n                                                                                                         currency                  currency                  currency                  currency \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenator Ted Stevens:                                                                                                                                                                            \n    France.................................

Mr. President, before the day closes, I wanted to \ncomment on yesterday's election results from around the country. I have \nhad the opportunity now to consult with people around the country in \nmany of the States in which the elections were held. I think it is very \nclear that the country sent a rejection notice to the extreme agenda of \nthe right wing.\n  The message to many Republicans should be very clear: Back off, you \nare going too far. It is time to work together. It is time to achieve a \nbipartisan consensus. It is time to recognize that in many of the \nextreme proposals now being offered by the Republicans the American \npeople have now concluded they go too far. They cannot agree with the \nRepublican direction.\n  Democrats retained control of the statehouse in Kentucky and the \nlegislature in Virginia. We have retained control of the Maine House of \nRepresentatives and even made gains in the New Jersey Assembly despite \nbeing outspent by more than 4 to 1.\n  In particular, the elections in Virginia and Kentucky are very \ninstructive. The Republican State party in Virginia made this election \na referendum on the extreme politics that Democrats have been fighting \nagainst. In Virginia, voters called for a halt in the GOP assault. In \nKentucky, the Democratic Governor-elect made it clear in his campaign \nhe was running against the Gingrich Contract, against the cuts in \nMedicare, against cuts in education. In short, he ran against \neverything that the Republican budget would accomplish--and was \naffirmed at the polls.\n  Mr. President, this was a victory of priorities over politics, a \nrealization that the so-called GOP revolution is too extreme for \nmainstream America, a realization that I believe had much to do with \nGeneral Powell's decision today. In today's Republican Party, \nmoderation is off message. People now understand that the Republican \npolicies we have been fighting on this floor hurt working families and \nreward special interests.\n  The American people cannot abide a budget that guts Medicare to pay \nfor huge tax cuts. Americans are coming home to the Democratic message \nof opportunity and fairness. Voters in the States are speaking directly \nto Republican leaders in Washington: Your cuts are too extreme.\n  We want to balance the budget but Democrats will not let the ends \njustify the means. We believe we have a contract with the American \npeople, and its elements are ones we have been talking about for 10 \nmonths: We will protect Medicare. We are going to invest in our \nchildren. We will enhance our educational system. We are going to \npreserve the environment. We will provide jobs and opportunity for the \nfuture.\n  Speaking for this side of the aisle, the results of this election \nwill serve to redouble our efforts in the crucial budget battle ahead. \nI yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/08/senate-section/article/S16840-3", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16840]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
