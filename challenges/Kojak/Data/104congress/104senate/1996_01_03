Mr. President, I wanted to quickly review the historic 1st \nsession of the 104th Congress, the first Republican Congress in 40 \nyears.\n  On January 3, 1995, I spoke from this podium and outlined the agenda \nthe Republican Senate would be advancing.\n  Exactly 1 year has now passed since that day, and as we begin the \nsecond session of this Congress, I would now like to offer a progress \nreport to the American people--detailing the promises we kept in 1995, \nand the work we hope to complete in 1996.\n  As I said on the first day of this session, the primary goal of this \nCongress would not be to pass unnecessary new laws--but instead to \nremember a timeless one--the 10th amendment to our Constitution.\n  That, of course, is the amendment that sets out the principle of \nfederalism, stating that ``The powers not delegated to the United \nStates by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are \nreserved to the States, respectively, or to the people.''\n  Shifting power out of Washington, and returning it to our States, our \ncities, our neighborhoods, and to the American people. That's what the \n10th amendment is all about.\n  And that is exactly what the 104th Congress has been about since day \none--and since Senate bill 1--which put an end to unfunded Federal \nmandates.\n  That is what we were about when we passed landmark welfare reform \nlegislation that will give our States the flexibility to design \nprograms that best meet the needs of their citizens.\n  And that is what we have been about these past few weeks, as we \ncontinue our fight for a balanced budget that will ensure a brighter \nfuture for our children and grandchildren.\n  As budget negotiations continue, it is important to note that for as \nmuch as this Congress has accomplished in giving Government back to the \nAmerican people, there is more we could have accomplished--had \nPresident Clinton not time and again stood in the way of fundamental \nchange.\n  In fact, it was President Clinton's active opposition that prevented \nthe Senate by just one vote from joining the House in sending a \nbalanced budget amendment to our States for approval. And it was his \nveto of the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 that put us in the situation we \nare now in.\n  Had President Clinton not chosen to engage on a campaign to scare the \nAmerican people, America's seniors would be beginning 1996 secure in \nthe knowledge that Medicare was solvent.\n  It seems to me that we have made some progress, but we need to make \nmore, and whether or not that can be done will be determined, I assume, \nin the next very few days.\n  It is also worth noting that President Clinton's misguided insistence \non the status quo has prevented the enactment of much-needed regulatory \nreform legislation which would ease the burden of Government redtape \nand regulations on America's small business men and women.\n  Let me make it clear that although we are very frustrated with the \nPresident's actions, we have not given up on a balanced budget or on \nregulatory reform.\n  Something else we have not given up on is doing everything we can to \nhelp law-abiding Americans in the fight against crime and drugs.\n  In the wake of the terrible tragedy in Oklahoma City, the Senate \nmoved quickly to pass antiterrorism legislation. And at our insistence, \nthis legislation included historic habeas corpus reform, which would \nput a limit on frivolous lawsuits that convicted felons use to clog our \ncourts and delay justice.\n  Republicans also included a number of tough anticrime provisions in \nthe Commerce, State, Justice Department appropriations bill. \nUnfortunately, President Clinton vetoed the bill.\n  I know that the distinguished chair of the Judiciary Committee, \nSenator Hatch, will continue to look for ways in which Congress can \nprovide the leadership in the fight against crime that has been missing \nat the White House.\n\n[[Page S2]]\n\n\n  We took steps to do that just last month, when Speaker Gingrich and I \nannounced the formation of a congressional task force on national drug \npolicy.\n  A series of national surveys have shown a very disturbing increase in \ndrug use among America's youth. Drug use among young people was down--\nway down--in the 1980's, when Presidents Reagan and Bush made the war \non drugs a national priority. And these surveys show what has happened \nnow that the Clinton administration has all but declared a cease-fire.\n  The Speaker and I have charged this task force with convening the \nNation's top experts, and coming up with an antidrug action plan which \nwe can implement in the coming year.\n  Earlier this year, the Speaker and I also asked Jack Kemp to chair a \n14-member blue-ribbon national commission on economic growth and tax \nreform.\n  We asked the commission to start with a blank piece of paper, and to \ndesign a tax system that is flatter, fairer, and simpler--one that \nstrengthens families, and one that encourages savings, investments, \nstrong economic growth, and greater opportunity for all our people.\n  The Kemp commission will issue its report next week, and I anticipate \ntheir recommendations will significantly advance the tax reform debate. \nHopefully, these recommendations will lead us to a new system so we can \nend the IRS as we know it.\n  We also made substantial progress this past year in our efforts to \npass a line-item veto, to bring much-needed reform to America's \ntelecommunications industry, and to restore some common sense to our \ncivil justice system. With our House colleagues, we hope to put the \nfinishing touches on both of these important issues early this \nyear. That is still in conference. It is our hope, perhaps, if there \nshould be a budget agreement, that might become part of the budget \nagreement. The Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain, and Senator Coats, \non this side, have worked on this for years, as have many other of my \ncolleagues, too.\n\n  We have not given up on regulatory reform. We are just shy of the 60 \nvotes we need; we have 58. We are working with our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle because this area affects real people. It costs \nthe average American family about $6,000 per year. We believe in this \ncase it should not be a partisan debate. So I hope we can come together \non that.\n  I also say with pride that just as this Republican Congress has \ninsisted on returning power to the people, we also have made clear that \nCongress is not a ruling class that is above the people.\n  While we were in the minority, Republicans fought for legislation \nthat would subject Congress to the same laws we impose on everybody \nelse. And once we were in the majority, we were able to do just that by \npassing the Congressional Accountability Act.\n  With Republicans in the majority, Congress was able to enact into law \nlegislation that will shine additional sunlight into the lobbying \nprocess, and we also placed a strict limit on gifts that Members of \nCongress and Senators can receive.\n  And with Republicans in the majority, we were able to cut more than \n$200 million from the congressional budget--the largest cut in 40 \nyears.\n  One thing we did not cut, however, was America's national security. \nOver the past few years, the Clinton administration has come \ndangerously close to gutting our national security budget, and this \nCongress reversed that ill-advised course.\n  Let me conclude, Mr. President, by thanking all Senators on both \nsides of the aisle. Our first session was a lengthy one, and at times, \nthe debates have been contentious.\n  But I believe that all of us can take great pride in the fact that \nhistory will reflect we were all part of a truly revolutionary U.S. \nCongress:\n  A Congress that kept its promises.\n  A Congress that fought to change the status quo.\n  A Congress that succeeded in bringing fundamental change to \nWashington, DC.\n  A Congress that, above all, remembered the 10th amendment by \nreturning power to our States and to the American people.\n  Also, again, I trust that in this session, as it says in the 10th \namendment, we will return power to the people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/03/senate-section/article/S1-4", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CONTINUED BUDGET MEETINGS\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, we will meet again, as the Democratic leader \nknows, at 3 o'clock, with the President to talk about whether or not we \ncan come together on a balanced budget amendment over the next 7 years, \nusing CBO numbers. I hope that can be accomplished. I think we are, \nagain, serious in what we are attempting. Whether or not it will \nhappen, we will have to wait and see.\n  We have honored, as far as I know, the so-called blackout. I think we \nmake a lot more progress when none of us are talking to the media. They \nare all good people, do not misunderstand me, but I think in order to \naccomplish this very difficult task, we better have an understanding of \nwhat it is before it becomes public--not just for our sake, but for the \nsake of the American people, for the sake of our colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle. They are going to have to vote on it up or down \nwhen and if we reach that point.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner).

Mr. President, let me commend the distinguished majority \nleader for his leadership in the 1st session of the 104th Congress.\n  Let me also repeat what I said a year ago, when this Congress began: \nDemocrats are willing to work with our Republican colleagues where we \ncan--but we will oppose them where we have to. That is the principle \nthat guided Senate Democrats last year, and the principle we will use \nagain this year.\n  We all wish we were beginning this new session under better \ncircumstances. Instead, the Federal Government remains closed for the \n19th consecutive day. Hundreds of thousands of Federal employees are \nbeing forced to go without pay, and millions of taxpayers are being \ndenied services for which they have already paid.\n  The American people deserve better than this, Mr. President, and this \nCongress is capable of better. We proved that on a number of occasions \nlast year. We proved that we could work together--Democrats and \nRepublicans, Senate and House--to accomplish something worthwhile.\n  Today, as we begin the second session of this Congress, I think it is \nworth reviewing those occasions on which we were able to achieve broad \nconsensus last year.\n  Second, let's look at the successes we achieved in this Senate when \nwe were able to replace extremism with reason.\n  Third, let's remember the opportunities we lost last session when we \ncould not work together to do what the American people sent us here to \ndo. In each case, I believe we can learn something that may help us in \nthis session.\n  One area in which this Congress was able to achieve broad consensus \nis congressional reform. Democrats fought in the 103d Congress for a \nCongressional Accountability Act to hold Congress to the same standards \nwe demand of other employers. We fought for lobbying disclosure and a \nreal gift ban. And we fought to put an end to the irresponsible \npractice of unfunded Federal mandates. We were grateful that our \nRepublican colleagues finally joined us last year in supporting these \nproposals and passing them into law.\n  Another important area in which Democrats and Republicans worked \ntogether successfully was in helping to secure the chances for peace in \nBosnia the right way--by strengthening the NATO alliance rather than \nshattering it. While the results of our decision cannot be determined \nimmediately, I am hopeful that as a result of our continued \ncooperation, we can work with the administration to see that our \nefforts in Bosnia remain a success.\n  In other areas, we achieved success with smaller--but still \nbipartisan--margins. These were issues on which Democratic Senators, \njoined by a few of our moderate Republican colleagues, were able to \ntemper the extremism of certain proposals sent over from the House. \nThrough that effort, we avoided deep cuts in school lunch programs, and \nwe preserved the rights of ordinary citizens to know what kinds of \ntoxic \n\n[[Page S3]]\nchemicals are being emitted in their neighborhoods.\n  There are still other areas in which we were unable to reach \nagreement. These are, in many cases, the lost opportunities of the \nfirst session of this Congress. It is my hope that we will be able to \nput aside our differences and recapture those opportunities this year.\n  Perhaps the greatest of these lost opportunities is welfare reform. \nWe had the ability to change welfare, as we say, from a way of life to \na way out. We had more than an opportunity; we had a bill. We passed a \ngood, workable bill in this Senate that would have given people on \nwelfare a real chance to support themselves and their families. But we \nlost that opportunity when extremism once again reared its ugly head in \nconference. I hope we will have the chance this year to correct that \nmistake.\n  Another lost opportunity is the anti-terrorism legislation we passed \nin the Senate; 9 months after Oklahoma City, that legislation \nlanguishes in the House for reasons unknown.\n  As the majority leader indicated, Democrats opposed the balanced \nbudget amendment put forth last year by Republicans because it would \nhave used Social Security funds to pay off Washington's debts and hide \nthe real size of our deficit. We regard that amendment as yet another \nopportunity lost. The American people are ready--in fact they are \ndemanding--that we deal with the deficit honestly.\n  The 1st session of the 104th Congress, represented a number of \ndisappointments. We are disappointed, frankly, that we did not pass \nwelfare reform that promotes work and protects children. We are \ndisappointed that we did not pass a minimum wage law, long overdue. We \nare disappointed that we did not pass even a minimum health reform \npackage. We are disappointed we did not pass the campaign finance \nreform bill that should have been passed a long time ago. We are \ndisappointed we did not pass meaningful farm legislation. The farm bill \nhas been pending and we are well into the new crop year and farmers \nstill wonder what the farm policy will be even as they begin to plant \nfor the 1996 season.\n  We are hopeful in the coming months we can deal with these \ndisappointments in the same bipartisan fashion we dealt with issues \nfrom unfunded mandates to Bosnia. I remain willing to work with my \ncolleagues, the majority leader, and all of my colleagues on the \nRepublican side to ensure that we achieve the kinds of successes we are \ncapable of in the second session of this Congress. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/03/senate-section/article/S2-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 EXTENSION OF TIME FOR MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats).

Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep concern \nover the President's veto of the defense authorization bill and to \nstate very clearly why I am not convinced that ratification of the \nSTART II Treaty is in the best interests of the United States national \nsecurity.\n  At the heart of both of these matters is the issue of national \nmissile defense and whether we are really serious about defending our \nNation and the American people against ballistic missile attack. As I \nhave stated many times on this floor, I am serious about this issue. I \nthink there is no higher priority for our Nation's overall defense \nposture than the issue of national missile defense.\n  The threat is a very real threat. I have stated several times on this \nfloor and quoted many people who are the experts who understand and \nevaluate what the threats are around the world. Certainly, the former \nCIA Director, James Woolsey, is in a position to know and to evaluate \nwhat a threat is to our Nation. That is what he did for a living. He \nwas appointed by this President. He stated that he knows of between 20 \nand 25 nations that have or are developing weapons of mass \ndestruction--either chemical, biological, or nuclear--and are \ndeveloping the missile means of delivering these weapons.\n  In addition to that, we know that North Korea--with its development \nof the Taepo Dong II missile--is going to be capable of reaching Hawaii \nand Alaska by the year 2000 and the continental United States by the \nyear 2002. Yet all we are talking about in the defense authorization \nbill is to develop a national missile defense system by the year 2003, \nnot even meeting the time that missiles would be able to reach the \ncontinental United States. Many people like to speak of social programs \nand priorities almost as if national defense no longer matters now that \nthe cold war is over. Yet I am convinced more every day that the threat \nfacing the United States is in many ways greater now than it was when \nwe had only two superpowers that we could identify. Right now we have \nLibya, Syria, Iran, Iraq, and many other nations that are developing \nthe kind of destructive weapons and missile technology that pose a \ndirect threat to our country.\n  I suggest also that when the President and others try to use such \nterms as ``star wars,'' are grossly misleading the American people, \ntrying to make it appear not only that the prospect of a real and \naffordable missile defense is somehow a fantasy but also that the \nthreat itself is a mythical thing that is not real, not something that \nwe need to be even remotely concerned about. But they are wrong, Mr. \nPresident. They are living in the past. They do not realize that \ntoday's advancing weapons and missile technology are not the same as \nwhat they were 10 years ago when they might not have been so imminent a \nthreat affecting our Nation's security. Today it is there and it is not \nto be taken lightly by those charged with responsibility for defending \nAmerica.\n  We have an investment in this country of over $38 billion in just the \nAegis system. The Aegis is an existing system of naval ships that have \nadvanced capabilities for both air and missile defense. For an \nadditional investment of just $4 to $5 billion over several years, we \ncould have a very basic and limited national missile defense capability \nready to deploy in that short period of time that was called for in our \ndefense authorization bill.\n  That has now been vetoed. It was vetoed for one major reason, and \nthat is the President stated that it would be in violation of the ABM \nTreaty. But as others have pointed out previously, the bill was \nspecifically crafted so as not to violate the treaty. Instead, it \nmerely suggested that the President be urged to negotiate cooperative \narrangements with Russia to allow us to proceed with necessary missile \ndefense programs.\n  Now, Mr. President, I think it is important to realize the President \nis saying that we do not have a high priority on our Nation's missile \ndefense system. The ABM Treaty was put in place back in 1972 during the \nNixon administration. The architect of that treaty was Henry Kissinger. \nDr. Kissinger at that time felt that this policy of mutual assured \ndestruction was something that was worthwhile in that we had two \nsuperpowers and it put us each in a vulnerable position. Since we would \nnot be able to defend ourselves, and the other side would be in the \nsame position, it was thought that this would be some kind of an \nadvantage in providing strategic stability. I did not agree with it at \nthe time but nonetheless that is what was adopted.\n  I think it is interesting to remember what was stated not too long \nago by Dr. Kissinger when we asked him the question, publicly, on \npublic record: You were the architect of the ABM Treaty back when the \nABM Treaty was put in place, and you felt this was something that was \nin the best interests of this country; what about today, now that we \nhave the proliferation of missiles and of weapons of mass destruction? \nHe said it does not make any sense anymore. He said in a direct quote, \n``It is nuts to make a virtue out of our vulnerability.''\n  Mr. President, that is exactly what we have done when we hold up the \n\n[[Page S4]]\n  ABM Treaty as the cornerstone of U.S. strategic defense policy as this \nadministration has done. The President has stated in his veto message \nthat there is a linkage between the ABM Treaty and the START II Treaty. \nHe says the Congress' determination to proceed with national missile \ndefense ``puts U.S. policy on a collision course with the ABM Treaty,'' \nand ``puts at risk Russian ratification of the START II Treaty.'' I \nreject the notion that we should adopt some type of a treaty--in this \ncase the START II Treaty--just in order to protect the provisions of \nthe ABM Treaty.\n  I am aware that there is broad support in this body for ratification \nof the START II Treaty. I understand it. I expect the final vote to be \noverwhelmingly in favor. That vote may be a 98 to 1 vote and I may be \nthe 1, but I would be compelled to speak out and at least let the \nAmerican people realize how significant an issue this is.\n  There are a lot of reasons to be concerned about the merits of the \nSTART II Treaty. You could talk about compliance, the fact that the \nRussians' past record does not inspire a lot of confidence. We could \ntalk about verification. Many provisions would be difficult to verify \nin the very best of circumstances. We could talk about the SS-18 MIRV'd \nmissiles, and the fact that this would not actually do away with the \nlaunch facilities for these destructive multiwarhead missiles. We could \ntalk about the downloading provisions and the fact that, in many cases, \nit does not require that you do away with the missile. It merely \nrequires that you download it. And if you download it, then you can \nturn around and upload it.\n  Yet for all of these concerns, I don't seek to go into great detail. \nBut what I will be addressing is what it does as far as the ABM Treaty \nis concerned and how it impacts our ability to proceed with the kind of \nnational missile defense we need. This is what is most important.\n  I agree with Dr. Kissinger that the ABM Treaty is something that \noutlived its usefulness and no longer should be effective today. And, \nwhile I respect the views of some of my colleagues who are saying we \nnow have managers' amendments that address all of these problems, I do \nnot think these managers' amendments really do address them. For one \nthing, they do not change the treaty itself. All they are is advice by \nthe Senate. I agree that those nine provisions of the managers' \namendments are good and they make the Senate's understanding of the \ntreaty much clearer. Unfortunately, they are not a part of the treaty.\n  I think we should recognize, finally, Mr. President, that they \nunderwent some parliamentary elections in Russia on December 17. The \nCommunists got 22 percent of the vote gaining seats and renewed \ninfluence. We now have the Communists at 157 seats in the Duma. Then \nyou have Boris Yeltsin's party. Then there is a very interesting \nindividual by the name of Vladimir Zhirinovsky, from the \nultranationalist party that is now No. 3, close behind the party that \nwe were hoping would stay in power.\n  So it is a changed situation that we have today. And, of course, none \nof us can predict the future with certainty. But I come back to a \nsimple proposition. Missile defense is among our highest national \nsecurity priorities. If the President believes this priority must be \nsacrificed to gain Russia's approval of START II, then I would suggest \nit is too high a price to pay. This is why I believe it is imperative \nto resolve the impasse over the Defense authorization bill before we \nmove to final approval of the START II Treaty.\n  Therefore, today, I am joined by Senator Bob Smith in sending a \nletter to the majority leader stating we will object to proceeding to \nfinal action on the START II Treaty until an arrangement has been made \nwith the Clinton administration enabling the people of America to be \ndefended against missile attack. I believe this a prudent and justified \ncourse of action and I would urge my colleagues to concur.\n  Finally, if there were other individuals who had been with me in \nOklahoma City on April 19, where we observed the results of the most \ndevastating domestic bombing in the history of this country, they might \nbegin to understand what is at stake. There at the Murrah Federal \nOffice Building, we saw the destruction and had heard the cries of the \nindividuals who were in there trapped and injured. And, of course, so \nmany died--169 brave Oklahomans and wonderful people; citizens, who \nwere not guilty of anything. They were killed without warning and \nwithout provocation for no apparent reason. This is modern terrorism at \nits worst. But if you just multiply that tragedy by 100 or 200 or 300, \nyou can only begin to imagine what type of impact a future missile \nattack might have on a major American city.\n  The threat is there. The threat is more imminent than many realize. \nIt is a very real threat.

Mr. President, first of all I commend Senator Dole and \nthose leaders on the other side of the aisle who yesterday made it \npossible to pass a clean CR. I am sorry we did not do it sooner. I wish \nit had been done sooner. But I commend and applaud the Republican \nleadership and those Members of the Senate who allowed this to go \nforward.\n  Mr. President, I grew up in a small town in southern Nevada. When I \nwas in the eighth grade, there were six kids in the class. That was one \nof our bigger classes. In the school at that time there was a bully. He \nwas an eighth-grader and everyone in the school was afraid of him. If \nthey were not afraid of him they worked something out with him, so that \nthey could live with him.\n  We rarely had new people come to school there, but there was a young \nboy who came to school, an eighth-grader, somewhat small in stature, \nwho came from someplace in Arizona. His name was Gary. He was a quiet \nyoung lad. And he was pushed around by this bully for 3 or 4 days, a \nweek, 2 weeks. Finally this young man said I have had enough of this \nand we are going to settle this. And this young boy agreed to fight the \nbig bully. Everyone knew the bully would win, everyone except Gary. And \nthey engaged in fisticuffs and the young man, like one of the heroes in \nthe books we read as young kids, won the fight. The bully was all \nthrough. He no longer pushed anyone around.\n  The reason I mention that, we kind of have a bully running around \nCongress. It is in the form of 73 Republican freshman Congressmen. They \nhave suddenly gotten the stature that they can push everybody around. \nMr. President, there are 535 Members of Congress, 435 House Members. It \nseems to me that leaves about 360-plus Members of the House who should \nbe able to do pretty much what they want to do. Mr. President, 73 \nshould not a bully make; 73 should no longer be able to push a body of \n535 people around. The time has come, as when Gary came to Searchlight \nElementary School many, many years ago, to stand up for what is right.\n  What is right is to allow people to go to work and to be paid for \nworking. I think it is absolutely unreasonable and unconscionable that \nthe American taxpayer would be told: Yes, we are going to pay these \npeople someday in the future. We are going to pay them, but they do not \nhave to work for the pay.\n  Please, somebody tell me how that is rational? How is that \nreasonable? We are saying, ``Go ahead and stay home, do not work, and \nwe will pay you anyway''?\n  Or, we have another deal floating around. You can come back to work \nbut you cannot buy any pencils, cannot buy any gas for cars. You \nbasically cannot do anything.\n  Mr. President, I suggest that people of good will, both Democrats and \nRepublicans, should follow the lead of the Republican leadership in the \nSenate, what took place in this body yesterday, and do what is right. \nWhat is right is to pass a clean CR and get on with our business. Allow \npeople to go back to work.\n  Some people say an ongoing Government shutdown is a good thing. I \nsay, tell that to people who want to get a visa to come to the United \nStates. Thousands of them every day want to do that and they cannot do \nthat. Does \n\n[[Page S5]]\nthat matter? Of course it matters, because those people who come here \nspend around about $3,000 in businesses and retail stores around here. \nStudents trying to get home need to have paperwork processed in our \nEmbassies overseas, and that cannot be done. Foreign exchange students \nwant to come here to study. They cannot do that.\n  One Member of this body suggests that no one even noticed the \nshutdown and we ought to keep the Government partially closed. I say \nthat is foolish. Whoever said that has not been out of the beltway long \nenough. Say that, that the Government shutdown does not mean anything, \nto Meals on Wheels. What is Meals on Wheels? Meals on Wheels is people \nwho are shut-in's, and they are allowed to stay at their homes as a \nresult of Meals on Wheels. If Meals on Wheels is shut down, these \npeople are going to have to go into rest homes, extended care \nfacilities, and cost the taxpayers even more. Meals on Wheels allows \npeople their independence, their ability to stay at home. But for Meals \non Wheels, our rest homes, our convalescent centers, our extended care \nfacilities would be burdened even more than they are.\n  For someone who says we ought to keep it shut down, what about our \nSuperfund cleanup sites? We have now Superfund cleanup sites that are \nbeing cleaned up. We just had a big celebration because the final Love \nCanal payment was made. We have 30 Superfund cleanup sites that are \ngoing to be shut down in the next 24 hours; shut down. That not only \ninvolves stopping the cleanup, it costs a lot more money to get them \ncranked up again. So people do care if the Government is shut down. \nThey care about the thousands and thousands of people who cannot go to \nour national parks. They cannot go fishing, and small retail merchants \nat entrances to these parks are screaming for help. They depend on \nthese national parks to earn a livelihood.\n\n  This shutdown has nothing to do with agreeing to a balanced budget. \nWe could go back to the process of the appropriations bills which were \nnot passed. We could pass blame on why they were not passed. The fact \nof the matter is they were not passed, and there is no reasonable, just \ncause for this Government shutdown and not allowing people to go to \nwork. In fact, we are paying them anyway.\n  Agreeing to a balanced budget plan and allowing the Government to \noperate are two entirely separate issues. There is simply no linkage. \nThere should be no linkage. Attempts to make one solely contingent upon \nthe other is really a form of legislative terrorism. The Federal \nworkers are being used as negotiating chips. In order for one side to \nbe able to declare unconditional victory, these people are being used \nas pawns. This simply is not right. They are not part of the best \nequation leading to a balanced budget, and it ought not to stop them \nfrom going back to work.\n  What is the current impact of the shutdown?\n  Six hundred thousand elderly Americans may lose their Meals on \nWheels. That is a large number of people.\n  States have lost $74 million in grants for child protection programs. \nChild protection programs, this is not welfare. These moneys are used \nto deal with more than 2\\1/2\\ million cases of child maltreatment each \nyear.\n  Eleven States have exhausted their funding for unemployment \ninsurance.\n  The Federal Housing Administration is unable to process 2,500 home \nloans and refinancing each day of the shutdown. There are 2,500 each \nday.\n  More than 1,000 workplace safety complaints have gone unanswered. We \nreceive an average of about 240 calls each day to EPA's hotline for \ndrinking water contamination information. We have people who are \ncomplaining that their water is contaminated. These are calls going \nunanswered.\n  Five other hotlines which receive thousands of calls each month are \nshut down, depriving the public of potentially critical information on \npesticides, toxic substances, asbestos in schools, and other public \nhealth information.\n  Three hundred and eighty-three thousand people each day are being \ndenied access to our national parks--almost 400,000 people a day. And \nsome say it does not matter?\n  As Senator Dole said yesterday--enough is enough. It is time to end \nthis folly and stand up to this bully. A few jabs and a left hook would \nend them real quick.\n  This, Mr. President, should end immediately. The bully should be put \ndown, and put down quickly.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

In my judgment, he has \nbeen a pillar of strength throughout.\n  I also extend my remarks to the distinguished Democrat leader who has \nworked with Senator Dole here in the last 48 hours, and many Members on \nboth sides.\n  I think the Senate should stand with great pride as to how it has met \nthis tragic shutdown in the Federal Government and the ripple effect \nthroughout the private sector, so that it just is not the Government \nemployees.\n  I will also address other matters from my constituents here \nmomentarily. But I wish to thank the Senator from Nevada for his \nremarks about our distinguished leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/03/senate-section/article/S5-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR FEDERAL EMPLOYEES\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this morning in my office Congressman \nWolf, Congressman Davis, and Congresswoman Morella joined--and we now \nhave met several times a day--to try to provide our respective \nleadership here in the Senate and in the House, together with our \ncolleagues from Maryland.\n  I note the presence of the junior Senator from Maryland on the floor, \nas well as yesterday the senior Senator from Maryland, and Senator Roth \nalso.\n  We worked here as a group because the greater metropolitan area of \nWashington is probably the most severely affected as a consequence of \nthis Government shutdown. Not only is there a large number of \nemployees--perhaps as high as a half million--who are working at their \njobs without pay, but there are some 260,000 to 280,000 who are \nfurloughed and not able to report to their offices for various reasons.\n  I also wish to mention that at 1 o'clock, and I shall be departing \nshortly to join Members of Congress, Congressman Davis, Congressman \nFrank Wolf, and Congresswoman Connie Morella, and others, to meet with \nthe various members of the Federal Employee Education and Assistance \nFund. This is under the leadership of Jerry Shaw, a nationally known \nindividual with Federal employees, currently the counsel for the Senior \nExecutive Association.\n  We are coming together, the Members of Congress, to encourage \nothers--those who can--who will pledge some personal financial support \nfor Federal employees receiving short paychecks. This is becoming a \ncrisis.\n  I commend the Federal Employee Education Assistance Fund for doing \nthis. This is a private member of the Combined Federal Campaign \nassisting Federal employees in dire need during the shutdown with \ninterest-free loans for rent, mortgage, utilities, and food. The \ncharity is in danger of running out of funds without additional \ncontributions.\n  I am happy to join with others to try to make our contributions to \nhelp them.\n  Attending this 1 o'clock meeting will be representatives from the \nFederal employee organizations represented on the board of directors. \nAmong them include the Senior Executive Association, the National \nTreasury Employees Union, the Federal Managers Association, the \nNational Federation of Federal Employees, and the Social Security \nManagers Association.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/03/senate-section/article/S5-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5-S7]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Now, Mr. President, I would like to make reference again \nto the problems here. They are all well \n\n[[Page S6]]\nknown to Members of the Senate, particularly those of us who have been \nhere the last few days as the Senate and the House began to resume \nactivities.\n  We are still hopefully waiting for the President's budget message \nshowing us the balanced budget. We are at an impasse because we do not \nhave an agreed-upon budget, but a 7-year balanced budget with the \nCongressional Budget Office numbers seems to be agreed upon by both the \nPresident and the leadership of Congress. So I am hopeful that will be \nforthcoming.\n  I think the American people are looking to the Congress now for \nleadership. I again commend the leadership of the Senate and many \nothers who are participating.\n  I hope--and I say this with a long pause--but I hope that the same \nleadership can come from the Speaker of the House and others to realize \ntoday the need to pass a continuing resolution for these employees \ngovernmentwide. In addition, we have a crisis here in the Nation's \nCapital, the District of Columbia. That also requires a continuing \nresolution which I hope will be acted upon favorably today.\n  But the Federal Managers Association newsletter which arrived in the \nSenate offices this morning graphically portrays the ripple effect of \nthis problem. I am reading from a paragraph of that letter.\n\n       Social Security Administration: On a normal day the SSA's \n     1-800 telephone number receives about 250,000 calls. Today, \n     the SSA expects to receive 2 million calls.\n\n  I repeat, Mr. President: 2 million calls.\n  Managing this task is that volunteer group of Federal employees who \nare coming to work without pay.\n  It is interesting, but tragic to note, that a number of the managers, \nthe senior executives of the Social Security Administration, and indeed \nthe Veterans' Administration, are making loans from their own budgets \nto some of the lower paid employees to enable them just to meet \ntransportation costs to come in, and to work with this volunteer group.\n  Some of the lower paid Social Security Administration workers are \ntelling their managers they can no longer afford transportation costs \nto get to work to answer the 2 million calls.\n  I wish to commend the can do spirit that is prevailing throughout the \nFederal Government to try to provide these services to needy people.\n  Back to the Veterans' Administration.\n  They are caring for those who serve this Nation in the time of our \ngreatest need. And now the managers again are working with the lower \npaid employees, the local banks, guaranteeing loans to secure the \nneeded funds just to get these employees over this period which I hope \nwill come to a conclusion today. And from my own State the switchboard \nis off the hook. We are there in my office together with other Senate \noffices taking these calls. I wish to pay special tribute to those in \nmy office, Anna and Patty and Todd and Doreen, all of whom have been by \nthe phones throughout the day and well into the evening to take calls \nsuch as the following:\n\n       My name is Brian Rothermel, a heart transplant recipient. I \n     am a member of a 7-person team from the United States \n     scheduled to go to France to participate in the ``2nd Winter \n     World Heart Transplant Games'' along with participants from \n     38 other countries. I have been unable to get my passport due \n     to the Government shutdown. My flight is to leave out of New \n     York on a chartered trip to France on January 5. Please give \n     me help.\n\n  From the Handicapped Placement Service--this is a volunteer \norganization which helps handicapped persons obtain jobs and work in \nthe Federal Government--dated December 28:\n\n       Dear Senator: Many of our employees are being hammered by \n     the budget impasse. Because our employees are contract staff \n     rather than Federal employees, they received no wages during \n     the last furlough. The impact from that stoppage was over \n     $11,000 in wages lost to our employees. As you know, over 80 \n     percent of our employees are people with disabilities and \n     most cannot afford lost wages.\n\n  This story goes on and on, Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent \nthat I may have printed in today's Record other communications from \npeople seeking help from my office as well as other Senate offices.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              Fairfax Opportunities Unlimited,\n\n                                                December 28, 1995.\n     Hon. John W. Warner,\n     Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner: Many of our employees are being \n     hammered by the budget impasse. Because our employees are \n     contract staff rather than Federal employees, they received \n     no wages during the last furlough. The impact from that \n     stoppage was over $11,000 in wages to our employees.\n       As you know, over 80% of our employees are people with \n     disabilities and most cannot afford to lose wages. They are \n     not paid at the same level of pay and benefits as Federal \n     employees, and so the impact is very real and significant. \n     Our organization, as a non-profit, is obviously not in a \n     position to be able to protect people financially as the \n     impasse drags on.\n       We currently have people out of work at EPA, FBI, Commerce, \n     and GSA and we received notification yesterday that 10 people \n     at a second EPA site are being sent home today. The impact \n     for all of these folks is potentially far greater than the \n     first shutdown (which affected more people but was resolved \n     relatively quickly).\n       I know that you and other members of our Northern Virginia \n     delegation have been very active in protecting the interests \n     of our local Federal employees. If there is any way that \n     contractor staff, most of whom are at greater financial risk \n     because of wage and benefit differentials, can be protected \n     in this round of reviews, please help make that happen. In \n     any case, anything that can help speed resolution of the \n     current differences will help minimize the significant \n     financial losses that our employees are in the midst of \n     trying to cope with.\n       Thanks so much and a happy new year!\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Janet Samuelson,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                  January 2, 1996.\n       Dear Senator Warner: We are two federal employees who \n     believe in the Republican values of individual \n     responsibility, family responsibility, and service to \n     country. Accordingly, one and five years ago respectively, we \n     left lucrative private employment to return to federal \n     service. We have a home, just completed putting one daughter \n     through college, and now have two attending college. This \n     week a mortgage and two sets of tuition, room and board, and \n     textbook bills had to be paid. In short, we gladly go in each \n     weekday to work hard in federal service, then return each \n     night to family life with its rewards, responsibilities and \n     financial obligations.\n       In the private sector it was a given that one's employment \n     and financial welfare were directly related to performance \n     and output: work hard and produce, and you are rewarded. In \n     the federal workforce, however, we are reliant on the \n     President and Congress for our employment and financial \n     compensation. We depend on you and your colleagues. \n     Consequently, we ask you to stop the shutdown and allow us to \n     go back to work with pay.\n       We believe a balanced budget is important for the country, \n     but we believe reasonable people can accomplish this and \n     allow the government to work at the same time. In the next \n     pay period, we will embark on serious financial problems \n     through no fault of our own. We hold the President and \n     Congress responsible and we ask you to put us back to work \n     now. Anything else will undoubtedly result in an anti-\n     incumbent bias within the federal workforce, regardless of \n     past party affiliation.\n                                    Vern and Mary Ann Bettencourt,\n     Burke, VA.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                  Yorktown, VA, December 29, 1995.\n       Dear Senator Warner: I am writing you to express my concern \n     with what is happening or not happening in the Congress \n     concerning passage of the federal budget. First, let me state \n     that I agree with trying to balance our budget. It has gone \n     for too many years in the red and something should have been \n     done years ago! Get rid of unnecessary costs, and there \n     appear to be many, but keep what is necessary to keep our \n     country the great nation it has become.\n       Next, I'll let you know that I have been employed for \n     twenty years by the federal government as a medical \n     technologist either with the Department of Defense or \n     currently with the Veterans Administration. I have always \n     been proud to serve our military and now our veterans. \n     However, it is a disgrace to our country the behavior of \n     those in power in Congress. It has been difficult working \n     under the conditions you expect us to work under, not knowing \n     whether there is money to order necessary supplies to cover \n     testing for our veterans. Now, I have learned that we will \n     not be paid for one of the weeks we have already worked!! I \n     will continue to work until it is necessary because of \n     financial constraints to seek employment elsewhere. I was not \n     furloughed, I worked. The ones who were furloughed should be \n     allowed to take their leave, not cost the government more \n     money by being granted authorized absence as occurred \n     previously. This nonsense occurring in Congress is supposedly \n     for my best interests! I wish you could witness the havoc \n     occurring in the time keeping departments and payroll at the \n     Veterans Administration, not to mention other federal \n     agencies. How many millions of dollars are being wasted \n     because of furloughs and shut downs? \n     \n[[Page S7]]\n\n       I urge you and other Congressmen to settle this dispute \n     about our budget. Do what is best for our country, pass a \n     balanced budget, but do it promptly!\n           Sincerely,\n     Cecelia J.

My flight is to leave out of New York on a \n     chartered trip to Pro-Loup, France, on January 5, 1996. I \n     have been actively raising money through donations from \n     companies, organizations and individuals to help defray the \n     cost of the trip.\n       The National Kidney Foundation out of New York is the U.S./\n     organizer of the event and all of the money raised goes to \n     them as a tax deduction.\n       I am a key member on the team and will be severely \n     devastated if I am unable to go. Please help me in my ``quest \n     for gold'' and let me get my passport.

Mr. President, I, too, am pleased that the Senate \npassed a continued funding resolution which puts the Federal Government \nback to work and puts money into pay stubs for all Federal employees. I \ncommend the Republican leader for doing that, and I am proud of the \nfact that the Democratic leader has also been offering those continuing \nresolutions. I am relieved that we have finally taken positive action \nto put an end to this national disgrace and the shameful way we have \ntreated our Federal employees.\n  I thank everyone who worked on this continuing resolution that has \npassed, but I am here to say that we need more than a continuing \nresolution. We also need to repair the damage that has been done.\n  Mr. President, I represent a shutdown State, as does the Senator from \nVirginia. What does a shutdown State mean? Of the hundreds of thousands \nof Federal employees that are furloughed, many of them are in the State \nof Maryland. I represent flagship agencies. What are those flagship \nagencies? One is the National Institutes of Health, 13,000 people \nworking around the clock to find the cure and containment of disease \nand they are furloughed. I represent the national space agency at \nGoddard, the Social Security agency, the responsibility of which is to \nrespond to the needs of the elderly in terms of getting out their \nSocial Security benefits; the health care finance agency, the National \nInstitute of Standards. I could go on and on.\n  I can tell you as I have been out meeting with them, visiting with \nthem, talking with them, they know they are out of work, they are out \nof money, and they are out of patience. For those workers who have been \ndeclared essential, what the American taxpayer should know is that \nalthough someone has been declared essential does not mean they are \ngetting paid.\n\n  What are examples of the essential employees? Those are FBI agents, \nthe DEA agents, the drug enforcement agents. This morning I met with \nthe FBI team in the Baltimore area. They are on the job. The drug \ndealers are getting paid. Burglars are getting theirs, the bank \nrobbers. But the very people we rely upon to track down the criminals \nin the United States of America are not getting paid. They are there. \nThey are working. They have every right to be paid.\n  I was at the VA hospital in Baltimore this morning, speaking to the \nnurses, the physical therapists, the physicians, the support team. They \nare there making sure that every veteran is cared for. They are giving \ntheir time and their life's blood, but those doctors, those nurses, are \nnot being paid.\n  Mr. President, that is a national disgrace. When you talk to \nconstituents as I have, they say to me: Why is it that we can have \npeace talks for Bosnia and get it done? Why is it that we can have \nMideast peace talks and get it done? But why is it we cannot have \nbudget peace talks and get it done?\n  I do not know. Maybe we have to take the entire Republican and \nDemocratic leadership including the President and all of us and go down \nthe Wye River and try to get this settled. We need to be very serious \nabout this.\n  Yesterday, when I was at the Social Security Administration, I spoke \nwith the workers there. They want to work, they want to earn their pay, \nand they want to pay their bills. And you know what. They are \nabsolutely worried. They are worried about how they can meet their \nresponsibilities while they are trying to answer the phone calls and do \nthe other work that Social Security requires.\n  This morning, when I met with those FBI agents and met with the \nnurses at the Social Security, I heard incredible talk, stories. At the \nVA hospital, I talked with a nurse who has come into the job without \nfail to save the lives of veterans and they themselves have no money \nfor their mortgage. They have no money for their car payment. They have \nno money for their child care. They worked Christmas Day. They worked \nNew Year's Day. Many of them worked the night shift and therefore are \npaid a premium for that. They are also prohibited from getting any type \nof second job because they are essential employees. How can we turn our \nbacks on these men and women?\n  They have given me letters that they want to go into the \nCongressional Record talking about how they continue to work and \ncontinue to care for the sick and care for the dying and they want to \nknow who is going to care for them.\n  I have a letter from one Federal employee who talks about how, while \nthey have no pay, they are raising money for those who are also out of \nmoney. I have another letter from a nurse who has dedicated her life to \nthe sick. I ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed in the \nRecord, because I want everyone to know the consequences of this.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    Baltimore, MD.\n     Hon. Newt Gingrich,\n     Speaker of the House of Representatives, House of \n         Representatives, Cannon House Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Speaker, I am a Federal employee at the Baltimore \n     VA Medical Center, the wife of also another loyal Federal \n     employee who works for Ft. Howard VAMC. Together we support 2 \n     children, and assist my elderly mother. Our mortgage alone is \n     greater that \\1/2\\ our pay. It seems clear to me that no one \n     serves to profit from this political struggle over the \n     budget. Remember you cannot have everything, so start by \n     prioritizing the most valued needs for the good of everyone. \n     I struggle with the thought that Congress and our President \n     no longer care about what happens to us, and that the \n     decisions to allow other Federal employees to be punished for \n     your inability to perform your job, makes me cringe with \n     fear. As for my case, the risk of losing my home and those \n     things I have worked hard for is incomprehensible when you in \n     the midst of disaster took a vacation. It makes me worry that \n     if our country was threatened by other beings, would you \n     hinder and jeopardize our existence. What you are doing is \n     WRONG . . . It's wrong morally and ethically and you, the \n     entire Congress and President should know that team work is \n     what built our country. Divided you will be conquered, United \n     you will build the new generation, much stronger and able to \n     lead us through more challenging endeavors.\n       There has been no negative outcomes directly affecting you, \n     and why??? Have you created a Them and Us? It is time to earn \n     your keep? Help me, my family and make the RIGHT choices. You \n     were selected for your expertise and administrative skills to \n     manage this task. As we approach the feast of the Three Wise \n     Men, let God send the Holy Spirit to make wise decisions now.\n       I came to work for the Federal Gov't 6 years ago searching \n     for job security, a little premature. I think the Gov't \n     strategies and methods have to move toward rebuilding a model \n     that meets the needs of this day and age. If you want a \n     budget passed, make it contingent on the salaries of those \n     who must decide this process. It appears that the rules to \n     this game are mixed up and with every passing day, you leave \n     Federal workers with the thought that they are not important. \n     The long term effect is a work force that has little \n     motivation and a lot of anger and resentment. Trying to \n     remotivate staff AIN'T EASY.\n       I guess I personally want you to hear how it feels to be \n     one of the Federal employees. It's like the story ``JUNGLE \n     BOOK'' when the little boy raised by animals in the jungle \n     walks into a room filled with the stuffed \n\n[[Page S8]]\n     heads of game, and starts to tear. He says if this is civilization, let \n     me stay an animal, we hunt for food, you hunt for game. . . . \n     Unfortunately, the behavior of you leaders isolated out the \n     Federal Employees (and select groups of them), making us the \n     game. It really hurts to part of them right now. I guess I \n     believed in the UNITED States of America. Unite now, work \n     diligently to restore our confidence for this country.\n           Yours Truly,\n     Marlene Siemek.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                        Mike Holy, R.N., M.S.,\n\n                                   Baltimore, MD, January 3, 1996.\n     Hon. Barbara Mikulski,\n     Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Mikulski: I am a registered nurse, employed at \n     the Baltimore V.A., once furloughed back in November, and \n     now, since December 15th, presently working without pay. I \n     have repeatedly over the past few weeks heard derogatory and \n     mean-spirited comments directed at the federal workforce from \n     a variety of sources. The latest, and what I would consider \n     one of the most reprehensible, came this past Sunday, when on \n     Meet the Press Phil Gramm asked, ``Has anyone really missed \n     the federal workers?''\n       Perhaps, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Gramm has not ``missed'' the \n     workforce because, dedicated to the mission, and despite the \n     lack of pay, they continue to come to work, continue the \n     mission, and in the case of the staff at Baltimore's V.A., \n     continue to minister to the needs of our country's veterans! \n     I would challenge Mr. Gramm, or any of the other detractors \n     of the federal workers, to produce comparable examples of \n     such dedication in the private sector.\n       I would like to share with you, in the hopes that you may \n     share with others, one additional example of the dedication \n     to the community which is evidenced here at the Baltimore \n     V.A. Just five days before Xmas a thirty year old mother of \n     five lost her life in a tragic vehicular/pedestrian accident. \n     Hearing of the news, and the five orphaned children, and \n     aware of what the pay situation would be regarding their own \n     forthcoming paychecks, in a period of just two and a half \n     days V.A. employees contributed and raised one-thousand-\n     fourteen dollars (and thirty-five cents) for the family. The \n     money was hand delivered to a local radio station, to be \n     given to the family, that Friday afternoon, three days before \n     Xmas. Such, Ms. Mikulski, is the ``stuff'' of which the \n     Baltimore V.A. employees are made!\n       I share with you the above, again, in the hopes that you \n     may share it with others who may be unaware of the caliber of \n     the people involved. In spite of the politics within the \n     Washington Beltway, at the Baltimore V.A., the mission \n     continues--``Putting the Veteran First!''\n       Thank you for your continued efforts and advocacy on our \n     behalf!\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Mike Holy, R.N., M.S.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The Senator from Virginia also talked about phone \ncalls. I have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of phone calls coming \ninto my office. We have even had to bring in, in some very emotional \nand highly charged situations, a suicide intervention team because of \nthe desperation that we are facing.\n  Not everybody is a high-paid Federal employee. One of my \nconstituents, one of the nurses, got a paycheck yesterday for 7 cents--\n7 cents--after all the deductions were taken out. Another cannot pay \nher car insurance, and she is not getting paid, and she needs to drive \nher car to work. I have another Federal employee who is deaf, cannot \npay her rent, and they are not accepting the fact that she is \nfurloughed.\n  These are real stories about real people. And why are they not \ngetting paid? They are not getting paid because some refuse to pass a \ncontinuing resolution until we pass a balanced budget. Sure, we want to \npass a balanced budget, but we also need not destroy civil service. And \nwhile the civil servants are on the job, the Federal contractors are \nalso losing their wages.\n  Who are they? They are people like the cafeteria workers at NASA who \nwork at the minimum wage. They work for a contractor. They are never \ngoing to get caught up. They are the small businesspeople who, again, \nare Federal contractors and are not being paid. There are people like \nthe small business lady who has a small photography shop outside of the \nBaltimore passport office. Because there are no passports, nothing is \nhappening. She still has to pay her rent. She has lost 75 percent of \nher business.\n  Mr. President, this cannot go on. This is why I am pleased that the \nRepublican leader passed a no-frills, get-back-to-work continuing \nresolution.\n  Today I hope that the House of Representatives passes this bill. I am \nappalled that the House of Representatives is stalling and is hinting \nthat they will not pass this. We must end this financial nightmare for \nnearly a million Federal employees and contractors. They want to be \nback to work. For those who are working, they want to be paid. Let them \nhave the pay that they have earned.\n  If this does not work, I will come back and offer a CR myself. We \nneed to stop playing games with people's lives and get down to \nbusiness. It is time to stop holding Federal employees hostage.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, I have a great deal of respect for the \nSenate, and I do not want to engage in any histrionics on the floor. \nBut yesterday the Social Security workers, those who want to answer \nthose hotlines, those that want to deal with the million-person \nbacklog, gave me a lock. They gave me a lock, and they gave me some \nchains. What did they do as a symbolic thing? They wanted to lock us in \nand chain the door until we get the Government back to work. They want \nus to go back to work, balancing the budget of the United States.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope today that the House of Representatives \npasses this continuing resolution and that the leadership can come to a \nresolution on this budget crisis. I thank the Chair, and I yield back \nsuch time as I might have.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/03/senate-section/article/S7-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8-S9]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE BUDGET AND ENTITLEMENT SPENDING\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to address what I think is a farce. \nObviously, we are hearing about what are some very significant \nindividual concerns and legitimate individual concerns about Federal \nemployees who are being put through significant stress as a result of \ntheir inability to be paid, which I would note in many instances, such \nas the FBI and the DEA, result from the fact that the President vetoed \nappropriations bills which would have funded those agencies.\n\n  But independent of that really personal and traumatic event which is \noccurring for many Federal employees, there is a much more significant \nevent occurring here which is the question of how, after 26 years, we \nbegin to put fiscal discipline into the Federal Government. And that \nhas a lot of stories, too, a lot of personal stories.\n  In fact, in our Nation today where there are approximately, I guess, \n50 to 70 million children, depending on how you define a child, every \none of those children are a personal story of the fact that we have not \nbalanced our budget. A child born today will have to pay almost \n$170,000 just in interest during their working lives in order to pay \nout debts which our generation has put on their backs. That is a pretty \nbig bill.\n  Just 2 weeks out of work is a big deal, too. Nobody wants to put \npeople through that burden. But what we are doing to our children as a \nnation is even more significant. So what is really the core issue of \nthis debate is how we straighten out our fiscal house so that we do not \nend up passing on to the next generation of Americans a country without \nan opportunity for prosperity, and that comes down to being responsible \nin the managing of our Government.\n  I want to talk a little bit today about what I would perceive as \nbeing a responsible solution to this balanced budget event, because we \nare hearing a lot of discussion and a lot of debate about how this \nshould occur or how that should occur. But let me just note there are a \nfew benchmarks upon which we can evaluate whether or not there has been \nsuccess in getting under control the Federal spending, the rate of \ngrowth of Federal Government and, therefore, the opportunity to bring \nunder control the Federal debt burden that we are passing on to our \nchildren.\n  The real benchmark of this exercise is not quite honestly whether we \nmeet a technical balanced budget in the year 2002, although that is \nabsolutely critical that we do that, because such a balanced budget can \nbe reached, unfortunately, through the adjusting and tinkering with \nassumptions. For example, if you change what the estimated inflation \nrate is over the next 7 years by just a percent or you change the \nestimated rate of revenues by the Federal Government by just a percent, \nyou adjust by hundreds of billions of dollars \n\n[[Page S9]]\nthe amount of money flowing into or out of the Federal Government. As a \nresult, you can reach balance.\n  Of course, assumptions have been part of the debate. That is why we \nhave insisted there be a core score of assumptions called the \nCongressional Budget Office. But that really is not the essence of how \nyou resolve the issue, because the essence of how you resolve the issue \nis what structural changes, what changes have you made in the way this \nGovernment functions that will guarantee or at least give us \nsignificant hope that we will be able to bring under control the \nexpenditures of Government or the rate of growth of the expenditures of \nGovernment in a manner which will allow us to be able to afford the \nsize of the Federal Government over the next 7, 10, 15 years.\n  If you are going to address that issue, it is not so much reaching a \nbalanced budget, it is the programs that drive Federal spending. So as \nwe evaluate the process of reaching a balanced budget and what is \noccurring at the White House, I suggest we look at a few issues because \nthose are the issues that are going to really determine whether or not \nwe are successful.\n  It is not so much whether the numbers that are put on the table after \nthis meeting at the White House, which hopefully will be successful, is \narrived at that say, yes, there is a balance by the year 2002; it is \nnot so much those numbers that are important, it is the programmatic \nactivity that underlies that.\n  In this area, the core issue is the issue of entitlement spending. \nEntitlement spending are those programs which people have a right to \nhave the Federal Government spend money on them because of their \nphysical situation, their financial situation, because of their \nsituation in their lifestyle. Those entitlement programs are the core \nproblem that is driving the Federal debt.\n  In fact, in the year 2015, all the revenues of the Federal Government \nwill be absorbed by the entitlement programs. We will not have any \nmoney to spend on national defense or cleaning up the environment or \nhaving better schools. We will be spending everything just on \nentitlement programs.\n  So the issue of whether or not we are going to bring under control \nFederal spending and whether or not we are going to be able to pass to \nour children and this country a fiscally solvent one versus one that is \nbankrupt, and whether our children will have an opportunity for \nprosperity really comes down to how we address these entitlement \nprograms during this process.\n  In doing that, I think we can score the activities by looking at a \nfew specifics. If the proposal that comes out of the agreements or the \ndiscussions which are now going on with the White House--assuming there \nis a proposal; and I certainly hope there will be--but if such a \nproposal does not aggressively and affirmatively address those \nentitlement programs, then it will be essentially a facade, and we will \nhave accomplished little. The pain that these Federal employees are \ngoing through subject to the continuing resolution failure will be for \nnaught, and how can we know whether or not there has been substantive \nchange or substantive action taken on the entitlement programs.\n\n  Let me lay down a few benchmarks that I think we should look at. \nThere are three basic programs that we are talking about here: \nMedicare, Medicaid, and welfare reform.\n  In the Medicare accounts, clearly there has to be a new way to \ndeliver services. There has to be more opportunity for competition. Our \nsenior citizens have to be given more choices, more opportunity to go \nout in the marketplace, like their kids today, and be able to purchase \nservices other than just what is known as fee for service. Thus, any \nreform that comes out of this process must involve the use and the \nutilization of marketplace forces in a very aggressive way. It must \nallow seniors to do as their children are doing today, which is to opt \ninto other types of health care delivery, whether it happens to be an \nHMO, a PPO, or a group of doctors, or a PSO, which is another form of \ndoctors and hospitals practicing together. Those various options must \nbe made available to our seniors. And I hope that in any resolution of \nthis matter--it must have that type of a choice program in it, a real \nchoice program, and it cannot be just what we presently have in our \nMedicare system, which is basically an illusory choice program.\n  You can also look at the Medicare reform effort and determine whether \nor not it is real by what the rate of the premium payment is. If we go \nback to a 25-percent rate of premium as being the part B premium borne \nby senior citizens, then we will know that basically there has been a \nsellout, that nothing has really happened.\n  The fact is that 31.5 percent is what is needed as the part of the \npart B premium to be paid by seniors if we are going to have a solvent \ntrust fund. Seniors cannot expect that the Medicare trust fund will \nremain solvent if they are going to ask their children to basically \nsubsidize, at an ever-growing rate, the cost of the part B premium.\n  The seniors cannot expect the Medicare system to remain solvent. \nSeniors have to be willing to pay their fair share. By paying their \nfair share and maintaining the premium at 31.5 percent is clearly a \ncore test issue.\n  Another test is whether or not there are copayments, especially \nwhether or not we have a situation where, on the part B premium, people \nwith high incomes are required to pay the full cost of the premium. \nToday, we have the top 500 of retirees from IBM last year being \nsubsidized by the folks who are working at the restaurant, down at Joe \nand Mary's Diner or at the local gas station, and it is not right, it \nis not fair. They are being subsidized to the extent of almost 68.5 \npercent, the cost of their part B premium, and that is not correct.\n  So any reform that comes out of this agreement has to have some sort \nof understanding that high-income individuals will bear the full cost \nof their part B premium.\n  In the Medicaid accounts, it is very obvious that Medicaid has not \nworked the way it was supposed to. Nor has welfare. If we are going to \nmake them work effectively, we have to give the States the flexibility \nto run the programs and to initiate original and imaginative approaches \nto running the programs. We have to end this huge drainoff of funds \nwhich is going into bureaucracy instead of going into care in the area \nof Medicaid and going into direct support in the area of welfare.\n  Today, I think it is less than 40 cents of every welfare dollar \nactually gets to the recipient. The rest goes to overhead. In most \nStates, the administrative costs represent about 15 percent of what the \noperating costs are of a program. So the difference between those two \nnumbers is what States feel they can have available to address the \nneeds of people versus ending up funding bureaucracies.\n  So any program that is going to effectively address the outyear \ndrivers of our budget problems, specifically the entitlement programs, \nmust address the fact that Medicaid and welfare must be decoupled from \nthe entitlement train and be returned to the States to be operated as \nStates' programs with the flexibility being given to the State \ngovernments where there is as much compassion as in Washington to \ndeliver these services to the less needy and to the more needy \nindividuals.\n  So these are some of the tests of whether or not we will reach an \nagreement which is real versus one that is illusory, and in looking at \nany balanced budget agreement, it is essential that we look at those \ntests because it is essential that we have an agreement that is real.\n  I thank the Chair for his courtesy and yield back my remaining time.\n\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/03/senate-section/article/S8-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9-S13]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HOSTAGE TAKING IS NOT PRETTY\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, let me join with those who complimented \nSenator Dole for taking the leadership yesterday in sending a clean \ncontinuing resolution to provide Government funding over to the House. \nI not only want to compliment Senator Dole, I also want to compliment \nall the Republicans on their side of the aisle in the Senate because \nSenator Dole made that proposal, knowing full well that he had \nunanimous consent, or he would not have made it. So I want to not only \ncongratulate him but also the Republicans on the other side who I feel \nare \n\n[[Page S10]]\nworking in good faith trying to bring this to an end.\n  Yesterday afternoon, I was making a couple of notes for some remarks \non the floor this morning. I was going to start out by talking about \nhostage taking, how it is never pretty and it is always unfair. The \ninnocents are penalized for something they had nothing to do with. I \nwas not aware at that time of what the lead editorial in the Washington \nPost was going to be today. They say ``The Government as Stage Prop.''\n  They start out saying almost the same words:\n\n       Hostage-taking is an ugly business. It doesn't matter what \n     the cause. Innocent people are seized and used as pawns; they \n     become political trading stamps whose welfare is exchanged \n     for things the hostage-taker could not win by normal means. \n     That, even more than the mindlessness, the waste (in the \n     supposed cause of economy in government), the inconvenience \n     and the instances of outright harm to unpaid workers and \n     unserved citizens alike, is what is finally wrong with the \n     current Government shut-down.\n\n  I will not read the rest of the editorial. I ask unanimous consent \nthat it be printed in the Record at the end of my remarks, along with \nanother enclosure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, innocents are being penalized for something \nwith which they had nothing to do. Congress protects its own income, of \ncourse. We do not give up any of the $133,600 a year, but for those \nmaking $33,000 a year, it makes all the difference in the world, and \nthis because one small group thinks that they, and only they, have the \nwisdom on how this Government should go and that they can dictate the \nfuture of this Nation.\n  We elect 535 people to the Congress of the United States, and what a \ncharade it is that just a small group thinks that they can shut down \neverything and bring such pressure that the rest of Government, \neveryone else who is elected to Government will give in and say, ``OK, \nthis is getting so bad that we give in to your unfair tactics.''\n  Why do we get into this mess? Let us go back just a few years and see \nwhat happened. Let us go back to the history. Let us ``go to the \ntape,'' as they say on the sports broadcasts.\n  Did Democratic problems contribute to some of the situation we are in \nnow? Why, of course it did. Back some years ago, we had an economy that \nwas not as well managed as it should have been. We wound up at one time \nwith 21-percent interest rates and 17-percent inflation rates, and that \nlead to what was called the ``Reagan revolution.'' That revolution came \nin with an experiment in supply-side economics, as it was called then, \nthat did not work, and we can show that.\n  In the years 1981, 1982 and 1983, we cut taxes by 25 percent--5 \npercent the first year, 10 percent the second year, 10 percent the \nthird year. This was supposed to result in more investment and such an \nincrease in the economy of this country that new revenues were going to \nmore than make up the losses from those tax cuts.\n  It flat did not work. When it started, we had, from George Washington \nthrough to the end of the administration of Jimmy Carter, $1 trillion \nin national debt. What do we have now? In the few short years since \nthat experiment in supply-side economics, we have seen the debt \nskyrocket. We have added $3.9 trillion--$3.9 trillion--in the last few \nyears. It will be just a short time until we hit a total debt of some \n$5 trillion.\n  Entitlement growth has contributed to that, of course. Were we prompt \nin taking action to slow some of these things down, in Medicare, \nMedicaid, and welfare? No, we probably were not. But does that mean we \ndump the whole of the programs and just stop Government now?\n  I know from talking personally with President Clinton on a trip he \nmade to Ohio that first priority of the new administration was get \ncontrol of the economy. Otherwise, all the other things would not be \npossible.\n  What did he do? He came out with a program then, and it was a program \nthat has had considerable success, in spite of the fact it seems to be \nmentioned only rarely these days. About half of it came in cuts in \nprograms and about half of it came in some tax restoration, to restore \nsome of those tax cuts that had happened under the Reagan \nadministration and went too far. President Clinton, to his everlasting \ncredit, had the fortitude to go ahead and make some changes in those \nprograms and restore some of the tax rate that could bring us back into \nbalance.\n  We remember that day on the Senate floor very well in the summer of \n1993. When the effort was made to pass the Clinton program, we had \ncomplete opposition on the other side, both in the Senate and in the \nHouse. It was a very dramatic moment when the Vice President, sitting \nas President of the Senate, broke the 50-50 tie and put the \nadministration's program into effect.\n  Now, every single Republican Member of the House and every single \nRepublican Member of the Senate voted against that proposal to move \ntoward a balanced budget. Every single one. There were no cries then \nabout the balanced budget and so on. It was a complete stonewalling of \nthe President's efforts to get us headed toward a balanced budget. Did \nit work, or did it not work in the ensuing years, since 1993? Let us \nlook at the record.\n  At the time the President made his proposal and at the time that we \nvoted the program in, the budget deficit, per year, was running right \nat $300 billion. Last year, what was the record? The program was \nworking. The budget deficit went down to $246 billion per year.\n  Last year, the record is that it went down to $162 billion. So we \nwere on the right path--without any major revolution, without dumping \nwhole programs of Government. We were tailoring them back.\n  I know from my own personal experience, because I was chairman of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee and I was assigned billions of dollars \nto cut back on programs that did not have that big a budget, and we did \nit. It was tough and we made some very, very tough decisions at that \ntime. That was opposed by every single Republican Member of the \nCongress, in the Senate and in the House. They said, ``We cannot \nrestore any of those tax cuts. We cannot come up with any tax increase \nat all.'' That was the rationale for most of the opposition.\n  Well, it did work. We have been on a track down where the budget \ndeficit has been declining in each one of those years. Where was the \nRepublican interest in the balanced budget? Did anybody ever say a good \nthing on this floor about what was happening as a result of those tough \nvotes we made in the summer of 1993?\n  We need to keep going with those reductions. I agree with that. It \nhas leveled off somewhat. Some of the predictions indicate that it will \nbe $150 to $200 billion as far as the eye can see. So we need to make \nan effort to keep cutting those down and do it not by some great \nrevolution but by the evolution that has been successfully started.\n  It is said that we have to transfer all these responsibilities to the \nStates. Some should be transferred to the States; I agree with that. \nBut I also say that these proposals to shut down the Government are not \naffecting only Federal employees, as has been pointed out on the floor \nhere this morning, they also impact the people on welfare, children, \nthe poor, and the care for the elderly.\n  Here are a few examples of how the people of this country are being \nimpacted, and this is not just Government employees, as important as \nthat may be.\n  We have some 54,000 Federal employees in the State of Ohio. All of \nthose are not affected by this, but I will use that figure. I do not \nhave a breakdown on how many exactly are impacted. We cannot get \ninformation because the appropriate offices that would provide that \ninformation are closed down.\n  These Federal employees are important to us in Ohio. But, Mr. \nPresident, regarding care for the elderly, 600,000 elderly Americans \nface the potential of losing their services of Meals On Wheels, \ntransportation, and personal care provided by the Department of Health \nand Human Services, if a CR is not passed this week. This covers \nprotection and services for children, unemployment insurance, \nsecurities markets, and so many other areas that are affecting every \nsingle American, not just the Federal employees, right now.\n  So what we need to do is say to our colleagues over in the House that \n``enough is enough,'' as the majority \n\n[[Page S11]]\nleader has said. Enough is enough, and it is time that we got on with \nnot only putting Federal employees back to work but rendering the \nservices that the American people expect and are paying for and should \nhave.\n  Over in the House, the Speaker has said that the crown jewel is the \ntax cut. That comes out of Medicare, as I see it, some $270 billion. \nThey say you cannot equate that. If you cannot equate it directly from \nMedicare to the tax cut, that means we are borrowing $245 billion to \ngive a tax cut. We are borrowing the money to give a tax cut. I \ndisagree with President Clinton's proposal on a lesser tax cut, also. I \ndo not believe any tax cut at this time is necessary. Borrowing to give \ntax cuts is pure folly, as I see it.\n  The social fabric of this Nation should not be changed by a \nrevolution dictated by a few, but by evolution, slower change, which \nlets people adapt, whether it be the elderly, children, the sick, the \npoor, those who need Medicaid. To just throw this back to the States \nand say that we will give you a bag of money, but we are going to put a \nmuch greater increase on requirements that you have to comply with, \nmakes the biggest mockery of the unfunded mandates legislation we \npassed earlier this year than I can possibly think of. So we are giving \nthem responsibilities, a little bit of money, and saying, ``Good luck \nto you.''\n  Mr. President, I think we need a clean CR, again, that the House will \naccept. We have narrowed this down to where it is time that the House \nof Representatives and their group of diehards gave in a little bit and \ndecide that we can negotiate these changes and put the Government back \nto work.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Jan. 3, 1996]\n\n                      The Government as Stage Prop\n\n       Hostage-taking is an ugly business. It doesn't matter what \n     the cause. Innocent people are seized and used as pawns; they \n     become political trading stamps whose welfare is exchanged \n     for things the hostage-taker could not win by normal means. \n     That, even more than the mindlessness, the waste (in the \n     supposed cause of economy in government), the inconvenience \n     and the instances of outright harm to unpaid workers and \n     unserved citizens alike, is what is finally wrong with the \n     current government shutdown.\n       Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole was trying again last night \n     to find the formula to reopen temporarily. Good for him; it's \n     the right position; and he takes it at a certain cost. \n     Speaker Newt Gingrich said it would be ``very hard'' to find \n     the necessary votes in the House without a budget agreement. \n     Does he really lack the power to produce such a limited \n     result? Sen. Phil Gramm, meanwhile, one of Sen. Dole's rivals \n     for the Republican presidential nomination, spoke for the \n     vaudeville wing of the party. He is one of those who, over \n     the years, have found it convenient to make almost a cartoon \n     of the federal government.\n       It's a straw-man style of politics. First you portray the \n     awful thing, then you run against it, and no matter if the \n     portrayal bears scant relation to the reality. ``I do think \n     we've discovered one thing,'' he said on television Sunday, \n     ``and that is, Have you missed the government? I mean, \n     doesn't it strike you funny that 280,000 government employees \n     are furloughed, large segments of the government are shut \n     down? I think this proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that we \n     need to go back and eliminate 150,000 to 200,000 bureaucratic \n     positions.'' Mr. Gramm and others thus use the government as \n     a stage prop. Rather than make the decisions they ought to be \n     making--ought in fact to have made weeks ago--both parties \n     are using it, or the lack of it, to score political points \n     and gain leverage in the underlying budget talks, even as \n     they also scramble to avoid the blame for the spectacle they \n     have jointly achieved. We have a suggestion for them. They \n     ought to reopen the closed agencies while they talk, since in \n     fact they do finally seem to be talking. It's a nasty game, \n     the shutdown, and it's gone on long enough.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n      Effects of the Government Shutdown, Tuesday, January 2, 1996\n\n       Congressional Republicans, by refusing to approve funds \n     even for the short term, are forcing a continued shutdown of \n     the government. The continuing shutdown is causing \n     increasingly severe hardships for millions of Americans who: \n     depend on government services; serve the public as federal \n     employees and contractors; and are impacted by the economic \n     spin-off effects of reduced government activity.\n\n\n        effects of the continuing shutdown on average americans\n\n       Care for the elderly: 600,000 elderly Americans face the \n     potential of losing their services of ``Meals on Wheels,'' \n     transportation and personal care provided by HHS if a CR is \n     not passed this week.\n       Protection and services for children: As of today, states \n     will lose $74 million in quarterly grants for discretionary \n     child protection programs, which help states respond to more \n     than 2.5 million reported cases of child maltreatment each \n     year. In addition, the Federal Parent Locator Service, to \n     which 20,000 child support cases per day on average are \n     referred, is closed.\n       Unemployment insurance: By the end of this week, 11 states \n     (plus DC and the VI) will have exhausted Federal funds for \n     administering the unemployment insurance program (New Jersey, \n     Alabama, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Kansas, Alaska, \n     Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, Utah, New Mexico). In \n     order to keep unemployment offices open, states will have to \n     fill the gap with their own funds. Otherwise, unemployment \n     offices would have to close and benefit payments would cease. \n     Kansas has already closed its unemployment office.\n       Securities markets: The SEC's funds are expected to be \n     exhausted by the end of next week, causing delays in review \n     of an estimated three-fourths of pending and new SEC filings \n     for the month of January. A delay in review of filings for \n     initial public offerings, mergers and acquisitions, and \n     filings for new debt or stock offerings would eventually \n     impact the flow of corporate financing and capital formation.\n       Home-buyers: Each day of the shutdown, the Federal Housing \n     Administration cannot process 2,500 home purchase loans and \n     refinancings ($200 million of mortgage loans) for moderate- \n     and low-income working families.\n       Protection of workers: Since the start of the shutdown, \n     over 1,000 workplace safety complaints have gone unanswered \n     and 3,500 investigations involving pension, health and other \n     employee benefit plans have been suspended.\n       Environmental protection: All EPA non-Superfund civil \n     environmental enforcement actions have stopped, costing $3 \n     million a day in fines or injunctive relief against \n     polluters; and as of today, up to 32 Superfund cleanups will \n     be shut down.\n       District of Columbia: The December 22 CR expires tomorrow \n     which will continue the uncertainty over how DC can continue \n     to operate its services.\n       Passports: Each day, the State Department can't process \n     23,000 applications for passports that it would normally \n     receive.\n       Programs for Native Americans: The Bureau of Indian Affairs \n     cannot make general assistance payments due to about 53,000 \n     Indian families and individuals, or to guardians and foster \n     families that care for about 3,000 Indian children.\n       Veterans: While the December 22 CR provided funding for \n     certain benefits and payments, it expires tomorrow; \n     consequently, contractors providing services and supplies to \n     hospitals will not be paid, and benefits for January will not \n     be paid on February 1 in the absence of a CR. In addition, \n     approximately 170,000 veterans did not receive their December \n     Montgomery GI Bill education benefits and will not receive \n     benefits in January. Funding has also lapsed for processing \n     veterans' claims for educational and rehabilitation \n     counseling, and enabling veterans to obtain VA guaranteed \n     home loans.\n       Small businesses: Each day of the shutdown, over 260 small \n     businesses are not receiving SBA-guaranteed financing; and \n     1,200 small business owners are not receiving SBA-sponsored \n     training and counseling normally available to them.\n       National parks/forests and related businesses: Each day, an \n     average of 383,000 people cannot visit National Parks. \n     Potential per day losses for businesses in communities \n     adjacent to National Parks could reach $14 million, due to \n     reduced recreational tourism.\n       Foreign visitors: Each day, the State Department cannot \n     issue 20,000 visas to visitors, who normally spend an average \n     of $3,000 on their trips.\n       Export promotion: On an average day--export licenses with a \n     value of $30.5 million that would otherwise have been \n     approved by the Bureau of Export Administration will not be \n     acted upon; more than $92 million in sales of U.S. products \n     are blocked due to inability to process license applications; \n     and more than 2,500 telephone calls and faxes from U.S. \n     businesses seeking export information are not being answered.\n\n\n                       effects on federal workers\n\n       Due to Congress' failure to approve short-term funds, \n     beginning last Friday, December 29, about three-quarters-of-\n     a-million Federal employees have received only half their \n     usual pay.\n       They received pay for December 10 to 15, but not December \n     16 to 23.\n       Unless the Congress approves funding by late this week, \n     emergency and furloughed employees will not receive pay for \n     the current pay period on time (i.e., next week).\n       480,000 emergency workers are working, and the government \n     is obligated to pay them, but they can't be paid until \n     Congress approves funds to end the shutdown (includes federal \n     law enforcement officials, prison guards, and nurses at \n     Veterans Hospitals).\n       280,000 non-emergency workers are currently furloughed and \n     not being paid (and have no guarantee they will receive back \n     pay unless Congress acts to approve back pay).\n\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  \n[[Page S12]]\n\n\n                      DO WHAT IS RIGHT FOR AMERICA\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I was elected to Congress in 1980. I took \noffice in January 1981. At that time, during that election, there was \nsome view that it was a major election. Ronald Reagan was elected \nPresident, and a number of changes took place that were viewed then as \nhistoric. Republicans took control of the U.S. Senate for the first \ntime since 1954. Republicans did not take control of the House of \nRepresentatives but in a sense they gained working control because they \nelected a significant number of new Members and, joining with \nconservative Democrats, they formed a working majority that passed some \nvery significant legislation.\n  One of the primary issues, if not the primary issue, of that election \nyear and the agenda that was proposed and adopted in part during that \n95th Congress was the whole question that we are debating here today \nand this year, which is, what is the size of Government? What is the \nscope of Government? Is Government too big? Does it try to do too much? \nDoes it overregulate, overspend, overtax? What is the proper role of \nGovernment?\n  David Stockman, then Director of the Office of Management and Budget \nfor then President Reagan, proposed a plan to begin to trim back some \nof the spending of Government. There was an outcry from the American \npeople. It was the issue of the year. When we compare what was then \nproposed with the magnitude of the problem then versus what is proposed \ntoday and the magnitude of the problem today, it is seen as a very, \nvery minor, almost inconsequential, proposal, in retrospect.\n  That debate, in one form or another, has been taking place now for \nthe past decade and a half. In a growing sense of frustration, I think \nthe American people are viewing the Congress as incapable of really \naddressing the fundamental core issues, of really doing something that \nmakes a difference. I do not know how many times we have promised a \nbalanced budget through plans that have been offered by Members from \nboth sides, by both parties. But it was said, ``This is the plan that \nwill balance the budget.''\n  We had, of course, the 1981 and 1982 legislation. We had the 1983 \nSocial Security legislation, which is probably the closest we came to \nmaking a policy change that substantially made a difference in the way \nwe spend money. We had the 1986 agreement, the 1988 agreement, the 1993 \nagreement. Each agreement, Members stood on the floor and said this \nwill do the job. We have finally stepped up to the plate, and we have \ndone what the American people have asked us to do. We go home and \ncampaign on it. This is the real balanced budget. Gramm-Latta I, Gramm-\nLatta II--we have been through it all. There is plenty of blame to \nspread as to why this was not accomplished.\n\n  The Senator from Ohio talked about tax cuts that were proposed and \nthose were attempts to address the question of more and more hard-\nearned money from those who are in the work force being siphoned off to \nGovernment--whether Federal, State, local, or sales tax, or excise tax, \nor whatever--and also an attempt to dry up the supply of money coming \nfrom taxes, to try to slow down the spending. We can argue whether that \nwas proper strategy or not.\n  I do not think anybody would argue the fact that we have seen the \nnational debt accelerate from a $1 trillion level when I came to \nCongress in 1981, to nearly $5 trillion level, a 500-percent increase \nin just this short decade and a half, that the solution would have been \n$4 trillion of additional taxes out of the American taxpayers pockets. \nI do not think anybody is advocating that as the solution.\n  So now here we are with this ever-accelerating frustration on the \npart of the American people, cynicism, apathy, distrust of this \ninstitution's ability to successfully address this problem. Here we \nare, now, in 1995, having spent this last year primarily attempting to \naddress this question.\n  We had, again, what many would call a historic election in 1994. As \nthe American people exercised their frustration with the status quo, \ntheir frustration with the way that the Congress was addressing the \nquestion, the fundamental question, of what the role of Government is \nand its ever-expanded expenditure that was placing our Nation's \neconomic future in jeopardy and, I think, violated the basic moral \nresponsibility that many people feel we have, and that is to not \ncontinue to pass on debt for the enjoyment of expenditures, the \nutilization of expenditures for our own enjoyment in the present, paid \nfor by someone else's earnings in the future.\n  I argue that there is an economic necessity for our getting hold of \nthis ever-accelerating rate of growth in the Government and that there \nis a moral requirement placed on each of us to do what I think each of \nus knows is the right thing to do, and that is not to enjoy the \nbenefits of this society that the Federal Government can provide to us \nin the form of payments and benefits to the extent that it places an \nextraordinary debt load and obligation on the future. That is one of \nthe most basic principles of life: Delaying gratification so that you \ndo the things that are necessary now to provide for a better result in \nthe future. We have robbed our children of this lesson. We have \ndemonstrated to them, I think, a great irresponsibility in terms of the \nway in which we handle our Nation's finances.\n\n  Now, all of this came to a head early on when we debated the balanced \nbudget amendment, because many of us stood here and argued, having gone \nthrough all this statutory process, this process of will, if we just \nwork hard enough with it we are able to deal with this problem; having \ngone through that several times and failed miserably, that only a \nconstitutional mandate to balance the budget would accomplish what we \nwere seeking to accomplish.\n  That was supported, largely by Republicans but also by a significant \nnumber of Democrats, and failed by one vote. It was the greatest \ndisappointment of my time in Congress to lose that by one vote, because \nas I spoke here, I said I doubt that we will ever have on a sustained \nbasis the will to do what is fiscally responsible on a year-after-year \nbasis, because the political requirement, or at least the political \ntemptation to please constituents now and worry about paying for it in \nthe future is so great that it will continue to drive us toward \nproviding more and more benefits and less and less personal \nresponsibility in terms of asking people to pay for those benefits in \nthe here and now.\n  Because the Government has the ability to float debt and postpone \nrepayment of those obligations, the political temptation to sort of \nplease those people you represent now so that you can get elected at \nthe next election and worry about repayment of that or putting the hard \nquestions before the people we represent, that is always deferred.\n  Now, in 1994 I think that frustration, as I said, boiled over. We had \na dramatic change in the representation in the House of Representatives \nand, I think, a very strong mandate from the American people that they \nwanted something different than the status quo. They wanted the real \nthing. In response to many who said, ``Well, I'm not voting for this \nbalanced budget because it doesn't have an exception for this, an \nexception for that, and, besides, we shouldn't have to rely on the \nConstitution to make us do what we know is right. We should have the \nwill to do it ourselves. So let's forget the mandatory constitutional \nrequirement and let's go forward by exercising our own personal will \nand do what we know is right.'' That is what the attempt has been all \nthis year.\n  Here we are. Now it is 1996. We were not able do that in 1995. We are \narguing over small numbers and details and large numbers and details, \nbut we are not focusing our efforts on the core concepts.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire came down here a few moments ago and \nredirected our attention back to what I think are the basics, what \nshould be the basics of this debate. Instead of focusing on those \nbasics, we are focusing on whether or not a Federal employee should be \npaid for work that they are doing now, whether they should be held \nhostage to this process, what the impact is on people and their \nfamilies, and that impact is real. However, it does not address the \ncore debate.\n  Mr. President, it seems to me our options are somewhat limited at \nthis point. We can talk about this endlessly and posture and get spins \nout of the White House and spins out of Congress. \n\n[[Page S13]]\n This can go on and on and on and on, or we can simply say, ``Look, \nthere is a basic principle involved here. We all know it requires major \npolicy changes, or we will just simply be back here 2 years from now \narguing the same thing.''\n  We all know, as the Senator from New Hampshire said, unless we \naddress the three basic programs of Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare \nreform and change policies that drive that spending and decouple the \nentitlement from the automatic spending train, we will not have \nachieved success in balancing the budget. I think everybody understands \nand knows that. Yet, we are now addressing that or focusing on that \nquestion.\n  I do not know what the solution is, Mr. President. Maybe it is to \nrequire that the President of the United States, the leader of the \nSenate, and the Speaker of the House be sent to Dayton, locked up at \nWright Patterson Air Force Base--as were the Bosnian factions, leaders \nof the Bosnian warring factions; they have been at war with each other \nfor 600 years, and being locked up at Dayton produced a result most \nthought would not happen--perhaps locking up the three leaders of our \nGovernment in Dayton, cutting off and saying, ``No Larry King, you \ncannot read any newspapers, you cannot take any polls, you cannot watch \nthe television, you cannot go to Hilton Head to play golf, and you \ncannot go to New Hampshire and campaign until you do what is right for \nAmerica,'' maybe that is the solution. I do not know.\n  Doing what is right for America is what ought to be driving us in \nthis debate. I think we all know what is right for this economy and \nwhat is right for the President and what is right for the future. I \nthink we all know or we should know that unless we address these \nfundamental changes in the way in which this Government spends money \nand we put some restraint and control on that, we will not succeed and \nwe will be back here arguing the same thing.\n  I regret the Federal workers are out of work. There are a lot of \npeople out of work. AT just announced they are going to lay off \n40,000 people, so it is not just the Federal workers. In defense of the \nHouse Republicans, they are using the only leverage they have against \nthe President. It has not worked very well because the President's spin \nhas captured the headlines and their spin--the Republican House has not \ncaptured headlines with that.\n  I have probably gone over my time. I appreciate the patience of the \nChair and my colleagues. I will have more to say about this later, but \nI do think we ought to focus on the basic issues and I do think, \ndespite what the polls say and despite what the phone calls say, we \nought to do what we believe is right for America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/03/senate-section/article/S9-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13-S14]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        THE IRRESPONSIBLE COURSE OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today we are in the 19th day of the \nlongest Government shutdown in the Nation's history. Let me begin, as \nothers have here today, by commending the majority leader for his \naction yesterday in bringing to a vote, here in the Senate, a \ncontinuing resolution to restore funding for the ongoing operation of \nthe Government. I frankly regret that it took us 18 days to have that \ncontinuing resolution brought to the Senate floor. But, regardless, I \nwas very pleased to see that action by the majority leader yesterday. I \nalso commend all Senators for agreeing to the passage of the continuing \nresolution. I think we all know that under Senate rules, any Senator \ncould have objected and could have kept that measure from passing in \nyesterday's session. It says something about the merits of this issue, \nthis issue of the Government shutdown, that every single Senator agreed \nto allow that bill to pass.\n\n  Today, the House of Representatives will have to decide whether it, \ntoo, will pass the continuing resolution that we passed yesterday in \nthe Senate, whether it will pass that resolution so it can be signed by \nthe President and so that funding can be restored to the Government or, \nin the alternative, whether the House of Representatives will continue \nin what I believe is the irresponsible course that it has pursued, now, \nfor several weeks.\n  Since this second shutdown of the Government began, I have spoken \nthree times on the Senate floor. Each time I have denounced the refusal \nof the Congress to fund the Government as irresponsible. I have \ndenounced it as being an abuse of power by the Congress and an \nabrogation of responsibility by the majority here in Congress. I \nbelieve very strongly that the Founding Fathers who wrote the \nConstitution expected more responsible conduct by the later generations \nwho would serve in this Congress. I believe very strongly that the \nAmerican people deserve more responsible conduct by their elected \nofficials.\n  But I will not repeat today all the arguments that I made in the \nprevious days. Instead, what I want to say today is that today, each \nMember of the House of Representatives should be given the opportunity \nto vote on whether or not to restore funding for the normal operation \nof Government. Let the people's elected Representatives vote on whether \nthey believe that Government should be shut down or we should restore \nthat funding.\n  I saw the Speaker of the House made a statement yesterday that he did \nnot know whether the votes were there, in the House, and he doubted \nthat the votes were there in the House to pass the continuing \nresolution that we passed here in the Senate. It is very simple to \ndetermine that. Just put the question to a vote. Let each Member come \non the floor of the House and cast his or her vote and answer to his or \nher constituents for that vote.\n  The people's elected Representatives need to decide whether the \nCongress should continue to withhold funds needed to process student \nloans for this next semester of school. They need to decide whether it \nis proper for Congress to keep the campgrounds and monuments and \nvisitors centers closed in our national forests and our national parks. \nThey need to decide whether they want to continue withholding funds \nthat are needed to process the 23,000 passport applications that are \nreceived each day by the State Department, that were received \nyesterday, that will be received again today. And they need to vote on \nwhether the Congress wants to withhold one-half of the pay of three-\nquarters of a million Federal workers or, in fact, withhold the pay of \nthat entire group, entirely, for the month of January--which I \nunderstand will be the case unless some continuing resolution is \npassed.\n\n  People deserve to know how their elected Representatives stand on \nthese issues. I know the response that some Republican House Members \nwill give. They will refuse to vote for funding the Government and \nexplain their position by invoking their earnest desire to get to a \nbalanced budget. So let me respond to that just very briefly.\n  First of all, the issue of whether Congress shares with the President \nthe obligation of maintaining the functioning of Government is a \nseparate question from whether we ought to commit ourselves to reach a \nbalanced budget at some future date. I believe strongly that the \nCongress does share that obligation to maintain a functioning \nGovernment and it is not an obligation that can be ducked by Members of \nCongress by simply changing the subject.\n  A second point is the obvious one that we are not going to bring the \nbudget into balance this year. Nobody has stated that we could bring \nthe budget into balance this year. The Speaker of the House has not \nclaimed that, Senator Dole does not claim that, President Clinton has \nnot claimed that. If everything works perfectly, the best that we could \nhope for is that if the Government takes certain steps during the next \n7 years, and if the economy acts in certain ways during the next 7 \nyears, that that combined result will get us to a balanced budget in \nthe year 2002. So, those Congressmen and Senators, previously Senators, \nwho insist on keeping the Government shut until the Government gets to \na balanced budget will have a long time to wait.\n  Congress meets every year. We pass new budget bills every year. We \npass new appropriations bills every year. None of what we do around \nhere is chiseled in granite. All of it is subject to change during this \nnext 7 years. So we need to get on with our business. And part of our \nbusiness and part of our responsibility is to restore funding for the \nnormal functioning of Government. \n\n[[Page S14]]\n\n  Finally, we have a shared commitment between the Congress and the \nPresident to reach a balanced budget. What we also need, and need very \nurgently in my opinion, is a shared commitment, including the \ncommitment of House Republicans, to maintain a functioning Government. \nThis Senate has acted responsibly in passing a continuing resolution to \nonce again fund the Government as we did last evening. Today the House \nRepublicans have the opportunity to act responsibly as well. I \nsincerely hope that they will seize that opportunity.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I, like many of my colleagues, have \nreturned to Washington this week, hopeful that the Congress and the \nPresident can come to an agreement on the differences they hold over \nthe budget issues that the American public are now so aware of, as a \nresult of the continuing shutdown of Government or a portion of our \nGovernment. I stood on this floor just before Christmas and asked the \nPresident to give the American people a present, a Christmas present, a \nbalanced budget that would look toward the future, that would assure \nthe economic viability and vitality of this country well into the next \ngeneration. And that it was at Christmastime that we should start.\n  That did not happen. In fact, the President did just the opposite. He \nvetoed appropriations bills that were sent to him. At least as a result \nof the veto of one appropriation bill, the Interior appropriation bill, \nhe furloughed, by that action, a good number of workers in my State, \nFederal employees in the Forest Service and the BLM, who are now \nextremely frustrated and calling my office and saying why can we not \nwork? Why can we not be paid? Why can we not continue to do what we do \nfor our country?\n  Let me say to those workers that I am sorry they are not, today, at \nwork. Not just them, but all Federal workers in my State. The President \ndid not veto the Interior appropriations bill because of the dollars \nand cents of it. He vetoed it because of his belief in a policy or an \nattitude that is in disagreement with the majority of the U.S. Congress \non how many trees ought to be cut in a forest in Alaska, or how certain \nlands ought to be mined.\n  So, I am sorry, to those employees in my State, because the Congress \ndid its work and it responded to them, and to the Government, by \nsending the appropriate appropriations bill, only to be vetoed by the \nPresident.\n  So to those workers, let me tell you. You are today being held \nhostage by a President who refused to sign appropriations bills that \nhad been sent to him. That is all I want to say on that issue. And I \nsay that because I believe the Federal workers who are furloughed ought \nto be paid. They are furloughed through no fault of their own. And this \nCongress and this President ought to come to an agreement to resolve \nthat issue. And I hope that is accomplished before the week is out.\n  Yesterday, the Senate spoke in an effort to try to bring Federal \nemployees back onto their jobs. And that did not work for the House is \nstill considering its options as appropriately it should.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope you recognize the importance of the work \nthat we are trying to accomplish here. And I hope that we would not \ncontinually look at just tomorrow because, while I am not happy that \nour Government is shut down, I am not worried about tomorrow and \ntomorrow's unemployed Federal workers. But I am worried about the \nfuture and a balanced budget; and, that we will have a strong, stable \nGovernment as a result of a strong, stable U.S. economy that is able to \nappropriately fund the needed services of Government and assure the \nlong-term stability of the work force and the responsibilities and the \ngoals of a Government. That is the way it ought to be. That is what \nthis Congress has attempted to look at and make changes in over the \ncourse of the last 12 months.\n  It is my disappointment that the White House never sent a balanced \nbudget to Capitol Hill, and it never once said, except in the last few \nweeks, that it would come to the table in an effort to resolve the \nbudget crisis that we are now engaged in.\n  Several weeks ago the President did, while signing a continuing \nresolution, commit himself for the first time to work toward a balanced \nbudget; to try to match up the rhetoric of his last campaign with the \nactions of his administration. Yet, the American people have watched. \nAnd we have worked day after day through Christmas and now into the new \nyear at the White House and here on Capitol Hill to try to resolve the \ndifferences just to honor the commitment that we made to the American \npeople and to try to cause this President to honor his.\n  I know there are fundamental differences. There are differences that \nare very difficult to resolve because there are some in this Congress, \nand certainly many in the administration, who do not believe in a \nbalanced budget but who have profited politically over the years by the \nlongevity of their service by assuring the perpetuation of the welfare \nstate mentality; that you could just give and give and borrow and \nborrow and buy your way back year after year and continue to serve and \nto say all is well with the American citizen, the American Government, \nand the American economy.\n  While all was well for the short term, what became overpowering to \nthe American people was the growth of a debt that is nearly $5 trillion \nby its total amount and that is costing well over $200 billion a year \njust to finance.\n  Finally, the American people spoke very clearly in the last general \nelection across this country when it said the future of our country is \nevery bit as important as the current well-being of our Government and \nthe well-being of our citizens.\n  So I am here to work to resolve the issue. I say to the Federal \nworkers in my State and across the Nation that while I wish you were \nnot furloughed, and while I support you being paid when you return to \nwork, and when we produce a balanced budget the future of our country \nis so very much more important than the short-term difficulty that I am \nsad you are experiencing but that, in fact, you are experiencing \nbecause the policies that will cause this Congress and our Government \nto operate in a near balanced budget year in and year out to stop \nbuilding mounting debt is what is fundamentally important for the new \nyear.\n\n  So while the President was unwilling to give the American people a \nChristmas gift, let me ask you, Mr. President, to make a New Year's \nresolution along with all of the Congress to by this weekend come to \nterms with the differences that we have between us to resolve a \nbalanced budget in 7 years using the Congressional Budget Office \nnumbers that we can all agree on, that makes sense to the American \npeople, and that for the new year sets a resolution that says for the \nfuture, for America's future, for our young people's future, we will \nbuild a strong and stable economy in a Government whose policies are \nbased on serving the truly needy but also recognize that the free \nmarket system unfettered by an ever-growing Federal Government is the \none that serves the American people best.\n  Mr. President, make that New Year's resolution with us today. Resolve \nthe issue before the week is out so that employees can go back to work \nwho are responsible and dedicated and furloughed through no fault of \ntheir own. And they can be compensated, and the American people can see \nthat politics in Washington is not politics or business as usual but \nthat we have heard them well, we have heard them loudly, and we have \nheard them clearly. And we responded by producing a balanced budget \nthat charts for future generations a responsible Government, and a \nstrong and growing U.S. economy.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/03/senate-section/article/S14-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14-S18]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, we have witnessed over the last few \nweeks an unprecedented effort to use a coercive tactic in order to \nachieve a particular substantive result--in my judgment, a totally \nirresponsible and outrageous tactic; and, this is, to hold Government \nhostage by closing it down and, therefore, not only depriving the \nFederal workers of the opportunity to \n\n[[Page S15]]\nrender service but depriving the American people of the service which \nthey render. And I am going to develop here in a moment the impact this \nis having in the private sector.\n  There is a tendency to think primarily about the Federal workers who \ncannot come to work and cannot get paid. And that is true, and that is \ncreating a tremendous hardship and tremendous crisis in many, many \nfamilies all across the country. But a similar crisis is being created \nin the private sector which interrelates with the Government in terms \nof its economic activity.\n  The Government ought to be allowed to go about its normal activities \nwhile this struggle and debate over a 7-year budget plan takes place. \nThere are very important fundamental differences over that budget plan. \nVery deep cuts in Medicare are proposed by some. There is strong \nresistance to that. At the same time, those who want the deep cuts in \nMedicare want to give large tax breaks. A lot of people do not see the \nsense in giving large tax breaks primarily at the upper end of the \nincome scale at the same time that you are going to be imposing cuts in \nmedical services on people with very modest means.\n  In all of this there is an effort in effect to create chaos, to hold \nthe Government hostage as a bargaining tactic; a coercive bargaining \ntactic.\n  The majority leader yesterday here in the Senate, Senator Dole, when \nwe passed the clean continuing resolution which would allow the \nGovernment to resume its normal activities for a temporary period of \ntime--workers would be back at work, they could do their job, people \ncould get services, workers would be paid--said, and I quote him: \n``People have been gone from their jobs long enough. Enough is \nenough.''\n  Today, the Washington Post in an editorial said, ``They ought to \nreopen the closed agencies while they talk, since in fact they do \nfinally seem to be talking. It's a nasty game, the shutdown, and it's \ngone on long enough.''\n  At the outset of that editorial the Washington Post said, and I quote \nthem:\n\n       Hostage-taking is an ugly business. It doesn't matter what \n     the cause. Innocent people are seized and used as pawns; they \n     become political trading stamps whose welfare is exchanged \n     for things the hostage-taker could not win by normal means. \n     That, even more than the mindlessness, the waste (in the \n     supposed cause of economy in government), the inconvenience \n     and the instances of outright harm to unpaid workers and \n     unserved citizens alike, is what is finally wrong with the \n     current government shutdown.\n\n  The basic issue raised is to what lengths will people go to try to \nget their way?\n  It is the hallmark of a democracy that you have to accommodate \nconflicting viewpoints. Democracy does not guarantee you that your way \nis necessarily going to prevail. It gives you an opportunity to try to \npersuade others.\n  We have a constitutional system of separation of powers and checks \nand balances, and it requires restraint and good judgment on the part \nof decision-makers not to sacrifice the means in order to gain their \nparticular end.\n  Now, we have a classic case of sacrificing the means, the proper \nworkings of democracy, in order to gain a particular substantive \nresult. It has never happened before. Never before has the closure of \nthe Government been used as a coercive tactic over substantive issues \nabout which there are very sharp differences. But it is happening in \nthis instance, and it is wreaking havoc.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this editorial from the Washington Post \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Jan. 3, 1996]\n\n                      The Government as Stage Prop\n\n       Hostage-taking is an ugly business. it doesn't matter what \n     the cause. Innocent people are seized and used as pawns; they \n     become political trading stamps whose welfare is exchanged \n     for things the hostage-taker could not win by normal means. \n     That, even more than the mindlessness, the waste (in the \n     supposed cause of economy in government), the inconvenience \n     and the instances of outright harm to unpaid workers and \n     unserved citizens alike, is what is finally wrong with the \n     current government shutdown.\n       Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole was trying again last night \n     to find the formula to reopen temporarily. Good for him; it's \n     the right position; and he takes it at a certain cost. \n     Speaker Newt Gingrich said it would be ``very hard'' to find \n     the necessary votes in the House without a budget agreement. \n     Does he really lack the power to produce such a limited \n     result? Sen. Phil Gramm, meanwhile, one of Sen. Dole's rivals \n     for the Republican presidential nomination, spoke for the \n     vaudeville wing of the party. He is one of those who, over \n     the years, have found it convenient to make almost a cartoon \n     of the federal government.\n       It's a straw-man style of politics. First you portray the \n     awful thing, then you run against it, and no matter if the \n     portrayal bears scant relation to the reality. ``I do think \n     we've discovered one thing,'' he said on television Sunday, \n     ``and that is, Have you missed the government? I mean, \n     doesn't it strike you funny that 280,000 government employees \n     are furloughed, large segments of the government are shut \n     down? I think this proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that we \n     need to go back and eliminate 150,000 to 200,000 bureaucratic \n     positions.'' Mr. Gramm and others thus use the government as \n     a stage prop. Rather than make the decisions they ought to be \n     making--ought in fact to have made weeks ago--both parties \n     are using it, or the lack of it, to score political points \n     and gain leverage in the underlying budget talks, even as \n     they also scramble to avoid the blame for the spectacle they \n     have jointly achieved. We have a suggestion for them. They \n     ought to reopen the closed agencies while they talk, since in \n     fact they do finally seem to be talking. It's a nasty game, \n     the shutdown, and it's gone on long enough.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. I also ask unanimous consent that at the end of my \nremarks three articles from the Post about the impact of this shutdown \nalso be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, one article talking about the impact \nacross the Nation of the partial Government shutdown. Let me quote from \nit:\n\n       Kansas stopped paying unemployment benefits yesterday, the \n     first time a State has turned away claims in the federal \n     program's 60-year history.\n       The Environmental Protection Agency sent home 2,400 of its \n     ``Superfund'' workers and stopped toxic waste cleanup work at \n     609 sites across the Nation throwing hundreds of contract \n     employees out of work . . .\n       With the holiday season over, the impact of the partial \n     Government shutdown came into sharper focus as private sector \n     companies and State agencies struggled with the ripple \n     effects from Washington . . .\n       ``We've never been through anything like this before,'' \n     said Ronald Frank, Executive Vice President of Ecology and \n     Environment, a Superfund contractor based near Buffalo that \n     will furlough ``a couple hundred'' workers today. ``I don't \n     think this is the way the system ought to work.''\n\n  He is absolutely right, it is not the way the system ought to work.\n  Another private sector operator, ``Michael Tilchin, Director of \nSuperfund programs at CH2M Hill Ltd, said `hundreds of employees' would \nbe furloughed.''\n\n       His company is helping clean up an old manufacturing plant \n     in Hellertown, PA, where hazardous wastes have contaminated \n     the groundwater.\n       The job is 95 percent complete and may have an ``unintended \n     consequence,'' Tilchin said. ``In the event the shutdown \n     persists, the costs of shutting it down and restarting it may \n     be larger than the cost of completing the work.''\n\n  And another private sector businessman said: ``If they had their own \nbusiness, would they run that business this way?'' he asked, referring \nto Congress. For the Government to have no plan to ensure that its \nprograms will continue operating, he said, ``seems kind of \nridiculous.''\n  It is ridiculous, and it is stupid and it is irrational, and it lacks \nany common sense. It just shows the limits to which some are prepared \nto go in terms of using coercive tactics in order to gain their way on \nanother issue. That is what is at work here.\n  Are you entitled to use any and all tactics, no matter how \ndisruptive, no matter how much chaos they create, no matter how much \ninjury they do, no matter how much harm they inflict on people in order \nto gain your way?\n  That is not my understanding of how democracy works, and that is not \nmy understanding of how our constitutional system is supposed to work. \nEvery time there is a sharp disagreement, is the Government to be taken \nhostage as a coercive tactic? In fact, we have a national policy of not \nnegotiating with hostage-takers. That is the position the United States \ntakes when it is confronted with this situation in the international \narena.\n\n  The ripple effect that is being felt throughout the economy is \nextraordinary. ``Hundreds of companies whose \n\n[[Page S16]]\nFederal contracts were frozen when the furlough began * * * have either \nsent employees home or may have to do so soon.''\n  These are not Federal employees. These are private sector employees. \nThe Federal employees, many of them, are coming into work, over \n500,000, and not being paid. And I ask people to stop and think: How \nlong could they go without a paycheck?\n  Now, there is apparently a certain insensitivity in the Congress to \nthat, but it may just reflect the fact that many Members of the \nCongress have significant economic means and the loss of a paycheck \nwould not impact upon them the way it does on ordinary citizens who \ncannot go without a paycheck. They have mortgage payments to make; they \nhave car payments to make; they have school payments to make.\n  Beyond the Federal employees are all of the private sector employees \nwho are being impacted very sharply, and those employees, unlike \nfurloughed Federal workers who expect to be reimbursed eventually for \ntime off the job, most employees of Federal contractors and vendors \nwill not be paid retroactively.\n  Mr. President, the impact of this is reaching not only locally and \nnationally, it is also reaching internationally. Visa applications by \nforeigners to come to this country have come to a complete halt. There \nare 20,000 to 30,000 applications made a day. Many of these people want \nto come for business purposes, for tourism, which is, of course, \nimportant to the functioning of our economy. We have just cut that off. \nThese visas are backed up. Americans are backed up now waiting for \npassports. In many instances, people have forfeited payments for travel \narrangements.\n  With the action taken by the Senate yesterday we have the opportunity \nto correct this situation. There is a clean resolution that has gone to \nthe House. I very much hope the House will pass it; that this exercise \nin hostage-taking will come to a halt and the talks on the overall 7-\nyear plan can continue with their sharp differences, but this \nirresponsible tactic, this impermissible tactic of coercion by closing \nthe Government down ought to come to a halt.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Jan. 3, 1996]\n\n                  Inconvenience Edges Toward Emergency\n\n                         (By Thomas W. Lippman)\n\n       In Vietnam, the government has threatened to cut off \n     electricity to the U.S. Embassy because the $1,600 bill \n     hasn't been paid.\n       In Russia, U.S. diplomats took out an interest-free loan \n     from the Moscow embassy's community association to cover the \n     payroll for Russian employees.\n       In Cuba, the trucker who hauls drinking water to the U.S. \n     interests section has refused to make any more deliveries \n     until paid.\n       Between 20,000 and 30,000 applications by foreigners for \n     visas to come to this country are going unprocessed each day, \n     creating a huge backlog of paperwork and infuriating \n     prospective visitors. And in this country, more than 200,000 \n     Americans are waiting for passports that cannot be issued.\n       Such is life in the State Department in the third week of a \n     partial government shutdown that has cut off the department's \n     money and blocked almost all nonemergency spending. Senior \n     officials yesterday described a mounting sense of crisis as \n     undone paperwork piles up, the backlog of unprocessed visa \n     and passport applications grows, travel plans are canceled \n     and embassy officials scramble for funds to pay restive local \n     employees.\n       ``We just don't have any cash,'' said Richard M. Moose, \n     undersecretary of state for management. As long as suppliers \n     and contractors are willing to extend credit for the few \n     expenditures authorized, the State Department can get by, \n     Moose said. But in the many parts of the world where the \n     department has to lay out cash as services are provided--\n     including several countries where security companies demand \n     payment up front to provide guards--the current mass \n     inconvenience is about to become an emergency, Moose and \n     other officials said.\n       People around the world may find it hard to believe that \n     the United States could be reduced to the level of ``banana \n     republic,'' Moose said, but ``my threshold of believing what \n     can't happen is getting lower all the time.''\n       State is one of nine Cabinet departments and assorted \n     independent agencies whose fiscal 1996 appropriations bills \n     have not been signed into law by President Clinton and thus \n     are mostly shut down because of the budget impasse between \n     Clinton and the Republican-controlled Congress. State, more \n     than any other agency, has spread the impact of the shutdown \n     around the world.\n       Among those who have felt it are students who planned to \n     start classes this month in foreign universities, vacationers \n     who had firm travel plans and nonrefundable tickets, and \n     people with job offers from employers overseas.\n       ``We had an 84-year-old woman who wanted a passport to go \n     to Rome because her bishop was being elevated to cardinal'' \n     in the Roman Catholic church, a State Department consular \n     official said. ``We had to say no because it wasn't an \n     emergency.''\n       In many foreign countries, according to Moose and other \n     officials, local laws do not permit the furloughing of local \n     employees. As a result, ``we have to let them come to work, \n     but we can't pay them.'' Worse than that, other officials \n     said, is the fact that visa applicants can see all these \n     furlough-proof local employees at their desks, but are unable \n     to obtain any service because the workers are not permitted \n     to do anything.\n       ``All this is unprecedented. We hope for a solution soon. \n     Otherwise things will just get worse and worse,'' said Pamela \n     Harriman, U.S. ambassador to France.\n       State Department and Office of Management and Budget \n     officials said the cutoff of visas and passports has cut into \n     airline revenue at a peak travel season because tens of \n     thousands or even hundreds of thousands of prospective \n     travelers had to stay home. Airline industry spokesmen, \n     however, said they have so far noticed little impact.\n       Some of the impact of the shutdown is more embarrassing \n     than substantive. Harriman and all other ambassadors, for \n     example, have been told they cannot spend money on what is \n     known as ``representation,'' which mostly means \n     entertainment. No luncheons for visiting business executives, \n     no cocktail parties for important locals, no travel to \n     ribbon-cutting and statue dedications.\n       The shutdown also is undermining morale in the ranks as \n     leaves and long-planned transfers are canceled and work that \n     is being done goes unrewarded, senior officials said.\n       In Colombia, for example, U.S. consular officials who \n     worked all last week to help families of the victims of an \n     American Airlines crash were treated as ``volunteers'' \n     because there is no money to pay them.\n       In Washington, newly appointed foreign service officers are \n     planning to meet tonight to commiserate over cancellation of \n     their first deployments.\n       And morale among State Department and U.S. Information \n     Agency employees at overseas posts is likely to fall further \n     on the next scheduled payday, officials said, because their \n     colleagues from funded agencies, such as Defense and \n     Agriculture, get full paychecks but they do not.\n       Those concerns, however, pale before impending crises in \n     security and communications, officials said.\n       ``I don't think the system can tolerate this for many more \n     days,'' said OMB Deputy Director John Koskinen, noting that \n     local personnel in many foreign countries ``live paycheck to \n     paycheck. That raises a serious problem for us because a \n     number of those people provide security.''\n       ``The places that really worry us are the ones where the \n     FSNs [foreign service nationals, or local employees] are at \n     the lower end of the pay scale anyway,'' Moose said, citing \n     Cairo, New Delhi and Moscow as examples. He said in many \n     embassies funds used for recreation or commissaries are being \n     tapped to cover the payroll shortfall.\n       In embassies that have U.S. Marine guards, Moose said, the \n     State Department is responsible for paying for the Marines' \n     food but no longer has the funds to do so. ``Maybe we can get \n     the Corps to carry us on the cuff. It doesn't do a lot for \n     our image,'' he said.\n       As if to underline his point about image, the U.S. Embassy \n     in Mexico City, where the shutdown has been front-page news, \n     sought to allay fears about the solvency of the government in \n     Washington.\n       ``The embassy wishes to make it clear that this situation \n     arises from the constitutional definitions of how the United \n     States budget is passed into law and does not represent any \n     fundamental inability of the United States of America to pay \n     its bills,'' the statement said.\n       On Saturday, Moose said, the State Department will run out \n     of money to pay the contractors who run its worldwide \n     communications network. Diplomatic cables, e-mail and secure \n     telephones--the lifeblood of diplomatic communication--could \n     be truncated or cut off, he said.\n       The restriction on all but emergency travel will not block \n     Secretary of State Warren Christopher and a sizable entourage \n     from flying this weekend to Paris and the Middle East, \n     officials said. One reason is that Christopher travels on an \n     Air Force plane, and the State Department's credit is good \n     with the Air Force.\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Jan. 3. 1996]\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                 Ripple Effect Could Leave Area Reeling\n\n                            (By Peter Behr)\n\n       On a normal day, Duke Chung's Manhattan Bagel shop would \n     serve more than 1,500 bagels to employees of the National \n     Science Foundation and nearby contractors in Ballston. Now he \n     feels like the hole, not the dough.\n       ``Today, it was a little over 200,'' said Chung; who \n     operates the bagel franchise on NSF's ground floor. The \n     building, usually filled with 1,400 workers is closed except \n     for several dozen supervisors, security and custodial \n     workers, he said. ``I used to have 13 employees. Now I have \n     about three. Merry Christmas.''\n       As the partial federal shutdown enters its third week, the \n     economic damage has begun to spread into many corners of the \n     Washington area, from people who run government \n\n[[Page S17]]\n     computers to those who supply its desks and bake its morning bagels.\n       Hundreds of local companies whose federal contracts were \n     frozen when the furlough began Dec. 16 have either sent \n     employee home or may have to do so soon, officials said.\n       ``In the local area there have to be thousand of \n     [contractor] employees who aren't working. It's of that \n     order,'' said Edward H. Bersoff, chairman of BTG Inc., a \n     Vienna information technology company. Bersoff also chairs \n     the Fairfax County Chamber of Commerce.\n       If it continues, the shutdown could soon threaten the \n     entire region's economy, first through the direct impact of \n     federal furloughs and private-sector layoffs and then through \n     the secondary, ripple effects from loss of local wages, \n     economists said. The shutdown may ``feed on itself,'' said \n     Russel C. Deemer, regional economist with Crestar Bank in \n     Richmond.\n       Unlike furloughed federal workers, who expect to be \n     reimbursed eventually for time off the job, most employees of \n     federal contractors and vendors will not be paid \n     retroactively.\n       Companies that avoided layoffs by requiring employees to \n     use vacation and comp days over the period from Christmas to \n     New Year's Day are running out of time, said Olga Grkavac, \n     vice president of the International Technology Association of \n     America in Arlington, which represents about 150 area \n     technology companies.\n       ``Unless something is resolved quickly, we'll see more \n     layoffs,'' she said.\n       There are no estimates of how many contractors' employees \n     have been sent home-federal departments and agencies whose \n     budgets have not yet been approved provided about one-fourth \n     of the nearly $18 billion in contracts that went to area \n     firms in 1994.\n       But ``we are starting to see some pretty significant \n     impacts,'' said John F. Dealy, a Washington attorney and \n     business consultant who advises technology companies. The \n     contractors ``aren't able to continue working on projects so \n     they have to lay people off. That's accelerating.''\n       BTG's Bersoff said he knows of companies that are preparing \n     to cut off or curtail medical coverage for laid-off workers. \n     ``There are second- and third-tier effects of all kinds,'' he \n     said.\n       The blow already has fallen on hundreds of merchants and \n     suppliers who depend on federal workers and contractors for \n     their business.\n       Mark Herman, who manages the Au Bon Pain restaurant at \n     Union Station, said he has seen a sharp falloff in breakfast \n     and lunch business since the Bureau of Labor Statistics \n     office across the street shut down two weeks ago.\n       Until Dec. 16, Christine Webb, a computer systems developer \n     with a Labor Department contractor, worked at keeping the BLS \n     computers going and bought her lunch at Herman's counter. \n     Now, she's home and preparing to file for unemployment \n     benefits.\n       Soon, some of Herman's employees who have been using up \n     vacation and sick leave will face layoffs too, he said. \n     Moreover, he has no idea how many croissants and sandwich \n     fillings to order for the days ahead. ``It's just totally \n     confusing. It's just nuts.''\n       Others describe a chain reaction of disruption.\n       Richard A. Morsell, president of Office Furniture Concepts/\n     Federal Supply Contracts Group Inc. in Chantilly, ships desks \n     and chairs to federal offices around the nation. In the past \n     week, some of those shipments have gone into limbo because \n     the federal doors are closed. ``This stuff is floating all \n     over the country,'' he said.\n       He said he is out several hundred thousand dollars in \n     shipments on which the government has not made payment and he \n     intends to see that the bills are paid, with interest. But \n     who knows where the invoices are? Somewhere in the mountains \n     of unprocessed paperwork in federal mail rooms, he said. \n     ``I'm going to have to wait a . . . long time while they work \n     through that paperwork and get to us,'' he said.\n       Meantime, his staff has shrunk from 19 to 11 since \n     government purchases began to slow last summer, he said. \n     ``It's utterly stupid.''\n       The long-term consequences of the upheaval may hurt local \n     federal contractors for months to come, according to \n     executives such as J.P. ``Jack'' London, chairman of CACI \n     International Inc., an Arlington-based information technology \n     company.\n       The next batch of contracts his company would compete for \n     may well be delayed by the shutdown. ``It takes people to put \n     those out,'' London said.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Jan. 3, 1996]\n\n                 Jobless Aid, Toxic Waste Cleanup Halt\n\n                  (By Stephen Barr and Frank Swoboda)\n\n       Kansas stopped paying unemployment benefits yesterday, the \n     first time a state has turned away claims in the federal \n     program's 60-year history.\n       The Environmental Protection Agency sent home 2,400 of its \n     ``Superfund'' workers and stopped toxic waste cleanup work at \n     609 sites across the nation, throwing hundreds of contract \n     employees out of work.\n       Eleven companies, including Blue Cross, are using $5 \n     million to $6 million a day of their own money, rather than \n     the government's, to process Medicare claims and pay their \n     employees.\n       With the holiday season over, the impact of the partial \n     government shutdown came into sharper focus as private sector \n     companies and state agencies struggled with the ripple \n     effects from Washington. It also generated more disgust with \n     Washington's ways.\n       ``We've never been through anything like this before,'' \n     said Ronald Frank, executive vice president of Ecology and \n     Environment, a Superfund contractor based near Buffalo that \n     will furlough a ``couple hundred'' workers today. ``I don't \n     think this is the way the system ought to work.''\n       Stephen Crickmore, the president of AdminiStar Federal in \n     Indianapolis, administers Medicare claims for the government. \n     He has been paying 650 employees out of company reserves \n     since the shutdown started on Dec. 16.\n       ``If they had their own business, would they run that \n     business this way?'' he asked, referring to Congress. For the \n     government to have no plan to ensure that its programs will \n     continue operating, he said, ``seems kind of ridiculous.''\n       His company, Crickmore said, is ``looking at how long we're \n     going to continue what we're doing at this point, which is \n     subsidizing the federal government.'' Early next week, he \n     said, the company will have to decide whether to furlough \n     employees.\n       Other companies, however, have started sending workers \n     home. EPA contractors across the country received ``stop \n     work'' orders yesterday, the first wave of several that could \n     jeopardize the jobs of up to 10,000 Superfund workers.\n       In Houston, Peter Arrowsmith, president of NUS, a Superfund \n     contractor, said his company had started laying off employees \n     and would soon have 125 employees, 15 percent of his work \n     force, sent home without pay.\n       Michael Tilchin, director of Superfund programs at CH2M \n     Hill Ltd., said ``hundreds of employees'' would be \n     furloughed. His company is helping clean up an old \n     manufacturing plant in Hellertown, Pa., where hazardous \n     wastes have contaminated the ground water.\n       The job is 95 percent complete and may have an ``unintended \n     consequence,'' Tilchin said. ``In the event the shutdown \n     persists, the costs of shutting it down and restarting it may \n     be larger than the cost of completing the work,'' he said.\n       Like the other EPA contractors, Frank said his New York-\n     based company would furlough ``a couple hundred'' workers \n     today unless the White House and Congress agreed to end the \n     shutdown.\n       Administration officials, such as Labor Secretary Robert B. \n     Reich and Health and Human Services Secretary Donna E. \n     Shalala, have said repeatedly that the shutdown would disrupt \n     services to a wide range of Americans, not just federal \n     employees. But Republicans, such as Sen. Phil Gramm (Tex.), \n     have argued that, if anything, the shutdown would show what \n     little role the government plays in the lives of ordinary \n     citizens. Republicans point out that the agencies now closed \n     kept about 480,000 employees on the job to provide services \n     while sending a smaller number--280,000--home.\n       Yesterday, Reich pointed to the closure of the Kansas \n     unemployment offices as an example of the shutdown's fallout, \n     saying, ``The people who have lost their jobs in Kansas this \n     week are simply out of luck.''\n       The Labor Department estimated there are between 1,900 and \n     2,600 new claims for unemployment benefits in Kansas each \n     week. Wayne Franklin, state secretary of human resources in \n     Topeka, said the state did not have the $60,000 a day to keep \n     the unemployment benefits offices open.\n       Kansas has plenty of money in the unemployment insurance \n     trust fund to pay the benefit claims, but it relies on the \n     federal government to pay the cost of administering the \n     program.\n       At least 10 other states and the District of Columbia also \n     have exhausted federal funds to administer their unemployment \n     insurance programs, Reich said. District officials said \n     yesterday that 40,000 furloughed federal employees have filed \n     unemployment claims related to the current shutdown. The \n     city, which usually pays about 35,000 claims a year, could \n     issue its first shutdown checks next week.\n       Reich said officials do not know how long the District \n     offices can stay open. New Mexico, which has a relatively \n     large federal population, also has run out of federal money. \n     ``It is an open question whether they'll be able to continue \n     at all,'' Reich said.\n       Alaska will try to stay open until Saturday, while Alabama \n     is also using state money to finance the unemployment program \n     through Friday.\n       In Little Rock, officials with the Arkansas Rehabilitation \n     Services virtually disbanded their state agency for the \n     disabled because the federal money has stopped coming from \n     Washington.\n       Commissioner Bobby Simpson said he had to furlough 495 of \n     the agency's 603 employees, meaning that 17,000 Arkansas \n     residents with physical and mental disabilities will have no \n     office to turn to for help with job training, special \n     vehicles for commuting to work, and other services. The state \n     rehabilitation office, which has an annual budget of $38 \n     million, receives 76 percent of its funding from the federal \n     government.\n       ``It's ironic because we're in the business of putting \n     people to work, of helping to turn tax users into \n     taxpayers,'' Simpson said. ``We held on as long as we could. \n     . . .''\n       Despite the problems in some states, reports yesterday by \n     Washington Post correspondents showed that other states were \n\n[[Page S18]]\n     coping with the shutdown, keeping their services available even when \n     faced with lapses in federal funding.\n       Michigan, for example, has been using its own revenue to \n     make up for the cutoff of federal funds in crucial programs \n     such as Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) \n     and Medicaid, said John Truscott, a spokesman for Gov. \n     John Engler (R). ``We can't fund them forever, but for the \n     next couple of weeks we're okay,'' Truscott said.\n       Wisconsin is preparing to use more of its own funds for \n     those two major programs this week but is counting on an \n     eventual reimbursement from the federal government, said \n     James R. Klauser, the state's secretary of administration. He \n     said AFDC and Medicaid payments range between $25 million and \n     $40 million a week in Wisconsin. ``We look at it every \n     week,'' he said. ``We're comfortable right now.''\n       California is losing more than $5 million a day in tourism \n     revenue. Officials of Mariposa County, the home of Yosemite \n     National Park, asked Gov. Pete Wilson (R) to declare the \n     county an economic disaster zone, but Wilson turned down the \n     request, saying it exceeded the scope of his authority.\n       The shutdown also cut into the pensions of about 150,000 \n     retired railroad workers. The retirees, most over 70 years of \n     age, receive a portion of their pension from appropriated \n     funds and the rest from a retirement trust fund. They will \n     lose about two-thirds of an average $130 monthly payment that \n     is paid directly from the treasury; the rest of their annuity \n     from the railroad trust fund will not be reduced.\n       Federal agencies, meanwhile, continue to struggle to \n     provide services.\n       Only two of the 15 employees that the Department of Housing \n     and Urban Development has in Flint, Mich., for example, have \n     been allowed to report to work during the shutdown. That has \n     forced the office to delay opening any bids from families or \n     real estate agents for HUD property. Also, none of the \n     roughly 500 families who have home-purchase loans through the \n     field office have been able to get any help, especially those \n     who are drifting further into delinquency.\n       ``The sense of emergency is much higher now than before,'' \n     HUD coordinator Gary LeVine said. ``The three-day shutdown \n     before wasn't so bad. Three weeks is. This is no way to treat \n     the public.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as we embark on this new year, I think it \nmight do us all well if we were to put aside the rhetoric of \nconfrontation and attempt to come together on some principles that so \nmany have articulated for so long but have failed to really enact. I do \nbelieve there might be a handful--and I say a handful--who do not \nbelieve there should be a balanced budget. I have not identified \nanyone. No one has ever told me they are opposed to that, whether they \nbe Democrats or Republicans.\n  Over the 15 years now that I have been here, I have seen us work, \nDemocrats and Republicans, to attempt to achieve that. I have seen us \npass Gramm-Rudman in an attempt to bring about a balanced budget.\n  On the campaign trail, it is great fodder to say I am for a balanced \nbudget, I want that, and yet when it comes to doing the business of the \npeople, we have failed to do that. We have failed to achieve it. And \nthe reason is because it is not easy. It is difficult. The reason is \nthat because the same people, our constituents, who, on the one hand, \nsay and demand we do the business of the people, as we should, in a \nresponsible manner, that we cut out the wasteful programs, that we \nreform systems such as the welfare system that certainly needs an \noverhaul and should be reformed and turned into a workfare system, when \nit really comes down to implementing what is necessary to achieve a \nbalanced budget, the same people in many cases are the first to come to \nus and to beseech us to cut spending, but, by the way, there is a good \nprogram and it is in education or it is in the arts or it is as it \nrelates to transportation or drug treatment, all of these good programs \nthat are for seniors and do not cut that program.\n\n  Everybody has a favorite program. That is without even touching the \narea of entitlements that people are afraid to even speak to. The fact \nof the matter is that if you were to reduce or eliminate the spending \nin all of the discretionary programs, eliminate any of the moneys that \nwe spend on education, any of the money that we spend on the military, \non defense, and all of the money that we might spend in housing and \nurban development, in mass transit, eliminate it all, that unless we \nbegin to curtail the growth in the entitlement programs, begin to \nreduce that growth in Medicare, in Medicaid, why, then, it makes no \nsense, we will continue to operate with huge deficits.\n  That means we are mortgaging the future of our children and their \nchildren and future generations. I suggest that that is not \nresponsible. That is an easy way out. That is what has been taking \nplace for far too long.\n  So as we embark upon this new year, I hope that maybe we will stop \nbeing accusatory, one side blaming the other--all of us know that this \nis not going to be easy--but attempt to come together and to say, how \ncan we moderate the growth in these programs?\n  I have heard friends of mine, Democrats, indeed, at the White House, \nthe President, Mrs. Clinton, have talked about slowing the growth in \nthese programs. How is it now that that rhetoric has turned so harsh? \nHow is it now that those who attempt to implement the same suggestions \nthat were put forth by the White House in good faith are now accused of \nattempting to savage senior citizens?\n  That is inaccurate. It is not fair. Rather than one side or the other \nbeing accusatory, why do we not attempt to build on those things that \nwe agree on? If we agree there is a need to balance the budget, if we \nagree and we have spoken to doing it within a prescribed period of \ntime, if we have agreed that we would use realistic numbers and not pie \nin the sky, why do we not begin to do this?\n  It would seem to me that the people of the United States have every \nright to be angered at both the administration and the Congress for not \nresolving these differences in an appropriate fashion by working at it \nand not by delaying and not by taking extended vacations and not by PR \nand not by spin doctors, but by coming down honestly to resolve this in \na manner that all of us know can and should be done.\n  So I do not come to the floor for the purposes of blaming one side or \nthe other or pointing a finger toward the administration or saying that \nall that we have put forth in our balanced budget proposals must be and \nshould be adopted. But certainly within the bounds of those that have \nbeen suggested, those suggestions by the administration, and within the \nbounds that have been put forth by the Congress, there is ample \nopportunity, there has been and there is now, that if we exert \nourselves and exhort ourselves not to try to be one up on the other \nside, one up so we can aggrandize it and claim credit, then why do we \nnot take a look at what we owe the people?\n\n  There are suggestions that make sense. It would call for some \ncollective coming together and some courage to be demonstrated on both \nsides. The senior Senator from New York, my colleague, Senator \nMoynihan, has put forth as a suggestion looking at the CPI. The CPI no \nlonger adequately reflects what the true costs are as it relates to \ngoods and products and services and indeed has been estimated as being \noff by as much as one-third--one-third. We say, what is 1 percent? But \n1 percent, if you have a 3-percent increase in the inflation rate, is \none-third.\n  Why not then use legitimate numbers to measure what the cost-of-\nliving increase is, what the cost for the consumer really is? That \nwould take some courage on both parts, on the side of the Republicans \nand the Republican Congress as well as our colleagues on the Democratic \nside, and on the side of the White House. But, my gosh, if it is a \nfact, and if it is true, why do we not come together and say, this is \nthe place to start?\n  We might be able to save $150 billion. Imagine that. Why can we not \nhave the good common sense, again, collectively, Democrats and \nRepublicans, both in the Congress and in the administration, the \nExecutive, to say this is something we can agree on? If we do it \ntogether, that together we can go forward and say this is the right \nthing to do, why then, that is what we should be expected to do.\n  I do not know that it should even take such great courage. But if one \n\n\n[[Page S19]]\nside is afraid the other will then run to the various lobbying groups \nand to the seniors and claim that they are trying to cut back their \nincreased benefits, then let us do it collectively, let us go forward \ncollectively.\n  There is $100 billion-plus that can be saved. Should it be saved? I \nsuggest that we have an obligation to do that and, again, to do it \ntogether. I suggest that we are wrong in postponing the inevitability \nof what will take place, which is mortgaging the future and saddling \nfuture generations with this great burden, which will mean that they \nwill lose the opportunities that we had in terms of home ownership, in \nterms of jobs, in terms of creativity that otherwise is going to be \nstifled in this country.\n\n  It seems to me that there are areas that we can agree upon. You \ncannot continue to double the growth of any program every 7 years. It \nis a simple mathematical proposition that if you increase spending at \nthe rate of 10 percent per annum over 7 years, you come up with the \nfigure of 2. You have doubled whatever that cost is. So in the area of \nMedicare, if you are spending $100 billion now, and you increase \nspending by 10 percent per annum, in 7 years it will be $200 billion.\n  Does that make sense? Of course not. So it would seem to me that \ntogether we should begin to say, how can we moderate the growth in \nvarious programs? Yes, good programs, necessary programs. Where can we \nachieve savings? How can we do that?\n  In the area of taxes and tax relief, does any side really believe one \nside wants to advance the interests of the wealthy over those of \nworking people, over those of people who are struggling to make a \nliving? It might be good rhetoric politically for one side or the other \nto charge that, but how does that advance the business of doing what we \nshould on behalf of the people? We detract, and we detract from \nourselves. We detract from the process. And people then come and say, \n``We need a change. We need to change what is going on. A pox on both \nyour houses.''\n  I hope we would begin to address, where can we give tax relief? And \nwho is entitled to tax relief? Are working-class, middle-class families \nwith children entitled to that relief?\n  Mr. President, I thank you for the opportunity of putting forth just \nsome suggestions in a new year, in the spirit of attempting to come \ntogether and to do the business of the people. I hope we could all \nreach out together, Democrats, Republicans, legislative and executive, \nto do that business.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bond).

The first order of business, as described by my \nfriend, the Senator from Maryland, Senator Sarbanes, is to end this \nshutdown and get people back to work and pay Federal employees for the \nwork they do.\n  Someone yesterday on the floor said, ``Well, my constituents cannot \nunderstand this shutdown of the Federal Government.''\n  There is good reason for that, because it is not an understandable \nkind of thing. It made no sense. It never made any sense for anybody to \nsay to 280,000 Federal workers, ``We prevent you from coming to work, \nbut we're going to pay you for not performing work we won't allow you \nto perform.''\n  What kind of logic is that?\n  And then to say to half a million others, ``We insist you come to \nwork and we won't pay you until we resolve the dispute between the \nWhite House and the Congress on the budget.''\n  What on Earth kind of logic is that? The first order of business is \nto end this shutdown that has never made any sense.\n  The second order of business is to reach an agreement on the budget, \none that, yes, does balance the budget, does it in 7 years and does it \nthe right way with the right priorities.\n  There are other things we need to do this year. There are other \npriorities. At the start of this session a couple of hours ago, I heard \na description of some of the successes of the last session and, indeed, \nthere were some successes in the last session. I might say one of the \ndisappointments of the last session for me and many of us who come from \nfarm country was the inability to have enacted into law a 5-year farm \nprogram. There is great difference in Congress about what kind of a \nfarm plan we ought to have. There were virtually no hearings, there was \nno bipartisan markup, very little bipartisan discussion about a farm \nprogram this past year. One was cobbled together, posthaste, and put in \na reconciliation bill that everyone knew was going to be vetoed.\n  The result is we now cross into the new year with no 5-year farm \nprogram. I think that is unfair to farmers. It is important to tell \nfarmers and their lenders what kind of a farm program we will have this \nyear as they begin planting their crops this spring. My hope is the \nCongress will turn its attention to this, have a fair debate, have some \nhearings about a decent farm program, what works to help family farmers \nin this country. My hope also is while we do that, the Congress will \nextend the current farm program for 1 additional year. It seems to me \nthat will provide some certainty, at least, with what will happen with \nrespect to 1996, and then it seems to me we ought to decide to write in \n1996 a good farm program, one that saves money, yes, but one that saves \nfamily farmers and gives family farmers an understanding that there is \na safety net so they will have a chance to make a living when \ninternational prices go down and stay down.\n  So I hope the Congress will consider extending the current farm \nprogram for 1 year, and I hope the Congress will be serious and the \nCongress will decide quickly to begin hearings and to begin a \nthoughtful discussion about what kind of farm program works for the \nlong-term future of family farmers in this country.\n  I want to mention two additional items. Not very many minutes ago a \nMember of the Senate stood up and said one of the problems we face is \nthe construction of a national missile defense program. He spoke very \npersuasively--not for me but very persuasively for his point of view--\nthat we need a national missile defense program.\n  This is not about partisan politics, it is about fundamental \ndisagreements about how we spend money. Stripped apart, someone who \ncalls for a new national missile defense program is calling for a new \nspending program of $48 billion. Those who say we ought to tighten our \nbelts and cut Federal spending and then stand up and say, ``By the way, \nwe want to start a new star wars\" --and, by the way, it is star wars, \nthere are space-based components included in the program--a multiple-\nsite national missile defense program, are standing up and saying, ``We \nwant to embark on a $48 billion new program to construct star wars.'' I \nam just saying that is out of step with what we ought to be doing.\n  The cold war is largely over. In Russia today, they are destroying \nmissile launchers and destroying warheads as part of the agreements we \nhave on weapons reductions, and then we have people stand up and say, \n``By the way, let's begin a new $48 billion program for star wars, and \nwe insist that you order 20 new B-2 bombers for over $30 billion that \nthe Pentagon says they can't afford, don't need, and don't want.''\n  So I urge us this year to have an aggressive thoughtful debate on \nthose policies as well. If we want to cut spending, and we should, if \nwe want to save money, and we should, if we want to balance the budget, \nand we ought to, we cannot afford, in my judgment, to order star wars \nor B-2 bombers the Pentagon says they do not want and this country does \nnot need.\n  Finally, there is another issue that we have to address in 1996, and \nthat is the issue of jobs. We need to balance the budget because it is \nthe right thing to do and will give us a better economy. I agree with \nthat. But we also ought to care about specific policies in this country \nthat relate to jobs.\n  Yes, an expanded economy produces jobs. So does a decent trade \nsystem. Mr. President, you know something, with all of the angst, with \nall the nail biting and with all the finger tapping on the desks around \nhere, the shrugging about this, that, or the other thing, the \nmerchandise trade deficit in \n\n[[Page S20]]\nthis country will exceed the budget deficit this year, and you do not \nhear a whimper about it on the floor of the Senate.\n  Let me say that again. We will have a larger trade deficit this year \nin this country than we will have a budget deficit.\n  Our trade deficit will be nearly $180 billion. That means jobs have \nleft this country, things are being produced elsewhere. And we have a \nbunch of economists who are measuring economic progress in this country \nby what we consume. Every month they flail around and say, ``Gee, \nAmerica is doing well because we are consuming more.''\n  The genesis of economic health, it seems to me, the seedbed of jobs \nand opportunity in the future is not what we consume, but rather what \nwe produce. Do we have good manufacturing jobs in this country?\n  Among the discussions of trade must be a discussion about NAFTA. I \njust want to show my colleagues a chart. The red, incidentally, is a \ntrade deficit, trade with Mexico. Before NAFTA, before a trade \nagreement, a trade agreement which, incidentally, we never seem to be \nable to win--every time we show up at a negotiating table on trade, we \nseem to lose--we had a trade surplus with Mexico. We reached a trade \nagreement, and what happens? Well, we have a deficit with Mexico. This \nyear, that deficit will be $16 to $18 billion. We will have lost about \n200,000 American jobs to Mexico.\n  Take Mexico and Canada together, because that is what NAFTA really \nis, two countries. Look at the cumulative trade deficit with both \ncountries, which will reach about $40 billion this year. I will during \nthe next 4 or 5 months every month come to the floor to discuss the \ntrade deficit with Japan, over $60 billion and the trade deficit with \nChina, over $30 billion, all of which means fewer jobs and less \neconomic opportunity in this country. It seems to me that we ought to \nturn our attention in 1996 to the question of who are we and what do we \nwant to be in terms of providing opportunity in the private sector in \nthe form of jobs to the American people.\n  Do we decide we want to compete with people who make 12 cents an hour \nand hire 12-year-olds to work 12 hours a day? Not me. That is not fair \ncompetition. Yet, the product of child labor flows into this country \nevery day in increasing quantities. The product of labor that makes a \nquarter an hour making tennis shoes, 30 cents an hour making shirts, 80 \ncents an hour making shoes, flows into this country every single day, \nand it displaces American workers who, if they are able to find another \njob, find a lower-income job. And if they are not able to find another \njob then become unemployed, or those who are despondent, or those who \nsee somehow a stock market that reaches record highs, productivity on \nthe rise, CEO salaries never higher and discover that American workers \nget laid off or that 60 percent of American families--who, during \ndinner at night, discuss their situation --understand that they now \nmake less money than they did 20 years ago when you adjust their income \nfor inflation.\n  Part of the discussion we must have as a country, Republicans and \nDemocrats, conservatives and liberals, CEO's and workers, the private \nsector, Wall Street and Main Street, is what about economic opportunity \nin this country? Will we continue to measure our economic health by \nwhat we consume, or will we decide that our productive sector, our \nmanufacturing base, the seedbed with good jobs, with good incomes make \na difference to this country? Will we decide to do something about \nthat?\n  Will we decide to stop and put an end to the insidious, perverse tax \nprovision that says if you close your U.S. plant and move it overseas, \nwe will give you a tax break? That exists in law. I have had a vote on \nthat in the Senate and lost. It is inconceivable to me that we would \nretain in our Tax Code a provision that says if you will shut your \nAmerican manufacturing plant down, lay off your workers, and move those \njobs to a tax-haven country somewhere else in the world and then \nmanufacture the same product and ship it back in to our country, we \nwill give you a tax break.\n  It is inconceivable that this Congress does not act to say we stand \nfor American producers and American workers. No, we do not build walls \naround our country, but we want our country to compete in an economic \nsystem where competition is fair.\n  I hope in the coming months that this Congress will decide that trade \ndeficits matter; that record trade deficits, the highest in the history \nof the world that this country absorbed in 1995, are intolerable.\n  Trade deficits that are bigger than our budget deficits are \nintolerable. This country needs to do something about it. For those who \nwonder about some of the issues, on NAFTA, which is the one trade \nissue, there was something released yesterday by Public Citizen. It \nsays that NAFTA has broken promises. It is a rather lengthy, footnoted \ndocument. There are many other evidences of the same problem.\n  My interest in 1996 is that all of us, together, decide that budget \ndeficits matter and we are going to balance the budget; trade deficits \nmatter and we are going to address the chronic trade problems; farm \nprograms matter and we are going to construct a farm program that makes \nsense for the family farmers of this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/03/senate-section/article/S19-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S20-S21]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REFLECTION ON THE PAST YEAR\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise to reflect a little bit on the past \nyear but, more importantly, to reflect on it as it pertains to what we \ndo in the coming year. I am sorry this year has ended in the conflict \nover the balanced budget. That has been one of the principal items of \nthis entire year. We have worked on it almost all year. We worked on it \nin terms of a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. It failed \nby one vote. We worked on it then through the appropriations process \ninto a reconciliation balanced budget bill, which changed a great many \nthings. A balanced budget is much more than, of course, simply \narithmetic or numbers. It is a fundamental change in the direction this \nGovernment takes.\n  So I am sorry that we ended up with this conflict, and I am sorry \nthat Federal employees have become sort of trapped in it. I hope that \nthat changes soon. I hope more than anything that we are able to \ncomplete the work that we started on the balanced budget.\n  I have been in this body now just for 1 year, and I came, as I think \nmost of us came, in 1994, with a message from home that the Federal \nGovernment is too big, it costs too much, and the Federal Government is \ngenerally too intrusive in our lives. I believe that, and I think most \npeople believe that.\n  One of the measurements of good government is the responsiveness, I \nthink, to the voters, and to what people at home have suggested. So \nthis year, then, in terms of those kinds of things, it has been a \nlittle frustrating. It has been frustrating in that we have come up to \na balanced budget amendment, which I thought was necessary, but we \ncould not quite get there.\n\n  We have done a great deal on welfare reform. We passed it in this \nbody with a good vote, and now there has been some change in terms of \naccepting that reform. Then there is regulatory reform. Almost \neverybody recognizes that the regulatory system results in \noverregulation and results in regulation that is not efficient, and \nthat the cost benefits often need to be measured there.\n  On the other hand, it has been a very fulfilling year, it seems to \nme. I came to Congress in 1989 when Dick Cheney went over to Defense, \nand I spent 5 years in the House. During that time, it seems to me, \nthere was very little real consideration of change, little discussion \nof fundamental change in the way this Government behaves and operates. \nInstead, we sort of dealt with the policies that had been there for a \nvery long time. There was a good deal--and continues to be--of \nprotection of the Great Society kind of programs, the little tinkering \naround the edges when they came up for renewal. If they did not work \nright, if the results were not what we hoped they would be, whenever \nthere was measurement of results--which, frankly, is not often enough \n--then the chances are that we put more money into the program. We \ncontinued to increase spending over this period of time, and the effort \nwas basically to see how much increase there was going to be. If we did \n\n\n[[Page S21]]\nnot like the product, we would put more money in it. Welfare is one of \nthe best examples. Of course, more people are in poverty now than when \nthe welfare program started over 30 years ago. The program needs to be \nchanged.\n  I understand resistance to change. Change is much more difficult than \nmaintaining the status quo. I think that is part of what is happening \nhere. Some are simply concerned about the uncertainty of change. Nobody \nknows exactly what will happen. Others, of course, have real \nphilosophical differences. There are people in this body and in this \ncountry who believe more Government is better, who believe that the \nanswer to questions that exist with respect to jobs and the economy and \nservices is more Federal Government. I do not happen to share that \nview. Frankly, the majority does not believe that.\n  But this has been, I think, a very encouraging year, a very exciting \nyear, because we have reformed and reframed the debate. Instead of \nextending all the programs and talking about tinkering around the \nedges, we have begun to look at the merits of the programs and ask, \n``Is this a program that needs to be carried out by the Federal \nGovernment, or is it one that could be better carried out by the State \ngovernment? Is it accomplishing the purpose for which it was \nestablished?'' We are beginning to measure some results, which is kind \nof an unusual process in the Federal Government. So we have changed the \nway we look at things. I think that is very helpful.\n\n  The debate now has been about holding down spending, not about how \nmuch you are going to raise it, but whether we can hold down the rate \nof spending some. That is a difficult thing to talk about because what \ndo you hear on the floor and in the media? ``They are going to cut \nMedicare. There will be no more benefits out of Medicare.''\n  We know that is not true. We know that Medicare, under the proposal, \ncontinues to grow at 7.2 percent annually, as opposed to 10 percent, \nand the spending per beneficiary goes from $4,700 to over $7,000. But \nwe hear it is going to be cut, that we are going to ruin it, \nexterminate it, because that is the easier conversation. But we have \ntalked about that and we changed that conversation.\n  Instead of talking about more and more intrusion into State and local \ngovernment, we are talking about block grants, about the 10th \namendment, which says clearly that those things not set forth in the \nConstitution to be done by the Federal Government should be left to the \nStates and the people. It is pretty clear and simple.\n  I happen to come from a small State. Some of our needs are quite \ndifferent than they are in New York. Greybull's welfare problems are \ndifferent than they are in Pittsburgh. We need to be able to manage it. \nInstead of talking about how that should grow on the Federal level, we \nare talking about block grants. We have changed the discussion, and \nthat is healthy.\n  We are talking about balancing the budget. We have not seriously done \nthat for 30 years. Sure, somebody mentions it occasionally. The \nPresident has agreed to it. I will have to admit there have not been \nresults from that yet, but I think that perhaps there will be. To \nbalance the budget in 7 years with CBO numbers is a promise that we \nhave. That is a change.\n  So, Mr. President, we have not accomplished all that we would like, I \nam certain. On the other hand, I have to tell you that I am encouraged \nthat we have changed the direction of this body and I think we have \nchanged the framing of the discussion; the purposes have changed. We \nare going in a different direction. We have not accomplished as much as \nwe would have liked, but we will.\n  In this coming year, it is very important to continue what has begun. \nMr. President, I wish you and my colleagues well as we enter into a new \nyear, representing the people of America. We are, after all, the board \nof directors, the trustees here. We are responsible to respond to our \npeople. We are responsible to respond to what the voters said. We are \nresponsible to make some decisions, by the way, instead of negotiating \nfor 2 months. I am pretty exasperated with that process, as I know \neverybody is.\n  In any event, it is a new year, a good year, and I look forward to \nsome fundamental changes in this country, as I think most people do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/03/senate-section/article/S20-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S21-S22]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TWO SIMPLE STEPS TO BALANCING THE BUDGET IN 7 YEARS\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the shutdown of the U.S. Government is \nbecoming a crisis. A recent article in the New York Times carried this \nheadline: ``Judge Says Budget Impasse Could Shut Nation's Courts.'' The \narticle reported that:\n\n       A senior judge who represents the policymaking board of the \n     Federal judiciary today warned that the budget stalemate \n     might force the nation's courts to shut down shortly after \n     New Year's Day.\n\n  Mr. President, this is unthinkable. It is time to settle, and a \nsettlement ought to be within reach. Here are two simple steps that I \npropose be taken immediately to break the stalemate and balance the \nFederal budget in 7 years:\n  First, drop the tax cut; and second, a 1-percentage point correction \nin the Consumer Price Index.\n  Under the President's December 1995 budget as scored by CBO, these \ntwo steps get you to a balanced budget in the year 2002. It's as simple \nas that, It's doable and ought to be done, and it ought to be done now.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table entitled ``Two \nSimple Steps to Balancing the Budget in Seven Years,'' and the article \nfrom the New York Times of December 23, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               TWO SIMPLE STEPS TO BALANCING THE BUDGET IN 7 YEARS                              \n                                    [By fiscal year, in billions of dollars]                                    \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                     1996     1997     1998     1999     2000     2001     2002 \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDeficit under administration's proposal as                                                                      \n estimated by CBO................................      148      162      155      148      145      130      115\nDrop Tax Cut.....................................       -3      -13      -14      -16      -22      -24      -25\nCPI minus one percentage point...................       -5      -15      -26      -37      -51      -66      -82\nAdditional savings on debt service...............  .......       -1       -1       -2       -3       -4       -6\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Deficit Disappears...........................      140      133      114       93       69       36        2\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n       Compiled by Senate Finance Committee Democratic staff from \n     CBO estimates.\n\n       January 2, 1996.\n\n                [From the New York Times, Dec. 23, 1995]\n\n          Judge Says Budget Impasse Could Shut Nation's Courts\n\n                      (By Robert D. Hershey, Jr.)\n\n       Washington, December 22.--A senior judge who represents the \n     policy-making board of the Federal judiciary today warned \n     that the budget stalemate might force the nation's courts to \n     shut down shortly after New Year's Day.\n       Gilbert S. Merritt, the chief judge of the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, said in an interview \n     that ``a breakdown in constitutional order'' could occur if \n     money was not authorized soon.\n       His warning came as an additional 20,000 workers were \n     ordered off the job today, bringing the total number of \n     furloughed Federal workers to 280,000, about one in seven \n     people on the Government's nonmilitary payroll. The partial \n     shutdown reached its seventh day today, surpassing the six-\n     day shutdown that involved 800,000 workers in mid-November \n     and making it the longest on record.\n       The White House and Congress are trading accusations over \n     who is more to blame for the deadlock. The shutdown results \n     from their inability to agree on several spending bills \n     needed to finance Government operations in the fiscal year \n     that began on Oct. 1. Meanwhile, they are also arguing about \n     legislation to balance the Federal budget by the year 2002.\n       The White House has issued a six-page list of Government \n     functions suspended by the budget deadlock, ranging from \n     granting farmers special permission to use restricted \n\n[[Page S22]]\n     pesticides on crops to the reimbursement of banks for Government-\n     guaranteed loans that have defaulted.\n       Judge Merritt's warning came in a separate statement. The \n     840 Federal judges would remain available for work, he said, \n     but it is unlikely that the courts would continue to be \n     staffed by clerical, probation and security personnel.\n       ``The judges cannot run the court system alone,'' said \n     Judge Merritt, who sits in Nashville. ``And if the judiciary \n     shuts down, you can't arrest people for Federal crimes \n     because you can't bring them to court.''\n       Republicans said the White House was to blame for the \n     problems. ``President Clinton shut down the Government,'' \n     said Michele Davis, spokeswoman for Representative Dick Armey \n     of Texas, the House majority leader. ``He vetoed three bills \n     last week that would have reopened'' national parks, museums \n     and monuments, and restored the missing services, she added.\n       The shutdown of the national parks forced the cancellation \n     today of the first of the annual Bracebridge dinners at \n     Yosemite National Park in California. Bracebridge, an \n     Ahwahnee Hotel tradition since 1927, recreates a Renaissance \n     feast and includes an eight-course meal.\n       About 1,650 guests, picked by lottery from among 60,000 \n     requests, were turned away after park rangers closed the \n     gates to Yosemite on Wednesday.\n       Although the Clinton Administration cited various aspects \n     of law enforcement among its examples of lapsed activity, it \n     did not mention the threat Judge Merritt found to the \n     judiciary.\n       ``If this goes into the first week in January, we are going \n     to have a serious problem,'' the judge said in the interview. \n     He spoke as the chairman of the steering committee of the \n     Judicial Conference, the policy-making body of Federal \n     judges.\n       Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist has long urged Congress \n     to consider a separate financing bill for the judiciary, but \n     there has been no response so far, the judge said. The \n     judiciary is now running on funds it gets from fees, which \n     are not allocated to any specific year's budget and which it \n     is allowed to spend on its own. But this money will soon run \n     out, Judge Merritt said.\n       The White House list included such highly visible examples \n     of service loss as 23,000 passport applications not being \n     accepted on the average day, 383,000 daily visitors affected \n     by the closing of the national parks and 92,400 people in \n     Washington denied admittance to the Smithsonian museums, the \n     National Zoo and the National Gallery of Art.\n       Among other effects of the shutdown on the list were these:\n       Suspension of activity involving sales of timber from \n     national forests.\n       No processing by the Federal Housing Administration of \n     2,500 home purchase loans and refinancing.\n       Suspension of civil enforcement actions by the \n     Environmental Protection Agency, except for Superfund cases, \n     that yield an average of $3 million a day in fines or \n     injunctive relief against polluters.\n       No processing of 20,000 applications a day for student \n     loans or Pell grants.\n       Blockage of more than $92 million a day in foreign sales \n     because of the closure of the center that licenses exports of \n     military items and sensitive technology.\n       In a related development, the Bureau of Labor Statistics \n     said that publication of the Producer Price Index and the \n     Consumer Price Index, scheduled for Jan. 11 and Jan. 12, \n     respectively, would be delayed about a week even if \n     furloughed employees returned to work by Tuesday. And \n     employment figures for December scheduled to be made public \n     on Jan. 5, will be delayed if workers do not return by \n     Tuesday.\n       ``The absence of this information potentially could create \n     a degree of short-term paralysis in decision making with \n     resulting long-term adverse effects on the nation's economic \n     well-being,''' said Commissioner Katharine G. Abraham. ``For \n     example, companies could delay investment or hiring \n     decisions, causing a decline in output and national income.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/03/senate-section/article/S21-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S22]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, as 1996 begins, and the 2d session of the \n104th Congress convenes, we need to take a close look at the record of \nthis Congress' first year. In reviewing that record, one stunning \nfailure stands out above all others. The majority in 1995 presided over \nperhaps the most bungled budget and appropriations process ever seen in \nCongress. The majority failed to meet every budget deadline set by law, \nand every deadline they set for themselves.\n  Rather than react responsibly to bring order to this process, \nRepublicans instead chose to shut down the government twice. The most \nrecent shutdown, now in its 19th day, is by far the longest in history. \nBoth of these shutdowns have been unnecessary, wasteful of taxpayer \nfunds, and have inconvenienced thousands of Americans who paid their \ntaxes only to have basic services denied them.\n  Let there be no mistake: Despite some of the rhetoric we have heard, \nthe responsibility for the shutdown falls squarely on the shoulders of \nRepublicans in the House of Representatives. Nothing makes that clearer \nthan the action by the Senate on January 2 to approve a continuing \nresolution that would fund the Government until January 12. The other \nbody could take up and enact that legislation in a matter of minutes. \nYet because of objections by self-proclaimed revolutionaries in the \nother body, the shutdown continues. These extremists plan to hold the \nGovernment and its workers hostage to force the administration to \naccept a budget that has already been rejected by the President and the \nAmerican people.\n  A brief review of the botched budget process this year explains how \nCongress got into this mess. The Budget Act requires the Senate Budget \nCommittee to report a resolution by April 1. The majority missed that \ndeadline. The Budget Act requires Congress to complete a budget \nresolution by April 15. Again, the majority missed that legal deadline. \nBy June 15, the Budget Act requires Congress to complete action on a \nfinal budget reconciliation bill. Today, over 6 months later, we are \nstill discussing that legislation at the White House. In fact, they did \nnot even complete work on the budget resolution until June 29.\n  The majority has missed every legal deadline for the appropriations \nprocess, as well. By June 10, the Budget Act requires the House \nAppropriations Committee to report all 13 appropriations bills. The \nmajority failed to report even one of them by that date. By June 30, \nthe Budget Act requires the House to complete action on all 13 \nappropriations bills. They had completed only two. By October 1, the \nbeginning of the fiscal year, all 13 appropriations bills are supposed \nto be enacted. On October 1, 1995, Congress had sent only two of them \nto the President.\n  Not only has Congress failed to meet its legal responsibilities. It \nis now failing to meet its constitutional responsibilities to properly \nfund the Government. Last year was not the first time the President \ndiffered with Congress on appropriations bills. When Democrats \ncontrolled Congress and Republicans controlled the White House, \nDemocrats handled Presidential vetoes very differently than the \nmajority does today. In 1990, President Bush vetoed the District of \nColumbia bill twice, and he also vetoed the foreign operations and \nLabor/Health and Human Services bills. He again vetoed the District of \nColumbia bills in 1992 and 1993, and the Labor/HHS bill in 1992. In \neach of these cases, Congress approved a continuing resolution to avoid \na shutdown while Congress and the President worked out differences over \nthese bills.\n  There is no reason that Congress cannot again this year approve \nstopgap funding while Congress and the President negotiate differences \nover outstanding appropriations bills that should have been completed \nlong ago. In fact, the President has indicated that, with relatively \nminor changes, he would quickly sign the bills he has vetoed, and the \nGovernment could be put back to work.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of my \nstatement, the veto messages of the President regarding the VA/HUD, \nCommerce/State/Justice, and the Interior appropriations bills be \nprinted in the Record.\n  As these messages make clear, agreement is within reach if extremist \nriders are removed and limited funding for high-priority programs is \nrestored. The only reason that this has not been done already is that \ncertain leaders in the \n\n[[Page S23]]\nother body seek to impose their radical agenda on America by holding \nthese bills hostage. The Founding Fathers, in writing the Constitution, \nexpected more responsible behavior from leaders in Congress, and did \nnot anticipate that Congress would renege on its basic obligation to \nmaintain the functioning of Government because one faction expected to \ngain partisan advantage.\n  Mr. President, I would ask my colleagues to review these veto \nmessages, and begin working to bridge the differences by negotiating in \ngood faith, and stop using coercive tactics to extract advantage. I \nhope very much that the House will act today on the clean continuing \nresolution approved by the Senate yesterday. Ending the irresponsible \nshutdown would be a good demonstration of leadership, and would clearly \nadd a positive note to the bipartisan negotiations over balancing the \nbudget that are now taking place.\n  There being no objection, the messages were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     To the House of Representatives:\n       I am returning herewith without my approval H.R. 2099, the \n     ``Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban \n     Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, \n     1996.''\n       H.R. 2099 would threaten public health and the environment, \n     end programs that are helping communities help themselves, \n     close the door on college for thousands of young people, and \n     leave veterans seeking medical care with fewer treatment \n     options.\n       The bill includes no funds for the highly successful \n     National Service program. If such funding were eliminated, \n     the bill would cost nearly 50,000 young Americans the \n     opportunity to help their community, through AmeriCorps, to \n     address vital local needs such as health care, crime \n     prevention, and education while earning a monetary award to \n     help them pursue additional education or training. I will not \n     sign any version of this appropriations bill that does not \n     restore funds for this vital program.\n       This bill includes a 22 percent cut in requested funding \n     for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), including a 25 \n     percent cut in enforcement that would cripple EPA efforts to \n     enforce laws against polluters. Particularly objectionable \n     are the bill's 25 percent cut in Superfund, which would \n     continue to expose hundreds of thousands of citizens to \n     dangerous chemicals and cuts, which would hamper efforts to \n     train workers in hazardous waste cleanup.\n       In addition to severe funding cuts for EPA, the bill also \n     includes legislative riders that were tacked onto the bill \n     without any hearings or adequate public input, including one \n     that would prevent EPA from exercising its authority under \n     the Clean Water Act to prevent wetlands losses.\n       I am concerned about the bill's $762 million reduction to \n     my request for funds that would go directly to States and \n     needy cities for clean water and drinking water needs, such \n     as assistance to clean up Boston Harbor. I also object to \n     cuts the Congress has made in environmental technology, the \n     climate change action plan, and other environmental programs.\n       The bill would reduce funding for the Council for \n     Environmental Quality by more than half. Such a reduction \n     would severely hamper the Council's ability to provide me \n     with advice on environmental policy and carry out its \n     responsibilities under the National Environmental Policy Act.\n       The bill provides no new funding for the Community \n     Development Financial Institutions program, an important \n     initiative for bringing credit and growth to communities long \n     left behind.\n       While the bill provides spending authority for several \n     important initiatives of the Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development (HUD), including Community Development Block \n     Grants, homeless assistance and the sale of HUD-owned \n     properties, it lacks funding for others. For example, the \n     bill provides no funds to support economic development \n     initiatives; it has insufficient funds for incremental rental \n     vouchers; and it cuts nearly in half my request for tearing \n     down the most severely distressed housing projects. Also, the \n     bill contains harmful riders that would transfer HUD's Fair \n     Housing activities to the Justice Department and eliminate \n     Federal preferences in the section 8, tenant-based program.\n       The bill provides less than I requested for the medical \n     care of this Nation's veterans. It includes significant \n     restrictions on funding for the Secretary of Veterans Affairs \n     that appear designed to impede him from carrying out his \n     duties as an advocate for veterans. Further, the bill does \n     not provide necessary funding for VA hospital construction.\n       For these reasons and others my Administration has \n     converyed to the Congress in earlier communications, I cannot \n     accept this bill. This bill does not reflect the values that \n     Americans hold dear. I urge the Congress to send me an \n     appropriations bill for these important priorities that truly \n     serves the American people.\n                                               William J. Clinton.\n       The White House, December 18, 1995.\n                                                                    ____\n\n     To the House of Representatives:\n       I am returning herewith without my approval H.R. 1977, the \n     ``Department of the Interior and Related Agencies \n     Appropriations Act, 1996.''\n       This bill is unacceptable because it would unduly restrict \n     our ability to protect America's natural resources and \n     cultural heritage, promote the technology we need for long-\n     term energy conservation and economic growth, and provide \n     adequate health, educational, and other services to Native \n     Americans.\n       First, the bill makes wrong-headed choices with regard to \n     the management and preservation of some of our most precious \n     assets. In the Tongass National Forest in Alaska, it would \n     allow harmful clear-cutting, require the sale of timber at \n     unsustainable levels, and dictate the use of an outdated \n     forest plan for the next 2 fiscal years.\n       In the Columbia River basin in the Pacific Northwest, the \n     bill would impede implementation of our comprehensive plan \n     for managing public lands--the Columbia River Basin Ecosystem \n     Management Project. It would do this by prohibiting \n     publication of a final Environmental Impact Statement or \n     Record of Decision and requiring the exclusion of information \n     on fisheries and watersheds. The result: a potential return \n     to legal gridlock on timber harvesting, grazing, mining, and \n     other economically important activities.\n       And in the California desert, the bill undermines our \n     designation of the Mojave National Preserve by cutting \n     funding for the Preserve and shifting responsibility for its \n     management from the National Park Service to the Bureau of \n     Land Management. The Mojave is our newest national park and \n     part of the 1994 California Desert Protection Act--the \n     largest addition to our park system in the lower 48 States. \n     It deserves our support.\n       Moreover, the bill would impose a misguided moratorium on \n     future listings and critical habitat designations under the \n     Endangered Species Act. And in the case of one endangered \n     species, the marbled murrelet, it would eliminate the normal \n     flexibility for both the Departments of the Interior and \n     Agriculture to use new scientific information in managing our \n     forests.\n       Second, the bill slashes funding for the Department of \n     Energy's energy conservation programs. This is short-sighted \n     and unwise. Investment in the technology of energy \n     conservation is important for our Nation's long-term economic \n     strength and environmental health. We should be doing all we \n     can to maintain and sharpen our competitive edge, not back \n     off.\n       Third, this bill fails to honor our historic obligations \n     toward Native Americans. It provides inadequate funding for \n     the Indian Health Service and our Indian Education programs. \n     And the cuts targeted at key programs in the Bureau of Indian \n     Affairs' are crippling--including programs that support child \n     welfare; adult vocational training; law enforcement and \n     detention services; community fire protection; and general \n     assistance to low-income Indian individuals and families.\n       Moreover, the bill would unfairly single out certain self-\n     governance tribes in Washington State for punitive treatment. \n     Specifically, it would penalize these tribes financially for \n     using legal remedies in disputes with non-tribal owners of \n     land within reservations.\n       Finally, the bill represents a dramatic departure from our \n     commitment to support for the arts and the humanities. It \n     cuts funding of the National Endowments for the Arts and \n     Humanities so deeply as to jeopardize their capacity to keep \n     providing the cultural, educational, and artistic programs \n     that enrich America's communitties large and small.\n       For these reasons and others my Administration has conveyed \n     to the Congress in earlier communications, I cannot accept \n     this bill. It does not reflect my priorities or the values of \n     the American people. I urge the Congress to send me a bill \n     that truly serves the interests of our Nation and our \n     citizens.\n                                               William J. Clinton.\n       The White House, December 18, 1995.\n                                                                    ____\n\n     To the House of Representatives:\n       I am returning herewith without my approval H.R. 2076, the \n     ``Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, \n     and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1996.''\n       This bill does not meet the priorities and needs of our \n     Nation and people. It would undermine our ability to fight \n     the war on crime; decimate technology programs that are \n     critical to building a strong U.S. economy; and weaken our \n     leadership in the world by drastically cutting funding for \n     international organizations, peacekeeping, and other \n     international affairs activities.\n       First, the bill represents an unacceptable retreat in our \n     fight against crime and drugs. It eliminates my COPS \n     initiative (Community Oriented Policing Services) to put \n     100,000 more police officers on the street. Already, this \n     initiative has put thousands of police on the street, working \n     hand-in-hand with their communities to fight crime. The block \n     grant that H.R. 2076 would offer instead would not guarantee \n     a single new police officer. That's not what the American \n     people want, and I won't accept it. As I have said, I will \n     not sign any version of this bill that does not fund the COPS \n     initiative as a free-standing, discretionary grant program, \n     as authorized.\n       The bill also eliminates my ``drug courts'' initiative. And \n     it unwisely abandons crime prevention efforts such as the \n     Ounce of Prevention Council and the Community Relations \n     Service. I am also disappointed that the funding levels in \n     the bill fall short of my request for the Drug Enforcement \n     Administration, and OCDETF (Organized Crime Drug \n\n[[Page S24]]\n     Enforcement Task Force). This is no time to let down our guard in the \n     fight against drugs.\n       Second, the bill constitutes a short-sighted assault on the \n     Commerce Department's technology programs that work \n     effectively with business to expand our economy, help \n     Americans compete in the global marketplace, and create high \n     quality jobs. As we approach a new, technology-driven \n     century, it makes no sense to eliminate an industry-driven, \n     highly competitive, cost-shared initiative like our Advanced \n     Technology Program (ATP), which fosters technology \n     development, promotes industrial alliances, and creates jobs. \n     Nor does it make sense to sharply cut funding for measures \n     that will help assure our long-term growth and \n     competitiveness--such as our National Information \n     Infrastructure grants program, which helps connect schools, \n     hospitals, and libraries to the information superhighway; the \n     GLOBE program, which promotes the study of science and the \n     environment in our schools; the Manufacturing Extension \n     Partnership, which helps small manufacturers meet the hi-tech \n     demands of the new marketplace; Defense Conversion; or the \n     Technology Administration. And I oppose the bill's harmful \n     cuts for the Census Bureau and for economic and statistical \n     analysis.\n       Third, I am deeply concerned that this bill would undermine \n     our global leadership and impair our ability to protect and \n     defend important U.S. interests around the world--both by \n     making unwise cuts in funding for international organizations \n     and peacekeeping activities, and by cutting programs of the \n     State Department, the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, \n     and the United States Information Agency. These cuts would \n     impair our ability to support important activities such as \n     the nonproliferation of weapons, the promotion of human \n     rights, and the control of infectious disease like the Ebola \n     virus.\n       Moreover, sections of the bill include inappropriate \n     restrictive language, including language limiting the conduct \n     of U.S. diplomatic relations with Vietnam, that I believe \n     infringe on Presidential prerogatives. And I cannot accept \n     the provision that would cut off all funding for these \n     agencies on April 1, 1996, unless the State Department \n     Authorization Act and related legislation had been signed \n     into law.\n       Fourth, the bill includes three additional provisions that \n     I cannot accept.\n       It cripples the capacity of the Legal Services Corporation \n     (LSC) to fulfill its historic mission of serving people in \n     need--slashing its overall funding, sharply limiting the \n     administrative funds LSC needs to conduct its business, and \n     imposing excessive restrictions on LSC's operations. LSC \n     should be allowed to carry on its work in an appropriate \n     manner, both in its basic programs and in special initiatives \n     like the migrant legal services program.\n       Section 103 of the bill would prohibit the use of funds for \n     performing abortions, except in cases involving rape or \n     danger to the life of the mother. The Justice Department has \n     advised that there is a substantial risk that this provision \n     would be held unconstitutional as applied to female prison \n     inmates.\n       The bill also includes an ill-considered legislative rider \n     that would impose a moratorium on future listings under the \n     Endangered Species Act by the National Oceanic and \n     Atmospheric Administration and other agencies. That rider not \n     only would make bad policy, it also has no place in this \n     bill.\n       Finally, I would urge the Congress to continue the \n     Associate Attorney General's office.\n       For these reasons and others my Administration has conveyed \n     to the Congress in earlier communications, I cannot accept \n     this bill. H.R. 2076 does not reflect my priorities or the \n     values of the American people. I urge the Congress to send me \n     an appropriations bill that truly serves this Nation and its \n     people.\n                                             William J. Clinton.  \n       The White House, December 19, 1995.\n\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/03/senate-section/article/S22-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S24-S26]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                MEDICAID\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, we all hope that agreement can be reached \nvery shortly on the budget. I would like to take a few minutes of the \nSenate's time this afternoon to talk about one particular part of that \nbudget controversy and that is Medicaid. I would like to caution the \nnegotiators, caution all of us on both sides of the aisle, that as we \ndebate and negotiate on Medicaid, we really need to stay focused on the \nfact that this is not just a question of money. The argument is not \nover just money. It is not just a question of finding a dollar amount \nthat we can all agree on, a dollar amount that we can compromise. There \nare also very important policy issues that we simply must deal with. \nThe policy issues are, in a very real sense, even more important than \nthe dollars that are involved.\n  If we merely reduce the Federal contribution to the States to furnish \nMedicaid but at the same time do nothing to structurally fix Medicaid, \nthen I believe we will have failed, and that failure will have \ndevastating consequences. Instead, I believe we must seize this \nopportunity to fix Medicaid by removing the wasteful, inefficient, and \nadministratively burdensome parts of the current program. If we do \nthat, then we will improve Medicaid but, more important, we will \nimprove poor people's health care.\n  So this debate is not just about money. It is not just about \nfederalism. It is not just about State sovereignty. It is about the \npoor and how best to serve them, how best to develop constructive and \nviable alternatives that will meet their health care needs. Because the \nreality is, if given the flexibility, if given the freedom, the States \ncan devise programs that cost less and at the same time provide better \nhealth care for the poor.\n\n  I would like this afternoon, therefore, to review for just a few \nmoments where we are currently on Medicaid, where our proposal and the \nPresident's proposal would take us. Today, under the status quo, under \nwhat has become an open-ended entitlement program, the Federal \nGovernment can give States an unlimited amount of money to look after \nthe health of their poor so long as States do two things. First, States \nhave to provide the poor within their boundaries with a Federally-\nprescribed set of services. That is, States are told what health care \nto give their poor and how to give it to them, how to deliver the \nservices. Second, States have to contribute to the costs of Medicaid \nfrom their budgets based on a Federal formula.\n  The fact that unlimited funds have been made available to this \nprogram has also meant that there has been no incentive to remove the \ninefficiencies that exist, nor to come up with new or better ways to \nserve the health care needs of the poor. This has resulted, in turn, in \never-increasing expenditures on Medicaid by both the Federal Government \nand by the States. Between 1988 and 1994, 6 years, State spending on \nMedicaid has increased by 160 percent. During the same years, Federal \nspending on Medicaid has increased 170 percent. Or, to look at it \nanother way, in 1987 States spent on the average 10 percent of their \nown budgets on Medicaid. Last year, they spent almost 20 percent.\n  In a conversation I had this morning with my Governor, the Governor \nof the State of Ohio, George Voinovich, he told me that in just a few \nyears, unless changes are made, Ohio will be spending 40 percent of its \ntotal budget for the cost of Medicaid.\n  Federal Medicaid spending has grown from 2.7 percent of total Federal \noutlays to 5.6 percent during this same period of time. So, today, we \nhave a Medicaid Program that is growing too fast and does not provide \nthe best health care for the buck. So we have set out to change this, \nto cut Federal spending growth--not Federal spending, but to cut the \nrate of growth, and to cut it in half; and, at the same time, to \nimprove the delivery of health care services to the poor. We proposed a \nreduction in the current Federal contribution to Medicaid. But, under \nour plan, we also gave States more flexibility than ever before in \ndetermining how health care services should be provided to poor people.\n  These two changes, fewer dollars from Washington, slower rate of \ngrowth, but more flexibility for the States, those two have to go hand-\nin-hand. You cannot have one without the other, because States cannot \ndeliver health care with fewer dollars if they must do so under the \ncurrent bureaucracy-laden, expensive system. On the other hand, if we \nlet States be creative, they can spend less and at the same time \nprovide better services.\n  Allowing States the flexibility to reform and redefine Medicaid means \nthat our proposal is not just a proposal about money. While it is a \nproposal that sometimes tells the States what services to provide, for \nthe most part it leaves the States to find innovative ways to provide \nthese services. It leaves it up to the States. States are given this \nflexibility because we believe the States can devise better and \n\n[[Page S25]]\nmore cost-effective ways in which to deliver health care services. If I \ncould, let me give the Members of the Senate an example, an example I \nthink is very instructive.\n  Let us take a child on Medicaid who has severe asthma, and who is \nhospitalized on an average of every 2 to 3 weeks every summer, usually \nfor 3 to 4 days at a time. Medicaid pays for this child to be in the \nhospital at a cost, tremendous cost, per day. But Medicaid does not--\nlet me repeat--does not allow a State to send a case worker over to \nthat child's home and install an air-conditioner in that child's \nbedroom to prevent these recurring asthma attacks. An air-conditioner \ncould well save the child from what are very scary breathing problems. \nI will say my wife, Fran, and I have experienced this with our own \nchildren. There is nothing scarier than to have a child who cannot get \nher breath. A simple thing such as an air-conditioner could save that \nchild from that agony and that family from that agony and, at the same \ntime, save taxpayers thousands and thousands of dollars. Yet, under the \ncurrent law, this sort of preventive measure is not permitted. This \nsort of preventive measure is not permitted under current Medicaid law.\n  Giving the States more flexibility will allow them to be innovative, \nbold, imaginative, and will provide people with real services that \nmatter--and that in many cases will be cheaper.\n  Let me give another example, Mr. President. Under today's Medicaid \nProgram Medicaid beneficiaries who suffer traumatic brain injuries are \nrequired to be institutionalized in nursing homes, if they want the \nmoney, and if they want the help. So if an 18-year-old is involved in a \ncar accident and is left comatose, he or she may be treated in a \nrehabilitation center until the car insurance is exhausted. But then \nthat 18-year-old would be placed under current law in a nursing home. \nImagine if instead this 18-year-old could be treated at home with \nservices specific to his or her needs with community-based services \naimed specifically at brain injuries. He may well recover, return to \nschool, get a job, and live a full life. And, Mr. President, it would \ncost a lot less.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my time be extended by 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, let us consider another example, a 15-\nmonth-old baby girl born with short bowel syndrome. The teenage parents \ncan find child care an overwhelming prospect. Under Medicaid today that \ninfant would almost inevitably be sent to an institution. What if \nnursing services could instead be provided for that baby at home along \nwith training and support for the young parents? That little girl could \ngrow up with parents in a more stable home environment, and live the \nsort of life that children are meant to live. And again, Mr. President, \nit would cost less.\n  Here is another example. If today an 85-year-old woman has \nosteoperosis, cancer, psoriasis, she would likely end up in a nursing \nhome. But what if the States could instead establish full health \nprograms that include monthly nursing visits and weekly physical \ntherapy? She could be mobile, hopefully keep her condition from \ndeteriorating, and stay at home.\n  Another example: As we all know, under the current Medicaid system \nmany, many poor children get ordinary care in emergency rooms. That is \nwhere they go for that type of care. But that really is not the place \nfor building long-term doctor-patient relationships. Let us give States \nthe flexibility, and they will develop their own managed care plans for \nthe poor. So these children could go to their own primary care \nphysicians where the doctors will know them, their names, and their \nmedical history. That will certainly ensure better health care. But \nsome may say, but cannot States really do all of these things now? \nWell, in any one of these scenarios a State could go hat in hand to \nWashington and maybe, just maybe, get permission, get a waiver, to help \ntheir citizens in these alternative innovative, and, yes, responsive \nways. But States do not have the ability to address these local \nsituations in their own communities without permission from Washington. \nThat is the law today. They have to go to Washington hat in hand. They \nhave to beg for permission to do it. Why should we have a system in \nwhich we must waive the rules in order to simply do what is right?\n\n  We instead free States so that they could respond compassionately to \ntheir poor, and in the long run provide them with better care while \ncutting the inefficient and duplicative cost of Medicaid.\n  So, Mr. President, I believe it is a mistake to look only at the \nmoney side of the Medicaid question. The President proposes to cut the \nrate of growth of Federal contributions but make no structural \nchanges--let me repeat, make no structural changes--and require States \nto make up the monetary difference. It does not increase State \nflexibility, and it ties the hands of Governors and State legislators \nso that States are left paying more toward Medicaid but given an \ninsufficient voice in determining how those funds are spent.\n  Mr. President, it will take more than this to achieve what I am sure \nboth President Clinton and I ultimately want, and what we all want for \nthe poor of this Nation: Better affordable health care for the poor. \nUnfortunately, the President's proposal has shifted the debate away \nfrom substantive Medicaid reforms to simply a numbers debate.\n  It must be reiterated again and again that we are not just debating \nhow large or small the Federal contribution to Medicaid should be. To \ncharacterize the debate in this way emphasizes a fundamental \nmisunderstanding of Medicaid, and a fundamental misunderstanding of \nwhat this debate is all about. We cannot sit down to the negotiating \ntable to simply split the differences on the Federal contribution level \nand call it a day. We cannot just sit down and say Republicans are at \nthis figure, Democrats are at this figure, let us split the difference \nand all go away happily. That is not going to solve the problem. And in \nfact, Mr. President, as I think I have outlined to demonstrate this \nafternoon, that may be the worst of all possible worlds. If we end up \nsplitting the difference between the two sides but yet make no change \nin policy and keep the policy the way it is today, it simply will not \nwork. The States cannot make it work. We will be dealing the States a \nhand that they simply cannot play. And the people who are going to \nsuffer are not just going to be the Governors, the State legislatures, \nand the taxpayers of each State. The people who are going to suffer are \nthe poor who depend on Medicaid for their health care. That is who is \ngoing to suffer.\n\n  Mr. President, to approach it in this simplistic way, to make this \njust a numbers debate, would be, I believe, to take the easy way out \nand leave unaddressed the problems currently facing Medicaid today--the \ninefficiencies, the exorbitant costs. Given the flexibility, States \ncould begin to address. In fact, to split the difference and call it a \nday would leave the States with a devastating bill to meet these legal \nobligations. As I stated earlier, my State of Ohio would have to spend \n40 percent of its total budget on Medicaid--40 percent. Ohio already \ndevotes 30 percent of its budget to Medicaid today, and this increase \nwould come in just the first 10 years. That is huge, and this \npercentage will continue to grow.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, let me say that States will be forced \nto pull money away from other programs if this path is followed. Which \nState programs would we have our Governors cut? Education? Public \nhealth and safety? I think not. This runaway proposal would squeeze out \nall else, and it simply cannot be tolerated.\n  Mr. President, the only solution would be bankruptcy for the States \nor increase State taxes to raise money to pay for the ever-increasing \nlegal obligations of the States under Medicaid. This would certainly be \none back-door way of increasing taxes that I do not think anyone in \nthis Chamber would approve of. We cannot reduce the Federal \ncontribution to Medicaid while at the same time keep the costly, \ninefficient, and counterproductive requirements of Medicaid and then \nsimply walk away.\n  We cannot walk away from the 18-year-old accident victim, nor walk \naway from the 15-month-old infant of the overwhelmed teenage parents. \nWe \n\n[[Page S26]]\ncannot walk away from an 85-year-old woman with osteoporosis and \ncancer. Mr. President, we do not believe in simply abandoning people. \nAny Medicaid Program that comes out of these negotiations that we \nnegotiate or vote for should not do that either.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine).

Mr. President, I wish to say that I think we have had some \nvery useful discussions today, although obviously the substantive \ndiscussions and negotiations are, we hope, going on elsewhere. But I \nwish to begin by reemphasizing what my distinguished colleague from \nOhio has just said in the past few minutes about the importance of \nchanging the system.\n  I had the privilege of serving as chief executive of the State of \nMissouri for 8 years, and I was convinced, as were almost all of my \nother colleagues who were Governors at the time, Republicans and \nDemocrats, that we could do a far better job in handling many of the \nprograms partially funded by the Federal Government if we did not have \nall of the strings and restrictions and red tape put upon us. That is \nwhy we have moved in this session of Congress to change the programs \nthemselves, to make them more effective and efficient, not just to save \nmoney. Obviously, we cannot continue to spend, particularly on \nentitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid, at the ever-increasing \nrates of growth, without destroying these very programs, bankrupting \nthe Government, and destroying our economy. But it is not enough, as \nhas been pointed out by my colleague from Ohio, merely to cut the \namount of money that we are turning over to the States. If we tell \nthem, ``You have to keep spending the money the way we tell you but we \nare not going to give you as much as you have been getting, or not as \nmuch as an increase as you have been getting,'' then we risk disaster. \nWe need fundamental changes--allowing the States to develop responsive \nand responsible, effective and caring programs to meet the needs of \nthose who are recipients of the programs, within these budgetary \nconstraints.\n  Mr. President, in my second term as Governor, we fought and fought \nand fought to get waivers from the Department of Health and Human \nServices, now HCFA, so we could start a managed-care program for \nMedicaid, so we could give the providers selected by the Medicaid \nrecipient the opportunity to do the best job they could of keeping that \nrecipient healthy.\n  It made a tremendous amount of difference. More emphasis was placed \non keeping people healthy, on preventive health care, on regular \ncheckups, on routine well-baby care that kept the recipients well, kept \nthem out of the hospital, kept them from lost time. The result was that \nwe saved some money but people on Medicaid in my State were a lot \nhappier, and healthier, with the program. And those examples, those \nexperiments are being carried out in every State in the Nation. If we \nonly could change the program so that State legislators and Governors \nwho are just as concerned as the Members of this body about taking care \nof those in need could make those innovations, I am convinced we can do \nit.\n  Now, we have had, as I have said, much discussion about differences \nin policy, differences in policy that lie at the base of this balanced \nbudget debate, but part of the problem is, I think, some of the facts \nare being misstated. We have heard earlier today about how Federal \nemployees are being held hostage; that it is an unheard of shutdown of \nthe Federal Government.\n  It seems to me, Mr. President, in the time I have been here when \nthere was a Democratically controlled Congress and a Republican \nPresident, there were shutdowns in the Federal Government when Congress \nand the President did not agree. To say that it is unheard of is not \ntrue. I believe even during the period of the Carter administration, \nwhen there was a Democratic President and a Democratic Congress, there \nwere a number of periods of time when there was no budget or continuing \nresolution in place. As a matter of fact, some of my colleagues, on a \nbipartisan basis, today were talking about how the Democratic majority \nin Congress in 1990 toughened up the Anti-Deficiency Act to make it \nmore painful, more painful for the executive branch to try to continue \nto operate in the absence of a continuing resolution, and, yes, it \nappears that some of those chickens have come home to roost now.\n  But let us make clear one thing. Part of this responsibility, the \nresponsibility that some of the agencies of Government are shut down, \nis on the back of the President. I can speak from personal experience, \nhaving managed the bill that funds veterans, housing, environment, \nspace, emergency management, and other areas--the VA-HUD and \nindependent agencies appropriations bill. We passed the bill. We passed \nthe bill that made over 12 percent cuts from last year's original \nappropriations.\n  Now, during the summer of last year, in a rescission bill, the \nCongress, with the President's signature, rescinded some of those funds \nfrom the previous year because that bill, VA-HUD, was making too many \npromises that could not be kept in out-years. When you make a promise \nin housing, for example, to provide housing over a number of years, you \nhave to appropriate the budget authority up front, but then each year \nas you carry out that commitment, the expenditure of that authority--\nthe outlays--are scored against the aggregate budgetary limitations for \nthat year.\n  So we have had to cut back significantly, and the President agreed \nwhen he signed the rescission bill that we would cut back on the \ncommitments in VA-HUD. So it was with surprise that when we tried to \nnegotiate with the White House to find out how we could change the \nfiscal year 1996 appropriations bill to accommodate their needs and \ntheir desires, the only thing we got from Mr. Panetta, who was up here \non the Hill, was a statement that, well, we just need to spend $2 \nbillion more, just give us $2 billion more.\n  I explained to him, as every Member of this body who is familiar with \nthe appropriations process knows, we cannot give $2 billion more. We \nhave to stay within the budget. But I suggested that if they were \nwilling to work with us, we could make adjustments within the dollars \navailable and send the President the bill, he could sign that bill, and \nthen to the extent he is able to reach a later agreement which might \nput more money into the various appropriated accounts, we could come \nback by a supplemental appropriation or a continuing resolution to add \nmoney to the Veterans' Administration, Housing and Urban Development, \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration, the National Science Foundation, and all of those \nagencies.\n  What happened? Well, frankly, the President vetoed the bill. The \nPresident vetoed the bill because we did not spend as much money as he \nwanted. That is understandable. Everybody who likes government likes to \nspend more money. But if you don't want to cut spending in domestic \nappropriated accounts, you have to find someplace else to take it. You \ncould, for example, cut back on the money going into entitlement \nprograms like Medicare and Medicaid. Actually, we have a very good \nexample of that. The President and Mrs. Clinton back in 1993 and 1994, \nas my colleagues will recall, came before the Congress--you probably \nhave seen film clips of them recently--and said we really must slow the \nrate of growth of Medicare to 6 to 7 percent a year.\n  Mr. President, they were correct because as the Clinton trustees of \nMedicare and Social Security have said, if we do not reform part A of \nMedicare, it is going to go broke, it is going to run out of money in \nthe year 2002.\n  The President was right when he said we have to slow the rate of \ngrowth. But not only do we have to slow the rate of growth, just as my \nfriend from Ohio said, we have to change the structure of Medicare; we \nhave to change the structure of Medicare because a top-down Government \nprice-fixing program in health care has not worked. \n\n[[Page S27]]\n\n  It is important that we give senior citizens choices, choices so they \ncan choose from among private plans which will have to manage the costs \neffectively and give the recipients, the Medicare recipients, the kinds \nof services they need if they are to compete.\n  The President and Mrs. Clinton were very clear when they came before \nthe Congress and said it is not a cut when you say we are going to slow \nthe rate of growth to a reasonable amount of 6 to 7 percent. How \ninteresting it is to hear now representatives of the President, the ads \nrun by their supporters, saying Medicare is going to be slashed because \nthe Republican Congress proposes to let it grow by 7.2 or even 7.4 \npercent.\n  Mr. President, we have to save Medicare. If you are talking about \njust cutting a little bit of money out of Medicare, you are not going \nto really save it; you are just going to squeeze it down and make it \nmore difficult for Medicare recipients to get doctors and hospitals and \nother health care providers to give them the kind of services they \nneed. You need to change the program and you need to slow the rate of \ngrowth in the program. You tell me how much you want to slow the rate \nof growth of the Medicare Program, and we can probably tell you how \nlong past 2002 you will keep the program healthy, how long before it \nwill go bankrupt.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may be granted another \n5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, as I was saying, how long do you want to keep Medicare \nhealthy? Personally, I would like to see Medicare kept healthy, not \nonly for those who are on Medicare right now, but those who will be \ncoming on, people my age and people younger.\n  We are going to have to make changes to slow the rate of growth. One \nproposal to save $70 to $80 billion was estimated only to save it for \nmaybe 2 more years. I do not think, Mr. President, we ought to go \nthrough all this battle and all this heartache and say that Medicare \nwill not go bankrupt in 2002, it will go bankrupt in 2005. We can do \nbetter than that. We have to implement real reforms which will assure \nthe financial solvency of this critical program well into the \nforeseeable future.\n  I hope we would stop the posturing and stop the ads and stop the \nclaims that Medicare is being savaged. It begins to appear to me, Mr. \nPresident, that there is something else at work here. The President of \nthe United States told the American people in the campaign and told us \nin the State of the Union Message in 1993 he wanted a balanced budget. \nThen just a month and a half or so ago, before Congress sent him a \ncontinuing resolution, he agreed that he would sit down and develop \nwith the Congress a balanced budget reaching balance in the year 2002 \non the basis of Congressional Budget Office scoring.\n  If he is willing to do that, and if he is willing to take a hard look \nand a responsible look at how we keep entitlement programs from going \nbankrupt, and how we keep it from destroying us, then there is plenty \nof room to negotiate as far as I am concerned. If I were a negotiator, \nI would say, we put it all on the table. I would not put more taxes on \nthe table because we tried the taxes and that did not work. Jacking up \ntaxes in 1993 got only about a third of what we expected out of it.\n  It is time that we cut. If the President would come forward and deal \nin good faith, we could reach that agreement in a very short time. But \nwhat I am hearing from the press, some of my colleagues who have \nfriends in the White House, the political advisers are saying, ``Great, \ndon't move. Don't move, Mr. President. You've got it just where you \nwant it. You have talked about a balanced budget, but then you can come \nout and be against all the cuts. You don't have to agree to any of the \ncuts, just say you're for a balanced budget and then trash anybody who \ntries to put the details of a balanced budget together. And so long as \nyou don't have to present one, then you're not going to be caught.''\n  As one of my friends, a Member of this body on the other side of the \naisle, has said--and obviously I will not identify him--he said it \nmakes for great campaign rhetoric. It is great political fanfare, but \nit is a darn poor way to govern.\n  Mr. President, I suggest that if the President wants to have a \nbalanced budget, if he wants to carry through on his promise, then it \nis time, as we say in Missouri, to show me, come forward and say where \nyou are going to make these necessary cuts. The White House is not \ndoing that.\n  I mentioned earlier that with respect to the small little \nappropriations bill I handled, veterans, HUD, independent agencies, \nthey originally requested $2 billion, about $1.9 billion-plus. We have \njust received their latest request. Guess what? That latest request \ngoes up to $2.5 billion. This is not negotiation. This is moving in the \nopposite direction.\n  Mr. President, if anybody is negotiating with somebody who keeps \ntaking steps farther and farther away from agreement, you will find out \nthat is not negotiation, that is political game playing. Unfortunately, \nuntil we see any movement in the other direction, I have to say that \nthis President apparently does not want a balanced budget.\n  Dismiss all the rhetoric. His requests are for more spending in \ndomestic areas. His requests are for less cuts in entitlement programs. \nFrankly, every time that the Congressional Budget Office has scored his \nproposal--and the Congressional Budget Office is the one who he said \nmust judge those proposals --it shows that he misses in the \nneighborhood of two to three hundred billions of dollars.\n  Mr. President, there is some talk about adding a few billion dollars \nmore to domestic discretionary. Unfortunately, under the congressional \nbudget resolution that will achieve a balanced budget by the year 2002, \nhave to cut nondefense discretionary from $270 billion in 1996 to $258 \nbillion in 1997. That is a 4.4-percent decrease--a $12 billion \nexpenditure reduction. If you are going to be putting more money in \nthis year, you are going to make it a bigger cliff to fall off of next \nyear.\n  I would caution our negotiators not to go down that path of building \nin more spending now when we are going to have to have greater cuts \nnext year and more program disruption.\n  We could come to an agreement. I think there are lots of areas where \nwe could agree. I will tell you that I am beginning to think that the \nonly place that we can make an agreement is working with our colleagues \nin Congress. I have had the pleasure of working with the Senator from \nMaryland, Senator Mikulski. We have some policy differences, but those \npolicy differences can be accommodated.\n  I know that there are groups working together on a bipartisan basis, \nSenators Breaux and Chafee and others, Senator Nunn and many others, \nwho are working to come up with a balanced budget, because I believe \nthere are people in this body on both sides of the aisle who believe it \nis in the best interest of this country to get the Government back to \nwork, to get the employees of the Federal Government doing what they \nare supposed to do, and put forward a responsible bipartisan plan to \nmove this country toward a balanced budget in the year 2002.\n  The Kerrey-Danforth commission, headed by Senator Kerrey from \nNebraska and my former colleague, Senator Danforth from Missouri, \npointed out how difficult the entitlement problems are. Unless we start \ndealing with those entitlement problems, we are not going to reach that \nresult.\n  So, Mr. President, it has been with only a slight degree of hope and \na great deal of concern that I have watched the proceedings today. We \nhave to find some areas of compromise. Unless we see the President \nwilling to come forward and tell us where cuts are going to be made--\nreal cuts; not phony cuts, real cuts--then we are going to have to work \nwithin this body, and I hope we can find bipartisan cooperation in the \nHouse, to come to agreements on how to get spending under control, how \nto provide the vital services that are necessary, that must be \nprovided, but to do so in a responsible way that does not cost our \nchildren and our grandchildren another $1 or $2 trillion worth of debt.\n  Mr. President, this is a vitally important issue. The issue of the \nbudget is going to define not only what our children face in the \nfuture, but our economy in the short term. I look forward \n\n[[Page S28]]\nto working with Members of this body and ultimately Members of the \nother House in seeing if we cannot fashion what the President has been \nunwilling to come forth and produce, and that is a balanced budget.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Keith Kennedy, \nwho has served as the Republican staff director for the Appropriations \nCommittee for 15 years, having assumed that position 15 years ago \ntoday.\n  Keith is a very valuable member of the Senate staff, upon whom we \nhave all relied at one time or another.\n  I know my colleagues join Senator Hatfield and Byrd in wishing Keith \ncontinued success in his position--we will continue to rely on his \nsound counsel.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate and to convey my \nappreciation to a member of my staff, J. Keith Kennedy. Today marks the \n15-year anniversary of Keith's service as the Republican staff director \nof the Senate Appropriations Committee, serving either in the majority \nor in the minority as fortune permitted. Mr. Kennedy has steered the \nstaff with a firm, but gentle hand at the helm, through the often \nchoppy waters of legislative process. Such continuity has provided the \nSenate with the type of institutional memory that keeps us from \nremaking some of the mistakes of the past. In this capacity, Mr. \nKennedy has worked to uphold the position of the Senate in negotiations \nwith three administrations--those of Presidents Ronald Reagan, George \nBush, and Bill Clinton, five OMB directors--David Stockman, James \nMiller, Richard Darman, Leon Panetta, and Alice Rivlin, and a House of \nRepresentatives under both Democratic and Republican majorities. During \nthat time, he helped implement the Reagan revolution of the early \n1980's when many of us were still trying to get our sea legs in a \nSenate with a new Republican majority. In the 1990's, he has played a \nkey role in charting a course out of fiscal excesses of earlier years.\n  Keith has served the Senate with distinction and honor for over 23 \nyears. I have come to rely on him as a trusted adviser, policy expert, \nand friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the resolution.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 208) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 208\n\n       Whereas J. Keith Kennedy has served as majority or minority \n     Chief Clerk and Staff Director of the Committee on \n     Appropriations since January 3, 1981;\n       Whereas he has ably served the Senate in various other \n     roles since September of 1972;\n       Whereas he has served as clerk of the Legislative Branch \n     Appropriations Subcommittee, in which capacity he has \n     endeavored to provide for the welfare and benefit of the \n     entire U.S. Senate and its employees;\n       Whereas he has overseen the modernization and streamlining \n     of the day-to-day operations of the Senate Appropriations \n     Committee;\n       Whereas he has ably represented the interests of the \n     Appropriations Committee and the Senate in all budget \n     negotiations since 1981;\n       Whereas he has upheld the high standards and traditions of \n     the Senate with abiding devotion; and\n       Whereas he has earned the respect, affection and esteem of \n     the United States Senate: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That on this fifteenth anniversary of his tenure, \n     the Senate express its commendation, appreciation and \n     gratitude to J.

Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate turn to consideration of Senate Resolution 207, a resolution \nsubmitted earlier today by myself and Senator Lott.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 207) to congratulate Brett Favre, a \n     native of Kiln, Mississippi, for winning the 1995 National \n     Football League Most Valuable Player Award.\n       Whereas Brett Favre, a native of Kiln, Mississippi, is a \n     professional football player with the Green Bay Packers;\n       Whereas Brett Favre has demonstrated extraordinary skills \n     as an athlete and has proven himself a leader and top \n     performer in the National Football League;\n       Whereas Brett Favre has been named the Most Valuable Player \n     of the National Football League for 1995: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the United States \n     congratulates Brett Favre for the outstanding season he has \n     had as quarterback of the Green Bay Packers and for being \n     named the Most Valuable Player of the National Football \n     League for 1995.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it is with much pride that I submit a \nresolution congratulating Brett Favre for his outstanding \naccomplishment in being named the Most Valuable Player of the National \nFootball League for 1995. Brett is a native of my State of Mississippi.\n  He grew up in the Kiln community near the Mississippi Gulf Coast and \nstarred as a student and athlete at Hancock Central High School. He \nfirst received national attention as quarterback for the University of \nSouthern Mississippi, where he led his team to victories over such \nnationally ranked powers as Florida State University, University of \nAlabama, and Auburn University.\n\n[[Page S29]]\n\n  This year, Brett Favre set a National Football Conference record of \n38 touchdown passes and 4,413 total yards passing during the regular \nseason. This is the third highest number of touchdown passes in a \nseason in NFL history. He threw three more touchdown passes in Sunday's \n37 to 20 first round playoff victory over the Atlanta Falcons.\n  Ironically, Brett was chosen for MVP over another outstanding \nMississippian and NFL star, Jerry Rice. Jerry Rice is generally \nconsidered the best wide receiver and pass catcher in modern history. \nHis accomplishments were noted when he was named MVP of the Super Bowl \nin 1987.\n  Brett Favre's rise to the top of his profession in four seasons is a \ntestament not only to his ability, but to his courage and determination \nto excel. Brett Favre has proven himself a leader and top performer in \nevery capacity and his achievements during the 1995 season were \nawesome.\n  I urge the Senate to join me in giving special recognition to this \nexceptionally talented young man and congratulating him upon receiving \none of the highest honors awarded in his profession.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article about him and his award that \nappeared in the Clarion Ledger, January 2, 1996, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Clarion-Ledger, Jan. 2, 1996]\n\nFavre Reaches Top--Earning NFL MVP Honors Caps a Long Climb for the Kid \n                               From Kiln\n\n                           (By Mike Knobler)\n\n       Billy Ray Dedeaux remembers a time he told his fourth-grade \n     class to play touch football. One boy made a tackle, and \n     Dedeaux paddled him for it.\n       Dedeaux had no way of knowing the boy was simply preparing \n     himself to become the world's best football player. And \n     that's exactly what Brett Favre has become.\n       Favre was named the National Football League's MVP Monday \n     in a landslide vote over fellow Mississippian Jerry Rice. \n     Favre, the Green Bay Packers quarterback, got 69 of a \n     possible 88 first-place votes from a panel of sports writers \n     and broadcasters. Rice, the San Francisco 49ers receiver, got \n     10.\n       ``It means everything,'' said Favre, who just completed his \n     fifth--and by far his most successful--regular season in the \n     NFL. ``It's like winning the Super Bowl, except it's an \n     individual honor. It's the National Football League, which \n     means it's the best player in the whole world. In this game. \n     And that's awesome.\n       ``Think about all the great players you play with and play \n     against. It's overwhelming. It's hard to even explain how \n     much that means to win that and say, `God, MVP of the \n     league.' ''\n       Back home on the Gulf Coast, Favre's family and former \n     teachers were pleased with the honor but not surprised. \n     They'd been hearing and reading for weeks that he was a \n     leading candidate for the award.\n       ``At first, when they started talking about it, you didn't \n     think too much of it,'' said Bonita Favre, Brett's mother \n     ``But as the year went on, it didn't seem out of reach.''\n       The MVP award carries with it the promise of more \n     endorsement contracts and more money for Favre, 26. That \n     means more work for his family in Kiln.\n       Bonita pays all the bills and takes care of all the \n     accounts for Brett's three businesses: Favre Enterprises, \n     Favre Agricultural Enterprises and Favre Property Management. \n     There are lawyers and accountants to help, but Bonita handles \n     the day-to-day finances.\n       Irvin, Brett's dad, runs the agricultural business, a 45-\n     acre Black Angus farm behind the Favres' house. Scott, \n     Brett's brother, runs the real estate business, which owns \n     residential and commercial property in Mississippi and \n     Tennessee.\n       Brett handles the football.\n       ``Being the MVP won't change Brett,'' Irvin said. ``It'll \n     change his lifestyle a bit. This'll complicate matters more. \n     In the offseason, if you add all the days up (for his current \n     endorsements and charity appearances), it'd be a little over \n     a month. How much that'll increase and how much he wants that \n     to increase, I don't know. He won't really have any off time. \n     He'll be a busy man, and Brett doesn't really like that.''\n       Brett set an NFC record with 38 touchdown passes and threw \n     for 4,413 yards. He guided the Packers to an 11-5 record and \n     their first NFC Central title in 23 years.\n       The Packers beat the Atlanta Falcons in the opening round \n     of the playoffs and face the 49ers Saturday at San Francisco. \n     Gladys Haas will be watching that game on TV.\n       ``I love to watch him throw that ball,'' said Haas, Favre's \n     kindergarten teacher. ``His father said to me one time after \n     things were going real nice for him, `Gladys, you started all \n     of this.' He was a dear youngster just like all \n     kindergartners are. Even at that age, I'd say he was an up-\n     and-going youngster.''\n       Favre was already a football prodigy by the time he got to \n     Dedeaux's class at Hancock North Central Elementary School. \n     Favre won a Punt, Pass and Kick contest in Biloxi. Dedeaux \n     watched Favre advance from PeeWee to high school to Southern \n     Mississippi to the pros.\n       ``Any teacher dreams of a star student,'' Dedeaux said, \n     ``Brett and many others have made that dream come true. He's \n     a go-getter. He's always been very competitive, even in \n     elementary school.''\n       Former high school math teacher Richard Streiff remembers \n     Favre as the A student who sat in the center of the front row \n     in class. he also remembers Favre as an unlikely candidate to \n     become an MVP quarterback in the NFL.\n       ``I never dreamed he'd be a quarterback,'' Streiff said. \n     ``I thought he'd wind up as a defensive back at one of the \n     major universities.\n       ``He's an excellent young man. I can't say enough nice \n     things about him as student and as a person.''\n       Favre has a new teacher these days: Packers coach Mike \n     Holmgren. Favre admitted he owes much of his success to \n     Holmgren. Holmgren admitted he owes much of his success to \n     Favre.\n       ``He does everything you can ask from a quarterback, and \n     he's still young and learning,'' Holmgren said.\n       Last year, Favre nominated Dedeaux for the NFL's teacher of \n     the month award. Dedeaux won and received $2,500, plus $5,000 \n     for the school Favre returns each spring and signs autographs \n     for sixth graders.\n       That gives Dedeaux the chance to tell his story about the \n     kid who disobeyed his teacher and went on to greatness.\n       ``Sometimes that's what happens when you become hardheaded \n     and don't listen,'' Dedeaux said. ``He was just making \n     himself tough.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the resolution.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 207) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/03/senate-section/article/S28-3", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S29]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF LIBYAN EMERGENCY--MESSAGE FROM THE \n                           PRESIDENT--PM 107\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the \nenclosed notice, stating that the Libyan emergency is to continue in \neffect beyond January 7, 1996, to the Federal Register for publication.\n  The crisis between the United States and Libya that led to the \ndeclaration of a national emergency on January 7, 1986, has not been \nresolved. The Government of Libya has continued its actions and \npolicies in support of terrorism, despite the calls by the United \nNations Security Council, in Resolutions 731 (1992), 748 (1992), and \n883 (1993) that it demonstrate by concrete actions its renunciation of \nsuch terrorism. Such Libyan actions and policies pose a continuing \nunusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and vital \nforeign policy interests of the United States. For these reasons, the \nnational emergency declared on January 7, 1986, and the measures \nadopted on January 7 and January 8, 1986, to deal with that emergency, \nmust continue in effect beyond January 7, 1996.
