Sometimes we are troubled about our success \nratings, what people think of us, and maintaining popularity. Often we \nare better at reading the pulse of public opinion than honestly taking \nour own spiritual pulse. Help us to use the true measurement of \nhumility; not to stoop until we are smaller than ourselves, but to \nstand at our real height and compare ourselves to the greatness You \nintend for us to achieve. Thus, seeing the real smallness of our \nsupposed greatness, stretch our souls today until they are enlarged to \ncontain the gift of Your spirit. Then sound in our souls Your renewed \ncall to serve You with our eye on only one opinion poll: What You think \nof our performance. Free us from need of people's approval so that we \nmay give ourselves away for the needs of people.

Mr. President, once again we have lied to the American \npeople.\n  Mr. President, once again, we are lying to the American people. For \nthe past several weeks, we have heard the cries of the ``balanced \nbudget'' and ``the first opportunity in 25 years really to balance this \nbudget.'' Everywhere men and women cry ``balance.'' But, Mr. President, \nthere is no balance to this budget. It is an outright fraud, and my \nfriends on the other side should know better.\n  It was an embarrassing moment at the Budget Committee last evening. \nThe chairman of the Budget Committee had fallen into the trap of \nplaying to the cameras.\n  He had a clock flashing the amount of the gross debt and a chart \nshowing the first page of the reconciliation bill with a ribbon, like \nin a horserace or the good housekeeping award, certifying that this \nbudget was for fiscal responsibility. Not so at all.\n  On last Tuesday, just a week ago, he inserted in the Congressional \nRecord the letter from June O'Neill, the Director of the Congressional \nBudget Office, together with the tables showing a surplus of $10 \nbillion.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record \nagain at this point.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                 Taxation, Budget, and Accounting Text\n\n  [Letter from Congressional Budget Office Director, June O'Neill to \n   Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici (R-NM), projecting \n enactment of reconciliation legislation submitted to committee would \n      produce budget surplus in 2002, issued Oct. 18, 1995 (Text)]\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 18, 1995.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     reviewed the legislation submitted to the Senate Committee on \n     the Budget by eleven Senate committees pursuant to the \n     reconciliation directives included in the budget resolution \n     for fiscal year 1996 (H.Con Res. 67). CBO's estimates of the \n     budgetary effects of each of those submissions have been \n     provided to the relevant committees and to the Budget \n     Committees. Based on those estimates, using the economic and \n     technical assumptions underlying the budget resolution, and \n     assuming the level of discretionary spending specified in \n     that resolution, CBO projects that enactment of the \n     reconciliation legislation submitted to the Budget Committee \n     would produce a small budget surplus in 2002. The effects of \n     the proposed package of savings on the projected deficit are \n     summarized in Table 1, which includes the adjustments to \n     CBO's April 1995 baseline assumed by the budget resolution. \n     The estimated savings that would result from enactment of \n     each committee's reconciliation proposal is shown in Table 2.\n       As you noted in your letter of October 6, CBO published in \n     August an estimate of the fiscal dividend that could result \n     from balancing the budget in 2002. CBO estimated that \n     instituting credible budget policies to eliminate the deficit \n     by 2002 could reduce interest rates by 150 basic points over \n     six years (based on a weighted average of long-term and \n     short-term interest rates) and increase the real rate of \n     economic growth by 0.1 percentage point a year on average, \n     compared with CBO's economic projections under current \n     policies. CBO projected that the resulting reductions in \n     federal interest payments and increase in federal revenues \n     would total $50 billion in 2002 and $170 billion over the \n     1996-2002 period. Those projections were \n\n[[Page S 15508]]\n     based on a hypothetical deficit reduction path developed by CBO. The \n     deficit reductions estimated to result from the \n     reconciliation legislation submitted to the Budget Committee, \n     together with the constraints on discretionary spending \n     proposed in the budget resolution, would likely yield a \n     fiscal dividend similar to that discussed in the August \n     report.\n       If you wish further details on this projection, we will be \n     pleased to provide them.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  June E. O'Neill,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair.\n  Thereupon, Senators admonished the Director of the Congressional \nBudget Office that she was violating section 13301 of the Budget Act, \nwhich provides that Social Security trust funds shall not be used to \nhide the size of the deficit.\n  On October 19, 2 days later, the same June O'Neill, the Director of \nthe Congressional Budget Office, sent a second letter in response to \ninquiries made by my colleagues from North Dakota, Senators Conrad and \nDorgan. In that response, Ms. O'Neill explained that if you follow the \nlaw, you will end up with a deficit of $98 billion in the year 2002.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record at \nthis point.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 19, 1995.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: Pursuant to Section 205(a) of the budget \n     resolution for fiscal year 1996 (H. Con. Res. 67), the \n     Congressional Budget Office yesterday provided the Chairman \n     of the Senate Budget Committee with a projection of the \n     budget deficits or surpluses that would result from enactment \n     of the reconciliation legislation submitted to the Budget \n     Committee. As specified in section 205(a), CBO provided \n     projections (using the economic and technical assumptions \n     underlying the budget resolution and assuming the level of \n     discretionary spending specified in that resolution) of the \n     deficit or surplus of the total budget--that is, the deficit \n     or surplus resulting from all budgetary transactions of the \n     federal government, including Social Security and Postal \n     Service spending and receipts that are designated as off-\n     budget transactions. As stated in the letter to Chairman \n     Domenici, CBO projected that there will be a total-budget \n     surplus of $10 billion in 2002. Excluding an estimated off-\n     budget surplus of $108 billion in 2002 from the calculation, \n     CBO would project an on-budget deficit of $98 billion in \n     2002.\n       If you wish further details on this projection, we will be \n     pleased to provide them. The staff contact is Jim Horney, who \n     can be reached at 226-2880.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  June E. O'Neill.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair.\n  Again the following day, October 20, the same June O'Neill \nacknowledged an accounting mistake and corrected her October 19 letter \nby explaining that actually the deficit in the year 2002 would not be \n$98 billion, but $105 billion instead.\n  Now, calling this budget balanced is a mistake that is commonly made, \nMr. President. Just two Sundays ago on ``Meet the Press,'' the best I \nhave seen in the public media covering this budget, Mr. Tim Russert, \nasked Mr. Panetta, ``Will you withstand those political charges and go \nalong with the reduction in cost-of-living increases in order to \nbalance the budget?''\n  That question is based on a false premise, Mr. President. The \nreduction of the cost-of-living increase does not go to balance the \nbudget, but, on the contrary, adds to the surpluses in the Social \nSecurity trust fund. We are getting all get boiled up around here, Mr. \nPresident, with respect to Medicare and Social Security, about things \nthat are in the black and ignoring the part of Government that is not \npaid for.\n  Specifically, let me cite Social Security. At the end of this fiscal \nyear, Social Security will have a $544 billion surplus. Has anybody in \nthis body, Capitol, ever heard the word ``surplus''? I have. I worked \nwith President Lyndon Johnson, in 1968 and 1969 with our good friend, \nChairman George Mahon, of the Appropriations Committee.\n  In December 1968 we called the President and said, ``Mr. President, \nplease allow us to cut another $5 billion.'' The outlays were for the \nentire Government in 1968-69, defense included were $178 billion. \nToday, just the interest cost on the national debt is projected to \nreach $348 billion, almost $1 billion a day.\n  We have been fiscally responsible at times. And perhaps before I \nstart, I ought to qualify myself as a witness, like they do in court.\n  Mr. President, this particular Governor got the first triple-A credit \nrating, before Tennessee, before North Carolina, Georgia, before any \nSouthern State. It was accomplished by hard work, but I, as a young \nGovernor, knew I could not make any impression on investors by just \ntalking about paving a road and serving barbecue. We needed a calling \ncard of fiscal responsibility.\n  Even back then I was trying to get business sense in Government, I \nasked the management consultants, to look at higher education, \nelementary and secondary education, the tax commission, insurance \ndepartment. We went through Government making it more efficient and \nearning a triple-A credit rating, which incidentally, was subsequently \nlost by our former Republican governor.\n  Then, as I previously stated, I worked in Washington with Chairman \nMahon back in 1968. And we continued that work to try and cut spending \nwithout decimating the responsibilities of Government. When President \nFord came in, we had an economic summit and we cut spending. When \nPresident Carter came in, I was the chairman of the Budget Committee. I \nwent to the White House after President Carter had been defeated in \nNovember 1980 and said, ``Mr. President, you are going to leave a \nbigger deficit than you inherited from President Ford.'' He said, ``How \nmuch?'' I said, ``$66 billion.'' He said, ``Well, then, how much are we \nprojecting?'' I said, ``We are projected to have a deficit of $75 \nbillion. And if that occurs, no Democrat will ever get elected again.''\n  So we passed the first reconciliation bill, signed by President \nCarter on December 5, 1980, cutting spending. I went to my good \nfriends, Senator Magnuson of Washington, Senator Church of Idaho, \nSenator Culver of Iowa, Senator Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin, Senator \nGeorge McGovern of South Dakota, Senator Birch Bayh of Indiana. I said, \n``You fellows have got to help. We have got to cut back on the \nappropriations bills that we have already approved.'' And we did just \nthat.\n  In 1981, I worked with the then majority leader, Howard Baker. We \ncould see that this supply-side economics was just exactly what Baker \ncalled it, ``river boat gambling.'' In the coming days, you are going \nto hear a whole lot of campy nonsense about opportunity and growth, \nabout giving people their money back, and about people back home \nknowing more about how to spend their money.\n  We should remember our experience with the supply-siders mantra of \n``growth, growth, growth.'' We first called it Kemp-Roth, then \nReaganomics, and finally Vice President Bush named it ``voodoo.'' And \nhere we go again with the voodoo. We are heading full-tilt toward \nenacting a massive tax cut, when we are looking for money to pay the \nbills.\n  It is absolutely irresponsible. We have lied again to the American \npeople.\n  President Reagan came to town promising to balance the budget in 1 \nyear. Then having been sworn in, the President said, ``Oops, this is \nway worse than I ever thought. We will balance it in 3 years.'' We \ncould not pass a budget freeze, so we tried Gramm-Rudman-Hollings which \nwas a freeze plus automatic cuts across the board.\n  The trouble is that we are about to see history repeat itself. We may \npass this budget but then, after 2 or 3 years, they will throw it away \njust like they threw away Gramm-Rudman-Hollings on October 19, 1990, at \n12:41 a.m. in the morning.\n  I stood at this desk and raised the point of order against doing away \nwith the fixed deficit targets of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, but Senator \nGramm and others voted me down. So it is not accurate to say, ``Oh, it \ndidn't work.'' It was working too well, that was the problem for some \nof my colleagues. Instead, they said, ``Let's have caps on spending and \nwe will balance the budget.'' And you can see the caps have gone up, up \nand away.\n  My Republican colleagues have, to their credit, mastered the rhetoric \nand the lingo: Balance, balance, balance, balance, first time in 25 \nyears, solid \n\n[[Page S 15509]]\nbudget, certified by CBO--it is an absolute charade. CBO says that by \nthe year 2002 there will be a $105 billion deficit. But Mr. Archer, the \nchairman of the Ways and Means Committee over on the House side, was \nquoted yesterday in USA Today. He said:\n\n       House Ways and Means Chairman Archer (R-TX) denies that his \n     party's budget is balanced with borrowing through Social \n     Security dollars and angrily denied Hollings' allegations. \n     ``I don't know where he comes up with that,'' Archer says of \n     Hollings.\n\n  Mr. President, I would recommend that he go to the conference report \nof Mr. Kasich's budget on page 3 where it says: Fiscal year 2002, \n$108,400,000,000 deficit. ``Deficit'' is the word used, not surplus or \nbalance.\n  No wonder we're in a pickle. The chairman of the Ways and Means \nCommittee does not even know that the budget provides for a deficit in \n2002. Here in the Senate, the chairman of the Budget Committee charges \nthat we are using a phony argument. But I would invite my colleagues to \nlook at the Congressional Record of last Tuesday, October 17, and you \nwill see that Mr. Domenici himself says that we will owe the Social \nSecurity fund. I quote from S. 15193, October 17 and Mr. Domenici:\n\n       So we owe it, in fact, we owe part of it to the Social \n     Security trust fund.\n\n  So please spare me this about phony. They think as long as they \nholler ``balance'' and holler ``phony and fraudulent'' people will \nignore the fact that the law plainly says that Social Security shall be \nexcluded from deficit and surplus totals.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record that section \n13301 of the Congressional Budget Act.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     SEC. 13301. OFF-BUDGET STATUS OF OASDI TRUST FUNDS.\n\n       (a) Exclusion of Social Security From All Budgets.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the receipts and \n     disbursements of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance \n     Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund \n     shall not be counted as new budget authority, outlays, \n     receipts, or deficit or surplus for purposes of--\n       (1) the budget of the United States Government as submitted \n     by the President,\n       (2) the congressional budget, or\n       (3) the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act \n     of 1985.\n       (b) Exclusion of Social Security From Congressional \n     Budget.--Section 301(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of \n     1974 is amended by adding at the end the following: ``The \n     concurrent resolution shall not include the outlays and \n     revenue totals of the old age, survivors, and disability \n     insurance program established under title II of the Social \n     Security Act or the related provisions of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 in the surplus or deficit totals \n     required by this subsection or in any other surplus or \n     deficit totals required by this title.''.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS.

Mr. President, these budget tables show the Government \noutlays from 1968 through 1995 and the CBO estimate for 1996. It shows \nthe trust funds that we have borrowed from for a total of \n$1,255,000,000,000.\n  Then it shows the term they use--``Unified deficit''--that is \nborrowing from the public and then also borrowing from your own pocket.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I may continue for another 5 minutes to \nconclude.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair.\n  So we have each figure in a separate column. Adding the unified \ndeficit to the money we owe the trust funds gives us the real deficit \nwhich last year totaled $283.3 billion.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record another budget \ntable.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n             more budget tables: senator ernest f. hollings\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                  National     Interest \n                                                    debt        costs   \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1996..........................................        5,238          348\n2002..........................................        6,728          436\n                                                                        \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                    1996         2002   \n                                                                        \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDebt includes:                                                          \n    1.

Mr. President, in this chart we have taken the outlays \nunder the Republican budget proposal as promulgated by the \nCongressional Budget Office for the years 1996 through the year 2002, \nand the revenues from CBO for the years 1996 through 2002. If you look \nat the total for spending, it is $12,080,000,000,000--\n$12,080,000,000,000. Then if you look at total revenues over the same \nperiod, it is only $11,008,000,000,000.\n  By simple arithmetic we will be adding over $1 trillion to the debt \nover the next 7 years.\n  In the year 2002, the gross debt will go from $4.9 trillion today to \n$6.728 trillion.\n  In order to show good faith, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nto have printed in the Record the budget paths that I presented in \nJanuary at our initial meeting of the Budget Committee.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Hollings Releases Realities on Truth in Budgeting\n\n       Reality No. 1: $1.2 trillion in spending cuts is necessary.\n       Reality No. 2: There aren't enough savings in entitlements. \n     Have welfare reform, but a jobs program will cost; savings \n     are questionable. Health reform can and should save some, but \n     slowing growth from 10 to 5 percent doesn't offer enough \n     savings.

Mr. President, the January table shows the deficit \nusing trust fund and not using the trust fund.\n  I have been in this budget game now for over 20 years at the Federal \nlevel. If anyone can show me any kind of realistic cuts that will by \nthemselves balance the budget, I will jump off the Capitol dome. It is \nvery easy to make that pledge because you see exactly from the \narithmetic.\n  The Republican budget can claim it balances the budget in 7 years \nonly because they use $636 billion of Social Security between now and \n2002. The other half of the trillion-dollar program comes from \ndiscretionary cuts, entitlement cuts, and interest savings of $347 \nbillion in the year 2002. That should give us a dose of reality. At \nthis very minute, we are struggling to find $45 billion in cuts for \nthis fiscal year.\n  In addition, you can add on the tax cut, which adds $93 billion to \nthe debt. I ask unanimous consent that a Wall Street Journal article \noutlining this fact be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From the Wall Street Journal]\n\n  GOP Tax Cuts Will Add $93 Billion To U.S. Debt, Budget Analysts Say\n\n                           (By Jackie Calmes)\n\n       Washington.--Despite Republicans' claims to the contrary, \n     their tax cuts will add billions to the nation's nearly $5 \n     trillion debt even as the GOP seeks to balance the budget by \n     2002.\n       An estimated $93 billion in extra debt will pile up as a \n     result of the Republicans' proposed $245 billion in seven-\n     year tax cuts, according to calculations from GOP \n     congressional budget analysts. And that's assuming the \n     economy gets a huge $170 billion fiscal stimulus that \n     Republicans are counting on as a consequence of balancing the \n     budget over seven years, thanks mostly to lower interest \n     rates.\n       GOP leaders agreed last summer, as part of a House-Senate \n     budget compromise, to apply that hypothetical $170 billion \n     ``fiscal dividend'' toward their proposed $245 billion in tax \n     cuts. That left $75 billion in revenue losses unaccounted \n     for. Interest on that amount would add about $18 billion, for \n     the total $93 billion in debt.\n       Meanwhile, the Republican architects of the plan boast that \n     the tax cuts are all paid for with spending cuts. Senate \n     Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, announcing his \n     panel's draft $245 billion tax-cut package last Friday, said \n     it would be completely financed with lower interest rates and \n     smaller government. ``Other factors like that will add up to \n     $245 billion,'' the Delaware-Republican said.\n       And Oklahoma Sen. Don Nickels, another Finance Committee \n     panelist and a member of the Senate GOP leadership, added, \n     ``We will not pass this tax cut until we have a letter'' from \n     the Congressional Budget Office reporting that Republicans' \n     proposed spending cuts through 2002 ``will give us a balanced \n     budget and a surplus of at least $245 billion.'' He added, \n     ``It's all paid for.''\n       The confusion has to do with the frequently misunderstood \n     distinction between the nation's accumulated debt, now \n     approaching $4.9 trillion, and its annual budget deficits, \n     which have built up at roughly $200 billion a year.\n       Republicans' spending cuts, it's projected, generally will \n     put the annual deficits on a downward path until the fiscal \n     2002 budget shows a minimal surplus. But the annual deficits \n     until then, while declining, together with nearly $1 trillion \n     more to the cumulative debt. Meanwhile, the GOP tax cuts add \n     to those annual deficits in the early years--in fact, the \n     fiscal 1997 deficit would show an increase from the previous \n     year. Thus the debt, and the interest on the debt, would be \n     that much higher.\n       Interviews in recent weeks indicate that many House and \n     Senate GOP members are unaware of the calculus. And some are \n     unfazed even when they hear of it. ``It would bother me if I \n     thought we were adding to the debt,'' said Texas Sen. Phil \n     Gramm, now seeking the presidency on his record as a fiscal \n     conservative, ``but I don't think we are.''.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The Chair has been indulgent and I know my \ndistinguished colleague from Tennessee is waiting to be heard.\n  Let me conclude by asking people to look at the arithmetic and to \nhelp expose the fact that once again, we have lied to the American \npeople.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nTennessee is recognized to speak for up to 20 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/24/senate-section/article/S15507-5", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15510-S15513]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CHANGE THE BUDGET STATUS QUO\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I appreciate the recognition.\n  First of all, I want to commend the distinguished Senator from South \nCarolina for his usual eloquence. I \n\n[[Page S 15511]]\nthink if I ever had a case to litigate in court that I want him on my \nside. Apparently, a lot of people in South Carolina over the years have \nfelt the same way.\n  He brings to this discussion a unique perspective of someone who has \nbeen in this body for many years, having served as Governor before his \nservice in this body. Great experience--he has been through the budget \nyears, budget battles.\n  It is always enlightening to hear an analysis of history--ancient \nhistory, recent history--as to how we got into the fix that we are in \nthis country, whose fault it has been in the past, and what \ncalculations that were made in the past that turned out not to be \ncorrect, and the political battles back and forth.\n  It is also interesting to hear from someone with such vast knowledge \nand experience as to how these deficits are figured, whose figures are \nto be used, whose figures are to be trusted and all of that.\n  However, Mr. President, I cannot bring to this discussion that kind \nof richness of historical perspective. I bring, as many of my \ncolleagues here in the Senate, including my colleague from Tennessee \nwho occupies the chair now, a different perspective.\n  That is, one from someone who has not been in this body, has not been \nin politics as far as that is concerned, over the years, and perhaps \nwho views this a bit differently, from a different perspective.\n  That is, simply--regardless of all of that--we are simply spending \nmore than we are taking in. We are simply bankrupting the next \ngeneration. We simply have to do some things differently in this \ncountry.\n  I think probably the best service that analysis of the past can be is \nan example of what we should not do. Sometimes I wonder whether or not \nwe should not, with regard to our fiscal policies in the past, with \nregard to so many of our social policies, we should not carefully \nanalyze what we have done over the years and do the exact opposite.\n  I think as far as these fiscal problems are concerned, all I know is \nthat we have that problem; the American people know we have that \nproblem. They sent some of us here to address that problem in a \ndifferent way than has been addressed in times past.\n  We stand here now on the brink of what I feel is a historic \nopportunity to address this for the first time in decades. Others would \ndisagree and say we have tried various things before and they have \nfailed. We tried some things and they worked for a while and we backed \noff again, which to me is a pretty good argument for a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget. That is a debate for a different time.\n  The chairman of the Budget Committee, as I read in this morning's \npaper, called this reconciliation package the culmination of his life's \nwork. He is not a person to use language loosely, and I am sure he \nfeels that way, and I am sure it is the case.\n  It has been a remarkable life's work and I think it points out the \nway in which serious people view this serious problem and where we are. \nThat is, on the brink of perhaps a historic occasion for the first \ntime, perhaps, in this generation, to really try to get a grip on a \nproblem that is strangling our Nation, that will undoubtedly engulf the \nnext generation if we do not face up to it and do something about it.\n  Anyone who reads history will see that history is full of occasions \nof great powers having great economic viability and power and success \nand great military powers, and countries come to the top and they rule \nthe world on occasion for periods of time, in ancient times, and they \nbecome the major economic powers of the world for periods of time.\n  Invariably, as the Bard would say, they strut and fret their brief \nhour upon the stage and then they move on. They decline, through \nlaziness, laxity, corruption, for whatever reason, they move on. And \nthey fade into the sunset and they are no longer militarily or \neconomically powerful.\n  One looking at the United States of America by any measurable \ncriteria--economic, socially, or perhaps any other criteria--could make \na pretty good case that the United States of America is on the \nbeginning stages of that kind of decline. I think just within the last \nfew years that people have taken note and made a decision in this \ncountry that we are not going to let that happen to the United States \nof America, that we are going to do something really unprecedented in \nworld history, and that is to stop ourselves in mid-decline and to \ncorrect that course.\n  For years in this country we have somewhat recognized these problems, \nbut basically roll them over for the next generation to deal with. We \nhave thought that we could have our cake and eat it too. We have \nthought that we could socially engineer our ways out of almost any \nproblem and do it from Washington, DC.\n  These things have not worked. Now we are in a position of having to \ncorrect some false assumptions that we have made and some false basis \nfor policies that we have had in this country for some time now. That \nshould not be a remarkable occurrence and it should not be something \nthat should be extremely disturbing to many of us.\n  This must happen in an individual's life. In the life of a nation, \nThomas Jefferson, as we heard so often quoted in the balanced budget \ndebate back a few months ago, pointed out that we need to reexamine \nourselves every once in a while. Even our form of government, in some \nbasic ways, should be reexamined and challenged from time to time. \nDifferent way of doing business. Certainly these policies that are \nbased on nothing more than a series of legislative enactments should \nundergo that kind of scrutiny. That is what we are doing now. That is \nwhat we are doing.\n\n  We have operated under the assumption that we could cure poverty in \nthis country by spending our way out of it, that as long as we were \nspending vast sums of money this was demonstrating our commitment to \nthose less fortunate. It made us feel good.\n  Basically, of course, we were spending other people's money, folks \nout there working for a living, paying taxes, and they were footing the \nbill as always. But we felt basically the end would justify that, \nbecause we could eradicate poverty in this country, basically. We, of \ncourse, gave no account, apparently, to basic tenets of human nature, \nthat we could not spend $5 trillion on a problem such as this without \ncreating dependency. We gave no accounting to the obvious fact that we \ncannot micromanage people's behavior from Washington, DC. But we spent \n$5 trillion and now we have, perhaps, basically the same rate of \npoverty that we had in this country when we started.\n  We developed a program for health care coverage for the elderly back \nin 1965. A lot of Democrats and Republicans joined together at that \ntime to institute Medicare and also Medicaid. At the time the Ways and \nMeans Committee estimated the hospital insurance part A would cost $9 \nbillion to finance in 1990. In 1990 hospital insurance actually cost \n$67 billion. Medicaid, a narrowly defined program buried in the 1965 \nbill that created Medicare, of course provides health care for low-\nincome Americans. It was intended to cost about $1 billion annually. By \n1992, expenditures had ballooned to $76 billion. In 1995 it was $89 \nbillion. Of course that is the Federal Government's share alone, the \nStates spent another $67 billion.\n  So it is clear that we miscalculated, that we have operated under \nfalse assumptions, and that we must have some midcourse correction here \nin order to save the very thing we say we want, because the results of \nthese policies, the results of this miscalculation, has left us in a \nsea of debt. It has slowed down the economy. We now have the lowest \nsavings rate in the industrialized world. We have one of the lowest \ninvestment rates among our trading competitors, and it has left our \ngrowth rate at about half what it usually is coming out of a recession \nin this country. It is making it more difficult for us to compete in a \nglobal economy with nations that measure their wages in pennies instead \nof dollars, and our work force here is insufficiently trained to meet \nthat. This is all in the context of an economy about which a good \nargument can be made, based upon our savings rate and our growth rate, \nthat our investment rate is basically, long range, long term, slowing \ndown--slowing down.\n  We have seen the result of our social policies. Mr. President, it is \nnot going to matter all that much whether we \n\n[[Page S 15512]]\nbalance the budget or not if out-of-wedlock births become the norm in \nthis country. It is not going to matter whether we have a tax cut or \nnot if juvenile crime makes it so that nobody can even get out on the \nstreets anymore in this country--and that is what it is coming to.\n  At a time when many of our prime statistics are leveling off, \njuvenile crime is now skyrocketing. Drug use among the juvenile \npopulation is now skyrocketing. So we have a slowing economy and \nterrible social indicators, where out-of-wedlock births exceed 50 \npercent in most of the major cities now.\n  Probably worst of all, I think, is a growing cynicism among the \nAmerican people. The dissatisfaction you see, the third parties we hear \nbeing talked about, the aftermath of these activities of some of our \nlaw enforcement agencies, have people who are big, strong, conservative \nlaw enforcement people saying, ``Wait a minute, this is not the way it \nought to be. This is not the Government I know. I feel disassociated \nfrom that kind of Government, that way of doing business.'' This is in \na country where 75 percent of the people consistently say they want a \nparticular policy--term limits is one example--and nothing ever \nhappens.\n  All of that, all of that is a result, a culmination of years and \nyears and years of policies that may have worked for a while and that \ncertainly were based on good intentions by those who instituted them. \nCertainly some remnants and some parts of some policies are worth \nsaving, and then there are some that were outright wrong from their \ninception and were based on fraudulent premises. A combination of all \nof that has led us here with these problems.\n  We talk about the last election. I do not think people got up on \nElection Day last time and started loving Republicans across the \ncountry. I think we benefited from the fact that we were not in, that \nwe were out. I think, more than anything else, it had to do with people \nwanting some kind of fundamental change in the way we were doing \nbusiness in this country on a fundamental basis, and they were willing \nto give us a narrow window of opportunity to see if we could do \nsomething about it. That is why so many of us came together and decided \nwe would take a handful of things, but a handful of the most important \nthings facing this country, and try to do something about them that is \ndifferent fundamentally--and they are come together in this \nreconciliation package.\n  It had to do with the commitment to balance the budget of this \ncountry. It had to do with a Medicare system that everybody knows \ncannot continue the way it is. Changes have to be made or it will not \nbe with us. It had to do with a failed welfare system where $5 trillion \nhas created more social havoc than we would have believed imaginable. \nAnd it had to do with leaving a few more dollars in the pockets of \nthose who earned the dollars in the form of a tax cut. They were laid \nout in the campaigns last time and people responded to them, and they \nare looking to see now whether or not we are going to keep that \ncommitment.\n  Everyone can be debated and will be debated, but I think it is good \nfor the system and the American people to see it all debated out, \nbecause there are two sides to most of these issues. But after all is \nsaid and done, the time is running out for us to make fundamental \nchange and it is going to have to be done and it is going to happen on \nour watch.\n  I am proud to be here for that historic occasion, when I think that \nwill happen. The easy thing to do, always, is to maintain the status \nquo, to nibble around the edges, to really do just enough to make \npeople think you are doing something without doing enough to really \nhave any effect on anybody's life so you will be subject to criticism. \nWe can argue over whose figures to use and all that. But I think the \nPresident's so-called second budget is a good example of that. He \napparently comes up with $245 billion simply by changing a few \nestimates. Again, I suppose folks that have been around here a long \ntime are used to that. That is the way you make your money, mostly, is \nto change your estimates, change your growth estimates, change your \ninflation estimates and all that, and you can come up with $245 billion \nout of thin air without having to make any changes.\n  Regarding the Congressional Budget Office, we do not have anyone who \neveryone can agree is omnipotent, who is all-knowing and can give us \nfigures that everyone will agree on. I suppose the Congressional Budget \nOffice is the nearest we have been able to come to that. The President \nalways thought so until recently. According to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, the President's so-called second budget does not balance. It \ngives us $200 billion deficits as far as the eye can see.\n  So the status quo is always easier. The same thing as far as the \nMedicare situation is concerned. We take the position we have to have \n$270 billion in Medicare savings. Our colleagues on the other side, so \nmany of them, say, ``Yes, we acknowledge first of all that we would \nhave to have a balanced budget,'' which is progress right there. And \nsecond, ``Yes, we must do something about Medicare.'' But again, just \nas with the balanced budget, ``You are going too far, you are going too \nfast.''\n  Mr. David Broder wrote in the Washington Post earlier this month on \nthis subject, and he pointed out the real problem, when you cut through \nall the rhetoric on both sides of the aisle as far as the health care \nproblem is concerned, is that the growth in spending for health care is \ndevouring the Federal budget. He pointed out the Presidential \ncommission, headed by our colleagues Senator Kerrey of Nebraska and \nSenator Danforth, reported earlier this year that unless current trends \nare changed, by 2010 or 2012, 15 to 17 years from now, all Federal \nrevenues will be consumed by entitlement programs and interest on the \nnational debt. So we clearly cannot continue down that road.\n\n  He further states that the Republican approach comes closer to the \nscale of changes that the country needs. He points out that in the \nHouse Ways and Means Health Subcommittee, they point to some estimates \ngiven to the committee by Guy King, former chief actuary for the \nFederal agency that runs Medicare and Medicaid.\n  Mr. King says that the Democrats are correct in claiming that their \n$90 billion solution would keep the Medicare trust fund solvent until \n2006, but in 2010--the last year that the Republican plan would keep \nthe trust fund in the black--he said the Democrats would leave it with \na $309 billion figure in the red. He says that date is terribly \nimportant because 2010 is the year the huge wave of baby-boomer \nretirees really hits.\n  Everyone acknowledges further changes in Medicare will be needed by \nthen. But, as Thomas points out, it is one thing to be dealing with the \nretiree wave from a position of fiscal parity--which is what our plan \nwould do--but it is much harder to do it when you are already $300 \nbillion in arrears.\n  So all he is saying is that, sure, the plan that would say let us \njust have $90 billion in savings would get us over the hump. That is \nwhat we are used to doing in this country--getting over the hump \nusually until the next election, hopefully until the next generation, \njust pushing it on down the road just a little bit further, and do not \nlet me have to deal with it because I do not want to have to go home \nand explain anything unpleasant to anybody. But if we do that when \nthose retirees hit, when those baby boomers start retiring, we will be \nhopelessly insolvent.\n  But we are not getting a reasoned debate in many instances on this. \nWe are getting scare tactics. We are getting the 30-second sound bites \nwhich the American people have grown to love so much in our political \nraces, 30-second television commercials that appeal to the most basic \ninstincts and that are invariably flawed from the factor standpoint.\n  Mr. President, has my time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The time has expired.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, Mr. Tim Penny, former Democratic \nRepresentative from Minnesota, wrote earlier in the Washington Post, \nlast month, and said that members of both parties should be working \ntogether on this important issue just as many Republicans joined \nDemocrats in voting for Medicare in 1965. Unfortunately, \n\n[[Page S 15513]]\nDemocratic leaders in Congress have decided otherwise, choosing to \nattack the Republican Medicare plan rather than offering an \nalternative. By politicizing the issues, Democrats are threatening the \nviability of the very program that they created.\n  Mr. President, we are better than that. We can do better than that. \nThose on both sides of the aisle have pointed out that this is not an \naccurate representation of what we are doing, the rhetoric that we are \nhearing now.\n  The Washington Post, on September 25, 1995, pointed out that as far \nas saying the tax cut proposal is simply a tax cut for the rich to \nfinance the Medicare cuts, they said, ``The Democrats have fabricated a \nMedicare tax cut connection because it is useful politically''.\n  Mr. President, the stakes are too high. The opportunities are too \ngreat. We must get down to what we all know is the task at hand; that \nis, saving this Nation from insolvency, saving the Medicare trust fund \nfrom insolvency, and putting some money back into the hands of working \npeople.\n  Mr. President, only in Washington, DC, do we still think that $1 of \ntax cuts of any kind, capital gains or otherwise, is $1 of revenue to \nthe Federal Government. It simply does not work that way. In 1981, for \nexample, when the rates were cut for capital gains, revenues went up. \nIn 1996, when rates were increased, revenues went down.\n  So I believe, as Senator Domenici has pointed out, the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee, this is a culmination of not only his last work \nbut a lot of people's last work. It is an historic occasion. We have an \nopportunity to do something that probably will not present itself \nagain, certainly in our lifetime, as far as this reconciliation package \nis concerned.\n  I urge its prompt consideration and its approval.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under a previous order, the Senator from \nMichigan [Mr. Levin] is recognized to speak for up to 15 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/24/senate-section/article/S15510-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15513-S15515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE ISTOOK AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Saturday New York Times over the \nweekend reported that a group of freshman Republicans in the House were \nthreatening to basically bring the Federal Government to a halt unless \na provision that they support is adopted in the conference report on \nthe Treasury-Postal appropriations bill. The provision at issue is \ncommonly referred to as the Istook amendment after its author, \nCongressman Ernest Istook of Oklahoma. It would put massive new \nrestrictions on all Federal grant recipients with respect to their \nparticipation in matters of public policy. This is how the New York \nTimes described it: ``As this week began, the freshmen were threatening \nan even wider uprising, with nearly half vowing to hold up all the \nupcoming spending bills and the reconciliation bill unless the \nleadership holds fast'' on the Istook amendment.\n  Congressman Roger Wicker of Mississippi is quoted in the article as \nsaying, ``It is something the conferees will ignore at their peril.''\n  One headline recently referred to the amendment here, as ``lobby \nreform.'' Proponents of the amendment say it will ``end welfare for \nlobbyists.'' Well, I have been working on lobbying reform for over 5 \nyears, now, and I can tell you, this is not lobbying reform. It is \nrepression of the rights of people to lobby.\n  The Istook amendment is a rather blatant attempt to silence dissent \nand to muffle the diversity of opinion in the forum of public policy \ndebate. The amendment is one of the most poorly thought out I have ever \ncome across. Senate conferees have been holding fast against it, \nalthough there is supposed to be a meeting of the conferees sometime \ntomorrow and we will have to see what happens. But again, the Senate \nhas served as a firewall against an extreme proposal emanating from the \nHouse. The Istook amendment provides that any Federal grant recipient \nis not allowed to use more than a small percentage of their own money--\nnon-Federal dollars--for political advocacy and still receive a Federal \ngrant for totally unrelated activities.\n\n  There is already a longstanding law on the books that prohibits the \nuse of appropriated funds for lobbying--no ifs, and, or buts. \nAppropriated funds under current law cannot be used for lobbying and \nthere are provisions that ensure that even indirect costs of an \norganization cannot be used to subsidize lobbying activities. Current \nlaw applies to all appropriated funds regardless of who the recipient \nis--for profit contractors as well as nonprofit grant recipients. The \npenalties for violating this provision are severe, including debarment \nfrom all future Federal funding. So this is not restriction that is \neasily overlooked or dismissed.\n  The argument that current law allows welfare for lobbyists is \nfactually incorrect. Under current law, no federally appropriated \nmoney, no Federal tax dollars can be spent by any recipient to lobby, \nperiod.\n  Well, then, what is the Istook amendment getting at? It is getting at \nthe non-Federal money. It is trying to control what private \norganizations can do with the money they raise solely from private \nsources.\n  What does the amendment say? First, it applies to all grant \nrecipients. Any entity that receives a Federal grant, either directly \nor indirectly would be subject to the provisions and requirements of \nthe Istook amendment. So, yes it covers organizations like AARP which \nreceives grants to conduct various programs for senior citizens, a \nfavorite target of the Istook supporters. But it also covers grants to \npersons who do research in small laboratories for the NIH. It covers \ngrants to major medical centers that may be studying the effects of \nchemotherapy for cancer treatment. It covers grants to religious \norganizations that may be conducting latchkey programs for the \nforgotten kids in neighborhoods across this country, and it covers \ngroups like the Red Cross. It applies to any organization or entity \nthat receives, directly or indirectly, Federal grant money or, indeed, \nthat may apply for Federal grant money.\n\n  It does not apply to Federal contractors. Federal contractors receive \nhundreds of billions of Federal tax dollars, and they have a tremendous \nincentive to lobby. Continuation of the B-2 bomber readily comes to \nmind as a program that producers of the B-2 might have an interest in \nlobbying on, but the Istook amendment does not try to limit the amount \nof lobbying that contractors can conduct with their private money, even \nwhen they are lobbying for Federal funds. The amendment does not try to \nlimit the volume of lobbying these companies can conduct despite the \nhundreds of millions, and in some cases the billions of dollars, they \nreceive from the Federal Government and the Federal taxpayers. And if \nthe Istook supporters can call private money used by Federal grant \nrecipients welfare for lobbyists, the same would have to hold true for \nprivate moneys used by Federal contractors. There is no difference.\n  The whole approach is based on a disturbing and a flimsy distinction. \nYou can buy B-2's from a company that makes a profit and not worry \nabout how it lobbies with its own money, but if you buy research into a \ncure for cancer from a nonprofit university, then you need to restrict \nthat university's lobbying efforts with its own money.\n  The B-2 contractor can lobby all it wants with its own money, but the \nuniversity working on a cure for cancer cannot.\n  So the amendment at the outset targets only one type of recipient of \nFederal funds, and that is the grant recipients that are largely \nnonprofit organizations, leaving the contract recipients that are \nlargely for-profit companies completely untouched.\n  What are the restrictions that the amendment then places on all \nFederal grant recipients? An organization cannot get a Federal grant if \nit spent more than--and I am shorthanding the formula here--if it spent \nmore than 5 percent of its total expenditures on political advocacy in \nany one of the preceding 5 years. So let me repeat that. An \norganization cannot get a Federal grant if it spent more than 5 percent \nof its total expenditures on political advocacy--that is the term the \namendment uses--in any one of the preceding 5 years. And then, of \ncourse, once an organization is a grantee, it is held to that same 5-\npercent limit as a condition of continuing to receive the grant.\n  So first of all, this is not a limitation on what a grant applicant \nmust be \n\n[[Page S 15514]]\nbound by once it gets a grant. This is much more than that. This is a \nlimitation on what an applicant for a grant can do in the 5 years prior \nto applying for a grant.\n  An organization may not even know that it wants to apply for a grant, \nlet us say, in 1995, but should it this year spend more than 5 percent \nof its money on what the Istook amendment calls political advocacy, \nthen it is precluded 5 years from now from applying for a grant, even \nthough it engaged in no political advocacy this year, next year, the \nyear after, or the year after that.\n  This amendment is not only applicable to the period of time during \nwhich the grantee is carrying out a grant, it applies for all practical \npurposes for all years whether or not an organization has a grant if it \nthinks that it might some year, 5 years down the road, want to apply \nfor a grant.\n  What is ``political advocacy''? The definition is so extreme that it \nis almost laughable if the stakes, namely, basic democratic principles, \nwere not so high. Political advocacy includes carrying on \n``propaganda''--that is the term that is used in the amendment--or \notherwise attempting to influence legislation or agency action. This, \nthe amendment says, includes but is not limited to contributions, \nendorsements, publicity, or similar activities.\n  So if the Food and Drug Administration were considering restricting \nthe availability of cigarettes for young people, the American Medical \nAssociation, which may have a grant or may even want to apply for a \ngrant in the next 5 years, could be precluded from using non-Government \nfunds, its own funds, to endorse that agency action. At a minimum, if \nit thought it might want to apply for grant in the next 5 years, if it \ndid not have one at the time, it would have to keep records of how much \nit spent if it made such endorsements and then regularly measure that \namount against its other political advocacy activity, assuming you \ncould figure out what political advocacy meant, and it would have to do \nthat to make sure its total expenditures do not go over the 5-percent \nlimit.\n  Political advocacy also includes participating in any judicial \nlitigation-- I do not know what litigation is other than in a judicial \nsetting, but that is the term the amendment uses--in any judicial \nlitigation or agency proceeding including as a friend of the court in \nwhich any Federal, State, or local government is involved. The \nexceptions to this sweeping provision are if the grantee is a \ndefendant, so you are allowed to defend yourself, or if the grantee is \nchallenging a Government decision or action directed specifically at \nthe powers, rights, or duties of the grantee or grant recipient.\n  OK, so now let us say you are the Mayo Clinic, and you receive a \nlarge Federal grant to conduct cancer or diabetes research. The city of \nRochester has developed a new master plan to rezone the entire city \nincluding the area around the clinic. You as the clinic are affected by \nthat plan and you want to challenge it, but it is not directed \nspecifically at the powers, rights, or duties of the Mayo Clinic. It is \na plan for the entire city of Rochester, so now you would be forced to \nchoose between continuing with the research grant or participating in \nthe debate over the master plan.\n  Political advocacy also includes--and this is where the amendment \ntakes another major leap in its extremism and its absurdity--\nallocating, disbursing, or contributing any money or in-kind support to \nany person or entity whose expenditure for political advocacy in the \nprevious fiscal year exceeded 15 percent of its total expenditures for \nthat year.\n  What does that mean? Presumably that every Federal grant recipient or \npotential applicant has to determine whether or not the business from \nwhich its purchasing services or products meets the 15-percent test.\n  So now if a Federal grantee or a potential grantee purchases a \ncomputer from IBM, that Federal grantee had better be sure that IBM is \nwithin the 15-percent limit, because otherwise that is an expenditure \nfor political advocacy and the grantee has to count the amount of the \npurchase toward its 5-percent limit.\n  Let us take another example. A child care facility which receives a \nFederal grant for a breakfast program uses its own non-Federal private \nfunds and hires an individual to do graphics for a campaign to promote \nhealthy breakfasts. The person they happen to pick is a part-time \nlobbyist at the State legislature for other persons and other \ninterests. The child care facility did not pick that person for that \nskill. They picked him for his ability to put together an attractive \npresentation for little children and for families. Under the Istook \namendment, we are going to hold that child care facility responsible \nfor determining whether or not that graphics person spends more than 15 \npercent of his expenditures on political advocacy. And if it does, the \nchild-care center has to include in its total of its expenditures that \namount of money.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, this is getting absolutely absurd. A potential \ngrantee, an applicant for a Federal grant, who thinks that it may apply \neven in the next 5 years, has to keep a record of every single purchase \nit makes from every company during that 5 years and make sure that no \ncompany from which it buys a computer or anything else has exceeded a \n15-percent expenditure limit using its own funds.\n  If you buy food for a clinic, you better make sure that the \nwholesaler from which you bought that food did not spend more than 15 \npercent of its own funds on political advocacy. This is Government gone \nmad. This is Government gone haywire. Nobody can keep these kinds of \nrecords and get certification from every person from whom they buy \nanything that that person did not spend more than 15 percent of its \nmoney on political advocacy.\n  This amendment does exactly what the opponents of lobbying and gift \nreform in the last Congress correctly said would be unacceptable: \ninterfering with the right of an organization to communicate \ninformation to its members.\n  The Istook amendment would treat as political advocacy, and therefore \nreportable and subject to its limits, all communications between a \ngrantee organization and any bona fide member of that organization that \nencourages the member to communicate with any government official on \nlegislation or agency action. Let me repeat that. The Istook amendment \nrequires grantees to report on an annual basis all of their \nexpenditures--again, we are talking about non-Federal funds--incurred \nin communicating to their members to encourage them to contact \nGovernment officials on legislation or agency policy action. Isn't that \nwhat killed lobbying reform last Congress and is not that exactly the \nissue the very proponents of this Istook amendment said would be so \noffensive? We struck any reference to grassroots lobbying from the \nlobbying reform bill this year in order to make progress, and here, \nsome Congressmen are threatening to shut down the entire Federal \nGovernment in order to pass a provision that requires organizations to \npublicly account for just how much they spend to do grassroots lobbying \non their own members, not only on persons outside their organization \nbut with their own members. Last year's provision did not go nearly \nthat far and many of these same House Members railed against that.\n  This is Alice in Wonderland material, made real by the fact that the \nsponsors have threatened to shut down Government, if they don't get \ntheir way.\n  We are talking here about making the Red Cross report each year how \nmuch it spends of non-Federal funds should it ask its members to urge \nCongress to pass stronger legislation to protect the country's blood \nsupply. We are talking about making the Girl Scouts of America report \neach year how much they spend when they ask their members to write to \nthe FCC on violence in television shows. We are talking about requiring \nMothers Against Drunk Driving to keep a record of all the expenses they \nincur in communicating with their members to fight for tougher drinking \nlaws in their states. And these organizations would have to keep these \nrecords and report these amounts even though they do not even meet the \ndefinition of a lobbying organization under the Senate-passed lobbying \ndisclosure bill.\n  Promoting and supporting this amendment is, alone, an unfortunate, \nunwise, and I believe deleterious position to take with respect to our \nbasic democratic principles. But elevating the passage of this \namendment to the position of importance that puts the \n\n[[Page S 15515]]\nentire Federal Government at risk is incomprehensible.\n  One day we will weary of threats to shut Government down--and as a \nbody rise up to defeat proposals supported by such threats. This \nproposal should also be defeated despite the threats, Mr. President, \nbecause the laws are already in place to protect any misuse of taxpayer \nmoneys with respect to lobbying by tax-exempt organizations. The Senate \nshould not give in to this thoroughly misguided piece of legislation; \nour conferees should hold fast.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nPennsylvania [Mr. Specter] is recognized to speak for up to 30 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, 1 year ago we Republicans won control of \nthe Congress based on commitments to balance the budget, reduce the \nsize of Government, and lower taxes. These commitments remain our basic \ngoals. I have sought recognition this morning to speak on the \nreconciliation bill which will be coming up tomorrow.\n  I know that tomorrow time will be very precious, so I want to express \nsome of my thoughts at this time. These reservations which I am about \nto discuss have been expressed to the leadership. There was difficulty \nin even coming to preliminary conclusions because much of the material \nhad not been made available until very recently, some of the tables on \nthe tax reductions only coming as late as yesterday.\n  As we address the reconciliation process in the next few days, I ask \nmy colleagues to reconsider certain aspects of the proposed \nlegislation. As much as I favor tax relief for Americans, I question \ntax cuts that may jeopardize our No. 1 priority, which is balancing the \nFederal budget.\n  As much as I want to reduce the size of Government, I question \nspending cuts directed so disproportionately against the elderly, the \nyoung and the infirm. And on a political basis, I suggest to my \nRepublican colleagues that we all rethink support for a combination of \ntax cuts and spending cuts that may lead to the perception of the \nRepublican Party as the party of wealth, power and privilege, and not \nthe party of ordinary American working families.\n  Last fall we Republicans swept to historic victories in both Houses \nbased on our responsiveness to the people's demand for less, not more \nGovernment, for a Government that lives within its means, and for a \nreduction of the tax burden on ordinary Americans.\n  I am fearful, Mr. President, that we will forfeit that political high \nground in an instant if we adopt a budget that not only fails to end \nthe deficit, but that, either in appearance or in fact, makes the least \naffluent Americans bear the heaviest burdens while giving most of the \ntax benefit to the most affluent among us.\n  I am concerned, Mr. President, that these tax cuts threaten a \nbalanced budget, which is by far the most critical aspect of the \nelectoral mandate of 1994. Many of us have been working for a balanced \nbudget for many years. And I have been making that effort for all of my \n15 years in the Senate. But until this year, I have never seen \nlegislation passed that actually had a likelihood of achieving that \ngoal.\n  Finally, after years of shadowboxing, after years of spending \nrestraint initiatives that were mere smoke and mirrors, not really \nsubstance, this Congress has been willing to make the painful changes \nnecessary to achieve a balanced budget. We are moving toward real \nreform of entitlements, thereby for the first time giving us a real \nability to restrain future spending in those programs. Painful though \nthese actions are, we are willing to make these sacrifices in the name \nof future generations. And we do that in order to achieve a real \nbalanced budget within the 7-year glidepath.\n  The Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health, and Human \nServices, which I chair, and where the distinguished Senator from Iowa, \nSenator Harkin, serves as ranking member, has made very, very painful \ncuts on a budget which had exceeded $70 billion in discretionary \nspending. These reductions totalled almost $8 billion, down to somewhat \nmore than $62 billion in spending.\n  I would suggest to you, Mr. President, that we made these cuts with a \nscalpel and not a meat ax. But we had to pare back critical programs, \ndifficult as it was, such as compensatory education for the \ndisadvantaged, substance abuse treatment and prevention, drug-free \nschools, dislocated worker training--and we did so, I believe, in a way \nthat left intact the basic safety net that protects America's neediest \nand most disadvantaged--and with a special concern for children and the \nelderly.\n  We were able to make these difficult spending cuts because of our \ncommitment to a balanced Federal budget. But the current reconciliation \nbill may undercut that commitment while leaving those painful spending \ncuts in place. The largest spending cuts occur in the so-called \noutyears while many of the tax cuts occur at the outset. These savings \nmay materialize, but there is no guarantee that they will.\n  Estimates of rates of economic growth, inflation, tax revenue \ngeneration are only estimates, and estimates invariably become less \naccurate the further out in time they occur. The proposed \nreconciliation bill offers the certain tax cuts right now paid for by \nspending cuts later and anticipated savings. That sounds too much like \nthe approach which has put us in a predicament with almost a $5 \ntrillion national debt.\n  Mr. President, I am very concerned that these tax cuts are unfair or \nat least give the perception of unfairness. I express this concern \nbecause much of the pain of the spending cuts goes to the elderly, the \nyoung, and the infirm while allowing tax cuts for corporate America and \nthose in higher brackets.\n  I question, Mr. President, cuts in student aid, job training, low-\nincome energy assistance, workplace safety, Head Start, childhood \nimmunization, and mother and child health programs while we give \ncorporate tax breaks such as accelerated depreciation for convenience \nstores and expanded equipment depreciation.\n  I am concerned, Mr. President, as I take a look at the cuts in \nMedicare and Medicaid. This is a subject that was highly controversial, \nleading many Republicans from my neighboring State of New Jersey to \nvote against the Medicare Program in the House of Representatives. I \npoint specifically to Medicare part A disproportionate share payments \nrelating to extra payments to hospitals that serve a high proportion of \npoor patients. This program is reduced by some $4.5 billion over 7 \nyears. This change impacts very, very heavily on many of the hospitals \nin my State of Pennsylvania and on many training institutions across \nthe country.\n  And I point further to the Medicare part A indirect medical education \npayments, which are financial adjustments to teaching hospitals to \ncover excess costs due to training. This program is reduced by some $9 \nbillion. I also point to the change in the index for future payments to \nhospital providers, which will be reduced by some $36 billion over the \ncourse of 7 years.\n  While it is admitted that Medicare changes are necessary in order to \nremain solvent and that we have to have a handle on Medicare, there are \nmany questions being raised by senior citizens and the elderly all over \nAmerica today as to the fairness of these reductions. I specify that \nthey are not cuts, but we are trying to get a handle on Medicare so \nthat as costs increase, we can reduce the rate of increase. But there \nare many questions legitimately being raised about these budget \nconsiderations on Medicare.\n  On Medicaid, there is a change from entitlements to block grants. We \nhave bitten the tough bullet on changing the block grants on welfare \npayments, and we are in the process of making real reforms in the \nentitlement programs.\n  There is a particular concern as to what will happen in many of the \nStates. There was a lead article in the New York Times in the last few \ndays about what is happening and what may happen further. The State \nillustrated was Mississippi. A particular concern of my State, \nPennsylvania, is the formula for the allocation of Medicaid funds under \na block grant, with some \n\n[[Page S 15516]]\nof the pending legislation hitting Pennsylvania very, very hard.\n  Mr. President, it is a herculean effort to rein in entitlements and \nbalance the budget under the best of circumstances in a way that will \nbe accepted as fair. I believe the American people are prepared to \ntighten their belts to balance the budget, so long as the sacrifices \nare fair and equitable.\n  We consistently hear constituents urge spending cuts except for their \nown pet projects. But leadership calls for the Congress to take the \npolitical risks on those hard votes to cut popular programs for the \nfuture economic stability of the country. It simply may be too much to \ncut about $1.4 trillion, and that is an approximation--$200 billion a \nyear over 7 years--plus another $245 billion for tax cuts, which at \nleast gives the appearance of unfairness.\n  I further suggest that the reconciliation bill may well be bad \npolitics as well as bad public policy. To balance the budget and reform \nentitlements are tough under any circumstance, but they are even more \ndifficult along with the tax cuts and corporate benefits.\n  In the wake of Congress' proposed tax cuts, the lead story in the \nSunday Philadelphia Inquirer of October 15, 1995, headlined, in the \nupper right hand corner: ``Bearing the Brunt of GOP Cutbacks, Low-\nIncome Families Would Lose Billions in Benefits. Tax Cuts Would Benefit \nthe Affluent.''\n  That story then details the cuts in popular programs. It is \nespecially difficult, Mr. President, I suggest, to justify curtailments \nin the earned income tax credit at the same time the tax cuts are going \nto Americans in higher brackets.\n  The earned income tax credit was expanded in 1986 under President \nReagan and again in 1990 under President Bush. President Reagan called \nthe program the best antipoverty, the best pro-family, the best job \ncreation measure to come out of the Congress.\n  What is the measure of fairness in eliminating facets of the earned \nincome tax credit at the same time that we are adding tax breaks for \nthose in higher brackets?\n  The specifics on this, frankly, have been difficult to obtain, but \nthe Senate reconciliation bill would reduce funds for the earned income \ntax credit by some $43.2 billion, which is substantially more than the \nHouse reduction of some $23.2 billion over 7 years.\n  The Senate bill would eliminate the earned income tax credit for \ntaxpayers without children, who now receive a limited credit up to \n$324. The changes made in the Senate bill on the earned income tax \ncredit tighten up eligibility and expand the income included for \nphaseout purposes.\n  Further, the credit would be entirely phased out for individuals with \none child with income over $23,730. The Senate proposal would also \nfreeze the credit at 36 percent rather than allowing it to rise up to \n40 percent under current law.\n  Mr. President, the reconciliation bill contains many credits which I \nlike very much. I especially like the $500 tax credit per child, but is \nthere not a question as to extending that tax break to individuals in \nthe $75,000 bracket or $110,000 for married couples, at a time when we \nare curtailing the earned income tax credit for people who earn \n$23,730?\n  There is no doubt about the justification for giving a tax credit for \nfamilies in middle-income America, but should we be doing it at the \nsame time when the taxes are being increased or the earned income tax \ncredit is being reduced for people in much lower brackets?\n  This legislation, the reconciliation bill, contains an increase on \nIRA's, independent retirement accounts, and that is a measure that I \nhave long supported and fought for. I recall in 1986 we had a vote, 51 \nto 48, eliminating the IRA's. I very strongly opposed the elimination \nof the IRA's. But is it sound public policy to be increasing IRA \navailability for singles who earn up to $85,000 and for families \nearning up to $100,000, from the current limits of $25,000 and $40,000, \nat a time when we put limitations on the earned income tax credit?\n  I do not have absolute answers to these questions, but I think they \ndeserve very, very careful thought.\n  Mr. President, these political problems have been candidly noted by \nmany of our colleagues in the U.S. Senate. Our distinguished majority \nleader on a Sunday talk show a few weeks ago raised a question about \nhaving these tax cuts and quoted a number of Republican members on the \nSenate Finance Committee, and then, in the wake of objections, \nretreated from the questioning of these tax cuts.\n  I believe that if there were a secret ballot among the 53 \nRepublicans, many would vote against the tax cuts in the context of \nbalancing the budget and in the context of difficulties for others in \nlower brackets. One of my colleagues estimated that as many as 20 of \nour Republican Senators might oppose the tax cuts if we were to have a \nsecret ballot.\n  I raise these issues in the context of having debate at the start of \nthis bill, again saying that I do not have absolute answers but think \nthat these issues have to be thought through very, very carefully.\n  Mr. President, I suggest that it is time to face the facts that the \nEmperor, as well as the poor, may well be wearing no clothes if the \nreconciliation bill passes in its present form.\n  I remind my colleagues about the political consequences back in 1986. \nMany who are now in the Senate, especially on the Republican side, were \nnot here in 1986 when we faced a question about cutting Social Security \nbenefits. Those benefits were cut. Later in 1986, Republicans lost \ncontrol of the Senate. Those who voted in favor of the Social Security \ntax cuts were defeated at the polls.\n  I think that is something that has to be remembered, especially \nsince, even though the Social Security tax cuts passed the Senate, they \ndid not come into law. They ultimately were abandoned.\n  Many of the items we are going to be voting on here, as we seek to \npass this reconciliation bill, are conceded not to be in final form--\nthat this is a test run and that this reconciliation bill is highly \nlikely to be vetoed by the President. He already announced his \nintention. Then it is going to come back for further consideration, \nagain raising the question about making these votes which are so \npolitically perilous and which really may not have any effect at all.\n  Mr. President, I further suggest that we can have all of the \nadvantages in the reconciliation bill in terms of tax breaks for \nmiddle-income Americans and more. We can have not just a reduction in \nthe capital gains rate but an elimination of the capital gains tax, and \nan elimination of tax on dividends if we move to the flat tax, which I \nintroduced earlier this year, Senate bill 488.\n  I take second place to no one in this body when it comes to \nsupporting tax relief for all Americans. But real tax relief cannot \ncome from tinkering at the margins, by adding a new break here or a new \nloophole there. Breaks and loopholes are part of the problem, not the \nsolution. The solution to tax oppressiveness is a completely new method \nof income taxation, a method based on the fundamental principles of \nfairness, simplicity, and growth. That solution, Mr. President, is the \nflat tax.\n  Our current Internal Revenue System is a mammoth bureaucracy \nrequiring Americans to spend billions of hours each year to complete \ntheir tax forms and hundreds of billions of dollars in compliance, \nestimated as high as $595 billion by Fortune magazine. It is reliably \nestimated that some 5.4 billion hours annually are spent by Americans \non tax compliance.\n  Worse, our tax system is fundamentally antigrowth, diverting \notherwise productive resources to compliance costs, promoting economic \ndecisions based on tax avoidance rather than productivity, and \ndiscouraging savings and investment by the double taxation of dividends \nand capital gains.\n  My flat-tax proposal, Senate bill 488, was introduced in March of \nthis year. It would scrap our current Tax Code and replace it with a \nsimple 20 percent rate, keeping only two deductions--interest on home \nmortgages up to $100,000 in borrowing, and charitable deductions up to \n$2,500.\n  Individuals would be taxed at the 20 percent rate on all income from \nwages, pensions, and salaries. They would not pay tax on interest or \nsavings and dividends because those would be taxed at the source. They \nwould also not pay any tax on capital gains because the answer to \nencouraging investment and \n\n[[Page S 15517]]\ngrowth is not simply to reduce capital gains tax but to eliminate it \nentirely.\n  Under my bill, a family of four earning up to $25,500 would pay no \ntax. Low- and middle-income Americans would benefit from my tax cut \nbecause millionaires, who often pay little or no tax because of the \nmyriad loopholes and shelters in the Tax Code, would have to pay tax at \nthe 20 percent rate because these loopholes and shelters would be \neliminated. It has been shown that under our current tax system, more \nthan half of all personal income in the United States, or some $2.6 out \nof $5 trillion, escapes taxation entirely. A fair tax system, like my \nflat-tax proposal, taxes all income equally--and just once.\n  Businesses would also be taxed at a flat rate of 20 percent. My plan \nwould eliminate the intricate scheme of depreciation schedules, \ndeductions, credits, and other complexities that complicate business \nfiling, and that in some cases permit tax evasion. Businesses would \nonly deduct wages, direct expenses, and purchases. Businesses would be \nallowed to expense 100 percent of the cost of capital formation, \nincluding purchases of capital equipment, structures, and land, and to \ndo so in the year in which the investments are made. Although the \nelimination of most deductions means that business taxes will increase \nin the aggregate--thus assuring that investment income is fully taxed \nbefore it is paid out--that extra cost to business will be offset by \nthe elimination of their enormous tax compliance costs.\n\n  For both businesses and individuals, the hours and hours of tax-\nrelated recordkeeping, the litany of schedules, the libraries full of \nregulations and decisions, would be replaced by a postcard sized form \nthat almost all Americans and business owners could complete in about \n15 minutes.\n  But the most important reason for adopting a flat-tax system is in \nits potential to foster economic growth and job creation. With the \nelimination of taxation on interest, dividends, and capital gains, the \npool of capital available for investment will grow dramatically. \nConservative economic projections are that interest rates will come \ndown two full points, and that renewed economic activity will add $2 \ntrillion to the gross national product over 7 years--an additional \n$7,000 for every man, woman, and child in America.\n  My tax proposal has been carefully calculated to be revenue neutral, \nso that it will not add one penny to the national debt. My flat tax is \nbased on the analyses done over a period of years by highly respected \neconomic professors, Robert Hall and Alvin Rabushka, of Stanford's \nHoover Institute. Hall and Rabushka's calculations show a national flat \ntax with no deductions and a 19 percent rate matching current tax \nrevenues. My bill deviates from the Hall-Rabushka model by its \nretention of limited deductions for home mortgage interest on up to \n$100,000 of borrowing and charitable contributions up to $2,500. While \nthese modifications limit the purity of the flat-tax principle, I \nbelieve that these deductions are so ingrained in the financial \nplanning of American families that they should be retained as a matter \nof fairness. Based on computations provided by the Joint Tax Committee, \nthe additional 1 percent in my flat-tax proposal above the Hall-\nRabushka proposal--a 20 percent rate instead of 19 percent--will fully \ncover the cost of these deductions.\n  In fact, there is every reason to believe that as the growth aspects \nof flat taxation take hold, and the economy expands, tax revenues will \nrise significantly--which will permit either a further lowering of tax \nrates or actual reduction in the national debt. However, since those \nsavings are speculative, I have not included them in my calculations to \nset revenue neutral, deficit neutral rate.\n  I am obviously reluctant to vote against legislation that offers \nneeded tax relief to some Americans. But we ought not be tinkering at \nthe margins where some Americans benefit and others don't. Under a flat \ntax such as I have proposed, everyone benefits and everyone pays their \nfair share.\n  The current tax breaks are, at best, a Band-Aid. A flat tax is a cure \nfor the cancer which retards the productivity of the American economic \nengine. The relevant committees have had hearings on the flat tax and \nare in a position to act on these proposals.\n  Mr. President, I make these comments because of my concern that the \npending reconciliation bill may be going too far at a time when our \nprimary objective is to balance the budget, and that Americans are \nprepared for those cuts if they are fair and if they are just.\n  At a time when we are tightening our belts, I question the wisdom of \nthe additional tax cuts to people who are in much higher brackets and \nto corporate tax breaks at this particular time.\n  Again, I say I am not in concrete on this matter, but I urge my \ncolleagues to carefully consider this matter before we move to the \nvoting state and consideration of final passage of the reconciliation \nbill.\n  The Republican leadership has heretofore been advised of my concerns \nand reservations. While it is late in the process, there is still time \nto revise the reconciliation bill in the interest of fairness and sound \ntax policy. It is my hope that modifications can be made so that I and \na broad coalition of Members can support this landmark legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under a previous order, the Senator from \nArkansas, Senator Pryor, is recognized for up to 15 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/24/senate-section/article/S15515-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15517-S15520]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEDICARE MISINFORMATION AD CAMPAIGN\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, this morning I rise today to sound an \nalarm, an alarm about a $1 million television advertising campaign that \nsupports the Republican plan to cut Medicare and is currently airing \nall over the United States.\n  I am here to explain to my colleagues why this commercial does not \ntell the whole story and why the public needs to know more about the \norganization that is actually paying for this TV commercial that \nadvocates the Republican cuts in the Medicare program.\n  Mr. President, the organization paying for this television commercial \nis called the Seniors Coalition. We might not have heard a great deal \nabout the Seniors Coalition because it has not been around all that \nlong. It is an operation founded by Mr. Richard Viguerie.\n  The star of this ad is our colleague and good friend from Tennessee, \nSenator Bill Frist.\n  Let me make it clear at the start that I mean no disrespect to \nSenator Frist. I talked to him this morning, stating I was going to \nmake this statement, and that I was not questioning his integrity in \nany way.\n  In fact, I sincerely doubt our colleague, Senator Frist, is aware of \nthe information that I will share with my colleagues this morning.\n  The ad, Mr. President, which features Senator Frist talking about the \nRepublican plan to cut Medicare, is not paid for by the Republican \nParty but by the Seniors Coalition.\n  First, some background on the Seniors Coalition. The Seniors \nCoalition is one of three so-called seniors organizations that have \nbeen working exclusively with the GOP leadership. It is working with \nthe GOP leadership to push and help organize and in some cases to fund \nactivities that support the Republican plan to cut Medicare by $270 \nbillion and to provide a $245 billion tax break--most of it or a lot of \nit, Mr. President, going to the wealthiest in our society.\n  Here we see a chart that includes the Seniors Coalition. We also see \n60-Plus here. And, we see United Seniors, or USA, here. These are all \nfounded by Mr. Viguerie, who has control of perhaps some of the most \nsophisticated mailing lists in America.\n  The Coalition to Save Medicare was founded to support the House \nRepublican plan to cut Medicare. As one columnist has recently put it, \nthe Coalition to Save Medicare is ``deliriously misnamed,'' and is a \n``coalition of huge corporations and insurance companies out to loot \nMedicare to pay for corporate tax breaks.''\n  In fact, Mr. President, the Seniors Coalition, United Seniors \nAssociation, and 60-Plus, are all 501(C)(4) organizations. They pay no \ntaxes whatsoever. They have use of a nonprofit mailing permit. They are \nbeing subsidized by the American taxpayer.\n  The other coalition, which is the Coalition for America's Future--and \nhere is a letter of September 22--was created by the majority party, by \nthe Republican leadership, to apply pressure \n\n[[Page S 15518]]\nduring efforts to push the Contract With America, including tax breaks \nfor the wealthy, through the House of Representatives.\n  Let us look at this letter of September 22. This letter is addressed \nto me:\n\n       On behalf of the more than 7 million families, senior \n     citizens and large and small businesses of the Coalition for \n     America's Future, we are writing to urge you to make good on \n     the promise of the budget resolution to provide $245 billion \n     in tax cuts over the next 7 years.\n\n  One of the so-called members of the Coalition for America's Future is \nthe National Committee To Preserve Social Security and Medicare. They \nare listed along with the Seniors Coalition, United Seniors \nAssociation, and 60-Plus as seniors organizations who are members and \nwho support the Coalition's agenda.\n  Mr. President, just this morning I received a letter from the \nNational Committee to Preserve Social Security, and I will read part of \nit now:\n\n       Regrettably, that letter lists our organization as a member \n     of this Coalition and falsely implies our support for its \n     position in favor of the $245 billion tax cut package \n     contained in the budget reconciliation bill.\n\n  Martha McSteen concludes by saying:\n\n       I want to emphasize in the strongest possible terms that \n     the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and \n     Medicare did not endorse this letter or approve of the use of \n     our organization's name in connection with this letter.\n\n  At this point, I would like to explain how these groups were founded, \nhow they operate and exactly who they are.\n  First, letters that will grab the attention of seniors, usually \nthrough scare tactics, are sent to thousands of seniors across America. \nThese letters make senior citizens think that their Medicare is in \njeopardy, that it is in danger, and that what they need to do \nimmediately is to send their money in to one of the three groups \nfounded by Mr. Viguerie. Here is what happens.\n  The letter is sent by one of these groups to Mr. or Mrs. Smith, \nAnytown, USA. Then the older American receives this letter, writes a \ncheck out of their savings account to either the Seniors Coalition, \nUnited Seniors Association, or 60-Plus. Then the dollars go, first--\nwhere? To Mr. Viguerie. We have the contract for Mr. Viguerie that we \nwill show in a few moments, that shows that Mr. Viguerie gets up to 50 \npercent, possibly one-half of all of these checks sent in by mail by \nthe senior citizens to United Seniors Association. Some of the \nremaining money is used to generate some more mail to send out to scare \nthe seniors.\n  These groups also use some of the remaining money to lobby the \nCongress. For example, Seniors Coalition had enough money left over to \nrun TV commercials like we are seeing running in many parts of America \ntoday. This ad campaign is telling seniors that the Medicare cuts are \nnecessary to save the Medicare system.\n  Last year, in 1994, these same groups were doing the exact opposite. \nThey were scaring seniors by telling them that President Clinton was \ncutting $124 billion out of Medicare as part of his health care reform \nproposal. Here is one letter dated March 28, 1994 from the same \norganization, the Seniors Coalition, and it was sent out to thousands \nof seniors all over the country, requesting contributions. In the body \nof the letter the Seniors Coalition states:\n\n       Now President Clinton wants to cut an additional $124 \n     billion. This is all part of his plan to have the Government \n     take over health care.\n\n  Well, they reversed themselves now, 2 years later, because of the \nContract With America, because of their desire to cut $270 billion out \nof the Medicare proposal, because they want to give a $245 billion tax \nbreak for the wealthy, and because now they are all in the league with \nthe Republican leadership.\n  This year, however, the same groups are scaring seniors by telling \nthe seniors if the Republican plan to save Medicare is not adopted, \nthey might lose their Medicare benefits. What the letters do not show \nis that the Seniors Coalition strongly supports the Republican plans to \ncut Medicare by $270 billion and to provide a $245 billion tax break, a \ngreat portion going to the wealthiest in America.\n  Second, many seniors are dipping into their savings--from their piggy \nbanks, like the one shown here--to send so-called contributions to \nthese three groups, thinking the money would be used to lobby Congress \nto save their Medicare Program. But what these seniors are not told and \nwhat they do not know--and they would have no reason to know--is that \ntheir dollars are being used, not to save Medicare, but to cut \nMedicare. A senior sends his check in to one of these groups, and their \nown money is being used against them, to cut Medicare benefits. This is \na fraud. It is a sham.\n  And, after collecting savings from seniors, the groups spend a lot of \nit, up to 50 percent in the case of the United Seniors Organization, to \npay direct-mail companies. Here we have the direct-mail contract \nbetween United Seniors Association and Mr. Viguerie. As part of the \ncontract, Mr. Viguerie takes up to one-half of all of the dollars that \nare sent into USA. And Mr. Viguerie also does the direct mail for \nanother of these groups called 60-Plus.\n  Experts have taken a look at this contract between Mr. Viguerie and \n60-Plus. In fact, they have taken a very close look at this contract. \nThese experts have all concluded that the provisions in Mr. Viguerie's \ncontract, when added up, indicate that in fact he controls as much as \n70 percent of the so-called ``not-for-profit'' 60-Plus. If this is \ntrue, what it means is that the American people, through tax \nexemptions--because it is a nonprofit organization--and postal \nnonprofit permits, are subsidizing a private fundraiser's operations. \nIn these days of budget cutting, this sort of thing must be stopped.\n  Mr. President, I think this is an absolute outrage. In fact, it is my \nunderstanding the Postal Service is now investigating some of these \nissues. I hope they will pursue that investigation to its conclusion.\n  The money that remains after the direct mail people get their cut is \nused to send out more scare letters to seniors and to support the \nRepublican plans to cut Medicare by $270 billion. Once again, the \nmessage is clear: Medicare is growing broke. Send us your money, and we \nwill save it.\n  Well, seniors are sending in their money. And what they are doing \nwith the seniors' money is it is used to cut, not to save, Medicare.\n  As I have stated, documents make it very clear that these groups are \nactively supporting the Republican plans to cut Medicare by $270 \nbillion and to provide a $245 billion tax break, mostly for the \nwealthy. The ironic thing is that this is not what their members truly \nwant.\n  This summer I received a petition from the United Seniors \nAssociation, one of Mr. Viguerie's groups, and they had on this \npetition the names of almost 300 Arkansans listed as ``members.'' I \nthought something looked strange about this petition, so I instructed \nmy staff during the August break to sit there and call the people on \nthis list, on this petition, and simply ask a very few basic questions. \nWhat we learned was most educational. It made me realize that their \n``members'' do not necessarily know that they are members. They do not \nunderstand what these groups support, nor do they understand that their \nnames are being used to lobby to cut their Medicare benefits.\n  This chart also shows the results of a phone survey of these \nArkansans listed as USA members. First, 53 percent of the seniors \nlisted on the USA petition that I received from Arkansas as members \nwere not actually members. They said they were not members of USA, \ndespite what the petition to me said.\n  Second, seniors listed in the USA petition to me expressed confusion \nabout the positions that USA takes; 83 percent said they did not know \nthat USA is working to rally support by the Republicans to cut Medicare \nby $270 billion.\n  These same seniors, on this list that was sent to my office as a \npetition, listed their opposition USA position's position on Medicare. \nAgain, as a matter of fact, on Medicare, 89 percent were in fact \nagainst cutting it by $270 billion. They oppose the very position of \nUSA that USA and the House majority claims they support.\n  In sum, the Republicans are saying that a lot of senior groups are \nsupporting these cuts in Medicare. These charts I have shown indicate \nwhat these senior groups actually are, how they are motivated, and with \nwhom they are associated. \n\n[[Page S 15519]]\n\n  It is not the case that these so-called seniors groups--Seniors \nCoalition, United Seniors Association, and 60-Plus--are fighting \nagainst these cuts in Medicare. In reality, two things are happening:\n  First, much of the money is going into the budgets of Richard \nViguerie and other direct mail vendors.\n  Second, the lobbying that these groups are doing amounts not to the \nsaving the Medicare Program but rather supporting the Republican \nMedicare cuts--even though these cuts could jeopardize the health care \nreceived by seniors.\n  Mr. President, now that we have basically looked at who the players \nare in this scheme to confuse and to manipulate older Americans, I \nwould like to talk about the million-dollar television campaign that \nthe Seniors Coalition is running across America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is advised that the time for \nmorning business is expired.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I see no other Senator seeking recognition, \nand I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed for an additional 6 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Could I ask \nunanimous consent that it would be 10 minutes, and that I could have 4 \nminutes after the Senator?\n  Mr. PRYOR. I would have no objection to that. I see my colleague from \nMinnesota. I did not see him.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I have no objection. I had 10 minutes \nreserved earlier this morning. But I know the leader wants to close off \nmorning business as early as possible because of the remaining debate \non the resolution S. 1322 dealing with the Israeli question.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, if I might, I would like to ask my friend \nfrom Minnesota, is my friend from Minnesota going to be one of the \nmanagers or one of those involved with the resolution or with the issue \nbefore the Senate?\n  Mr. GRAMS. No. I was going to go ahead with another statement. But I \nwill yield to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if I could perhaps clarify this, it has been \nmy understanding that we are operating under a unanimous-consent \nagreement which will cause the Senate to begin literally right now at \n11 o'clock on the debate on the Jerusalem Embassy bill, and that the \nvote would then occur at 11:40. Is that a correct understanding?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KYL. And the leader has asked that we begin that debate as soon \nas people are here to speak to it. Until the leader or Senator Helms \narrives, I would be acting in their stead. I see Senator Feinstein is \nhere. I do not know whether others may wish to, but I would suggest, in \norder to comply with the unanimous-consent agreement, that we wind up \nthe business we are on so we can get to that.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. KYL. Sure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas has the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I might say to my colleague from Arkansas that I \nwithdraw my request, and I think the only question is whether the \ncourtesy might be given to the Senator from Arkansas to finish his \nstatement. He only has a few more minutes to go.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I will try to be very brief. I will try to proceed if I \nmay.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas will proceed under a \nunanimous-consent request.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I ask unanimous consent that I may be allowed to proceed \nfor an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I think it would then be important to \nindicate to Members that the vote would occur at 11:45, and not at \n11:40.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would observe that under the \nunanimous consent, under the previous order, the vote will not occur at \n11:40 but at 11:45.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I want to sincerely thank my colleagues, \nand my colleague from Arizona, for allowing me to proceed.\n  Mr. President, as part of the million-dollar Seniors Coalition ad \ncampaign that we are talking about, the television commercials state \nthat in the Republican plan there are ``no cuts in benefits.'' The \nfacts are simple and indicate otherwise. With this particular \nRepublican plan that the ad campaign is supporting, $270 billion will \ntaken out of Medicare. The question is this: If this level of cuts \ncauses the only hospital to which we have access to close its doors, is \nthis not a cut in benefits? In rural America this is exactly what is \nabout to happen to hundreds of hospitals.\n  Second, if this level of cuts causes the nursing home or a doctor in \nour town to stop taking Medicare beneficiaries, is this not a cut in \nbenefits?\n  Third, if this gives incentives to home health care agencies and \nother providers to treat only healthy people, is this not a cut for \nolder and more frail citizens?\n  There is another claim expressed in this television commercial. This \ncommercial states that ``the Republican plan increases spending by \nnearly $2,000 per senior.''\n  The fact is, Mr. President, that the yearly per beneficiary growth \nrate allowed under this plan is 4.9 percent. It is, in fact, much below \nthe expected 7.1 percent growth rate in private sector health care \ncosts. Medicare's ability to respond to health care costs decreases \nwith the severity of these cuts.\n  Mr. President, the commercial further states that the Republican plan \ngives ``patients more choices.'' The fact is what good is offering \nchoices when only bad choices are offered? While seniors may have more \nhealth care plans to choose from, choosing the one that they can afford \nmay mean they must give up their choice of a physician.\n  And, finally, the proposed medical savings account threatens the \nviability of Medicare by allowing insurance companies to cherry-pick by \nmoving healthy, wealthy people out of the Medicare pool. The result \nwould be far higher costs to the beneficiaries who stay in Medicare.\n  Also, the Seniors Coalition television ad says nothing about the \nRepublicans using the cuts in Medicare to fund tax breaks for the \nwealthy. Why is this, Mr. President? It is perhaps because seniors who \nare actually paying for these commercials do not want the Medicare \nProgram to be cut to fund tax breaks. I think this is a legitimate \nquestion.\n  Mr. President, only $89 billion is actually needed to shore up \nMedicare's trust fund in the short term. Why then are our people not \nbeing told where the $181 billion cuts are actually going to go? Were \nthose same seniors who sent their dollars to Mr. Viguerie's groups told \nthis? Of course not. They have been used, they have been abused, and \nthey have been manipulated by a slick campaign of distortion and \nuntruths.\n  Mr. President, this is a situation where the seniors of America are \nbeing scared to death. They are sending their money in to basically, as \nthe letters call for, to protect Medicare.\n  Mr. President, this television advertising campaign cost the Seniors \nCoalition $1 million and is running in 19 markets across the country. I \nwant to make sure everyone knows that this campaign was paid for by the \nelderly, many of them poor and disabled, who sent in money thinking \nthat the Seniors Coalition was going to lobby the Congress to save \ntheir Medicare Program-- not cut it.\n  That is why my advice to seniors who are thinking about sending their \nhard-earned savings to these three so-called seniors groups is that \n``Contributions May Be Hazardous to Your Health.'' They should think \ntwice before writing a check to a Viguerie-founded group.\n  As I said earlier, I am here today to sound the alarm and expose this \nscam. I am concerned not only because some seniors are being taken \nadvantage of, but also because this scam is a cynical manipulation of \nour political process. It threatens the democratic principles under \nwhich we operate.\n  Americans who think they are getting involved with the political \nprocess are actually being financially exploited. Furthermore, they are \nnot being represented the way they think they are. This is a perfect \nexample of why so many people today have such little confidence in our \npolitical system.\n  Mr. President, older Americans--all Americans--can say ``no'' to this \ntype of cynical manipulation and misrepresentation.\n  Let me encourage every senior to get involved with reform of their \nMedicare \n\n[[Page S 15520]]\nProgram. They can write a letter to us in the Senate. They can call. \nThey can visit. They can fax. But, they do not need to send money to a \ndirect-mail vendor in order to be heard in the Congress.\n  Mr. President, before seniors send in $10, $20, or $30 to these so-\ncalled seniors groups they should consider the following. The most \neffective way only costs 32 cents. I will always place more importance \non a personal letter or a visit from one of my constituents than on a \nletter or preprinted card from a group that distorts their views.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \ncertain material, editorials, and extraneous matter that relate to this \nissue that I have discussed this morning.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    National Committee to Preserve\n\n\n                                 Social Security and Medicare,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 23, 1995.\n     Hon. David Pryor,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Senate Special Committee on Aging, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Pryor: Thank you for forwarding the September \n     22, 1995 letter of the Coalition for America's Future. \n     Regrettably, that letter lists our organization as a member \n     of this coalition and falsely implies our support for its \n     position in favor of the $245 billion tax cut package \n     contained in the budget reconciliation bill.\n       I want to emphasize in the strongest possible terms that \n     the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and \n     Medicare did not endorse this letter or approve of the use of \n     our organization's name in connection with this letter. We \n     had no advance knowledge that it was sent to Congress and \n     only learned of its existence today after you forwarded it to \n     us.\n       Our position in strong opposition to the pending budget \n     reconciliation bill is well known to Congress. It is the \n     position of this organization that the $270 billion cut in \n     Medicare to finance tax cuts, primarily for upper income \n     individuals and corporations, is unfair and unjustified. We \n     supported an alternative bill in the House which eliminated \n     the tax cuts and made only those cuts in Medicare necessary \n     to insure its solvency.\n       If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Martha A. McSteen,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Oct. 2, 1995]\n\n                  Fundraiser Already a Medicare Winner\n\n                (By Jack Anderson and Michael Binstein)\n\n       The battle to reform Medicare still has a long way to go on \n     Capitol Hill, but it's already clear who one of the biggest \n     winners will be: Richard Viguerie, the conservative king of \n     direct-mail fund-raising.\n       Three groups founded by Viguerie--the Seniors Coalition, \n     the United Seniors Association and 60-Plus--have teamed with \n     the House Republican leadership to gather public support for \n     its controversial Medicare changes. The Coalition to Save \n     Medicare was launched in July and includes the three seniors' \n     groups, in addition to leading industry groups such as the \n     National Association of Manufacturers and the Alliance for \n     Managed Care.\n       But according to documents uncovered by the Democratic \n     staff of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, much of the \n     money being raised by two of the three seniors' groups is \n     going straight to Viguerie's for-profit company.\n       Although the Seniors Coalition is no longer associated with \n     Viguerie, having severed its ties with him in 1993, the two \n     other groups remain dependent on Viguerie's fund-raising \n     prowess. United Seniors Association, for example, signed a \n     contract with Viguerie's for-profit direct-mail firm, \n     American Target Advertising, that calls for ATA to receive as \n     much as 50 percent of gross revenue from direct mail until \n     July 30, 1996. After that, ATA will get 25 percent of the \n     take.\n       In Viguerie's contact with 60-Plus, Viguerie & Associates--\n     later reorganized to become ATA--is slated to own 70 percent \n     of the income for the life of the mailing lists. According to \n     direct-mail experts, this means Viguerie ``owns'' 70 percent \n     of the organization, including its fund-raising operation. \n     Some direct-mail experts wonder if 60-Plus should be allowed \n     to retain its nonprofit status, which lets it mail \n     solicitations at taxpayer-subsidized rates.\n       ``I've never seen anything like this [contract],'' Sen. \n     David Pryor (Ark.) told our associate Jan Moller. Pryor, the \n     ranking Democrat on the Aging Committee, has been directing \n     the Hill investigation. ``I've never seen one this flagrant. \n     The worst part of it is the real deception. They're \n     collecting the dollars from the seniors and using those \n     dollars to reduce these programs that are so necessarily for \n     their quality of life.''\n       The Viguerie style of fund-raising is as familiar as it is \n     effective: It starts with a ``scare'' letter warning seniors \n     of the imminent collapse of Medicare unless something is \n     done. It ends with a request for money, often accompanied by \n     a petition to sign or some other device so respondents can \n     get their ``voice'' heard in Washington. Viguerie did not \n     respond to our telephone calls.\n       But when Aging Committee staff members called a sampling of \n     Arkansas seniors whose names appeared on a ``telegram'' sent \n     to Pryor's office by United Seniors Association, they got a \n     surprise: Less than 15 percent of the seniors said they \n     supported the Republican effort to cut Medicare spending by \n     $270 billion. And only 47 percent acknowledged being members \n     of the association.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. I thank the Chair.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. 1322, which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1322) to provide for the relocation of the \n     United States Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Kohl \nbe added as a cosponsor to the legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. I also ask unanimous consent that the time consumed as a \npart of this debate be subtracted from the time originally provided for \nSenator Byrd from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, might I ask unanimous consent to add \nmy name as an original cosponsor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, Senator Wellstone will be \nadded as an original cosponsor.\n  Mr. KYL. May I also ask unanimous consent that a letter received this \nmorning addressed to Senator Dole, Senator Moynihan, myself, and \nSenator Inouye from AIPAC be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                        AIPAC,\n\n                                                 October 24, 1995.\n       Dear Senators Dole, Moynihan, Kyl, and Inouye: We wish to \n     express our strong support for the Jerusalem Embassy \n     Relocation Act, as modified. It is historic and \n     unprecedented. For the first time, the Senate will have voted \n     on binding legislation to move our embassy to Jerusalem by a \n     date certain, May 31, 1999.\n       The waiver language contained in the bill is very tightly \n     drawn, allowing the President to waive the funding provision \n     only to protect US national security interest--a very high \n     standard to meet. Clearly, the Senate has indicated that it \n     does not expect this waiver to be exercised lightly, without \n     strong and serious justification. Our embassy belongs in the \n     capital of the State of Israel, just as it is in the \n     designated capital of every other country with which we have \n     diplomatic relations.\n       As celebrations continue marking the 3,000th anniversary of \n     King David's incorporation of Jerusalem as the capital of \n     Israel, we wish to thank you and your colleagues for bringing \n     this legislation to the floor. We look forward to its \n     overwhelming adoption by the Senate, and to the opening of \n     our embassy in Jerusalem.\n           Sincerely,\n     Steve Grossman,\n       President.\n     Neal M. Sher,\n       Executive Director.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I want particularly to commend and \nthank the Senator from Arizona as well as the majority leader, Senator \nLieberman, Senator Levin, and in particular Senator Lautenberg, because \nI believe that together we have effected an agreement which is \nsignificant and important.\n  Before I go on, I just want to say I am fully aware that the majority \nleader and the Senator from Arizona could have proceeded on this issue. \nClearly they have the votes. I think the fact that they negotiated with \nthose of us who had concerns about the way in \n\n[[Page S 15521]]\nwhich the resolution was worded is very significant and important, and \nI must say I believe that is why the American people sent us here and \nhow they expect us to work.\n  And so to the Senator from Arizona, I would like to offer my deepest \nrespect and thanks for the process which I think worked very well, and \nI think we now have a bill which can bring about the broadest and I \nhope even unanimous consensus of this body.\n  Madam President, I think we all must recognize that Jerusalem is a \ncity of vital importance to people all over the world--not just Israel, \nnot just Arab peoples, but people all over the world. Its layers of \nhistory and importance are symbolized best perhaps by the Temple Mount \nwhere the Dome of the Rock and the El-Aqsa Mosque, shrines holy to \nMoslems, sit atop the remains of the Temple of Solomon, while down \nbelow Jews worship at the Western Wall, the last remnant of that \ntemple.\n  One can stand in the Old City and hear simultaneously the Moslem call \nto prayer from the minarets of the mosques, the sounds of the Torah \nbeing read down by the Western Wall, and church bells ringing in the \ndistance. It is truly a special city, and Israel is fortunate to call \nJerusalem its capital.\n  The bill we will pass today, as modified by the leader and the \nSenator from Arizona, is a good bill, and I believe it is one the \nPresident can sign. We worked hard Friday and again yesterday to \nproduce a compromise that protects the President's prerogatives to \nconduct foreign policy. This was a crucial point because without these \nprotections there was a good chance that this bill would be vetoed, \nwhich would be a tragic outcome.\n  Under our compromise, the President would have to establish that it \nis in the national security interests of the United States to postpone \nestablishing the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem in 1999. This is a tough but \nfair standard for any President to meet. As I said yesterday, it is my \nbelief that if a successful conclusion to the Middle East peace process \ncould be imperiled by the implementation of this act, then the \nPresident would be able to invoke the waiver on national security \ngrounds. I am sure that many of my colleagues agree. But the inclusion \nof the waiver should not obscure the achievement reached by this bill.\n  For the first time ever, Congress will pass legislation that will \nmandate moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, and I believe the \nPresident will sign it. This represents a major advance in our cause of \nmoving the Embassy. And through this message we will send word that \nIsrael, like every country in the world, has the sovereign right to \ndesignate its capital and to have that capital recognized by the \nnations of the world.\n  I congratulate my colleagues on this achievement, and I look forward \nto it passing with overwhelming support.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the majority leader.\n  I might say to the majority leader that I will take just a few \nminutes. I actually rise to, first of all, thank the Senator from \nCalifornia and the Senator from Arizona and others for their fine work \non this measure. I believe that this is an extremely important step we \nare taking as we act on this resolution to move our Embassy in Israel \nto Jerusalem, and to condition certain State Department funding on the \nEmbassy's relocation under the specific timeline laid out in this bill. \nI rise in support of this legislation, and I am delighted to be a \ncosponsor of the compromise negotiated over the last few days.\n  Madam President, let me first talk about this issue personally, \nbecause the status of Jerusalem is important to me personally, and will \nalways be. As an American Jew, as a Senator from Minnesota, I believe \nJerusalem is and should remain the capital of Israel, an undivided \ncity. Never in my life have I had a more moving experience than when I \nwas in Jerusalem a few years ago, and could experience first-hand the \nmarvels of the city.\n  At the same time, I have had a concern--and I think the Senator from \nCalifornia, Senator Feinstein, and from New Jersey, Senator Lautenberg, \nand others shared this concern--that certainly we did not want to do \nanything inadvertent which was going to impede the Mid-East peace \nprocess. And for this reason I believe that the waiver provided for in \nthe substitute bill is extremely important. The administration has been \nclear about this concern all along. In fact, United States Ambassador \nto Israel Martin Indyk observed that moving forward on the original \nversion of the resolution could have placed tremendous strains on the \npeace process, and even caused its collapse. This measure now tries to \naddress that potential problem.\n  Our deep and abiding commitment to Israel is reflected in the bill. \nOur commitment to Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, with the United \nStates Embassy there, is again strongly and clearly stated. At the same \ntime, the clear commitment to Jerusalem as a city for all peoples is \nthere. This was the most sensitive of all issues in the peace process, \nagreed to be put off by the parties, in the Declaration of Principles, \nto final-status negotiations. I think that with this provision we now \nhave in this bill something which I would hope all of us can support.\n  The initial formulation in the bill, which talked about the \nimportance of Jerusalem as the capital, which talked about our locating \nour Embassy there, I supported. When we began to talk about this in \nterms of specific timelines, the concern I had was the effect this \ncould have on ongoing negotiations. Those concerns have now been \naddressed in this most recent version.\n  Mr. President, passage of this resolution would be simply another \nindication of the deep and strong support for Israel in this body. That \nis critical, I think, because our support for Israel must remain strong \nand steadfast in this difficult period. Maintaining the security of the \nState of Israel, our good friend and strategic ally, must remain \nparamount. We must continue to work actively to help her achieve and \nmaintain peace with her neighbors. This requires maintaining adequate \nforeign assistance to Israel designed to help her resettle refugees, \nmake key economic reforms, and encourage peaceful economic development. \nStrengthening and building upon historic gains in the peace process, \nand making sure that the risks which have already been taken for peace \nwere not taken in vain, must be our twin goals.\n  I think we now have the strong language necessary to accomplish the \ngoal of this resolution. At the same time, we have the waiver built in \nto give the President appropriate flexibility. I think that now this \nversion of the bill represents the best of people here in the Senate \ncoming together, and working out an agreement which we can all proudly \nsupport. I thank my colleagues for their work. I am proud to support \nthis. And I did ask earlier that my name be included as an original \ncosponsor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I support the pending legislation to \nmove the United States Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem because I \nbelieve that our Embassy should be located in the capital of Israel, \nwhich is the custom for all our other Embassies.\n  I have long supported this proposition, Madam President. A bill was \nintroduced back on October 1, 1983, Senate bill 2031, which I \ncosponsored. Back on March 26, 1990, Senate Concurrent Resolution 106 \nwas submitted. Again, I was a cosponsor of that measure. I have \ncosponsored the pending legislation.\n  I do have some concerns, Madam President, as to whether such \nlegislation would be an impediment to the peace process, but on balance \nI think it would not, especially as the legislation has been worked out \ngiving a Presidential discretionary period to expand the time when the \nEmbassy would be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\n  I believe that basically this is a decision which ought to be made by \nthe U.S. Government, and it is entirely appropriate for the legislation \nto come from the U.S. Senate and for us to take a stand on this matter.\n  Madam President, today is an auspicious moment for me and many here \nin the Senate. We are taking action by the passage of S. 1322 to call \nagain on the President of the United States to move the United States \nEmbassy to its rightful location in the city of Jerusalem, the capital \nof Israel. This is a welcome moment.\n\n[[Page S 15522]]\n\n  I have supported this action since I came to the Senate. I first \ncosponsored a resolution on this issue introduced on October 1, 1983. \nThat resolution (S. 2031) was cosponsored by 50 Senators. Now, some 15 \nyears later, it is my hope that with the momentum of the peace process, \nthe message of the cosponsors to this bill will resonate sufficiently \nto move the administration to action on this.\n  On March 26, 1990, Senate Concurrent Resolution 106 was submitted and \nwas subsequently passed calling for the move of the Embassy to \nJerusalem. Again, the Congress acted on this subject through its recent \ncorrespondence on February 24, 1995 in its letter to Secretary of State \nWarren Christopher signed by 93 Senators.\n  During the August recess, I traveled to Israel as well as other \ncountries. On September 28, I stated here on the Senate floor my \nimpressions of the challenges facing American foreign policy in the \nnear future. It was during that travel that I was able to speak \ndirectly with the President of Israel, Ezer Weitzman, Prime Minister \nYitzhak Rabin, the leader of the opposition party Mr. Benjamin \nNetanyahu, as well as Chairman of the Palestine Liberation \nOrganization, Mr. Arafat and significant Palestinian personalities now \nengaged in attempting to fashion a means to live side by side, Israelis \nwith Palestinians. Many times during these conversations, we spoke of \nJerusalem and the future. All of us were aware of the importance of \nJerusalem to the future of the region.\n  Tomorrow, Members of Congress and their guests will convene in the \nCapitol Rotunda to celebrate the Inaugural ceremony for Jerusalem \n3,000, a 15 month long celebration commemorating 3,000 years since the \nestablishment of Jerusalem as the capital city of Israel by King David. \nI hope to be in attendance at this ceremony.\n  The action we take today is consonant with the observance of the \nceremony as well as with the policy we have around the world in every \ncountry we recognize. The United States today locates its embassies, \naround the globe, in the city designated by the respective country as \nits capital. It is long overdue that this is our action in Israel. It \nis most appropriate that, as we move toward the period when both sides \nin the conflict are scheduled to move into negotiations over a \npermanent resolution, that the commitment to a date certain be made for \nthe opening of our embassy.\n  We have been, and continue to be, the catalyst in bringing the \nparties to resolution; it is my hope that our action in the Senate \ntoday will be accepted and acted upon by President Clinton and that no \nfurther roadblocks will be put up which would impede the opening of the \nEmbassy in Jerusalem on May 31, 1999, as provided for in this \nlegislation.\n  I think it is very, very important that Jerusalem remain undivided, \nand I think the expression by the U.S. Congress putting into law the \ntimetable for moving our Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem is entirely \nappropriate, and accordingly I support that legislation. I yield the \nfloor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/24/senate-section/article/S15520-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15522-S15535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PROTECT THE PEACE PROCESS\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, this bill, which would mandate a move of \nthe U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem by May 31, 1999, may be \npopular with a very vocal segment of the United States population, but \nit represents precarious foreign policy for the United States as a \nwhole. The United States has played a central role in carrying forward \nthe very difficult and sensitive negotiations that will, hopefully, \nbring a lasting peace to Israel and the Middle East. It ill behooves us \nnow to undermine what is arguably the single most sensitive issue of \nthe negotiations, that of the status of the holy city of Jerusalem, by \nimpetuously acting to side with one party to the negotiations. If the \nUnited States is to be credible as a facilitator of the peace process, \nit must act with fairness and impartiality.\n  Proponents of this legislation argue that negotiations on the final \nstatus of Jerusalem are to be complete by May, 1999, so that this bill \nis compatible with the timetable of the peace process. But this \npresupposes the outcome of the negotiations, which do not even begin \nuntil next May. This may be exactly what the proponents desire. If it \nis ``imperative to establish now the U.S. conviction that realistic \nnegotiations must be premised on the principle that Jerusalem is the \ncapital of Israel and must remain united,'' as an October 20, 1995 \nmailing from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) \nasserts, then what is left to negotiate at all? Acting in advance of \nthe negotiations undermines the incentive for the Palestinians, who \nalso have political and religious claims to the city, to participate in \nthe talks.\n  United States support for Israel is well known. Israel and the United \nStates have close military and diplomatic ties. The United States \nprovides more economic aid and military assistance to Israel than to \nany other single state. Moving the United States Embassy from its \ncurrent location in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem at this time is not necessary \nto help shore up Israeli support for the peace process. It can wait and \nlet the ground breaking in 1999 serve as a visible signal of the \nsuccess of the peace negotiations, should the outcome be as expected. \nNot moving the Embassy at this time is, in my view, probably more \nimportant to help shore up the willingness of the Palestinians to \ncontinue along this rocky path to peace. Let the ground breaking for a \nnew U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem in 1999 be a visible sign of U.S. support \nfor the final outcome of the negotiations, if that is the result, \nrather than a continuing reminder to them that the negotiations were \nrigged from the outset.\n  Jerusalem is an ancient city, considered holy by three of the world's \nreligions, Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. There is no more volatile \nmixture in the world than religion and politics, and Jerusalem has \nsuffered the devastating effects over the centuries as wars, \noccupations, and divisions have forever marked her walls and buildings. \nPeace is within our grasp, if we can act with sensitivity to \nacknowledge the ancient and competing claims to this most contested \nplot of land. No one, I believe, wants a city torn by terror and \ndivisiveness, a Jerusalem that cannot stand as a beacon of tolerance \nand understanding among three religions and all of the peoples of the \nMiddle East. Therefore, I will vote against this bill, which does so \nmuch to undermine the peace process.\n  Mr. ROBB. Madam President, I recognize the city of Jerusalem as the \nunited, undivided, eternal, and sovereign capital of Israel, and where \nthe United States Embassy is located should reflect that reality. While \nsome have urged caution about relocating our mission in the midst of \nthe peace process, it is my sense that such a move, as envisioned by \nthe Jerusalem Embassy Relocation Act, will not create a detour on the \nroad to achieving a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace.\n  Jerusalem stands today as an international city, where the rights of \nall ethnic religious groups are protected and freedom of worship is \nguaranteed. Diverse religious faiths coexist peacefully. This week we \nare seeing a hopeful spirit of internationalism expressed by many world \nleaders celebrating the founding of the United Nations 50 years ago. \nLike the community of nations joining together in support of the United \nNations many religious faiths and sects engender a collective spirit of \ninterdenominational harmony in Jerusalem.\n  Madam President, Prime Minister Rabin has told the Israeli people \nthat ``I assure you that Jerusalem will remain united under Israel's \nsovereignty, and our capital forever.'' That expression leads me to the \nconclusion that the final status talks on the city should not focus on \nissues of overall sovereignty. Rather, making permanent each \ndenomination's jurisdiction over its respective holy sites and \ncollateral issues of autonomy should be the subject of the negotiations \nnext year.\n  Even President Clinton has stated that ``I recognize Jerusalem as an \nundivided city, the capital of Israel--whatever the outcome of the \nnegotiations, Jerusalem is still the capital of Israel and must remain \nan undivided city, accessible to all.'' That statement represents a \nconsensus that our Embassy belongs in the functional capital of Israel.\n  Among the 184 countries we maintain diplomatic relations with, Israel \nis the single exception to the rule of locating \n\n[[Page S 15523]]\nthe United States chancery in the designated capital of each foreign \nnation. We have a responsibility to respect the decisions of where all \ncountries locate their seat of government, and Israel should not be \nviewed in a different light.\n  Thus far in the peace talks, Israel has sacrificed the tangible--\nland--for the intangible--the security of its people. As we continue \ndown the road of peace, Israel will cede valuable territory, natural \nresources, and political authority, while Palestinians will enjoy \nbroader political and economic freedoms. There are no long-term \nguarantees for Israel. A single Hamas-sponsored terrorist attack can \ndisrupt any sense of peace achieved at the negotiating table.\n  Madam President, that is why I endorse this move to demonstrate our \nlong-term commitment to having our Embassy in Jerusalem which will \nsymbolize the united and undivided character of this city. Such a move \nwill not stand in the way of achieving a comprehensive peace. It will \nsimply lay to rest doubts about the U.S. position on the status of our \nEmbassy.\n  I also support the modified substitute offered by the majority leader \nlast night that includes compromise language providing the President a \nnational security interests waiver. I think it is appropriate that the \nPresident should be given the authority to waive the legislation if it \nwould have dire consequences on the peace process.\n  Madam President, I joined as a cosponsor of this legislation some \ntime ago, and believe it sends the right message at the right time to \nIsrael. It is our decision alone to move the Embassy. With upcoming \nceremonies in the rotunda of the Capitol celebrating the 3,000th \nanniversary of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, I believe we will be \nserving the interests of peace in the Middle East by passing this \nlegislation. So I urge my colleagues to support this effort to relocate \nour Embassy to the capital of the Jewish homeland.\n  Mr. COHEN. Madam President, this week in the Capitol rotunda the \nUnited States Congress will host the United States Inaugural Ceremony \nof Jerusalem 3000, beginning the celebration of the 3,000th anniversary \nof the establishment of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.\n  It is a particularly appropriate time for the Senate to act on this \nimportant legislation that would reaffirm our commitment to Jerusalem \nas the undivided capital of Israel by directing the relocation of the \nUnited States Embassy to Jerusalem by 1999.\n  It has been over a decade since a majority of the Members of \nCongress, and I was proud to be among this group, called for the \nmovement of our Embassy to where it belongs--in the capital of Israel. \nSince then, as Senator Moynihan has recited in detail, the Senate and \nthe other body have repeatedly adopted by overwhelming and frequently \nunanimous votes legislation calling on the United States to affirm \nJerusalem as Israel's undivided capital.\n  Most recently, nearly every Member of the Senate signed a letter to \nthe President urging that the relocation take place no later than May \n1999. This letter clearly rejected the assertion of some that declaring \nour intent to move our Embassy would endanger the peace process, noting \nthat:\n\n       United States policy should be clear and unequivocal. The \n     search for peace can only be hindered by raising utterly \n     unrealistic hopes about the future status of Jerusalem among \n     the Palestinians and understandable fears among the Israeli \n     population that their capital city may once again be divided \n     by cinder block and barbed wire.\n\n  We also endorsed in that letter Prime Minister Rabin's declaration \nthat ``United Jerusalem will not be open to negotiation. It has been \nand will forever be the capital of the Jewish people, under Israeli \nsovereignty, a focus of the dreams and longings of every Jew.''\n  The bill we have before us, of which I am proud to be an original \ncosponsor, brings this legislative process to fruition by establishing \nin law United States policy that Jerusalem should be recognized as the \ncapital of Israel and that our Embassy should be relocated there no \nlater than May 31, 1999, and by authorizing funding beginning this year \nfor construction of a United States Embassy in Jerusalem.\n  To help that ensure the executive branch implements this policy \nfaithfully, the bill requires semiannual reports from the Secretary of \nState, beginning in January, on the progress made toward opening our \nEmbassy in Jerusalem. It also would give the State Department a strong \nfinancial incentive by limiting the availability of its construction \nfunding after 1999 until the Embassy opens in Israel's capital. As a \npractical matter, this limitation would not actually take effect until \nthe middle of the year 2000, given the historical spend-out rates for \nthe State Department's construction budget. But it emphasizes the \nimportance Congress places on this matter.\n  Even with this inherent flexibility, however, the administration has \nshown resistance to this legislation. In response, Senator Dole has now \nadded a broad waiver authority that would allow the President to \nsuspend this limitation on State Department construction if he believes \nit is necessary to protect the national security interests of the \nUnited States.\n  I should also note that the bill carefully states that the rights of \nevery ethnic and religion group should be protected in the undivided \ncapital of Jerusalem. Three major faiths revere Jerusalem as a holy \ncity. The best way to protect the religious interests of members of all \nthese faiths is to ensure that Jerusalem never again is divided, which \nwould only threaten to reignite religious conflict.\n  Madam President, Senator Dole and Senator Moynihan are to be \ncommended for their persistent leadership in ensuring that this \nlegislation has finally come for a vote on the floor of the Senate. I \nhope that, once the House of Representatives gives its approval, this \nlegislation will be signed into law by the President, who during the \n1992 campaign clearly stated that ``I recognize Jerusalem as an \nundivided city, the eternal capital of Israel.'' Given the very strong \nsupport this bill rightly enjoys in both Houses of Congress, I think \nthe President's advisers would be unwise to suggest another course of \naction.\n  And once this bill is enacted into law, through whichever mechanism, \nI trust that the President will move expeditiously to implement it and \nattain its objective before the May 1999 deadline.\n  Madam President, many of us in the Senate have had the opportunity to \nhelp cultivate America's special relationship with the State of Israel. \nAs a strategic ally and an island of stability and democracy in an \nimportant but troubled region, Israel steadfastly supported American \ninterests during the cold war. During the gulf war, when Saddam Hussein \nsought to gain control over Middle Eastern energy resources, Israel \nstood firmly with America, enduring savage attacks on its civilian \npopulation that were designed to split Israeli policy from United \nStates policy.\n  Having protected U.S. interests in a hostile region for decades, the \nAmerican-Israeli strategic alliance today is the foundation for the \nMiddle East peace process. Without steadfast United States support for \nIsrael, those among Israel's neighbors who have accepted the necessity \nfor a negotiated peace settlement would not have done so. And without \nour continued steadfast support, the peace process will not be \nsuccessful. Nowhere is this need greater than on the question of the \nstatus of Jerusalem.\n  Jerusalem is and will remain the undivided capital of the State of \nIsrael, and we must not miss the opportunity to underline that fact--\nparticularly today on the eve of the inauguration of the celebration of \nthe 3,000th anniversary of Jerusalem's establishment as the capital of \nIsrael. This legislation will help to ensure that the fourth millennium \nof this holy city will begin with an era of peace.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, so that we can pass \nit with a large majority and ensure its swift enactment into law.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I rise in support of S. 1322, a bill to \nrelocate the United States Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.\n  In the over 180 countries where the United States has a diplomatic \npresence, Israel is the only country where our diplomatic presence is \noutside of the capital city. It is time to pledge ourselves to moving \nour Embassy to Jerusalem, which is the legitimate capital of Israel. It \nis in our interest to \n\n[[Page S 15524]]\nstrongly support Israel and its continued administration of Jerusalem.\n  I am a cosponsor of this legislation, along with 63 other Senators. \nIn a year some characterize as a very partisan year, you have a \nbipartisan consensus on this issue. Senators have come together for the \nnational interest, something which is above politics.\n  This is what this bill is all about: The national interest. I have \nheard that this bill is solely about politics of the Presidential kind. \nThat is not true--the proof is in the list of cosponsors: This list is \nbipartisan and balanced.\n  I have heard the argument against this bill, that moving our Embassy \nahead of schedule would endanger the Middle East peace process. I am \nnot persuaded by this argument. The United States has consistently \nrecognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital. If we want to be an honest \nbroker in peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians, we should be \nhonest about our view of Israel's sovereignty over Jerusalem.\n  This bill would allow us to break ground in 1996 for the new Embassy. \nNext year will be the 3,000th anniversary year of Jerusalem. King David \nrelocated his throne from Hebron to Jerusalem 3 millennia ago. Next \nyear, America should move its Embassy to the city of David.\n  This bill is not a statement of animosity against any religion. \nAlmost all Senators are on record supporting Israel's administration of \nJerusalem as a unified and universal city, open to all followers of the \nthree great world religions. This it has done for 28 years, and that \nwill not be jeopardized.\n  This bill is not a statement against any country. This bill is for \nthe official recognition on our part that our ally Israel has its \ngovernmental seat in Jerusalem. The peace negotiations can and should \ncontinue. We should facilitate such negotiations. Relocating our \nEmbassy does not and should not have anything to do with ongoing peace \ntalks.\n  So I think we should pass this bill, and I think the President should \nsign it. Jerusalem has always been at the crossroads of history and \nfaith. We should begin next year to place our presence there.\n  I am reminded that people of the Jewish faith say at the end of the \nPassover and Yom Kippur services, ``Next year, in Jerusalem.'' This \nexpresses their hope of return and the centrality of Jerusalem in the \nJewish faith.\n  I say something similar, Madam President: That I hope this bill \npasses, and next year, we will be in Jerusalem breaking ground for a \nnew Embassy in the Holy City.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise as a cosponsor of the Israel \nEmbassy Relocation Act. I thank the sponsors of this legislation for \namending it to give Israel more flexibility on when construction on our \nnew Embassy will begin.\n  Jerusalem is and always will be the capital of Israel. For thousands \nof years the Jewish people prayed, ``next year in Jerusalem.'' This \nprayer helped to sustain Jews even through the darkest days of the \ndiaspora.\n  Even after Israeli independence, the holy sites of Jerusalem were \nclosed to Christians and Jews. The Jewish quarter of the old city was \ndestroyed. But since Jerusalem was unified in 1967, Jerusalem is open \nto all religions for the first time in its history.\n  I have visited Israel with Jews who were there for the first time. \nWhen we visited the Western Wall, I saw what it meant for them to touch \nthe stones that their ancestors could only dream of. I saw that \nJerusalem is not just a city or a capital. It is the religious and \nhistoric homeland of the Jewish people.\n  Why is Israel the only nation with which we have diplomatic relations \nthat is not allowed to chose its own capital? The sight for the U.S. \nEmbassy is in west Jerusalem, which has been part of Israel since its \nindependence. We should have moved our Embassy long ago.\n  So over the years, I have supported every effort of Congress to call \nupon the executive branch to move our Embassy to Jerusalem. And each \nsuccessive administration has ignored us.\n  But now, as Israel takes courageous steps toward peace, we are \nraising this issue again. And what should have been a clear statement \non Jerusalem has become a political debate.\n  When this legislation was first introduced, I had some concerns about \nthe requirement that construction on the new Embassy must begin in \n1996. I did not cosponsor it because I believe that we would be \nimposing our own deadlines on the peace process. This new bill removes \nthe arbitrary dates that fit United States elections rather than the \nwill of the Israeli people. This issue is too important to politicize.\n  Madam President, this year we celebrate the 3,000 anniversary of \nJerusalem. Let us mark this great event by reaffirming that Jerusalem \nis and always will be the capital of the State of Israel.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I stand here today to strongly support S. \n1322, the Jerusalem Embassy Relocation Act of 1995.\n  I wish to commend the majority leader for his efforts in introducing \nthis bill. I also wish to commend the efforts of Senator Kyl and a \nnumber of my Democratic colleagues for ensuring that we possess a bill \nthat will have, I hope, unanimous support here in the Senate.\n  The issue of Jerusalem has been debated on this floor for over a \ndecade. I have always believed that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel, \nand I believe that now is the time for the United States Congress to \nrecognize this reality. That is why I signed the letter to Secretary \nChristopher on March 20, 1995--along with 92 of our colleagues--that \ndeclared that ``we believe that the United States Embassy belongs in \nJerusalem.''\n  I understand that this legislation has been modified to address \nconcerns that we may be restricting the President's foreign \npolicymaking powers. With these modifications, I encourage the \nadministration to join us in correcting a diplomatic anomaly that we \nhave visited on our closest ally in the Middle East for too long: Of \nthe diplomatic relations we hold with over 180 nations around the \nworld, Israel is the only country in which our Embassy is not in the \ncapital.\n  I have been and remain a strong supporter of the Middle East peace \nprocess. But through the years of my support, I have always maintained \nthat the policy process must be driven by the participants, and that \nthe United States' role is to support, not dictate, the terms of the \nnegotiations. Israel has made some courageous concessions over these \nnegotiations. It has waged a fight for peace that has been, on some \ndays, as bloody as its previous wars.\n  Next year will begin the ``Final Status'' negotiations. There has \nbeen much positioning by certain parties over the future of Jerusalem. \nBut Israeli governments have not vacillated over this issue, and their \nposition has always been clear: Jerusalem is the seat of the Israeli \nGovernment, and Jerusalem shall remain the united capital of Israel. \nThis is the conviction of the Israeli Government, the only democratic \nstate and our most valuable ally in the region.\n  This should be our conviction now. Our ambivalence beyond this point \nwill only muddle, and I believe frustrate, the final status \nnegotiations. The parties must set the terms, and we must not confound \nexpectations by perpetuating the anomaly of the U.S. Embassy in Tel \nAviv. If we wish to continue supporting the peace process, and I firmly \nbelieve we should, then we must make clear that it is the policy of the \nU.S. Government to have its Embassy in Jerusalem by the conclusion of \nthe peace negotiations at the end of this century.\n  Jerusalem just celebrated its 3,000th anniversary. Let us now declare \nthat the U.S. Embassy will reside in that holy city by the end of this \ntroubled 20th century. Let us now pass resoundingly S. 1322.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Madam President, I strongly support S. 1322, the \nJerusalem Embassy Relocation Implementation Act, legislation which \nwould locate the United States Embassy in Israel in Jerusalem, Israel's \ncapital city.\n  It is customary, indeed, universal, that an embassy is located in the \ncapital city of every sovereign nation in which a diplomatic presence \nis maintained; that is why I cosponsored S. 1322, along with 62 of my \ncolleagues.\n  Madam President, Jerusalem is Israel's chosen seat of government. It \nis where the President, Prime Minister, Parliament, Supreme Court, \ncentral \n\n[[Page S 15525]]\nbank, and all other authoritative institutions of state are \nheadquartered. It has been the capital of Israel since 1950. Moving the \nAmerican Embassy is nothing more than an acknowledgment of what is in \nfact the reality--Jerusalem is the capital of the State of Israel.\n  Presently, the United States maintains diplomatic relations with 184 \ncountries around the world. Of these, Israel is the only nation in \nwhich our Embassy is located in a city not regarded by the host nation \nas its capital.\n  Imagine, Madam President, the huge outcry, within and outside of \ngovernment, if any foreign nation refused to locate its embassy in our \ncapital or insisted that it would maintain relations with us, but not \nin the location we designated as our capital city. That kind of refusal \nwould create serious and unnecessary tensions between the United States \nand that country. After all, the question of where to locate the \ncapital of the United States is for the United States to decide--and no \none else.\n  That same logic applies in this case to the capital of Israel. The \nquestion of where to locate its capital is for Israel to decide and no \nother nation or power to frustrate. And Israel decided long ago that \nJerusalem would be its capital.\n  If the argument is made that Middle East peace negotiations are at a \ndelicate stage, and that this is not the time for this legislation, my \nresponse to that is: Peace negotiations are always at a delicate stage. \nThe pendency of discussions should not force an untenable \ndiscrimination against one of the negotiators.\n  Jerusalem has been the capital of Israel since 1950. The time for \nwaiting is over. Forty-five years is a long enough period for closure \nof what should be a matter of simple fairness.\n  Critics of this legislation also argue that the passage--even the \ndiscussion--of this legislation will undermine the peace process, \nthereby harming Israel's security and strategic interests. However, the \nGovernment of Israel and its citizens, the ultimate authorities on \nIsrael's security and strategic interests, do not share that view. They \nenthusiastically support the relocation of the American Embassy to the \ncapital city, Jerusalem.\n  Others argue that the relocation of the American Embassy to Jerusalem \nwould prejudge and prejudice the final status of Jerusalem negotiations \nunder the Oslo agreement. I do not agree. The site the United States is \nconsidering for a future Embassy is in an area that has been part of \nIsrael since its founding in 1948. Moreover, Israel's right to this \nsection of Jerusalem is uncontested, even by the Palestine Liberation \nOrganization.\n  Madam President, I understand and appreciate the uniqueness of the \ncity of Jerusalem. It is unique in the world as a holy place. The \nhilltop city is sacred to Jews as the site of their ancient temple, to \nChristians as the birthplace of Christianity, and to Moslems as the \nsite from which Muhammad ascended into heaven. It is all of these \nthings--and it is also the capital of Israel.\n  Each and every U.S. Embassy abroad exists to represent our Government \nto the government of the country in which it is located. The Government \nof Israel is in Jerusalem. Jerusalem, therefore, is the only place our \nEmbassy should be.\n  The logic of locating our Embassy in Israel's capital city is \noverwhelming and compelling, which is why this legislation enjoys such \nwidespread, bipartisan support in both the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives. I urge the prompt passage of this legislation, and I \nlook forward to the day in the near future when the United States \nEmbassy opens in Israel's capital--Jerusalem.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the \nJerusalem Embassy Relocation Implementation Act. Like almost all of my \ncolleagues, I believe that an undivided Jerusalem is the legitimate \ncapital of the State of Israel, and that United States policy should \nclearly reflect that. Accordingly, the United States Embassy should be \nhoused in Israel's capital, just like it is in every other country, and \nnot in the country's economic center.\n  Of course, the Jerusalem issue is practically unique in world \npolitics. The ancient city is holy for Jews, Christians, and Moslems, \nand both Israelis and Palestinians claim Jerusalem as their capital. \nThe Tomb of the Holy Sepulchre is sacred for Christians to honor \nChrist's death. Moslems claim the Dome of the Rock and the al-Aqsa \nmosque as the site of Abraham's sacrifice. Jews pray at the Kotel, the \nWestern Wall, the last remaining wall of the ancient synagogues, as \nwell as the scores of other holy sites nestled in so many quarters.\n  Named as the City of Peace, Jerusalem has unfortunately been split by \nwar. Throughout history, Arabs and Jews and Christians have locked each \nother out, and have often accused each other of desanctifying religious \nmonuments, and barring access to each other's holy places.\n  Incidents have occurred where Moslems have felt offended by \ndesecrations of their holy monuments and religious foundations. My own \nmemory is seared by the defacing of meaningful and historic synagogues \nin the Old City's Jewish Quarter in 1947-67, when the city was not \ncontrolled by Israel. I remember with pain the laundry that hung on the \nWailing Wall, a place of immensely spiritual and sacred value for Jews. \nI cannot forget the pictures of Jewish tombstones thrown around the \nMount of Olives cemetery just at the foot of the walls of the Old City.\n  Though the international community has tried to split Jerusalem under \nthe political solution of corpus separatum, to my mind, the \nspirituality and emotion of the city make division impossible. Given \nthe 3,000 years of the history of Jerusalem, it will always be the \nheart of the Jewish people and the capital of the Jewish state. Indeed, \nit is the capital of the sovereign nation of Israel--a sovereignty the \nUnited States has heavily invested in and fiercely supported for 45 \nyears. If our support for Jewish sovereignty over the land of Israel is \nto mean anything, then the United States should recognize Israel's \ncapital appropriately.\n  Waiting years--if not decades--for the right moment to move the \nUnited States Embassy is not an appropriate recognition of Israel's \nsovereignty. As much as I hate to admit it, I do not think there will \never be a right time for a move with such emotional associations. And \ntherefore, now is as right as ever. In exchange, Israel must guarantee \nuniversal access to other religions who seek to honor their holy places \nas well. I believe that, save some very unfortunate incidents, Israel \nfor the most part has protected the right of access to Moslem and \nChristian holy places, and has a responsibility to continue to do so.\n  I am very sensitive to concerns that such a move by the United States \nat this time would undermine the peace process. I understand the risk \nthat perhaps the United States would compromise its important position \nas an honest broker in the peace process: To that, I respond that \nAmerica's position is nonnegotiable since Israel's claim to Jerusalem \nis nonnegotiable. Already, there should be no doubt of what the United \nStates position is; hiding our Embassy in Tel Aviv does not change \nthat.\n  I am also troubled by suggestions that such a move would predetermine \nthe outcome of the final status talks between Israel and the Palestine \nLiberation Organization, and tie the chairman's hands in other critical \nnegotiations. I am not persuaded, however, that the move of the U.S. \nEmbassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem would have such a devastating \neffect. It is important to keep this proposal in perspective, and not \nunderestimate the power of the commitment of the parties themselves to \nthe peace process--wherever the U.S. Embassy is housed. Further, I \nbelieve that Prime Minister Rabin's own assertions that Israel will not \ncede Jerusalem are just as important to the process, and can guide \nUnited States actions on the issue.\n  The stationing of the United States Embassy in Jerusalem has been a \nwidely supported proposal. The Democratic Party has included it as a \nplank in our platform since 1967. Sweeping majorities in Congress have \nurged it for years. It has not been a partisan issue; it has not been a \npersonal crusade for just a few Members of Congress. Indeed, it is when \nwe have broad-based and bipartisan support such as this that coherent \nand successful policies emerge. Israel has always been a beneficiary of \nsuch unity. For that reason, I appreciate Senator Dole working \n\n[[Page S 15526]]\nwith the administration to craft a bill that can have near-unanimous \nsupport, and to avoid the nonsense of division on an issue like \nJerusalem.\n  This year Jerusalem is celebrating its 3,000th anniversary. For it to \nremain the unclaimed capital of Israel is a shame. We should honor it, \nand the State of Israel, with the Jerusalem Embassy Relocation \nImplementation Act.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, I fully recognize that Israel is one of \nthe most strategic and important allies of the United States--the only \nworking democracy in the Middle East. We should never waver in our \nsupport for a nation that has been militarily threatened by its \nneighbors since its founding over 40 years ago.\n  But I also strongly support the peace process that Israeli Prime \nMinister Rabin and the Palestine Liberation Organization began over 2 \nyears ago. A glimmer of hope has emerged in recent years that the \nlongstanding hostilities that have fueled conflict in this volatile \nregion of the world may soon come to an end. It is imperative that the \nUnited States stand firmly behind the efforts of Israel and the \nPalestinians to reach agreement on the many disagreements that have \ndivided these peoples for so long.\n  In announcing its accord on Jericho and the Gaza Strip 2 years ago, \nIsrael and the PLO also agreed to negotiate the permanent status of \nJerusalem beginning next year. The United States has stood firmly--and \nindeed has been a leader--behind negotiations on these and other \nunresolved issues that are aimed at achieving long-term peace.\n  I certainly recognize that Israel declared Jerusalem to be its \ncapital in 1950. However, since 1967 the United States has called for a \nnegotiated resolution of Jerusalem's status, a position restated by the \nSeptember 1993 agreement between Israel and the PLO. I am convinced \nthat the question of when we construct our Embassy in Israel should be \nleft to the President and the State Department. Having Congress dictate \nto the State Department a construction schedule for our Embassy would \nsurely disrupt and possibly derail the ongoing Mideast peace process, a \nmost sensitive diplomatic effort.\n  Although the administration is given a national security waiver in \nthe compromise version of this legislation, there is still no guarantee \nthat the Embassy move could be waived if the peace process is halted. \nThat is why the State Department remains opposed to this bill. Because \nof my support for the Mideast peace process and executive branch \nauthority on foreign policy, I will vote against S. 1322.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I rise today as a cosponsor of this \nresolution to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. I \nstrongly believe that Jerusalem is, and will always be, the undivided \ncapital of the state of Israel. The United States Embassy should have \nbeen moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem long ago, and I have supported \nmany past efforts to that end. Earlier this year, I joined 91 other \nSenators in a letter to Secretary of State Christopher urging that our \nEmbassy be moved as soon as possible.\n  Beyond the protocol concerns of maintaining an embassy outside a \nstate's declared capital city, the U.S. Government is ignoring the \ncentrality of Jerusalem to the Jewish people by keeping its embassy in \nTel Aviv. Jerusalem is more than just a capital for the people of \nIsrael. Israelis cherish Jerusalem for its historical and religious \nsignificance and hold it in great affection. As a result, this \ncontinued reluctance to move the Embassy to Israel's precious capital \nand most important city is perceived as the ultimate diplomatic snub. \nIt is only appropriate that we correct this slight.\n  Jerusalem has emotional resonance that reaches far beyond the Middle \nEast as the religious capital for all Jews and as an important \nreligious site for many other faiths. The Israeli Government has earned \nour praise in its valiant efforts to ensure that people of all faiths \nhave unhindered access to their holy sites. Unfortunately, Jerusalem \nhas not always been so accessible, as Senator Lautenberg detailed for \nthe Senate yesterday.\n  Mr. President, I have been somewhat skeptical as to whether we can \npass legislation that will really move our Embassy from Tel Aviv to \nJerusalem. The administration has expressed reasonable concerns that \nthis measure is ill-timed and that in its original form could have had \nan adverse effect on the peace process. I am pleased that Senators \nFeinstein and Lautenberg were able to work with the original sponsors \nof this measure to achieve a compromise to address the administration's \nconcerns.\n  With or without this legislation, I continue to urge the \nadministration to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem as soon as \npossible. I urge my colleagues to support this bill to send that \nmessage to the administration.\n  Mr. MACK. Madam President, I rise in support of S. 1332, a bill to \nrelocate the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem. I have long supported placing \nthe U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem. It is time that the United States \nrecognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel by placing our Embassy \nthere. Such recognition is long overdue--47 years overdue. Over time, \nthe location of the Embassy in Tel Aviv has taken on a significance \nthat is at odds with our strong and unwavering support for Israel and \nJerusalem as its undivided capital.\n  The United States failure to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of \nIsrael has only served to embolden the enemies of Israel, leading them \nto think perhaps the United States, Israel's closest ally, was \nambivalent about the status of Jerusalem. We are not. And it is long \npast time for us to demonstrate our steadfast commitment to an \nundivided Jerusalem as the historic, governmental, and spiritual \ncapital of Israel.\n  Much of the discussion on this bill has addressed concerns that \nrelocation of the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem would have a detrimental \neffect on the peace process. The opposite is true. An essential part of \nthe peace process involves a clear understanding between the parties on \na number of issues, an undivided Jerusalem as the capital of Israel is \none. PLO compliance is another. On both counts, I want to be absolutely \nclear: both are essential to a lasting peace in the Middle East. Both \nare good for Israel and both are good for the Palestinian people. Both \nare fundamental prerequisites for moving forward into a phase of good \nrelations between Israel and its neighbors. Both are necessary for \nstability, economic development, good government, and the rule of law \nfor the Palestinian people.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Madam President, I want to join the strong chorus of \nbipartisan support for S. 1322, the Jerusalem Embassy Relocation Act. \nAs an original cosponsor of this bill, as well as the legislation \nintroduced early this year, S. 770, I am pleased the Senate is taking \ndecisive action. This bill already has more than 60 cosponsors--a \ntestament once again to the strong bond between the people of the \nUnited States and Israel, our friend and ally in the Middle East. I \nurge my colleagues in the House of Representatives to pass this \nlegislation and send it to the White House as soon as possible.\n  Swift passage would not only be appropriate, but timely. In less than \n2 weeks, Prime Minister Rabin and Mayor Olmert of Jerusalem will be \nwith us here in the Capitol to commemorate the 3,000th anniversary of \nthe establishment of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel by King David. \nIt was 45 years ago, in 1950, when Jerusalem formally was reestablished \nas the capital of Israel. Throughout this city's rich history, \nJerusalem has been an important city to people of many faiths. It has \nbeen occupied by military governments, psuedo-states, and empires. \nHowever, for three centuries, only one State has called Jerusalem her \ncapital--the State of Israel. Jerusalem is and should forever be the \ncapital of Israel. Jerusalem is where our Embassy belongs.\n  The Senate repeatedly has expressed in a strong, unified voice that \nthe United States Embassy in Israel should be relocated to Jerusalem. \nEarlier this year, I was pleased to join a vast majority of my \ncolleagues--92 to be exact--in a letter to Secretary of State Warren \nChristopher, urging that the State Department begin taking concrete \nsteps to relocate the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem. The legislation we \nwill pass today more than gets the process moving. Specifically, S. \n1322 would set a definitive timeline for the construction and \nrelocation of the \n\n[[Page S 15527]]\n\nUnited States Embassy to Israel in Jerusalem. It would authorize \nfunding over the next 2 years to ensure the timeline is met, including \nthe opening of the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem by May 31, 1999.\n  Madam President, I strongly disagree with those who claim that this \nlegislation could threaten the Middle East peace process. There is no \nrational basis to question the Senate's commitment to achieving a \nlasting peace in the Middle East. All want to see the peace process \nsucceed. The safety and security of all the people of Israel is \ncritical to attaining a stable environment in the Middle East.\n  Clearly, a number of issues in the peace process remain to be worked \nout. However, there are a few facts that are not in dispute: Jerusalem \nis an undivided city. Jerusalem is a city open to all people of all \nnationalities and faiths. Jerusalem is the true capital of Israel. By \nrelocating our Embassy in this historic city, we simply reinforce these \nfacts--facts that reinforce U.S. policy. Nothing more. Nothing less.\n  Again, Madam President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of \nthis very important legislation. Throughout my career in the Senate, \nthis body has passed a number of nonbinding resolutions recognizing \nJerusalem as the capital of Israel. U.S. policy is clear. Congress has \nspoken many times. Now the time has come for action. I commend the \nmajority leader, my friends and colleagues from New York--Senator \nD'Amato and Senator Moynihan--and my friend from Arizona, Senator Kyl, \nfor their tenacious leadership to see this bill through to final \npassage today. I can think of no action by the United States to be more \nappropriate on this extraordinary year--the 3,000th anniversary of King \nDavid's recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel--than to \nplace our Embassy in Israel's capital city, Jerusalem--a city forever \nfree, forever undivided and forever the capital of the people of \nIsrael.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President: I rise today to speak about S. 1322--\nJerusalem Embassy Relocation Implementation Act of 1995. Let me say at \nthe outset that I share the fundamental premise of the sponsors of this \nlegislation, namely that Jerusalem is and should remain the undivided \ncapital of the State of Israel. I also agree that the logical extension \nof that premise is that the U.S. Embassy should therefore appropriately \nbe located in that city.\n  I have joined with my colleagues on numerous occasions expressing \nthis view. Most recently, on March 20, I joined with 92 of my Senate \ncolleagues on a letter to Secretary of State Warren Christopher stating \nour view that:\n\n     it would be appropriate for planning to begin now to ensure \n     such a move no later than the agreements on permanent status \n     take effect and the transition period has ended, which \n     according to the Declaration of Principles is scheduled for \n     May 1999.\n\n  Mr. President, several weeks ago I had the privilege of being present \nat the White House to witness the historic signing of the Interim \nAgreement on the West Bank and Gaza by Prime Minister of Israel Yitzhak \nRabin and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat. With the stroke of their pens, \nthey took, the peoples of the Middle East one step closer to lasting \npeace. All of the efforts of those who were the enemies of peace could \nnot deter these two brave leaders from their goal of finding the common \nground that made that agreement a reality.\n  Since the establishment of the State of Israel more than 47 years \nago, the people of Israel have sought to live in peace with their \nneighbors in the Middle East. For too long Israeli efforts to reach out \nfor peace and dialog with its Arab counterparts were met with rejection \nand terrorism. Fortunately that has now largely changed. Clearly the \nbreak up of the Soviet Union and the gulf war were defining moments \nthat totally reshaped the political landscape in the Middle East and \nimproved the prospect for peace.\n  Mr. President, I fully understand the emotional attachment that \nIsraelis--indeed all Jews--have for Jerusalem. I also respect the \nsignificance of this city for those of Moslem and Jewish faiths. Under \nIsraeli sovereignty, all nations have enjoyed complete freedom of \nworship in a united Jerusalem. Moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem \nwill in no way effect freedom of access to holy places or Moslem and \nChristian continued control of their respective holy sites in that \ncity.\n  We can all be justly proud of the enormous progress that has been \nmade to date to undo the destruction and distrust that are the \nbyproduct of decades of hatred and havoc in the Middle East. But we \nmust also be realistic about the difficult issues that remain to be \nresolved. We must also be mindful of actions we might take here in this \nbody that could further complicate efforts to reach a final agreement.\n  It is within that context that the administration's opposition to \nlegislatively mandating the relocation of the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem \nby a date certain should be understood. Having said that, I believe \nthat at this point not to vote in support of this legislation would \nsend the wrong signal to those who would prefer to see the Middle East \nremain in turmoil. It would send the wrong signal to those who may hold \nsome allusion that our views about the undivided nature of the capital \nof Israel will somehow change.\n  Mr. President, I also would note that the changes that have been made \nto the original legislation by its sponsors do address some of the \nspecific concerns expressed by the administration about earlier \nversions. I am pleased that ongoing discussions concerning the \ninclusion of Presidential waiver authority bore fruit.\n  Mr. President, while I may have had some doubts about the specific \nwording of the legislation or the timing of its consideration, I \nwholeheartedly endorse its intent, and will join with my colleagues at \nthe appropriate time in support of final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished majority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, this is an historic day for the Senate. \nLong discussed and long promised, today marks the day that means a U.S. \nEmbassy in Jerusalem will be a reality. On October 13, 1995, along with \nSenators Moynihan, Kyl, Inouye, and 61 other colleagues, I introduced \nS. 1322, the Jerusalem Embassy Relocation Act of 1995. It modifies S. \n770, introduced last May, by deleting the requirement setting the \ngroundbreaking must be begun on the Embassy by May 1996. This \nlegislation states that Jerusalem should be recognized as the capital \nof Israel and that our Embassy should be relocated to that city no \nlater than May 1999. That is the bottom line.\n  I wish to say at the outset that the sponsors of this legislation do \nnot want to undermine the peace process. We support the process of \nbuilding peace in the Middle East.\n  In our view this legislation is not about the peace process, as the \nSenator from Arizona pointed out in a meeting we had the other day with \nthe Senator from California, Senator Feinstein, the Senator from New \nJersey, Senator Lautenberg, and the Senator from Connecticut, Senator \nLieberman, time and time again.\n  This legislation is not about the peace process, it is about \nrecognizing Israel's capital. Israel's capital is not on the table in \nthe peace process, and moving the United States Embassy to Jerusalem \ndoes nothing to prejudge the outcome of any future negotiations.\n  Years ago, I expressed some concern about the impact of Jerusalem and \nrelated issues could have on the prospects for peace. But we live in a \nvery different world today. The Soviet empire is gone, and Arab States \ncan no longer use cold war rivalries in their differences with Israel. \nIraqi aggression against Kuwait has been reversed with American forces \nfighting shoulder to shoulder with Arab allies. American military \nforces remain in the Persian Gulf region. Jordan has joined Egypt in \nmaking genuine peace with Israel. The second phase of the Declaration \nof Principles is being implemented, Gaza is under Palestinian control, \nand Israeli withdrawal from West Bank towns has begun.\n  Even yesterday Arafat met with a group of 100 some Jewish leaders in \nNew York City. I never thought it would happen. It happened.\n  No one can fail to see that the Middle East has changed dramatically. \nIn my view, now is the time to set the deadline for moving the American \nEmbassy to Jerusalem.\n  In the more than 5 months since this legislation was introduced, \nthere was not one single overture from the Clinton administration. \nThere were veto \n\n[[Page S 15528]]\nthreats and legal arguments, but no effort to even discuss our \ndifferences. Despite the administration's refusal to talk, the sponsors \nof the legislation remained willing to address concerns about the bill.\n  I had no doubt we can work it out and move forward on this \nlegislation.\n  I want to thank my colleagues, Senator Lautenberg, Senator Feinstein, \nand others for their willingness to cooperate and work out some of the \ndifferences we had, along, of course, with Senator Kyl, Senator \nLieberman, Senator Moynihan, and Senator Inouye.\n  The administration raised concerns over the lack of a waiver \nprovision in the bill. Last Friday, they proposed a national interest \nwaiver with no limits. In the interest of getting the broadest possible \nsupport--we hope, even including the support of the White House--the \nsubstitute adopted last night included a national security interest \nwaiver. If the waiver is exercised, funding withholding would take \nplace in the next fiscal year. This should take care of any possibly \nunforseen impact of the legislation. Despite having the votes to \nprevail, we have demonstrated our willingness to meet the concerns \nraised. We did not want a confrontation with the White House. In sum, \nwe have gone the extra mile, and now is the time for the Senate to \nspeak.\n  Some have said the Israeli Government is opposed to this legislation. \nNothing could be further from the truth. The architect of the Oslo \naccord, Deputy Foreign Minister Yossi Beilin recently made Israeli \nGovernment views very clear:\n\n       Any timing for transferring any embassy to Jerusalem, is \n     good timing. The earlier the better. Israel is the only \n     nation in the world that doesn't have a recognized capital.\n\n  As I said when introducing this legislation, the time has come to \nmove beyond letters, expressions of support, and sense-of-the-Congress \nresolutions. The time has come to enact legislation that will get the \njob done.\n\n  Madam President, we have a very sound piece of legislation before us \ntoday. I would particularly like to thank the lead sponsors and those \nwho have been helpful in the process.\n  I am pleased that Senator Feinstein and Senator Lautenberg agreed to \ncosponsor the legislation after the substitute was worked out last \nnight.\n  It would seem to me we ought to have unanimous or near unanimous \nsupport for this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that several items referred to in my \nstatement be printed in the Record at the end of my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    Shaw, Pittman,\n\n\n                                           Potts & Trowbridge,\n\n                                                    June 27, 1995.\n     To: American Israel Public Affairs Committee\n     From: Gerald Charnoff, Charles J. Cooper, and Michael A. \n       Carvin\n     Re S. 770; Bill to Relocate U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem\n\n\n                            i. introduction\n\n       This memorandum is in response to your request for an \n     analysis of the constitutionality of the ``Jerusalem Embassy \n     Relocation Implementation Act of 1995,'' hereinafter S. 770, \n     a measure introduced by Senator Dole in the first session of \n     the 104th Congress. Maintaining that Jerusalem should be \n     recognized by the U.S. as the capital of Israel, the bill, in \n     a Statement of Policy, states that groundbreaking for the \n     U.S. embassy in Jerusalem ``should begin'' by 31 December \n     1996 and that the embassy ``should be officially open'' by 31 \n     May 1999. S. 770, 104th Cong., 1st Sess. Sec. 3(a). The \n     measure further establishes that no more than 50% of the \n     funds appropriated to the Department of State in fiscal year \n     1997 for ``Acquisition & Maintenance of Buildings Abroad'' \n     may be obligated until the Secretary of State certifies that \n     construction has begun on the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem. Id. \n     Sec. 3(b). Similarly, not more than 50% of the funds \n     appropriated in the same account for fiscal year 1999 may be \n     obligated prior to certification by the Secretary of State \n     that the Jerusalem embassy has officially opened. Id., \n     Sec. 3(c). Additional provisions, contained in sections four \n     and five of the measure, earmark certain funds for the \n     relocation effort.'' \\1\\\n     \\1\\ Footnotes at end of letter.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The Office of Legal Counsel of the Department of Justice \n     has taken the position that the funding mechanism \n     incorporated into S. 770 is an unconstitutional infringement \n     on the President's powers. See Bill to Relocate the United \n     States Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, Op. Off. Legal \n     Counsel (May 16, 1995) (``The proposed bill would severely \n     impair the President's constitutional authority to determine \n     the form and manner of the Nation's diplomatic relations.'') \n     (hereinafter ``OLC Op.'').\n\n\n                              ii. analysis\n\n       The Office of Legal Counsel (``OLC'') Opinion argues that \n     the President has primary responsibility for foreign affairs \n     and that his specific power to recognize foreign governments \n     to exclusive. OLC Op., p. 2-3. Accordingly, OLC concludes \n     that ``Congress may not impose on the President its own \n     foreign policy judgments as to the particular sites at which \n     the United States' diplomatic relations are to take place.'' \n     Id. at 3. OLC maintains that the imposition of fixed-\n     percentage restrictions on the State Department's FY 1997 and \n     FY 1999 acquisition and maintenance funds until specified \n     steps are completed in the relocation effort constitutes an \n     impermissible restriction on the President's discretion in \n     foreign affairs. Although OLC does not in any way dispute \n     Congress' plenary power over the purse, it maintains that \n     Congress may not ``attach conditions to Executive Branch \n     appropriations requiring the President to relinquish his \n     constitutional discretion in foreign affairs.'' Id. at 4, \n     quoting Issues Raised by Section 129 of Pub. L. No. 102-138 \n     and Section 503 of Pub. L. No. 102-140, 16 Op. Off. Legal \n     Counsel at 30-31 (1992) (emphasis added.). In support of this \n     assertion, OLC places exclusive reliance on prior Executive \n     Branch opinions which criticize congressional appropriations \n     riders that directly required the President to take (or \n     refrain from) a particular action by stating that no \n     appropriated funds could be used for the congressionally \n     proscribed action. Id. at 3-4. See also Issues Raised by \n     Section 129 of Pub. L. No. 102-138 & Section 503 of Pub. L. \n     No. 102-140, 16 Op. Off. of Legal Counsel 18, 19 (1992), \n     citing Section 503 of Pub. L. No. 102-140, 105 Stat. at 820 \n     (1991) (``[N]one of the funds provided in this Act shall be \n     used by the Department of State to issue more than one \n     official or diplomatic passport to any United States \n     government employee. . . .''); Appropriations Limitation for \n     Rules Vetoed by Congress, 4B Op. Off. of Legal Counsel 731, \n     731-32 (1980), citing H.R. 7484, Sec. 608, 96th Cong., 2nd \n     Sess. (1980) (``None of the funds appropriated or otherwise \n     made available to implement . . . any regulation which has \n     been disapproved pursuant to a resolution of disapproval duly \n     adopted. . . .'').\n       OLC's assertion concerning the primacy of the Chief \n     Executive in foreign affairs is well-supported,\\2\\ and its \n     further assertion that Congress may not interfere with these \n     foreign policy prerogatives even when exercising its spending \n     power is also consistent with long-standing Executive Branch \n     precedent, although Congress has taken a different view.\\3\\ \n     The issue has never been resolved judicially.\\4\\ However, \n     OLC's assertion that S. 770 ``requires'' or ``compels'' the \n     President to move the Embassy to Jerusalem, and is thus \n     subject to the same constitutional objections as \n     appropriation riders containing such unconditional \n     requirements, is belied by the plain language of the bill and \n     is otherwise unsupported by law or Executive Branch opinions.\n       S. 770 does not purport to restrict the President's ability \n     to maintain an Embassy in Tel Aviv or to otherwise interfere \n     with the President's authority to use appropriated monies in \n     any manner he believes best serves the Nation's foreign \n     policy interests. Rather, the measure merely states that, \n     absent compliance with an established timetable for \n     relocation of the U.S. Embassy in Israel, Congress will \n     invoke its spending power to reduce the aggregate funding \n     level that can be obligated in certain related discretionary \n     accounts. Instead of a prohibition on the ability of the \n     President to use money to exercise his constitutional powers, \n     S. 770 merely provides a fiscal incentive for the President \n     to exercise his discretion in a certain manner, though \n     leaving him capable of eschewing these incentives and acting \n     in direct contravention of Congress' wishes. Thus, such a \n     mechanism in no way restricts the ability of the President to \n     use his foreign affairs power to employ appropriated money as \n     he sees fit.\n       That being so, S. 770 is different in this critical respect \n     from any other appropriation rider ever objected to by \n     Executive Branch officials as an unconstitutional \n     infringement on the President's foreign affairs power or \n     other executive powers. In all such cases, the appropriations \n     riders have directed a particular course of action or \n     inaction by prohibiting certain uses of appropriated funds, \n     even if the President desired to take such actions in \n     fulfilling his constitutionally-assigned duties. Issues \n     Raised by Section 129 of Pub. L. No. 102-138 & Section 503 of \n     Pub. L. No. 102-140, supra, citing Section 503 of Pub. L. No. \n     102-140, 105 Stat. at 820 (1991) (``[N]one of the funds \n     provided in this Act shall be used by the Department of State \n     to issue more than one official or diplomatic passport to any \n     United States government employee. . . . ''); Appropriations \n     Limitation for Rules Vetoed by Congress, supra, citing H.R. \n     7584, Sec. 608, 96th Cong., 2nd Sess. (1980) (``None of the \n     funds appropriated or otherwise made available shall be \n     available to implement . . . any regulation which has been \n     disapproved pursuant to a resolution of disapproval duly \n     adopted. . . .'').\n\n[[Page S 15529]]\n\n       The Attorney General and OLC have reasoned that if Congress \n     is without constitutional power to make decisions for the \n     President in areas the Constitution commits to his \n     discretion, it matters not whether that intrusion is embodied \n     in appropriations or other legislation. In exercising its \n     power of the purse, Congress has no greater authority to \n     usurp the President's exclusive constitutional authority than \n     when it acts pursuant to other enumerated powers. See, The \n     Appropriations Power & the Necessary & Proper Clause, 68 \n     Wash. U. L. Q. 623, 30 (1990) (``[W]hen we hear discussions \n     about Congress' weighty role in . . . the foreign relations \n     power, and Congress adverts to `the power of the purse,' it \n     does not make sense. Congress still has to point to a \n     substantive power. The power of the purse . . . is only \n     procedural.'') (remarks by the Honorable William Barr).\n       Here, in contrast, Congress imposes no restrictions on \n     appropriated funds: such funds may continue to be used to \n     maintain an Embassy in Tel Aviv should the President decide \n     to leave the Embassy there. Accordingly, there is nothing in \n     S. 770 ``requiring the President to relinquish his \n     constitutional discretion in foreign affairs'' and thus OLC's \n     reliance on Executive Branch condemnation of such \n     appropriation riders is entirely misplaced. OLC Op., p. 4.\n       To be sure, if the President retains the status quo in \n     Israel, the State Department will have less funds in two \n     upcoming fiscal years than it would otherwise have, and so S. \n     770 is plainly designed to influence the President's decision \n     on the Jerusalem Embassy. But this sort of ``horse trading'' \n     is a basic staple of relations between the two political \n     branches and hardly infringes the President's constitutional \n     authority or powers. For example, the President has \n     unfettered constitutional authority to nominate whomever he \n     desires for, say, Surgeon General, and Congress does not \n     unconstitutionally interfere with that presidential \n     appointment authority by abolishing or reducing the funding \n     for the Surgeon General's Office if certain nominees are \n     proposed. Similarly, Congress may constitutionally pledge to \n     reduce financial support for certain foreign interests or \n     international organizations simply because it is displeased \n     with the President's exercise of his responsibilities as \n     foreign affairs spokesman or Commander-in-Chief. Since the \n     use of these sorts of quid pro quos to influence the \n     President's exercise of his constitutional duties does not \n     unconstitutionally interfere with those duties, S. 770's \n     establishment of such a device is similarly within Congress' \n     constitutional authority.\n       By entrusting the President with the authority to \n     definitively resolve certain questions, the Framers did not \n     erect a prophylactic shield protecting the President against \n     all attempts to influence the manner in which he resolves \n     those issues. Accordingly, the Founders did not erect some \n     special constitutional protection for the President which \n     immunizes him from the give and take of inter-branch \n     disagreements. Rather, they expected that a President of \n     ``tolerable firmness'' would be able to resist congressional \n     blandishments to pursue a course he deemed unwise, assuming \n     such appropriations riders survived his veto in the first \n     instance. Alexander Hamilton, ``The Federalist No. 73,'' at \n     445 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).\n       For this reason, even those scholars who believe Congress \n     ``ought not be able to regulate Presidential action by \n     conditions on the appropriation of funds . . . if it could \n     not regulate the action directly,'' Henkin, supra at 113, \n     acknowledge that establishment of financial penalties or \n     incentives to influence presidential action is permissible. \n     Henkin, supra at 79. (``Since the President is always coming \n     to Congress for money for innumerable purposes, domestic and \n     foreign, Congress and Congressional committees can use \n     appropriations and the appropriations process to bargain also \n     about other elements of Presidential policy and foreign \n     affairs.''). Indeed, the Attorney General has favorably \n     opined on the constitutionality of an appropriation rider \n     that imposed a markedly more onerous restriction on the \n     President's exclusive Commander-in-Chief powers than S. 770 \n     imposes on his foreign policy discretion. In 1909, Congress \n     attached the following rider to the Navy's appropriation:\n       ``[N]o part of the appropriations herein made for the \n     Marine Corps shall be expended for the purpose for which said \n     appropriations are made unless officers and enlisted men \n     shall serve on board all battleships and armored cruisers, \n     and also upon such other vessels of the navy as the President \n     may direct, in detachments of not less than eight percentum \n     of the strength of the enlisted men of the navy on said \n     vessels.'' Naval Appropriations Act of 1909, 35 Stat. 753, \n     773, reprinted in Appropriations--Marine Corps--Service on \n     Battleships, 27 Op. Att'y Gen. 259 (1909).\n       The Attorney General found this restriction constitutional \n     because, ``Congress has power to create or not to create . . \n     . a marine corps, make appropriation for its pay, [and] \n     provide that such appropriation shall not be made available \n     unless the marine corps be employed in some designated way . \n     . .'' 27 Op. Att'y Gen. at 260.\n       So far as we can discern, neither OLC nor the Attorney \n     General have subsequently disavowed or undermined the \n     vitality of this Attorney General Opinion, although they \n     opined at times that appropriation riders could not direct \n     the President to take action within his constitutional \n     sphere. Presumably, then, even Executive Branch officials \n     have recognized a distinction between impermissible riders \n     that mandate certain action or inaction and permissible ones \n     which, like the Marine Corps appropriation, provide the \n     President with at least a nominal choice between two courses \n     of action, with financial ``penalties'' if he chooses the \n     disfavored option. In the 1909 naval appropriation, the \n     President's ``choice'' was between having marines constitute \n     eight percent of battleship crews or having no funding for \n     the Marine Corps at all. This complete defunding penalty for \n     exercising the disfavored option is obviously far more \n     draconian than the 50% reduction in construction funding \n     occasioned by S. 770.\n       In short, there is an obvious and constitutionally \n     significant difference between an appropriations law \n     forbidding the President to take action which the \n     Constitution leaves to his discretion and a law which merely \n     sets out the negative financial consequences that will ensue \n     if the President pursues a certain policy. This distinction \n     between coercive laws and laws which offer financial \n     incentives to exercise one's sovereign power in the preferred \n     way has been well-recognized by the Supreme Court in directly \n     analogous circumstances.\n       Most notably, in South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203 (1987), \n     the Supreme Court considered a congressional statute, known \n     as Section 158, which directed the Secretary of \n     Transportation to withold five percent of allocable highway \n     funds from any state in which individuals under the age of 21 \n     could legally purchase or possess alcohol. Like S. 770, the \n     funding mechanism in Dole constituted a congressional attempt \n     to provide indirect financial inducement to affect policy in \n     an area presumably beyond Congress' power to legislate \n     directly.\n       Despite earlier recognition that the ``Twenty-first \n     Amendment grants States virtually complete control over \n     whether to permit importation or sale of liquor and how to \n     structure the liquor distribution system,'' \\5\\ the Court \n     upheld this statutory incursion into state sovereignty, \n     asserting that the ``encouragement to state action found in \n     Sec. 158 is a valid use of the spending power.'' Dole, 483 \n     U.S. at 212. Accordingly, even though the Constitution \n     assigned to the states the responsibility for establishing \n     drinking ages, and thus Congress presumably could not direct \n     the states to set a minimum age, this funding restriction was \n     permissible because ``Congress has acted indirectly under its \n     spending power to encourage uniformity in the States' \n     drinking ages.'' Id. at 206. Thus, such restrictions are \n     permissible because the potential recipient of appropriated \n     federal funds is free to reject Congress' financial \n     inducement and exercise unfettered discretion in the relevant \n     area, so long as the recipient is willing to endure the \n     financial sacrifice that ensues. Id. at 211-212 (``Congress \n     has offered . . . encouragement to the States to enact higher \n     minimum drinking ages than they would otherwise choose. But \n     the enactment of such laws remains the prerogative of the \n     States not merely in theory but in fact.''). Similarly, in \n     upholding federal appropriation riders requiring the \n     regulation of State employees' political activities, the \n     Supreme Court has ruled that even though Congress ``has no \n     power to regulate local political activities as such of state \n     officials,'' the federal government nevertheless ``does have \n     power to fix the terms upon which its money allotments to \n     states shall be disbursed.'' Oklahoma v. Civil Service \n     Comm'n, 330 U.S. 127, 143 (1947). The Court found that the \n     state's sovereignty remained intact because the state could \n     adopt ``the `simple expedient' of not yielding to what she \n     urges is federal coercion.'' Id. at 143-144.\n       Thus, Dole would seem to directly establish that the sort \n     of conditional funding provided by S. 770 is constitutionally \n     permissible. In Oklahoma and Dole, the Tenth and Twenty-first \n     Amendments provided the states with exclusive authority over \n     their employees' political activities and citizens' legal \n     drinking age, yet Congress did not unconstitutionally \n     infringe these powers by offering financial incentives to \n     adopt a particular policy. By the same token, the fact that \n     the Constitution vests the President with exclusive \n     recognition authority does not disable Congress from using \n     its plenary spending power to seek to influence the exercise \n     of that authority.\n       Like the drinking-age restriction in Dole, the funding \n     mechanism in S. 770 merely attempts to induce recipients of \n     federal funds to pursue policy ends advocated by Congress via \n     clearly established conditions on future appropriations, \n     while leaving that decisionmaker with the option of refusing \n     such conditions. The President may exercise his discretion to \n     retain the American embassy in Tel Aviv and accept the \n     potential of reduced congressional funding in certain related \n     discretionary accounts, or he can move the embassy. S. 770 \n     does nothing to alter the fundamental fact that the decision \n     as to where to locate the U.S. embassy in Israel ``remains \n     the prerogative'' of the President ``not merely in theory but \n     in fact.'' Dole, 483 U.S. at 211-12.\\6\\\n       To be sure, the President differs from state governments \n     because, as noted, he cannot pursue any action requiring \n     expenditures without congressional funding. Thus a blanket \n     prohibition against using appropriated funds does not leave \n     him with any option to pursue the proscribed activity. \n     Because of this distinction, a straightforward restriction \n     against using any funds for an action \n\n[[Page S 15530]]\n     otherwise within the President's constitutional power is an effective \n     prohibition against taking such action and thus presents a \n     different, and more difficult, constitutional question. As \n     noted, however, that is not the situation here. The President \n     has been offered a choice directly analogous to that offered \n     the states in Dole--he may pursue the congressionally \n     disfavored option and accept the financial consequences or \n     acquiesce to the preferred option without any such sacrifice.\n       OLC has nonetheless previously sought to distinguish Dole \n     on the grounds that the Supreme Court's decision in \n     Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority v. Citizens for \n     the Abatement of Aircraft Noise, 111 S. Ct. 2298 (1991) \n     (hereinafter ``MWAA'') found Dole ``inapplicable'' to issues \n     that ``involve separation-of-powers principles.'' Issues \n     Raised by Section 129 of Pub. L. No. 102-138 and Section 503 \n     of Pub. L. No 102-140, supra, at 31. This assertion is \n     patently untrue. MWAA in no way suggests that, while Congress \n     is free to use its spending power to influence the sovereign \n     power of states guaranteed by the Tenth Amendment and the \n     Constitution's basic structure, the sovereign powers of the \n     President are somehow different and thus immune from such \n     congressional blandishments. Contrary to OLC's misleading \n     selective quotation, MWAA never said Dole's rationale was \n     ``inapplicable'' to cases involving ``separation-of-powers \n     principles,'' it simply stated that Dole's rationale was \n     ``inapplicable to the issue presented by this case.'' MWAA, \n     1111 S. Ct. at 2309 (emphasis added). Dole's rationale was \n     inapplicable not because the sovereign authority of the \n     President is somehow different from that of the states, but \n     because the infringement of executive powers in MWAA was \n     obviously and significantly different from the funding \n     appropriation conditions at issue in Dole.\n       The issue that divided the dissenting and majority opinions \n     in MWAA was whether Congress was effectively responsible for \n     creating the Board of Review, which was composed of Members \n     of Congress and had veto power over the Airport Authority's \n     important decisions. Id. at 2313 (White, J. dissenting). The \n     dissent argued that no separation-of-powers issue was \n     implicated by this Board of Review because the Commonwealth \n     of Virginia (and the District of Columbia) had created that \n     Board and no federalism principles prevented the states from \n     so utilizing the talents of Members of Congress. Id. \n     According to the dissent, the fact that Congress had coerced \n     Virginia to make this decision was of no moment because this \n     ``coercion'' was no different than Congress' use of the \n     spending power to influence states in Dole. Id. at 2316-17.\n       In the section of the opinion relied upon by OLC, the \n     majority refuted both prongs of the dissent's arguments:\n       ``Here, unlike Dole, there is no question about federal \n     power to operate the airports. The question is whether the \n     maintenance of federal control over the airports by means of \n     the Board of Review, which is allegedly a federal \n     instrumentality, is invalid, not because it invades any state \n     power, but because Congress' continued control violates the \n     separation-of-powers principle, the aim of which is to \n     protect not the States but ``the whole people from \n     improvident laws.'' Chadha, at 951, 103 S. Ct. at 2784. \n     Nothing in our opinion in Dole implied that a highway grant \n     to a State could have been conditioned on the State's \n     creating a ``Highway Board of Review'' composed of Members of \n     Congress.''--Id. at 2309.\n       The first two sentences merely make the obvious point that \n     since MWAA deals with a ``federal instrumentality'' and there \n     was no question about the propriety of ``federal power to \n     operate the airports,'' there is simply no issue of federal \n     interference with state power.\\7\\ Since there was no question \n     of federal interference with, or bargaining for, state power, \n     the only relevant question was who controlled the federal \n     power--Congress or the Executive. In that regard, Congress \n     had not ``bargained'' with the Executive by establishing \n     financial conditions analogous to S. 770, but had directly \n     commandeered control over the Airport Authority by \n     establishing the Review Board.\n       The third sentence in the quoted passage simply says that \n     Dole is inapplicable because the infringement in MWAA is \n     different from the appropriation restriction in Dole and \n     would be impermissible if applied to the states. This \n     obviously belies the assertion that Dole was found \n     inapplicable because different standards govern infringement \n     on the President's powers than those which govern state \n     intrusions. Specifically, Dole was distinguishable because, \n     in MWAA, Congress did not provide money in return for \n     Virginia exercising its sovereignty in a certain way. Rather, \n     Virginia agreed to transfer its sovereignty over the Airport \n     Authority to Congress. As the opinion's derisive citation to \n     a ``Highway Board of Review'' makes clear, while the federal \n     government may use its spending power to influence a state's \n     exercise of its own sovereignty, Congress cannot use its \n     spending power to induce the state to enhance congressional \n     authority by creating congressionally-controlled federal \n     instrumentalities. In short, Virginia was not trading away \n     its own state power over airports; it had none. Rather, it \n     was trading away the pre-existing Executive power over the \n     airports to Congress. Since Virginia obviously had no \n     Executive power to trade, Congress could not invoke Dole to \n     justify its exercise of Executive power.\n       As this detailed review establishes, MWAA said that Dole \n     was inapplicable because 1) there was no state power to \n     bargain away, and 2) states cannot enhance congressional \n     power in return for congressional dollars. Nothing in MWAA \n     suggests that Dole was inapposite because the Executive, \n     unlike states, in somehow disabled from agreeing to exercise \n     his sovereign authority in a particular manner in return for \n     increased congressional monies.\n       To the contrary, like the states, the Executive Branch, \n     ``absent coercion . . . has both the incentive and the \n     ability to protect its own rights and powers, and therefore \n     may cede such rights and powers.'' MWAA, 111 S. Ct. at 2309. \n     The fact that preserving the President's powers against \n     congressional enactments is ultimately designed to protect \n     the ``whole people from improvident laws'' does not suggest a \n     different rule, since the federalism concerns implicated in \n     Dole were also designed to preserve the people's liberty. See \n     U.S. v. Lopez, 115 S. Ct. 1624, 1626-27 (1995) (``Just as the \n     separation and independence of the coordinate branches of the \n     Federal Government serves to prevent the accumulation of \n     excessive power in any one branch, a healthy balance of power \n     between the States and the Federal Government will reduce the \n     risk of tyranny and abuse from either front.''), quoting \n     Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 458 (1991); New York v. \n     U.S., 112 S. Ct. 2408, 2431 (1992) (``[t]he Constitution \n     divides authority between federal and state governments for \n     the protection of individuals.'') (emphasis added.)\n       To be sure, under MWAA, Congress could not condition \n     appropriations on the President's agreement to establish an \n     ``Israeli Embassy Board of Review,'' where congressional \n     agents determine the location of the Embassy. The President \n     cannot transfer his recognition powers to congressional \n     decisionmakers and, as indicated, there is a plausible \n     argument that Congress cannot directly supplant the \n     President's decisionmaking authority on such matters, even \n     though directives in appropriations bills. Like any other \n     sovereign, however, the President may consider many factors \n     in making his own decisions. Just as he may consider the \n     reaction of foreign countries, he may also consider a \n     negative congressional reaction. Accordingly, nothing \n     precludes Congress from seeking to influence that decision \n     through use of its own constitutional powers including the \n     spending power.\n       Indeed, OLC's contrary position demeans the President's \n     constitutional status and certainly cannot be advanced in the \n     name of a strong Executive. The OLC Opinion suggests that the \n     President, unlike the states, lacks the ability or the will \n     to resist Congress' financial inducements. Particularly given \n     the existence of his veto power, this view of the President's \n     authority vis-a-vis Congress is obviously untenable and \n     irreconcilable with the Framers' views. The Framers did not \n     erect a prophylactic constitutional umbrella protecting the \n     President from the persuasive power of Congress' financial \n     inducements, they forged only a shield against congressional \n     directives. OLC simply ignores this vital distinction and the \n     Executive Branch and judicial precedent which support it.\n       Under these precedents and a proper understanding of the \n     constitutional framework, S. 770 does not violate any \n     separation-of-powers principle or infringe any constitutional \n     authority of the President.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ Section 4 of S. 770 merely reprograms $5 million in funds \n     appropriated in the Departments of Commerce, Justice, State, \n     the Judiciary and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of \n     1995.

Given the \n     identical requirement that ``not less than [the earmarked \n     amount] . . . shall be made available'' in fiscal years 1996 \n     and 1997 respectively, the President has discretion as to \n     whether to use the money, but cannot use earmarked funds for \n     other general purposes.\n     \\2\\ See, e.g., Alfred Dunhill of London, Inc. v.

See United States v. Butler, \n     297 U.S. 1, 69-70, 74 (1936): United States v. Lovett, 328 \n     U.S. 303, 315-16 (1946) (striking a funding restriction as a \n     bill of attainder in violation of the U.S. Constitution). \n     Obviously, this doctrine has no application here since the \n     Constitution does not prohibit moving the American Embassy in \n     Israel to Jerusalem. However, OLC, as it has in the past, \n     further maintains that the spending power cannot be used to \n     force the President to take action that is perfectly \n     constitutional, if the appropriation restricts the \n     President's power to exercise his unfettered discretion in an \n     area within his constitutional authority. There is no \n     judicial precedent either way on OLC's extension of the \n     independent constitutional bar principle in a separation-of-\n     powers context. In the context of congressional funding \n     conditions on state governments, the Supreme Court has \n     unequivocally rejected an expanded notion of the independent \n     constitutional bar:\n     ``[T]he ``independent constitutional bar'' limitation on the \n     spending bar is not, as petitioners suggest, a prohibition on \n     the indirect achievement of objectives which Congress is not \n     empowered to achieve directly. Instead, we think that the \n     language in our earlier opinions stands for the \n     unexceptionable proposition that the power may not be used to \n     induce activities that would themselves be \n     unconstitutional.''\n     South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 210 (1987). See also \n     Oklahoma v. Civil Service Commission, 330 U.S. 127 (1947). Of \n     course, the President, unlike the states, has no access to \n     funds other than those appropriated by Congress. Thus, unlike \n     the situation with state governments, a prohibition \n     precluding the President from spending any appropriated \n     monies on a particular activity is a direct prohibition \n     against pursuing that activity. This provides a plausible \n     basis for distinguishing the statute involved in Dole from a \n     direct appropriations restriction on the President's \n     activities. As we discuss below, however, Dole provides \n     direct support, where, as here, there is no prohibition \n     against spending money on the President's desired activity.\n     \\5\\ California Retail Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal \n     Aluminum, 445 U.S. 97, 110 (1980) cited in Dole, 483 U.S. at \n     205.\n     \\6\\ The Supreme Court has recognized that at some point, a \n     financial inducement becomes so lucrative that ``pressure \n     turns into compulsion'' and such incentive becomes \n     unconstitutional coercion. Dole, 483 U.S. at 211. See also, \n     Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, 301 U.S. 548, 590 (1937). \n     However, the Dole Court dismissed any claim of coercion \n     involved in the drinking age funding provision, stating that \n     the ``relatively small percentage'' of highway funds involved \n     in the cutoff were not coercive. 483 U.S. at 211. The Court \n     further asserted that the mere fact that a conditional grant \n     of money is successful in achieving compliance with \n     congressional restrictions will not establish coercion. Id. \n     seems clear that, given the minuscule amount of funding \n     involved in S. 770, especially relative to the substantial \n     highway fund allocations involved in Dole, the incentive \n     mechanism at issue could not be deemed coercive. Should the \n     President refuse to move the embassy, he would be barred from \n     obligating funds amounting to a mere one percent of the \n     budget authority reserved for international affairs in each \n     of the fiscal years involved and a mere one one-hundredth of \n     one percent of the aggregate budget in those same years. \n     Office of Management & Budget, ``Appendix to the Budget of \n     the United States for Fiscal Year 1996'' 692-93 (1995); \n     Office of Management & Budget, ``Historical Tables to \n     Supplement the Budget of the United States for Fiscal Year \n     1996'' 14, 69 (1995).\n     \\7\\ The Court had previously noted that the Board of Review \n     was ``an entity created at the initiative of Congress, the \n     powers of which Congress has delineated, the purpose of which \n     is to protect an acknowledged federal interest, and \n     membership in which is restricted to congressional officials. \n     Such an entity necessarily exercises sufficient federal power \n     as an agent of Congress to mandate separation-of-powers \n     scrutiny.''

Throughout history, Jerusalem has been \n     the capital of the Jewish nation and must remain so. For the \n     Embassy of the United States--``Israel's closest friend''--\n     not to be in the functioning capital of Israel is an anomaly. \n     Israel is the only country in the world where the U.S. \n     Embassy is located in a city not regarded by the host nation \n     as its capital. The basis for the Embassy not being located \n     in Jerusalem was incorrect from the beginning, and this \n     policy should finally be corrected.\n       Jerusalem is sacred to all three monotheistic religions but \n     is meaning is not equal for them. In Christendom and Islam \n     there are many spiritual centers and many symbolic capitals. \n     In Judaism and for the Jewish people, there is only one \n     Jerusalem.\n       Public attention is focused on whether or not this is the \n     ``right time'' for such a move. I believe it is. The \n     placement of the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem has been a \n     consensus issue for the American Jewish community and for \n     successive Israeli governments for years. In the last decade, \n     both Houses of Congress have enacted four resolutions calling \n     on the U.S. government to acknowledge united Jerusalem as the \n     capital of Israel.\n       The Dole/Inouye legislation, which is cosponsored by a \n     majority of the U.S. Senate, will be put to a vote. It must \n     be enacted by an overwhelming majority. Failure to do so will \n     send a wrong message to the Arab States. It is imperative to \n     establish now the U.S. conviction that realistic negotiations \n     be premised on the principle that Jerusalem is the capital of \n     Israel, and must remain united, Israelis of all political \n     stripes are for the establishment of the U.S. Embassy in \n     Jerusalem. The site reserved for the new Embassy is in West \n     Jerusalem--on land which has been part of Israel since 1948.\n       Support for this legislation is, and has always been, \n     bipartisan. Now is the time to move forward with it.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Teddy Kollek.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n   Yossi Beilin on Legislation to Move the United States Embassy to \n                               Jerusalem\n\n       (Press conference with Israeli journalists, Oct. 12, 1995)\n\n       Question.

I'm only sorry that this has become part of election \n     strife in Congress between the Republicans and Democrats in a \n     bit of a cynical manner. To my disappointment, it has been \n     promised by the opposition but then it was not carried out.\n       Question. Aren't you concerned that it will hurt the peace \n     process or the standing of the U.S. in the eyes of the Arabs \n     if the legislation will pass?\n       Beilin. Israel is the only nation in the world that doesn't \n     have a recognized capital and I am not prepared to accept \n     that if Israel has a recognized capital this will affect the \n     negotiations.\n\n  Mr. KYL. The waiver provision in S. 1322 will be examined by many \npeople.

I agree with my friend from Arizona, that it is important \nto address the scope and meaning of the waiver provision. It is \nimportant that no one think that this provision would allow the \nPresident to ignore the requirements of S. 1322 simply because he \ndisagrees with the policy this legislation is promulgating. The \nPresident cannot lawfully invoke this waiver simply because he thinks \nit would be better not to move our Embassy to Jerusalem or simply \nbecause he thinks it would be better to move it at a later time. The \nwaiver is designed to be read and interpreted narrowly. It was included \nto give the President limited flexibility--flexibility to ensure that \nthis legislation will not harm U.S. national security interests in the \nevent of an emergency or unforeseen change in circumstances.\n  Mr. KYL. What is the significance of the phrase ``national security \ninterests'' as opposed to ``national interest''?\n  Mr. DOLE. This is the way we are ensuring that the waiver will not \npermit the President to negate the legislation simply on the grounds \nthat he disagrees with the policy. ``National security interests'' in \nmuch narrower than the term ``national interest''--and it is a higher \nstandard than national interest. The key word is security. No President \nshould or could make a decision to exercise this waiver lightly.\n  Mr. KYL. Is it fair to say that the intention of the waiver is to \naddress constitutional concerns that have been raised about S. 1322?\n  Mr. DOLE. It is fair to say the waiver is intended to address unusual \nor unforeseen circumstances. We believe S. 1322 is constitutional even \nwithout the waiver, but the constitutional questions that have been \nraise about it deal \n\n[[Page S 15532]]\nwith issues so important that we think it is best to offer the \nPresident the limited flexibility of the waiver. It is within the \nconstitutional appropriations power of Congress to withhold funds from \nthe executive branch if it does not act in accordance with \ncongressional mandates.\n  Mr. KYL. Although in drafting the legislation Senators did not limit \nthe number of times the President could invoke the waiver authority, is \nit correct to say that the intent of the drafters is not to grant the \nPresident the right to invoke the waiver in perpetuity?\n  Mr. DOLE. The waiver authority should not be interpreted to mean that \nthe President may infinitely push off the establishment of the American \nEmbassy in Jerusalem. Our intent is that the Embassy be established in \nJerusalem by May 1999. If a waiver were to be repeatedly and routinely \nexercised by a President, I would expect Congress to act by removing \nthe waiver authority.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from California.\n  I would ask how much time is left, because I want to be certain that \nmy colleague from Delaware has a chance to say a few words.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. After your 4 minutes, there will be 3\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining on your side.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. And also for the Senator from California and the \nSenator from Connecticut. I will try to wrap up in a couple minutes \nbecause yesterday I think I expressed myself and my full support for \nthis substitute.\n  I want to commend the majority leader, Senator Dole, and Senator Kyl \nfor the hard work that they did to move this legislation along to \nensure that the capital of Israel, the capital chosen by that State, is \ngoing to be home to our Embassy, as it ought to be.\n  Frankly, there was some difficulty in arriving at the consensus view \nthat we finally did. And that was largely, not because we disagreed on \nthe objective, that is, moving our Embassy to Jerusalem, but because \nperhaps there might have been an involvement that would have interfered \nwith the orderly discussion of the peace process.\n  Madam President, the one thing that I want to be sure of is that as \nmuch as possible we stop the killing in the Middle East, that as much \nas possible we get these parties together on an open and honest basis. \nAnd the process is in being at this moment. There has not been in the \nhistory of the creation of the State of Israel a friendlier President \nthan President Clinton is to Israel.\n  We saw on the lawn of the White House the celebration of the end of \nenormous hostilities that existed for decades where people just looking \nat one another were almost ready at first sight to kill each other.\n  Yesterday's story in the Washington Post was a poignant recollection \nof what happens to two families, one Arab, one Jew, who lost their \nsons, one responsible in a way for the death of the other, but \nnonetheless no one seeking revenge, no one looking for vengeance. What \nthey wanted to do was make sure that other families did not have to \nmourn the loss of a son or a daughter, be they Palestinian or Jew.\n  That is the way we ought to be approaching this. And I think, Madam \nPresident, that is what is going to happen. All of us want the Embassy \nmoved. The question is, we want it to happen as soon as possible, but \nwe want the peace discussions to continue, as I said, in an orderly \nfashion.\n  I worked very closely with some dear friends, with Senator Lieberman \nfrom Connecticut, with whom I share a very deep interest in the State \nof Israel, in Jerusalem, in the peace process, and with Senator Biden \nwho has had a long history of support for Israel. And I want to commend \nSenator Feinstein for her diligence, for her insight into the problem, \nand for getting us to this point where I believe that the supporting \nvote will be almost unanimous, as I believe it should be.\n  And so, Madam President, it is a moment that not yet calls for \ncelebration, but does initiate a process of which I think we can all be \nproud.\n  Madam President, I support this substitute amendment.\n  Unlike the original bill, this amendment includes a waiver for the \nPresident. I believe the amendment will mandate the move of the \nAmerican Embassy to Jerusalem while providing the administration \nflexibility in case it's necessary for national security reasons.\n  Madam President, I have long supported having the American Embassy in \nJerusalem. I wish the American Embassy had been opened in Jerusalem \nlong ago, when the State was established or when the city was reunified \nin 1967. I believe Jerusalem--a city I have visited many times--will \nalways remain the undivided capital of the State of Israel.\n  The pace at which the Middle East peace process has yielded tangible \nresults has been breathtaking. Just 2 years ago, on September 13, 1993, \nPrime Minister Rabin and Yasir Arafat agreed to end decades of \nbloodshed when they signed the historic Declaration of Principles and \nshook hands at the White House. Continuing their pursuit of peace, they \nsigned the Cairo Agreement on Gaza and Jericho on May 4, 1994. And just \nweeks ago, on September 28, 1995, they again met at the White House to \nsign an agreement on the West Bank.\n  Jordan, too, has been brought into the process and has signed a \nformal peace agreement with Israel.\n  America should be proud of the role it has played in helping former \nenemies agree to end hostilities. To be sure, the parties in the Middle \nEast needed to be ready to take the giant step toward peace. It was \ntheir readiness and their political courage that made peace attainable.\n  The amendment we offer now would help protect the peace process \nshould national security interests warrant it. The amendment would \nprovide a national security waiver for periods of up to 6 months with \nprior reporting to Congress. It was included to give the administration \na limited amount of flexibility.\n  It also includes a clear expression of the Congress' belief that \nJerusalem should remain an undivided city in which the rights of every \nethnic and religious group are protected. It expresses the Congress' \nclear view that Jerusalem should be recognized as the capital of the \nState of Israel and that our Embassy there should be established by May \n1999.\n  I am firmly convinced, Mr. President, that the peace process will \nresult in Israel retaining control over all of Jerusalem, and that \nJerusalem will remain the undivided capital of Israel.\n  I am encouraged by support for the peace process. Even those who have \nlost their children to senseless acts of terrorism agree about the \nimperative of achieving peace. Earlier this year, a young college \nstudent from New Jersey, who was studying in Israel, was killed in a \nsuicide bombing in Gaza. Her name was Aliza Flatow, and her death \nbrought home to the people of New Jersey the urgent need to bring peace \nto the Middle East.\n  I was in Israel at the time of this terrible tragedy, and from there, \nI spoke to Aliza's parents in New Jersey. Despite the loss of their \ndaughter and in the midst of grieving her loss, Aliza's father urged me \nto do whatever I could to support the peace process and to ensure that \nit would move forward unimpeded. Only the peace process, he said, holds \nthe promise of bringing an end to these senseless deaths.\n  Our goal is to send a bill to President Clinton that will mandate the \nopening of the Embassy in Jerusalem. The amendment we are offering is \nconsistent with that goal. It would represent a clear policy statement \nthat the Embassy will be moved and is intended to preserve the \nPresident's constitutional authority. Absent a national security \ninterest, it requires the Embassy to be established in Jerusalem by May \n1999.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Graham \nfrom Florida be added as a cosponsor to the legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. At this time I would yield time to the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. How much time remains?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I do not think I need more than 3 minutes.\n  Mr. KYL. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  \n[[Page S 15533]]\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  I thank my friend and colleague from Arizona, not only for yielding \ntime but for the extraordinary leadership and dedication he has shown \nin his support of this measure.\n  Madam President, perhaps it is appropriate that I begin with some \nwords from the prophets.\n  Amos first.\n\n       In that day I will raise up the tabernacle of David that is \n     fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise \n     up his ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old.\n\n  Then Jeremiah.\n\n       So says the Lord; Behold I will return the captives of the \n     tents of Jacob . . . and the city will be rebuilt on its \n     mound.\n\n  Madam President, tomorrow in this Capitol we will join in the \nworldwide celebration of the 3,000th anniversary of the entering of \nKing David into the holy city of Jerusalem.\n  In our time, in 1948, thanks to the courage of the people of the \nState of Israel, thanks to extraordinary support from people throughout \nthe world, including particularly the Government of the United States, \nwe witnessed the creation of the modern State of Israel and the \nestablishment of Jerusalem as its capital.\n  For the ensuing 47 years, for a lot of reasons that were not \nadequate, we in the United States, administration after administration \nof both parties, refused to locate our Embassy in Israel in the city of \nJerusalem designated as the capital by that country as we do in \nvirtually every other country in the world.\n  Today, thanks to the leadership of Senator Dole who began this \neffort, of Senator Moynihan who has fought for it for so many years, of \nSenator Inouye, Senator Kyl, Senator Biden, who is on the floor, who \nhas been unyielding and persistent in his support of this principle \nand, in the last few days, working together with Senators Feinstein and \nLautenberg, we have come to the point where I think we fashioned an \nextraordinarily strong and honest bill that will receive overwhelming \nbipartisan support in both Chambers and I hope will be signed by the \nPresident.\n  Madam President, I want to say that there have been concerns raised \nabout the impact that passing this measure now would have on the peace \nprocess. In this regard, I will make two brief points. First, the \nlocation of the U.S. Embassy never was and never should be the subject \nof negotiations among third parties. It is our decision, it is an \nAmerican decision, and we will make it here today.\n  Second, as a supporter of the peace process in the Middle East, I \nfeel particularly that this is the moment, as trust grows--and honesty \nis at the core of our relations with the Israelis and the Palestinians \nand the Arab world--that we do what is honest and say clearly our \nEmbassy belongs in Jerusalem, the city that has been denoted by the \nIsraelis as their capital.\n  I will say in closing, ending, it seems to me, appropriately with a \nPsalm that we are realizing in this vote today the hopes expressed by \nDavid in Psalm 122, when he wrote:\n\n       Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that \n     love thee.\n       Peace be within thy walls, calm within thy palaces.\n\n  If I may offer a modern-day interpretation of the word palaces, calm \nbe within thy embassies as they locate in the city of Jerusalem.\n  I thank the Chair and my friends and colleagues. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I yield the remainder of my time to \nthe Senator from Delaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized for 3 \nminutes, 32 seconds.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, thank you very much. I would like to \nthank my colleague from California for her leadership in bringing about \nwhat I think is a workable piece of legislation.\n  I would like to thank Senator Moynihan, who is not here. In 1983, he \nstarted this process. He argued we should be doing this, and we are \nfinally getting there.\n  With regard to the last point made by my colleague from Connecticut \nabout the peace process, I have had the view for the past 24 years that \nthe only way there will be peace in the Middle East is for the Arabs to \nknow there is no division between the United States and Israel--none, \nzero, none.\n  I argue that is why we are where we are today, because we did not \nrelent under the leadership of this President and others. We made it \nclear that no wedge would be put between us, thereby leaving no \nalternative but the pursuit, in an equitable manner, for peace.\n  Those familiar, and all are on this floor, with the Jewish people \nknow the central meaning that the ancient city of Jerusalem has for \nJews everywhere. Time and again, empires have tried to sever the \numbilical cord that unites Jews with their capital.\n  They have destroyed the temple. They have banished the Jews from \nliving in Jerusalem. They have limited the number of Jews allowed to \nimmigrate to that city. And, finally, in this century, they tried \nsimply to eliminate Jews.\n  (Mr. KYL assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. BIDEN. They may have succeeded, Mr. President, in destroying \nphysical structures and lives. But they have never succeeded in wholly \neliminating Jewish presence in Jerusalem, or in cutting the spiritual \nbond between Jews and their cherished capital.\n  After the horrific events of the Holocaust, the Jewish people \nreturned to claim what many rulers have tried to deny them for \ncenturies: The right to peaceful existence in their own country in \ntheir own capital.\n  How many of us can forget that poignant photograph of an unnamed \nIsraeli soldier breaking down in tears and prayer as he reached the \nWestern Wall after his army liberated the eastern half of the city in \nthe Six Day War?\n  Those tears told a story. A story of a people long denied their \nrightful place among nations. A people denied access to their most \nhallowed religious sites. A people who had finally, after long \ntribulation, come home.\n  Mr. President, it is unconscionable for us to refuse to recognize the \nright of the Jewish people to choose their own capital. What gives us \nthe right to second-guess their decision?\n  For 47 years, we, and much of the rest of the international \ncommunity, have been living a lie. For 47 years, Israel has had its \ngovernment offices, its Parliament, and its national monuments in \nJerusalem, not in Tel Aviv. And yet, nearly all embassies are located \nin Tel Aviv. I think this is a denial of fundamental reality.\n  Mr. President, are we, through the continued sham of maintaining our \nEmbassy in Tel Aviv, to refuse to acknowledge what the Jewish people \nknow in their hearts to be true? Regardless of what others may think, \nJerusalem is the capital of Israel.\n  And Israel is not just any old country. It is a vital strategic ally.\n  As the Israelis and Palestinians begin the final status negotiations \nin May 1996--negotiations, I might add, that were made possible through \nthe leadership of President Clinton--it should be clear to all that the \nUnited States stands squarely behind Israel, our close friend and ally.\n  Moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem will send the right signal, not \na destructive signal. To do less would be to play into the hands of \nthose who will try their hardest to deny Israel the full attributes of \nstatehood.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority \nleader for bringing this to a head. It has not been easy. We have \ntalked about this for years. The people of Israel have fought \nrepeatedly to hold the State of Israel intact. They have designated \ntheir capital. The capital is Jerusalem. This historic, important \nreligious city is their capital. I think it is most unusual for the \nUnited States to go to another city to establish its Embassy when the \ncountry where we are being hosted has established a different city for \nits capital.\n  The time has come long since for America to recognize the capital \ncity of Israel. It is Jerusalem. It is time for us to move in a \nresponsible way to \n\n[[Page S 15534]]\nhave our Embassy also in the capital city of Jerusalem.\n  I commend the majority leader and the Senator from Arizona for their \nleadership in this area. I appreciate the fact that all factions have \ncome together. Clearly, there must be some leeway for the President to \nmake this move in a timely way. I think that leeway has been granted. \nThis is quite a reasonable resolution. The time has come for us to have \nour Embassy in the capital of Israel. The capital is Jerusalem.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto use my leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield 1 minute to the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, finally, after 50 years, the Congress is \nabout to act to assure the movement of our Embassy to Israel's capital. \nThis has been a bipartisan effort. I have been proud to cosponsor \nSenator Dole's legislation, and it is truly a historic day. This is a \nmeaningful day. It is a day where we finally acknowledge the reality, \nwhich is that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel and that at the end of \nthe peace process will be the capital of Israel.\n  It will not help the peace process for there to be any ambiguity \nabout where Israel's capital is. Our action today will help to \neliminate any such ambiguity and to make it clear to all concerned that \nthis country is finally going to do in Israel what we have done in \nevery single country in the world, which is to place our Embassy in the \ncapital city.\n  I want to thank the Democratic leader. I want to thank the majority \nleader, also, for his leadership here. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, let me commend the distinguished \nSenator from Michigan for his comments and associate myself with his \nremarks. This has been a bipartisan effort over the last several weeks, \nparticularly the last several days.\n  There is little doubt that we all share the same goals. There has \nbeen a good-faith effort to reach an agreement that allowed us the \nconfidence that those goals could be met.\n  I want to commend in particular the participants in those \nnegotiations over the last several days, Senators Feinstein, my good \nfriend, Senator Kyl, Senators Lautenberg and Lieberman, and certainly \nthe majority leader for all of the work that he put into ensuring that \nwe would reach this point today.\n  I think it is fair to say we all agree on three shared goals. The \nfirst is the most obvious: moving the Embassy to Jerusalem. We \nrecognize that Jerusalem is the spiritual center and the capital of \nIsrael, as well as a special city for those all over the world. Each \ncountry, as so many have already indicated, has the right to designate \nits capital, and certainly our Embassy should be there.\n  Second, we want to ensure that Jerusalem remains an undivided city in \nwhich the rights of every ethnic and religious group are protected. \nThat has been a goal articulated officially by this Senate since we \nadopted Senate Concurrent Resolution 106 in 1990.\n  Third, and perhaps most important in the context of this debate and \nthe negotiations that have taken place, we want to ensure that the \npeace process moves forward.\n  Let me commend the administration for emphasizing as strongly as they \nhave their concern for that last goal. It is their concern and their \ndesire to ensure that we have the flexibility, that we have the \nopportunities, that we have all of the tools necessary to ensure that \nwe can reach all three goals--that we move the Embassy, that we can \nensure that it remains an undivided city, and, most importantly, that \nthe peace process be allowed to continue.\n  I personally believe that the language that has now been agreed upon \nwill provide the President the flexibility to ensure that the peace \nprocess can move forward. Definitely, the whole concept of a peace \nprocess is in our national security interest. That peace process must \nbe contained. That peace process has to be nurtured throughout the next \nseveral years, and certainly the administration needs to proceed very \ncarefully as we begin to articulate our goals as it relates to moving \nthe Embassy.\n  The administration has concerns about the constitutionality of this \nlegislation. I understand that. I hope that we can find this agreement \nhas adequately addressed those concerns, as well.\n  Clearly, this has to be an effort on which we continue to work with \nthe administration. I am very hopeful that, as a result of the \ntremendous work that has been done in the last several days, we can \nbuild upon our work with the State Department and with others in the \nadministration to ensure that our goals are realized.\n  Let me again commend all of those who were instrumental in reaching \nthis agreement, to ensure a U.S. commitment to an Embassy in Jerusalem, \nand equally as important, Madam President, to ensure that the U.S. \ncommitment to the peace process maintains the kind of priority that we \nall have recognized during these very difficult talks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes and 12 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Madam President. Madam President, I am pleased \nand honored to close this debate on this important and historic \nlegislation which will finally cause the United States Embassy to be \nrelocated in Jerusalem, the capital of Israel, by the year 1999.\n  We all know that diplomacy is filled with subtleties but that some \nthings are fundamental. One of those fundamental things is the \nrelationship between the United States and Israel.\n  Key to that relationship is an underlying principle. The principle is \nthat Jerusalem is the essence of the historical connection of the \nJewish people for Palestine. That is why Jerusalem is the capital of \nIsrael.\n  This legislation, which is a bipartisan presentation of congressional \nintent that finally actions replace words, that deeds replace words, \nand expressing that historical connection, as I said, is supported in a \nbipartisan way by the overwhelming majority of both sides of the aisle.\n  There are approximately 50 Republicans which have cosponsored this \nlegislation, and it is strongly supported as well by the many Democrats \nwho have spoken on it.\n  I think the key here is for the American people to finally express, \nas I said, in deeds rather than words, their support for Israel through \nthe acknowledgment that Jerusalem is the capital by the relocation of \nthe United States Embassy in the capital city of Jerusalem.\n  As Senator Lieberman from Connecticut so ably pointed out, and \nSenator Dole did as well, this is not about the peace process, which we \nall support. Rather, it is an expression on the part of the United \nStates that no longer will there be any doubt about our position \nrelative to Jerusalem. It is an honest position, as Senator Lieberman \nsaid.\n  That is why, Madam President, it is so important for this body, in an \noverwhelming way, to express its support for the United States-Israel \nrelationship by supporting this legislation to relocate the Embassy of \nthe United States to the capital of Israel, Jerusalem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, and was \nread the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall it pass?\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Bradley] \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft).

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Each sovereign nation, under international law and \n     custom, may designate its own capital.\n       (2) Since 1950, the city of Jerusalem has been the capital \n     of the State of Israel.\n       (3) The city of Jerusalem is the seat of Israel's \n     President, Parliament, and Supreme Court, and the site of \n     numerous government ministries and social and cultural \n     institutions.\n       (4) The city of Jerusalem is the spiritual center of \n     Judaism, and is also considered a holy city by the members of \n     other religious faiths.\n       (5) From 1948-1967, Jerusalem was a divided city and \n     Israeli citizens of all faiths as well as Jewish citizens of \n     all states were denied access to holy sites in the area \n     controlled by Jordan.\n       (6) In 1967, the city of Jerusalem was reunited during the \n     conflict known as the Six Day War.\n       (7) Since 1967, Jerusalem has been a united city \n     administered by Israel, and persons of all religious faiths \n     have been guaranteed full access to holy sites within the \n     city.\n       (8) This year marks the 28th consecutive year that \n     Jerusalem has been administered as a unified city in which \n     the rights of all faiths have been respected and protected.\n       (9) In 1990, the Congress unanimously adopted Senate \n     Concurrent Resolution 106, which declares that the Congress \n     ``strongly believes that Jerusalem must remain an undivided \n     city in which the rights of every ethnic and religious group \n     are protected''.\n       (10) In 1992, the United States Senate and House of \n     Representatives unanimously adopted Senate Concurrent \n     Resolution 113 of the One Hundred Second Congress to \n     commemorate the 25th anniversary of the reunification of \n     Jerusalem, and reaffirming congressional sentiment that \n     Jerusalem must remain an undivided city.\n       (11) The September 13, 1993, Declaration of Principles on \n     Interim Self-Government Arrangements lays out a timetable for \n     the resolution of ``final status'' issues, including \n     Jerusalem.\n       (12) The Agreement on the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area \n     was signed May 4, 1994, beginning the five-year transitional \n     period laid out in the Declaration of Principles.\n       (13) In March of 1995, 93 members of the United States \n     Senate signed a letter to Secretary of State Warren \n     Christopher encouraging ``planning to begin now'' for \n     relocation of the United States Embassy to the city of \n     Jerusalem.\n       (14) In June of 1993, 257 members of the United States \n     House of Representatives signed a letter to the Secretary of \n     State Warren Christopher stating that the relocation of the \n     United States Embassy to Jerusalem ``should take place no \n     later than . . . 1999''.\n       (15) The United States maintains its embassy in the \n     functioning capital of every country except in the case of \n     our democratic friend and strategic ally, the State of \n     Israel.\n       (16) The United States conducts official meetings and other \n     business in the city of Jerusalem in de facto recognition of \n     its status as the capital of Israel.\n       (17) In 1996, the State of Israel will celebrate the \n     3,000th anniversary of the Jewish presence in Jerusalem since \n     King David's entry.\n\n     SEC. 3. TIMETABLE.\n\n       (a) Statement of the Policy of the United States.--\n       (1) Jerusalem should remain an undivided city in which the \n     rights of every ethnic and religious group are protected;\n       (2) Jerusalem should be recognized as the capital of the \n     State of Israel; and\n       (3) the United States Embassy in Israel should be \n     established in Jerusalem no later than May 31, 1999.\n       (b) Opening Determination.--Not more than 50 percent of the \n     funds appropriated to the Department of State for fiscal year \n     1999 for ``Acquisition and Maintenance of Buildings Abroad'' \n     may be obligated until the Secretary of State determines and \n     reports to Congress that the United States Embassy in \n     Jerusalem has officially opened.\n\n     SEC. 4. FISCAL YEARS 1996 AND 1997 FUNDING.\n\n       (a) Fiscal Year 1996.--Of the funds authorized to be \n     appropriated for ``Acquisition and Maintenance of Buildings \n     Abroad'' for the Department of State in fiscal year 1996, not \n     less than $25,000,000 should be made available until expended \n     only for construction and other costs associated with the \n     establishment of the United States Embassy in Israel in the \n     capital of Jerusalem.\n       (b) Fiscal Year 1997.--Of the funds authorized to be \n     appropriated for ``Acquisition and Maintenance of Buildings \n     Abroad'' for the Department of State in fiscal year 1997, not \n     less than $75,000,000 should be made available until expended \n     only for construction and other costs associated with the \n     establishment of the United States Embassy in Israel in the \n     capital of Jerusalem.\n\n     SEC. 5. REPORT ON IMPLEMENTATION.\n\n       Not later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary of State shall submit a report to the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations of the Senate detailing the Department of \n     State's plan to implement this Act. Such report shall \n     include--\n       (1) estimated dates of completion for each phase of the \n     establishment of the United States Embassy, including site \n     identification, land acquisition, architectural, engineering \n     and construction surveys, site preparation, and construction; \n     and\n       (2) an estimate of the funding necessary to implement this \n     Act, including all costs associated with establishing the \n     United States Embassy in Israel in the capital of Jerusalem.\n\n     SEC. 6. SEMIANNUAL REPORTS.\n\n       At the time of the submission of the President's fiscal \n     year 1997 budget request, and every six months thereafter, \n     the Secretary of State shall report to the Speaker of the \n     House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations of the Senate on the progress made toward opening \n     the United States Embassy in Jerusalem.\n\n     SEC. 7. PRESIDENTIAL WAIVER.\n\n       (a) Waiver Authority.--(1) Beginning on October 1, 1998, \n     the President may suspend the limitation set forth in section \n     3(b) for a period of six months if he determines and reports \n     to Congress in advance that such suspension is necessary to \n     protect the national security interests of the United States.\n       (2) The President may suspend such limitation for an \n     additional six month period at the end of any period during \n     which the suspension is in effect under this subsection if \n     the President determines and reports to Congress in advance \n     of the additional suspension that the additional suspension \n     is necessary to protect the national security interests of \n     the United States.\n       (3) A report under paragraph (1) or (2) shall include--\n       (A) a statement of the interests affected by the limitation \n     that the President seeks to suspend; and\n       (B) a discussion of the manner in which the limitation \n     affects the interests.\n       (b) Applicability of Waiver to Availability of Funds.--If \n     the President exercises the authority set forth in subsection \n     (a) in a fiscal year, the limitation set forth in section \n     3(b) shall apply to funds appropriated in the following \n     fiscal year for the purpose set forth in such section 3(b) \n     except to the extent that the limitation is suspended in such \n     following fiscal year by reason of the exercise of the \n     authority in subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 8. DEFINITION.\n\n       As used in this Act, the term ``United States Embassy'' \n     means the offices of the United States diplomatic mission and \n     the residence of the United States chief of mission.\n\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, I hope that the Senators who are present \nwill listen and that those who may be watching over the television will \nalso listen. We are about to take up the reconciliation bill in the \nSenate. At this moment, the Senate reconciliation bill is not \navailable. It has not been returned from the printers, so we do not \nhave it. I hold in my hand the House reconciliation bill, 1,563 pages--\n1,563 pages. The Senate bill may be a larger bill. It may not be. It \nmay not have as many pages, but I would imagine that it is at least \ngoing to be 1,000 pages.\n  This bill will be called up probably tomorrow. The motion to proceed \nto it is not debatable. One cannot filibuster. Once we are on it, the \nmaximum length of time is 20 hours to be equally divided, which means \n10 hours to the side.\n  This bill is so complex and so massive that there are tables of \ncontents scattered throughout to indicate what items are from what \ncommittees. Each committee has been given instructions, and when that \ncommittee submits the results of those instructions to the Budget \nCommittee, the Budget Committee cannot alter them substantively. The \nBudget Committee is required to fold them all into a reconciliation \nbill.\n  What I am going to say is that we need more time to debate a \nreconciliation bill. There are all kinds of legislation that will be \ncrammed into this bill--far-reaching legislation. Laws that are already \non the statute books will be repealed, and very few Senators will know \nwhat is in the bill or will know what they are voting on. There will be \ncomprehensive changes--Medicare, Medicaid, welfare reform, whatever.\n  After we have voted on this bill--and we only have 20 hours--after we \nhave completed our work on it, there may be a half dozen Senators who \nwill have a grasp of the actions that have been taken.\n  We are limited to 2 hours on any amendment in the first degree, 1 \nhour on any amendment in the second degree, and there is no committee \nreport.\n  There is nothing here to tell us what we are going to be acting on. \nAnd it is going to hit us tomorrow morning in all likelihood, if not \ntoday, or maybe tomorrow afternoon. But think of that! Think of having \nto act on a bill of that size, a bill of that magnitude, and even this \n1,563 page bill is not complete. On page 1,562 it refers to ``Title \nXVIII, Welfare Reform, Text to be supplied.'' Page 1,563, ``Title XIX, \nContract Tax Provisions, Text to be supplied; Title XX, Budget Process, \nText to be supplied.''\n  So it is not all here, even in this House reconciliation bill.\n  What are we coming to in this Senate, in this Congress? This will be \nthe most important bill that will be acted upon by this Senate in this \nsession. And we all know that far-reaching changes are being \ncontemplated, I suppose you would call it, in the so-called Contract \nWith America. All of these new, all of these reforms and repealing of \nmeasures are going to be included in this reconciliation bill this \nyear.\n  As Members of the Senate are aware, the Congressional Budget Act of \n1974 established the congressional budget process. I was here. I had a \nlot to do with the writing of that act. But we did not contemplate, \nthose of us who wrote that act in 1974, who voted on it, who debated it \non the floor, did not contemplate what was going to be done in \nsubsequent years through the reconciliation legislation.\n  It was never intended--I would never have voted for that 1974 act if \nI could have just foreseen that the reconciliation process would be \nused as it is being used. It is a catchall for massive authorization \nmeasures that should be debated at length, and should be subject to \nunlimited time for amendments and unlimited time for debate.\n  Very controversial measures are being put into reconciliation bills. \nAnd there is no cloture mechanism that could be more than a distant \nspeck on the horizon as compared with time restrictions in a \nreconciliation bill. It is a super bear trap.\n  Prior to the enactment of the Congressional Budget Act, there was no \nprocedure or process through which Congress could exercise control over \nthe total Federal budget. The appropriations process, which \ntraditionally had overseen Federal spending through the enactment of \nannual appropriations bills, had increasingly become less able to do so \nbecause of the growth in ``entitlement'' or ``mandatory spending.'' \nThese entitlement programs, notably Medicare and Medicaid, obligated \nthe Federal Government to make direct payments to qualified \nbeneficiaries, without the payments having to first be appropriated.\n  Congress recognized that in order to be able to carry out its full \nresponsibilities over the Federal purse, a new congressional budget \nprocess was needed. And through this new congressional budget process, \nit was our intention that all spending decisions would be considered in \nrelation to each other. In addition, it is vital that the aggregate \nspending decisions we make be related carefully to revenue levels.\n  In order to ensure that these new congressional budget processes and \nprocedures would work, the Congressional Budget Act created two new \nfast-track vehicles--the budget resolution and the reconciliation bill. \nBoth of these measures are considered under expedited, fast-track \nprocedures in the Senate. It is the fast-track procedures relative to \nreconciliation measures which cause me great concern.\n  And mind you, as I say, there is a limitation of 20 hours of debate. \nThat includes debate on amendments, debatable motions, appeals, points \nof order. Everything is included under debate in that 20-hour \nlimitation, except, for example, in the case of certain quorum calls \nand the reading of amendments. They are not charged against the 20 \nhours.\n  But that is not all. Any Senator may move to reduce the overall time \nfrom 20 hours to 10. Any Senator may move to reduce the 20 hours to 5 \nor to 2 or to 1 hour.\n  Well, that would be a rather unreasonable thing to do, but the rule \nallows it. And that would be a nondebatable motion. If a Senator elects \nto move to reduce the time--it does not have to be the majority leader \nor the minority leader--the newest Member of the Senate can make that \nmotion to reduce the time. It is a nondebatable motion. It would be \ndecided by a majority vote. So if a majority were so minded, it could \nreduce the time. This is an astonishing thing that we have done to \nourselves.\n  I think it is fair to say that the participants in the creation of \nthe Congressional Budget Act recognized that this new process, as I \nsay, was a dramatic departure from the budget practices and procedures \nthat existed at the time. It was, therefore, obvious that no one could \nanticipate all of the effects that could result from enactment of the \nCongressional Budget Act. I do not believe that the Congress fully \nanticipated the uses that would be made of the fast-track \nreconciliation process.\n  The reconciliation process is a fast-track, deficit-reduction vehicle \nwhich, under the Congressional Budget Act, cannot be filibustered \nagainst. A simple majority of Senators voting determines what \namendments the Senate will adopt to a reconciliation measure, and a \nsimple majority is sufficient to pass the legislation.\n  First degree amendments, as I say, get 2 hours of debate; second \ndegree amendments get 1 hour. All debate must fall within the act's 20-\nhour cap. It is for this reason that I have called reconciliation a \ncolossally super gag rule. It is a gigantic bear trap.\n  I do not believe, Mr. President, the participants in the creation of \nthe Congressional Budget Act recognized the way--I do not believe they \nrecognized the way; I did not recognize it--in which this expedited \nreconciliation process would be used. They intended the reconciliation \nprocess to be a way to ensure that the spending and revenue and deficit \ntargets for a given fiscal year would be met. In fact, there were no \nreconciliation instructions in budget resolutions for fiscal years \n1975, 1976, 1977, 1978, or 1979. The Senate Budget Committee first \nreported a budget resolution containing reconciliation procedures for \nFY 1980, under the chairmanship of Senator Muskie, Ed Muskie. The \nfollowing year, the new Budget Committee chairman, Senator Hollings, \nincluded reconciliation instructions in the 1981 budget resolution in \nthe form of a binding revision of the 1980 budget resolution.\n  Then, for fiscal year 1982, Senator Domenici assumed the chairmanship \nof \n\n[[Page S 15537]]\nthe Budget Committee, a post which he also holds today, and he made \nfurther innovations in the reconciliation process. In fact, I \nunderstand that it was during this period that the revised budget \nresolution for fiscal year 1981 included reconciliation instructions \nfor years beyond the first fiscal year covered by the resolution, \nthereby extending the reach of reconciliation to more permanent changes \nin law. No longer was reconciliation just a ledger adjustment for one \nyear.\n  Since that time, reconciliation instructions have been included in \nbudget resolutions for FY 1981, 1982, 1984, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1990, \n1991, 1994, and 1996. By the same light, budget resolutions did not \ninclude reconciliation instructions in many fiscal years, including \nfiscal years 1989, 1992, and 1993, during multi-year budget agreements.\n  Over this period, Congress used reconciliation legislation to \naccomplish substantial deficit reduction. At the same time, however, \nmany legislative items were included in reconciliation bills that had \nno business being there. And it is not surprising, Mr. President, that \nattempts have been made to include extraneous matters in reconciliation \nbills. After all, the fast-track procedures for considering \nreconciliation bills, as well as conference reports thereon, make them \nalmost irresistible vehicles to which Senators will attempt to attach \nnon-budgetary legislative matters.\n  It was in response to this problem that I offered an amendment to the \nConsolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, originally \nadopted as a temporary rule and made permanent in 1990 as Section 313 \nof the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended. The purpose of \nwhat is commonly referred to as the ``Byrd Rule'' was to curb this \ntendency to include extraneous matter in reconciliation measures. That \nis why the Byrd rule came about. The Congressional Research Service \nrecently issued a report for Congress entitled, ``The Senate's Byrd \nRule Against Extraneous Matters in Reconciliation Measures: A Fact \nSheet.'' According to that report, in the five reconciliation measures \nto which it applied, there have been 16 cases involving the Byrd Rule. \nIn 11 of those cases, opponents were able to either strike extraneous \nmatter from legislation--in six cases--or bar the consideration of \nextraneous amendments--in five cases--by raising points of order. Three \nof ten motions to waive the Byrd Rule were successful and two points of \norder against matter characterized as extraneous in a conference report \nwere rejected. It appears, then, that the Byrd Rule has had some \nsuccess in keeping extraneous matter out of reconciliation measures.\n  Yet, Mr. President, more needs to be done to ensure that Senators and \nthe American people are fully informed as to what is included in these \nmassive reconciliation bills before they are voted upon.\n  The people have a right to know, our constituents have a right to \nknow what is in this bill, and we Senators have a right to know, and we \nSenators have a responsibility to know. But how can we know under the \ncircumstances--under the circumstances?\n  As it stands now, the Budget Act allows only 20 hours of debate on \nreconciliation bills and only 10 hours of debate on reconciliation \nconference reports. And that does not even begin to be a sufficient \namount of time to address the massive number of items that are \ncontained in reconciliation bills. These bills contain a large number \nof permanent changes in law which would otherwise have extended debate, \nwhich would otherwise have to go through the process of amendments and \nthoughtful consideration, debate, perhaps days of debate.\n  Yet, we are all put under the gun, on both sides of the aisle, to get \nthe reconciliation bill through with a modicum of debate, both in the \nBudget Committee and here on the Senate floor. I am having to make this \nspeech on my amendment today, the day before we will actually take up \nthe reconciliation bill because there will likely not be time to \ndiscuss my amendment during regular consideration of the bill.\n  I have an amendment. It will be subject to a 60-vote point of order. \nIt probably will not be adopted, but I am going to offer it anyhow. Do \nyou think I will have time to debate that amendment when this bill is \nup before the Senate? We have a very little amount of time.\n  I do not raise this issue for any partisan purpose. When Democrats \ncontrolled the House and Senate, reconciliation bills were also far-\nreaching and yet received no more consideration than will the 1996 \nreconciliation bill. I am convinced, though that regardless of which \nparty is in the majority, reconciliation bills and conference reports \nrequire more of the Senate's time than the Budget Act presently allows. \nSo I intend to offer an amendment to the reconciliation bill which will \nincrease from 20 to 50 hours the time limitation for debate on future \nreconciliation measures and to increase from 10 to 20 hours the time \nlimitation for Senate consideration of conference reports thereon. I \nrecognize, as I say, that a Byrd Rule point of order can be raised \nagainst my amendment, in that it has no effect on outlays or revenues.\n  Nevertheless, I urge my colleagues to refrain from raising a point of \norder against this amendment and, instead, to join me in adopting the \namendment, both sides, Senators on both sides need more time for \nconsideration of such a leviathan as this. While not a magic pill that \nwill solve all the problems we face in reconciliation bills, I feel \nthat this increased time for consideration of reconciliation bills and \nconference reports in the future does constitute a much-needed \nimprovement to the present reconciliation process.\n  Analogies between the legislative process and making sausage have \noften been made, but in no instance does legislating resemble sausage \nmaking more than in the process known as reconciliation.\n  Unlike most legislative vehicles which emanate from only one \ncommittee, the reconciliation bill is a hodge-podge, a catchall, of \nproposals from every authorizing committee, sewn into one skin called a \nreconciliation package. The package is usually massive, as we have \nnoted here today, and contains far-reaching changes in the law--some of \nthem beneficial, some of them detrimental, and some of them downright \nridiculous. The point here is that the expedited procedures and very \ntight time limits have, over the years, become opportunities for those \nwho would abuse the process. Unfortunately, the Byrd Rule, which was \nintended to help lessen the prospects for abuse in reconciliation has, \nover time, become a favorite parlor game for many of Washington's \nfertile legal minds, and ways have been found to circumvent its intent.\n  It is my belief that very often the final reconciliation sausage \nwould not pass public inspection if there were a little more time for \nexamination and debate. Our aim in the Senate should never be to hide \nimportant public issues from the public eye. While we need to keep the \ndeficit reduction train on track with some sort of time limits, we do \nnot need to be in such a hurry that the toxic material in the boxcars \nis rushed by without even a moment for a cautionary warning flag to be \nraised.\n  We should give the American people a little more of a window on the \nreconciliation process here in the Senate, and at least allow for some \nadditional debate and some additional opportunity to amend the bill. My \namendment would make the ingredients of the reconciliation process a \nlittle more pure and, hopefully, a little better seasoned. I believe \nmine is a constructive change, and I will hope for bipartisan support \nwhen I offer it to the reconciliation bill.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from West Virginia \nwill yield to me for a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I gladly yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me first indicate that I hope that the \nSenator will add me as a cosponsor to his amendment that would expand \nthe amount of time available for which there would be debate on the \nreconciliation bill.\n  Mr. BYRD. I will be happy to do that.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I think that is a very important amendment, and I hope \npeople will not raise points of order against it. But even that is a \nminuscule amount of time with which to evaluate this kind of \nlegislation.\n  My understanding is that the reconciliation bill, when it comes to \nthe floor of the Senate, will be somewhere over 2,000 pages, and that \nincludes everything. It is now 20 minutes to 1. We \n\n[[Page S 15538]]\nare told today may be the day we will begin considering the bill. It is \nnot available. I have not seen a bill. I have asked for it. It is not \navailable. So a piece of legislation that will be probably 2,000 pages \nlong, if it includes everything--the House version is 1,500 pages long \nbut does not include the three major areas, that is text to be added \nlater, I understand.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. So we are talking about a proposal that will have some of \nthe most profound changes we have seen in 30, 40, 50 years coming to \nthe floor of the Senate later today, and it is now 20 minutes to 1 and \nit is not yet available, not yet written, not yet provided to Members \nof the Senate. Fifty hours is not enough. I support the Senator's \namendment.\n  I have heard in the past people say, ``Well, how can we legislate if \nwe don't have access to what is being done here?''\n  The Senator from West Virginia comes from a rural State, as do I. \nThis will contain, when it gets here, essentially, a new farm bill. We \nare required to write a farm bill every 5 years. This is a year to \nwrite a farm bill. It is now late October. We do not yet have a farm \nbill.\n  This will contain the structure of the new farm bill. It should not \nbe here. That is a slap in the face at rural States. It is in there. \nYet, like everything else, it will have a profound impact on a rural \nState and almost no opportunity will exist to get at it, to amend it, \nand to have a thoughtful, responsible debate about what farm policy \nwill be in our country.\n  This will have a substantial impact on men and women all over this \ncountry who are trying to run a family-sized farm.\n  Does the Senator from West Virginia have a copy of the reconciliation \nbill yet, or has the Senator from West Virginia sought to get a bill?\n  Mr. BYRD. I have sought to get a copy and a copy is not available. I \nhave in my hands a copy of the House reconciliation bill covering 1,563 \npages. As the distinguished Senator from North Dakota has pointed out, \nthere are three titles which are yet to be supplied.\n  I do not know what the size of the Senate reconciliation will be. It \nmay be longer or shorter. I think the Senator is well within reason to \nexpect at least 1,200 to 1,500 pages.\n  These will be changes of great magnitude--complex--in Medicare, \nMedicaid, and as the Senator has already said, farm legislation. \nVarious and sundry laws will be repealed and amended which otherwise \nwould perhaps require hours and hours or days, even, for debate on the \nSenate floor.\n  I will certainly be pleased to add the Senator's name to my \namendment. I hope that Republicans will join in supporting this \namendment because they, too, should be concerned about what we are \ndoing here--enacting legislation of this enormity without knowing what \nis in the legislation, without having an opportunity to adequately \nstudy it or amend it.\n  I thank the Senator for his willingness to join in the presentation.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/24/senate-section/article/S15536-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to consideration of S. 1328, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1328) to amend the commencement dates of certain \n     temporary Federal judgeships.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is taking up \nS. 1328, a bill that amends the commencement dates of certain temporary \njudgeships that were created under section 203(c) of the Judicial \nImprovements Act of 1990 [Public Law 101-650, 104 Stat. 5101].\n  The minor adjustment embodied in this bill should improve the \nefficiency of the courts involved. This is not a controversial change, \nbut it is a necessary one.\n  I am pleased to have Senators Biden, Grassley, Heflin, Specter, \nSimon, DeWine, Feinstein, and Abraham as original cosponsors of this \nbill.\n  I also want to thank the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts and \nthe fine Federal judges, particularly Chief Judge Gilbert of the \nsouthern district of Illinois, who called to my attention the need for \nthis legislative fix--and the need for it to be passed before December \n1, 1995.\n  The Judicial Improvements Act of 1990 created the temporary \njudgeships at issue in two steps.\n  First, the 1990 act provided that a new district judge would be \nappointed to each of 13 specified districts.\n  Second, the act then provided that the first vacancy in the office of \na district judge that occurred in those districts after December 1, \n1995 would not be filled.\n  That two-step arrangement, which is typical in temporary judgeship \nbills, is required in order to ensure that the judge filling a \ntemporary judgeship is still a full-fledged, permanent, article III \njudge in accordance with the Constitution.\n  Thus, although a new judgeship in a given district has only a \ntemporary effect, the individual judge appointed serves on a permanent \nbasis in the same manner as any other article III judge.\n  It is the time between the appointment of a judge to a temporary \njudgeship and the point at which a vacant permanent judgeship is left \nunfilled that is key. That overlap is what effectively adds another \njudge to the district for a temporary period of time.\n  The 1990 act created the temporary judgeships in the following 13 \ndistricts: the northern district of Alabama, the eastern district of \nCalifornia, the district of Hawaii, the central district of Illinois, \nthe southern district of Illinois, the district of Kansas, the western \ndistrict of Michigan, the eastern district of Missouri, the district of \nNebraska, the northern district of New York, the northern district of \nOhio, the eastern district of Pennsylvania, and the eastern district of \nVirginia.\n  However, due to delays in the nomination and confirmation of many of \nthe judges filling those temporary judgeships, many districts have had \nonly a relatively brief period of time in which to take advantage of \ntheir temporary judgeship.\n  In the district of Hawaii and the southern district of Illinois, for \nexample, new judges were not confirmed until October 1994. Other \ndistricts have faced similar delays.\n  Those delays mean that many of the temporary judgeships will be \nunable to fulfill congressional intent to alleviate the backlog of \ncases in those districts.\n  Many of the districts faced a particularly heavy load of drug \nenforcement and related matters. Those cases will not be absorbed \nadequately if the first judicial vacancy that occurs in those districts \nafter December 1, 1995 must go unfilled.\n  This bill solves the problem by changing the second part of the \ntemporary judgeship calculus.\n  The bill provides that the first district judge vacancy occurring 5 \nyears or more after the confirmation date of the judge appointed to \nfill the temporary judgeship would not be filled.\n  In that way, each district would benefit from an extra active judge \nfor at least 5 years, regardless of how long the appointment process \ntook.\n  This will help alleviate the extra burden faced in those districts. \nThe only district excluded from this treatment is the western district \nof Michigan. That district requested to be excluded because its needs \nwill be met under the current scheme.\n  I also note that the judges from the affected districts have \nrequested that this bill be enacted before December 1, 1995. After that \ndate, some vacant judgeships will be unable to be filled under current \nlaw.\n  That is why this bill has some urgency. And that explains why the \nbill \n\n[[Page S 15539]]\nhas not gone to the Judiciary Committee, but was placed directly on the \ncalendar.\n  I wish to clarify that for the benefit of my colleagues, who may not \nbe so familiar with this measure, and who may have wondered why that \nwas done.\n  As the list of original cosponsors shows, the Judiciary Committee \nsupports the substance of this bill. I also note that there was no \nopposition from any Senator on the Judiciary Committee to placing S. \n1328 on the calendar directly.\n  I see no reason for a prolonged debate on this noncontroversial \nmeasure, and I commend my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who \nhave cooperated in moving this measure along.\n  I should also note that no one should confuse this bill with the \nJudicial Conference's request to Congress for additional judgeships. No \none has yet to introduce that bill, and its merits have yet to be \nconsidered by the Judiciary Committee.\n  Finally, although this bill is needed because Congress in 1990 \nunderestimated the timeframes involved in the confirmation process, the \nneed for this bill is in no way a reflection on the speed with which \nSenator Biden, when he was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, or I as \nthe current chairman, have proceeded with the judicial confirmation \nprocess.\n  This bill would have been necessary regardless of who was chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee. The nomination and confirmation process is a \ndeliberate undertaking.\n  It has been my aim to have the Judiciary Committee process judicial \nnominees in a manner that is thorough, but also fair and expeditious.\n  Since January 1995, 8 circuit judges, 28 district court judges and 2 \njudges of the Court of International Trade have been confirmed.\n  Of the judicial nominees confirmed this Congress, it has taken only \n70.85 days from the date a judge is nominated to the date he or she is \nconfirmed by the full Senate.\n  That amounts to a speedier confirmation process in the Senate than \noccurred even when the Democratic Senate was charged with confirming \nClinton nominees.\n  The committee has carried out what is arguably its most important \ntask fairly and diligently in this session of Congress.\n  The upshot of this is that the courts are currently operating at \nnearly optimal levels. For example, there are only 11 unfilled circuit \ncourt seats in the Nation out of 179 permanent circuit court \njudgeships.\n  Adding both circuit and district court vacancies, there are only 57 \nvacancies unfilled out of the 828 judges of the Federal judiciary. This \nmeans that only 7 percent of all seats on the Federal bench are vacant.\n  When pending nominees are excluded, only 33 seats are open--just 5 \npercent of all seats.\n  While we intend to be very thorough in our consideration of nominees \nfor lifetime judicial appointments, we recognize the priority of this \nconstitutional mandate on the Senate.\n  I wish to thank my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee and in the \nSenate as a whole for their cooperation in the confirmation process, \nand I commend them for their accomplishments in this regard this \nCongress.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. HATCH. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. FORD. For a long time, three States have had split judges. The \nState of Kentucky has one, I think Missouri has a good many, and so \ndoes Oklahoma. The reason I ask the Senator this question is that we \nhave the split judge driving from one end of the State to the other, \nand most of the judicial time that is needed in court is spent on the \nroad. Until and unless we can have an additional judge, we will still \nhave the split judge.\n   I think an amendment to eliminate the split judge and add one, even \nthough the commission, as the Senator mentioned earlier--we have not \nconsidered its recommendations. I understand they recommended an \nadditional judge to eliminate our split judge. That was withdrawn, and \nwe fired off letters asking them to come back.\n  I believe this amendment would be germane. And, I intend, after we \nare offered the President's budget to approve and other things on this \nbill, to offer that amendment. I wanted to alert the Senator so he \nunderstands what I am concerned about.\n  Mr. HATCH. I do. Is the Senator intending to offer it on this?\n  Mr. FORD. I am hoping to offer it on this bill because this amendment \nis more germane to the bill than some of the other amendments we are \ngoing to get this afternoon.\n  Mr. HATCH. I would like the Senator to withhold. We are looking into \nadding additional judgeships. I believe before long, in the next year, \nwe will probably pass a bill to add additional judgeships.\n  Mr. FORD. But I say to my good friend, into the next year we will \nhave this one particular judge, and she will be driving from Ashland, \nKY, to Paducah, KY, from Louisville to Owensboro, and on the road. We \nhave cases that are beginning to pile up, and it is no fault of the \nsplit judge.\n  So it is just very important that I at least get this out for people \nto think about, and I may introduce it. I have it prepared to introduce \nas an amendment to this bill. As I say, it will be more germane to this \nbill than other nonbinding amendments, sense-of-the-Senate resolutions \nthat are going to be offered here this afternoon to try to make us walk \nthe plank. We voted 99 to 0 on the one that is going to be offered \nnext, I think.\n  So I just wanted to be sure that the Senator understood why I am \ndoing it, and not because of the Senator's position and my respect for \nthe Senator.\n  Mr. HATCH. I appreciate that. I understand. I hope the Senator will \nwithhold because I will certainly give every consideration to this and \nsolving it in an expeditious manner.\n  Mr. FORD. It will probably be next year before we can get to it.\n  Mr. HATCH. Perhaps we may be able to do something before then.\n  Mr. FORD. This has been going on for a long time. We have been \nwaiting for the commission's report. Then they withdrew that. So I \nwaited for that without doing anything. Now I feel I am almost \ncompelled for my constituents to be served by the Federal judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let us chat about it. Let us see what we can do.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank the Senator. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I simply want to thank my colleague from Utah for moving ahead with \nthis bill. We face problems in two districts in Illinois, and this bill \ntakes care of their problems, among others. I appreciate the leadership \nof my colleague from Utah on this.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2943\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the President's \n                    revised federal budget proposal)\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk, and I \nask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Santorum) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2943.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I object to dispensing with the reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Strike all after ``SECTION'', and insert in lieu thereof \n     the following:\n\n       . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE PRESIDENT'S REVISED \n                   FEDERAL BUDGET.\n\n       (A) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) On May 19, 1995, the United States Senate voted 99-0 to \n     reject the Fiscal Year 1996 budget submitted by President \n     Clinton on February 6, 1995.\n       (2) The President on June 13, 1995, after the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate passed resolutions that the \n     Congressional Budget Office said would result in a balanced \n     federal budget in Fiscal Year 2002, revised his budget.\n       (3) The President said on June 13, 1995, and on numerous \n     subsequent occasions, that this revised budget would balance \n     the federal budget in Fiscal Year 2005.\n       (4) The President's revised budget, like the budget he \n     submitted to Congress on February 6, 1995, took into account \n     surpluses in \n\n[[Page S 15540]]\n     the Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance (OASDI) trust funds in \n     calculating the deficit.\n       (5) President Clinton, in his address before a joint \n     session of Congress on February 17, 1993, stated that he was \n     ``using the independent numbers of the Congressional Budget \n     Office'' because ``the Congressional Budget Office was \n     normally more conservative in what was going to happen and \n     closer to right than previous Presidents have been.''\n       (6) President Clinton further stated: ``Let's at least \n     argue about the same set of numbers, so the American people \n     will think we're shooting straight with them.''\n       (7) The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the \n     President's revised budget would achieve savings of $128 \n     billion in Medicare through 2002 and $295 billion through \n     2005.\n       (8) The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the \n     President's revised budget would achieve savings of $54 \n     billion in federal Medicaid spending through 2002 and $105 \n     billion through 2005.\n       (9) The President has proposed savings of $64 billion in \n     ``non-health entitlements by 2002 by reforming welfare, farm \n     and other programs.''\n       (10) The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the \n     President's revised budget includes proposals that would \n     reduce federal revenues by $97 billion over seven years and \n     $166 billion over ten years.\n       (11) These proposed tax reductions are more than offset by \n     the President's proposed Medicare savings.\n       (12) The Congressional Budget Office has determined that \n     enactment of the President's proposal would result in \n     deficits in excess of $200 billion in each of fiscal years \n     1997 through 2005.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that Congress shall enact the President's budget as revised \n     on June 13, 1995.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I offer this amendment. It is not the identical \namendment that we voted on previously. The first amendment, sense-of-\nthe-Senate amendment was on the President's first budget that he \nintroduced back in February. This is on the revised Clinton budget that \npurports to balance the budget over the next 10 years. And the reason, \nif I may respond to the senior Senator from Kentucky, that I am \nintroducing this is not to vote on the same thing we had before. If the \nPresident were not running around the country talking about how he has \na balanced budget over 10 years, there would be no need for us to bring \nthis to the Senate floor and have a debate exposing a phony balanced \nbudget.\n  However, the President continues to go around the country saying, as \nhe did on September 30, I have proposed a balanced budget plan that \nreflects our fundamental values. This is September 30, 1995. I am sure \nwe can find hundreds of quotes as he has campaigned around the country \nwhere he has said that this budget comes into balance and reflects his \nvalues and all these things.\n  It may reflect his values. Principal among his values is he does not \nwant to balance the budget because this does not balance the budget. It \nmay reflect other values in spending more money and all the other \nthings that he wants to do, but fundamentally this budget does not \nbalance. And so the President's actions are the reason we have decided \nto bring this amendment to the floor and debate this issue. I think we \nneed to expose this budget for what it is and have a vote here on the \nSenate floor to determine whether we want to take the course the \nPresident would like to take us on, which is unbalanced budgets, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office, of $200 billion or more \nfor the next 10 years and beyond.\n  Let me read you what the Congressional Budget Office estimates the \nClinton revised budget will result in. In 1996, the Clinton budget will \nproduce a $196 billion deficit; in 1997, a $212 billion deficit; in \n1998, a $199 billion deficit; in 1999, a $213 billion deficit; in the \nyear 2002, a $220 billion deficit; 2001, a $211 billion deficit; 2002, \na $210 billion deficit; 2003, a $207 billion deficit, and in 2004 and \n2005, a $209 billion deficit.\n  That is not a balanced budget. It is not a balanced budget in 10 \nyears. It is not going to be a balanced budget in 20 years or 30 years \nor 40 years. It is a phony, and the President should stop running \naround trying to convince and fool the American public into believing \nthat he has this grand scheme to balance the budget when in fact it \ndoes not balance, and to say that our reductions in spending are \nsomehow mean spirited and draconian, that we do not have to do these \nthings to balance the budget when he knows in fact that is probably the \nonly way we are going to balance the budget is to do what we are \nsuggesting.\n  And so that is why this amendment is here. It is here because the \nPresident refuses to come to Washington and solve the budget crisis and \ninstead decides to run around this country and promote a phony balanced \nbudget. We want to bring this phony balanced budget back to where it \ncan be seen in the light of day and understand that this does not quite \nwash.\n  Now, the Democratic National Committee has the audacity to put on TV \nspots. Let me quote for you this TV spot that they have. ``There are \nbeliefs in values that tie Americans together. In Washington these \nvalues get lost in the tug of war. But what's right matters.''\n  I agree; what is right does matter. ``Work, not welfare, is right.'' \nIn the budget reconciliation bill that will be in the Chamber tomorrow \nis a welfare reform bill that passed 87 to 12 on this floor. And it \ndoes require work and has strong bipartisan support. ``Public education \nis right.'' Again, if you look at the budget reconciliation bill, very \nlittle of it--very little entitlement education spending. The bulk of \nthe education spending is in the education appropriations bill, of \nwhich of the $23 billion that we are going to spend this year, it is a \nreduction of $400 million.\n  By the way, we spend in public education in this country $400 \nbillion. We are talking about a reduction of one-tenth of 1 percent in \nthe amount of money we spend on public education. That is hardly a \ndraconian cut, one-tenth of 1 percent, in a system that everyone agrees \ncould use a lot of belt tightening.\n  So we have public education I think pretty well in focus here. \n``Medicare is right.'' I agree; Medicare is right. Medicare deserves to \nbe saved. We have the only proposal that is going to be put forward \nthat saves Medicare, not just for this generation but future \ngenerations. And I would also remind you from the resolution's reading \nthat the President's balanced budget, which does not balance, reduces \nthe growth in Medicare more than his tax cut that is in his own bill. \nThe same thing he, by the way, claims we are doing in our bill. So it \nis just a matter of degree, not a matter of direction. We believe that \nMedicare needs to be saved, not just for a year or two but for the \nlong-term.\n  ``A tax cut for working families is right,'' they say in the ad. \nWell, we have a tax cut for working families. Over 90 percent--listen \nto this--over 90 percent of the tax reductions in the Senate Finance \nCommittee bill, the bill that is going to be in the Chamber, over 90 \npercent of the benefits go to families under $100,000 in income. Over \n70 percent of the benefits go to families under $75,000 in income. That \nis our proposal. It is a very much middle-income, pro-family tax cut. \nAnd anyone who would like to claim otherwise is demagoging, not reading \nthe specifics of the bill. Read the bill. Read the bill. It is pro \nfamily, pro growth, pro jobs, and pro balancing the budget.\n  Then it continues on. ``There are values behind the President's \nbalanced budget plan.'' A TV ad that calls the President's plan, that \nthe Congressional Budget Office says is out of balance forever, they \nhave a TV ad running now that says the President has a balanced budget \nplan. On national TV. Just out and out lying to the American public.\n  Now, you would say, well, maybe the Congressional Budget Office \nnumbers are not the numbers we are going use, are not the numbers we \nshould use. I would just remind you that the President was the one who \nsaid we should use the Congressional Budget Office. In his first State \nof the Union Address he came to the Congress, right in a joint session \nover on the House side and he stood up and said the Office of \nManagement and Budget numbers have been wrong; they have been rosy; \nthey have been exaggerating growth, underestimating inflation and they \ncannot be trusted. The only numbers we should use, so we can all talk \nabout the same set of numbers, is the Congressional Budget Office \nnumbers.\n  That is what he said. He promised. Now, I know it is going to \nprobably strike people as absolutely incredible that the President \nwould actually go back on one of his promises, but here \n\n[[Page S 15541]]\nwe have it again. The President promised to use the Congressional \nBudget Office, promised to use the same set of numbers, promised that \nhe would shoot straight with the American public, promised. And then he \ncomes forward with a phony balanced budget using trumped-up numbers, \nand the Congressional Budget Office, the one he promised to use, says \nyou will have $200 billion-plus deficits for as far as the eye can see. \nAnd then comes on the air with a TV ad saying that he has a balanced \nbudget, lying--the Democratic National Committee lying--to the American \npublic that the President has a balanced budget.\n  And you want to know who is telling the truth around here. I hear so \nmuch of the American public saying, well, who do we believe? I can \nunderstand why they say that. You had so much misinformation out here, \nso many deliberate distortions of what is going on in this Chamber that \nit is no wonder the American public just throws up their hands and says \nwho do we believe? That is the strategy: Confuse, obfuscate, muddy the \nwaters, do not let anybody know who is really right and who is really \nwrong. Do not tell the truth about what is going on here.\n\n  And here we have this Democratic National Committee television spot \nsaying that there are values behind the President's balanced budget, \nvalues Republicans ignore; Congress should join the President and back \nthese values so, instead of a tug of war, we can come together and do \nwhat is right for our families.\n  We are ready to come together. We are here with a balanced budget \nover 7 years. We are here with real changes. We are here with real \nsolutions. We are here ready to engage with the President on a real \nbudget, not run around and campaign on a phony budget that does not \nbalance. I can tell you for those of us who were in the trenches making \nthese tough decisions which we know affect millions of peoples' lives, \nit does not help the air of cooperation to have a President demagoging \nthis issue so he can get elected in the next election and not be here \nin Washington to solve the problem. Someone should inform the President \nthat he was elected to serve as President, not elected so he could run \nfor reelection as President, but that his job is here to solve \nproblems.\n  That is why I offer this amendment. I offer it to bring to light and \nto have a vote on the phony budget, and to see who supports phony \nbudgeting around here, who supports trumped up, rosy scenarios, \nexaggerated growth, underestimated interest rates as a way to solve the \nbudget. We have had that for years around here, frankly, from both \nadministrations, Republican and Democrat, and I think everyone should \nbe tired of it.\n  We should deal with the real numbers, conservative estimates, that \nget us to a balanced budget in a reasonable set of time, and that is 7 \nyears. And I am hopeful we can reject this amendment.\n  I will just remind everybody that I came up here on the floor Friday, \nFriday morning, and said I would have sitting at the desk, which it has \nbeen all week long, a copy of this resolution, and encouraged someone \nfrom the other side to offer it, to stand up and defend the President's \nbudget. I said, ``Come to the floor, pick it up, debate it. I will be \nhere to debate the President's budget with you if you want to defend \nthe President's budget. There is the resolution.''\n  It is now the day before reconciliation, the day before the rubber \nhits the road, and no one did. So I decided to pick it up and offer it \non behalf of the body. I cannot support the President's budget. It is a \nphony budget, but I think we should have a debate about it. I think \nthose who want to defend what the President is doing, the posturing \nthat he is taking, the politicization of this debate, the demagoging \nthat has gone on, should feel free to defend it and show the American \npublic what you are really for.\n  Let us find out what people in this Chamber are really for. Are we \nfor a balanced budget or not?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2944 to Amendment No. 2943\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I send a perfecting amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2944 to amendment No. 2943.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the first word and insert, in lieu \n     thereof, the following:\n       In the event provisions of the FY 1996 Budget \n     Reconciliation bill are enacted which result in an increase \n     in the number of hungry or medically uninsured children by \n     the end of FY 1996, the Congress shall revisit the provisions \n     of said bill which caused such increase and shall, as soon as \n     practicable thereafter, adopt legislation which would halt \n     any continuation of such increase.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I did not realize that we were going to start the \ndebate on what we call the reconciliation bill today. But if we are \ngoing to do so, then I want to have out on the floor what I think are \nan important set of concerns. And by the way, I think, Mr. President, \nthey are the concerns of the vast majority of people in this country.\n  What this perfecting amendment says in the sense of the Senate is \nthat if, in fact, as a result of this bill with the budget cuts, we see \nan increase in the number of hungry or medically uninsured children in \nAmerica by the end of fiscal year 1996, the Congress shall revisit the \nprovisions of this bill which caused such an increase and shall adopt \nlegislation which would halt the continuation of such an increase.\n  I expect to get 100 votes for this amendment, Mr. President. I have \nsaid many times on the floor of the Senate that it is quite one thing--\nI have heard my colleague from North Dakota say it better than I--it is \nquite one thing to talk about deficit reduction and a balanced budget. \nI do not believe there is a Senator that serves in the U.S. Senate, \nDemocrat or Republican, who is proud of the decade of the 1980's-plus \nwhere we built up the debt and the interest on the debt. It is time to \nstart paying off that interest on the debt. It is time to put our \nfiscal house in order.\n  But, Mr. President, it is quite another question as to whether or not \nwe see in this proposed deficit-reduction plan what I would call the \nMinnesota standard of fairness. Too many of the cuts--every day people \nare reading in newspapers, every day people are hearing on the radio, \nevery day people are seeing in some of the TV reports that too many of \nthese cuts seem to be based on the path of least political resistance.\n  Mr. President, too many of us in office love to have our photo op, \nlove to have our picture taken next to children. It is a great photo \nopportunity. All of us talk about the importance of children. All of us \ntalk about the future and the importance of children. Well, what this \namendment says--and that is why it is such an important perfecting \namendment--is that if, in fact, these proposed reductions in the Food \nStamp Program, the Women, Infants, and Children Program, nutrition \nprograms for children and family child-care centers, really, whether it \nbe center-based child care or family-based child care, or whether or \nnot the cuts in medical assistance--in my State there are over 300,000 \nchildren, many of them in working-poor families that are covered by \nmedical assistance--that if these reductions should result in an \nincrease in the number of children that are hungry or the number of \nchildren who now find themselves without health insurance, then we will \nrevisit this question, we will revisit the provisions of this bill \nwhich cause such an increase; and then, after that, we will take such \npractical steps as can be taken that would, in fact, halt the \ncontinuation of such an increase.\n  Mr. President, I came out here on the floor of the Senate at the \nbeginning of this Congress and I said to my colleagues, ``I believe \nthat what we are going to do this session is we are going to, in the \nname of deficit reduction, take food out of the mouths of hungry \nchildren.'' I have said that more than once on the floor of the Senate. \nAnd I had an amendment, it was a sense-of-the-Senate amendment, that \nsaid the U.S. Senate, that Congress, shall take no action that will \nincrease the number of hungry or homeless children. \n\n[[Page S 15542]]\n\n  Mr. President, I lost. I lost on that amendment on the first two \nvotes. And I remember one of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle--and I have many close friends on the other side of the aisle, \nincluding the distinguished Senators on the floor, I would say \nespecially the distinguished Senator from Utah--but I remember that one \nSenator came out and said, ``The only thing the Senator from Minnesota \nis trying to do is embarrass us.'' And I said, ``You can just prove me \nwrong and vote for this.''\n  And then, finally, Mr. President--and I deeply regret that I did \nthis--I introduced the amendment again, and it was accepted, and it was \nvoice voted. But I am not interested in symbolic politics any longer. \nWe are getting into the debate now.\n  I probably would not have had this amendment today, but when the \nSenator from Pennsylvania comes out with his amendment, his concerns, \nthen it is time for me to come out with my amendment and my concerns.\n  Mr. President, these children, they are not the heavy hitters. These \nchildren, they are not the players. These children, they do not have a \nlot of lobbyists that are out there in the anteroom right now, and they \nhave not been here throughout this process.\n  But some of my colleagues just want to talk about the balanced budget \nover and over and over again, deficit reduction over and over and over \nagain. But how interesting it is that they fail to translate some of \ntheir proposals into human terms and what its impact on people is going \nto be.\n  Mr. President, we have scheduled in this reconciliation bill dramatic \nreductions of investment in children.\n  We have scheduled in this reconciliation bill, in this deficit \nreduction bill cuts in the Women, Infants, and Children Program. \nUnbelievable, Mr. President. My God, if there is one thing we ought to \nagree on, it is that every woman expecting a child ought to have an \nadequate diet, and we are not going to invest the resources necessary \nfor that?\n  Mr. President, the Food Stamp Program certainly has its \nimperfections, and I am all for fixing the problems, but there is a \ndifference between fixing problems and, no pun intended, throwing the \nbaby out with the bath water. I can tell you that with Richard Nixon's \nleadership, with national standards and dramatic expansion of such a \nprogram in the early 1970's--and I saw it in the 1960's in the State of \nNorth Carolina where I lived, we had all too many children with \ndistended bellies, too much rickets, scurvy, too many children \nmalnourished--we moved forward with a dramatic expansion of the Food \nStamp Program, and it has been--imperfections and all--one of the most \nimportant and successful programs in this country because, thank God, \nit reduced hunger and malnutrition among children in America, hunger \nand malnutrition among all of God's children.\n  I ask the Chair, where is the voice for low-income children? Where is \nthe voice for some of the most vulnerable citizens in this country?\n  So if we are going to now, today, debate this budget, it is my \nopportunity to make my case and to make my plea to my colleagues that \nwe should go on record, Mr. President, as Senators making it clear that \nif these reductions should increase the number of hungry or medically \nuninsured children by the end of fiscal year 1996, the Congress shall \nrevisit the provisions of such a bill that caused such an increase, and \nthen we shall adopt legislation which would halt such an increase.\n  I met on Saturday with family child care providers. I say to my \ncolleague from Iowa, these are small business people. There are some \n14,000 in the State of Minnesota. What did they say to me? They talked \nabout the adult and child care feeding program and they said to me, \n``Senator, we don't know what is going to happen with the proposed \nreductions in this program, because for a lot of these kids coming from \nthese families, this is the one really good meal they get a day, and we \ncan't assume the cost ourselves because we're small business people and \nwe don't have any big margin of profit. Senator, who cares about these \nchildren?''\n  But, again, we see reductions in this program.\n  We are talking about $180 billion-plus of cuts in medical assistance, \nand I said several weeks ago on the floor of the U.S. Senate when I \nsuggested that the Senate Finance Committee not meet because there had \nnot been one hearing on the precise proposals that had finally been \nlaid out with one expert coming in from anywhere in the country, I \nsaid, this was a rush to recklessness, and it is.\n  It is a rush to recklessness, and what is so tragic about it is that \nthe missing piece is the impact on the people back in our States. The \nState of Minnesota, again, has done a great job. You can talk to the \ndoctors and the nurses, you can talk to the caregivers, you can talk to \nthe people in the Government agencies, you can talk to the people in \nthe communities, we have 300,000 children that receive medical \nassistance and now we are going to see draconian cuts in medical \nassistance.\n  There is a reason why there has been an increase, and the reason is \nsimple: Every year, more and more families lose their employment-based \nhealth care coverage. Every 30 seconds, a child is born into poverty in \nthis country. I keep reciting these statistics over and over again \nbecause I do not seem to be able to get my colleagues to focus on it. \nEvery 30 seconds, a child is born into poverty in this country. Every 2 \nminutes a child is born to a woman who has not had prenatal care. Every \n2 minutes, a child is born to a woman and that child is born severely \nlow weight, which means that child may not even have a chance in his or \nher life. The statistics go on and on.\n  We are now moving toward one quarter of all the citizens in this \ncountry being poor. So if we are going to have this debate today, I \noffered my perfecting amendment to the amendment of the Senator from \nPennsylvania to say let us go on record and let us make it clear that \nsurely we are not taking any action that is going to reduce more hunger \nor is going to increase the number of children that go without medical \ninsurance and, therefore, without adequate medical care.\n  Mr. President, while I am speaking and before I forget, I do want to \nalso ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. Was \nthere a sufficient second?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. It is one \nthing to ask for the yeas and nays. We are not prepared to vote on this \namendment. So I object.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be dispensed with and we go forward.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes there was a sufficient \nsecond.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, what we have here, which is why I \noffered this perfecting amendment, is the following equation: On the \none hand, we have in the State of Minnesota somewhere between $2.5 \nbillion and $3.5 billion of cuts in medical assistance.\n  And what do I hear from citizens in Minnesota, I mean from those who \nare affected? I hear families with children telling me we do not \nbelieve that our children are any longer going to be able to receive \nadequate medical care. I suggest to you as a former teacher, that if a \nchild goes to school--and I have met such children in my State of \nMinnesota, and, Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, there are such \nchildren in their States as well --with an abscess tooth because that \nchild could not afford dental care or because a child goes to school \nand that child has not received adequate health care, that child cannot \ndo well in school.\n  So, to me it would be unconscionable--it would be unconscionable--to \nessentially dismantle one of the most important safety nets we have for \nchildren in our country.\n  I meet with families, I say to my colleagues, who right now receive \nmedical assistance so they can keep their children who are \ndevelopmentally disabled at home. If these proposed cuts in medical \nassistance go through, their fear--\n\n[[Page S 15543]]\nMr. President, may I have order in the Chamber?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, their concern is that what will happen is they will no \nlonger have the medical assistance program--it is called TEFRON--in our \nState to enable them to keep their children at home, and they do not \nwant their children to be institutionalized.\n  Are we going to turn the clock backward? That is why I have this \namendment. This is not a game. These are people's lives. I want my \ncolleagues to go on record that if these proposed reductions mean that \nthere will be more children in America that will go hungry or more \nchildren in America that will go without health care insurance, then we \nwill, in fact, in 1996 revisit the provisions and take the corrective \naction to make sure that we do not continue to see this suffering. That \nis what I am asking my colleagues to vote on.\n  The medical assistance program is a vitally important program for \nchildren in America, yet we have these huge reductions slated and \nnobody has bothered to ask these children or their mothers or their \nfathers--many of them come from working poor families--``How is this \ngoing to affect you and what will you do?'' Nobody has bothered to go \nout there and over and over and over again meet with people in the \ndevelopmental disabilities communities and find out from them, ``How is \nthis going to affect you? What are you going to do?''\n  I had an amendment on the floor of the Senate to the budget \nresolution that said we ought to consider some of these tax loopholes \nand deductions and tax giveaways.\n  A dollar spent by the Government is a dollar spent, regardless of how \nyou do it. It can be a direct subsidy or it can be a giveaway to some \nlarge corporation.\n  My amendment said we ought to consider some of this; it was defeated. \nLet me be clear about the why of this amendment on the floor of the \nSenate today.\n  The U.S. Senate, when it comes to what we call corporate welfare, \nwhen it comes to some of the largest tax giveaways to some of the most \naffluent citizens, largest corporations in America, we do not want to \ntake any action, do not want to ask them to tighten their belts, and do \nnot want them to be part of the sacrifice, but we are willing to cut \nnutrition programs for children in America.\n  That is not the goodness of people in this country. But it is pretty \neasy to explain because those children are not out there with their \nlobbyists.\n  The Wall Street Journal had a piece yesterday about the mix of money \nand politics. It is unbelievable the amounts of money pouring in from \nall over the country. But those children, they are not the ones that \nget represented in such a politics.\n  Today we get a chance to give our assurance to those children that we \ntake account of them and we take account of their lives.\n  Mr. President, we had a bill out here, appropriations bill that was \nthe Pentagon budget. It was $7 billion more than the Pentagon wanted. \nIt passed. Many of us were saying, could we not put that money into \ndeficit reduction? Could we not at least do a little bit of the \nbalancing of the budget? This is all about priorities, all about \nchoices. Could we not ask the military contractors to tighten their \nbelts?\n  My colleague from Iowa has probably done the best work in the Senate \nin pointing out where he thinks there has been some waste here and \nwhere he thinks there could be most fiscal accountability.\n  Mr. President, we were not successful. So we got $7 billion more than \nthe Pentagon wants. We got the money for the military contractors. We \ngo forward with the weapon systems. We go forward with add-on projects. \nWe go forward with this budget. But at the same time, we are going to \ncut nutritional programs for children and medical assistance for \nchildren in the United States of America.\n  Mr. President, the last piece of this, as long as my colleague brings \nout this whole issue of the budget, is we now look at the Treasury \nDepartment analysis, we now look at pieces that are being written in \nthe papers, and we have $245 billion of tax giveaways.\n  In the best of all worlds, I would love to vote for it. But it is, I \nhave said on the floor before, it is like trying to dance at two \nweddings at the same time. As my colleague from Illinois, Senator \nSimon, would say, if deficit reductions are our No. 1 goal, we will be \nput on a strict diet. The next thing we do is say, but first we will \ngive you dessert. It is preposterous.\n  What is more preposterous is when in fact you are willing to give \naway $245 billion in breaks, most of it going to the most affluent \ncitizens who do not need it, but you are going to cut the Women, \nInfants, and Children Program, nutrition programs for children, and \nmedical assistance that has become the most sweeping and important \nsafety net program in this country for children in America.\n  Mr. President, I just ask my colleagues, where are the priorities? \nMr. President, I do not intend to filibuster the Senate. I do not \nintend to bring the Senate to a halt. I am quite pleased to go forward.\n  Mr. President, let me just conclude because out of respect for my \ncolleague from Utah who is managing this bill I will not take up much \nmore time. Mr. President, my colleague from Pennsylvania came out here \non the floor and did what he felt was right. I respect him for that.\n  He absolutely should do so. He has his set of concerns. He talks \nabout a balanced budget. He talks about deficit reduction.\n  I also have a set of concerns. I have a set of concerns about whose \nbacks is the budget balancing on? I have a concern about where is the \nstandard of fairness? I have a concern about all the reports that are \ncoming out talking about the fact that this proportionate number of the \nbudget cuts target low-income citizens in America--the poorest of poor \npeople, with children unfortunately being disproportionately affected \nby these reductions.\n  I have concerns about too many children who live in poverty today. I \nhave concerns about what the impact in personal terms of some of these \nreductions in nutrition and health care programs will be on the \nnutritional status and health status of children in Minnesota and all \nacross this land.\n  Since I think we have had precious little discussion about all of \nthis, it seems to me it is time for the Senate to vote.\n  I remind my colleagues that I had a very similar kind of an amendment \non the floor of the Senate. It was defeated twice. The third time it \nwas passed by this body. This was an amendment which said ``We go on \nrecord that we will take no action, that we create more hunger or \nhomelessness among children in America.''\n  So today we can through our vote provide some assurance to people \nthroughout Minnesota and throughout the land that children do come \nfirst. Children and their mothers and fathers do come first. Families \ndo come first. That we will not target the most vulnerable citizens. \nThat there will be some standard of fairness. That we will make sure \nthat our actions do not increase the number of hungry children, and do \nnot increase the number of children who go without health care \ncoverage.\n  We can do that, Mr. President through this amendment. I will read the \namendment and then I will make a request. The amendment reads as \nfollows:\n\n       In the event provisions of the fiscal year 1996 budget \n     reconciliation bill are enacted which result in an increase \n     in the number of hungry or medically uninsured children by \n     the end of fiscal year 1996, the Congress shall revisit the \n     provisions of said bill which caused such increase and shall, \n     as soon as practicable thereafter, adopt legislation which \n     would halt any continuation of such increase.\n\n  That is very reasonable.\n  Mr. President, I am aware that the parliamentary situation is such \nthat I will only be able to get a vote on my amendment if I move to \ntable my own amendment. I will soon do so and urge my colleagues to \nvote against my motion to table. In that way, the Senate will go on \nrecord with respect to the provisions of my amendment.\n  Mr. President, I do not want to take up more time because we have a \nlot of business but I believe in my heart and soul that there could be \nno more important focus than children in this country, and especially \nvulnerable children. \n\n[[Page S 15544]]\n\n  Mr. President, I am a father of three children: 30, 26, and 23. I am \na grandfather, three grandchildren: Ages 4, 1, and 2 weeks. I am not so \nconcerned about my children or my grandchildren with this amendment. I \nam concerned about a lot of other children. I am concerned about a lot \nof children who right now in the United States of America live in some \nbrutal economic circumstances. I am concerned about a lot of children \nin America who right now are in a very fragile situation. I am \nconcerned about a lot of children in America who do not believe that \nthey truly will have an opportunity to be all that they can be. I am \nconcerned about a lot of children in America who grow up in families \nwhere there is tremendous tension, where there are parents without \njobs, where people struggle economically and where there is tremendous \nviolence in their lives.\n  I have all of those concerns. Mr. President, for that reason, I do \nnot want us to take any action that could increase the number of hungry \nchildren or those that would go without adequate health care.\n  I move to table my amendment and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is now on the motion to lay on \nthe table amendment No. 2944.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE PRESIDENT'S \n                   REVISED FEDERAL BUDGET.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) On May 19, 1995, the United States Senate voted 99-0 to \n     reject the Fiscal Year 1996 budget submitted by President \n     Clinton on February 6, 1995.\n       (2) The President on June 13, 1995, after the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate passed resolutions that the \n     Congressional Budget Office said would result in a balanced \n     federal budget in Fiscal Year 2002, revised his budget.\n       (3) The President said on June 13, 1995, and on numerous \n     subsequent occasions, that this revised budget would balance \n     the federal budget in Fiscal Year 2005.\n       (4) The President's revised budget, like the budget he \n     submitted to Congress on February 6, 1995, took into account \n     surpluses in the Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance \n     (OASDI) trust funds in calculating the deficit.\n       (5) President Clinton, in his address before a joint \n     session of Congress on February 17, 1993, stated that he was \n     ``using the independent numbers of the Congressional Budget \n     Office'' because ``the Congressional Budget Office was \n     normally more conservative in what was going to happen and \n     closer to right than previous Presidents have been.''\n       (6) President Clinton further stated: ``Let's at least \n     argue about the same set of numbers, so the American people \n     will think we're shooting straight with them.''\n       (7) The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the \n     President's revised budget would achieve savings of $128 \n     billion in Medicare through 2002 and $295 billion through \n     2005.\n       (8) The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the \n     President's revised budget would achieve savings of $54 \n     billion in federal Medicaid spending through 2002 and $105 \n     billion through 2005.\n       (9) The President has proposed savings of $64 billion in \n     ``non-health entitlements by 2002 by reforming welfare, farm \n     and other programs.''\n       (10) The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the \n     President's revised budget includes proposals that would \n     reduce federal revenues by $97 billion over seven years and \n     $166 billion over ten years.\n       (11) These proposed tax reductions are more than offset by \n     the President's proposed Medicare savings.\n       (12) The Congressional Budget Office has determined that \n     enactment of the President's proposal would result in \n     deficits in excess of $200 billion in each of fiscal years \n     1997 through 2005.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that Congress shall enact the President's budget as revised \n     on June 13, 1995.\n\n\n         Amendment No. 2945 to Amendment No. 2943, as modified\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the President's \n                    revised federal budget proposal)\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will please come to order.\n  Mr. FORD. Is it appropriate to have the modification read before we \nget the tree filled?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is not required that the modification be \nread.\n  Mr. FORD. I understand that. I ask unanimous consent the modification \nbe read.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, could we do that after I----\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I want it read before we fill the tree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator aware that a second-degree \namendment has been sent to the desk? And the regular order is for the \nclerk to report the amendment.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I withdraw my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2945 to amendment No. 2943, as modified.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In the pending amendment, strike all after the first word \n     and insert in lieu thereof the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE PRESIDENT'S \n                   REVISED FEDERAL BUDGET.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) On May 19, 1995, the United States Senate voted 99-0 to \n     reject the Fiscal Year 1996 budget submitted by President \n     Clinton on February 6, 1995.\n       (2) The President on June 13, 1995, after the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate passed resolutions that the \n     Congressional Budget Office said would result in a balanced \n     federal budget in Fiscal Year 2002, revised his budget.\n       (3) The President said on June 13, 1995, and on numerous \n     subsequent occasions, that this revised budget would balance \n     the federal budget in Fiscal Year 2005.\n       (4) The President's revised budget, like the budget he \n     submitted to Congress on February 6, 1995, took into account \n     surpluses in the Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance \n     (OASDI) trust funds in calculating the deficit.\n       (5) President Clinton, in his address before a joint \n     session of Congress on February 17, 1993, stated that he was \n     ``using the independent numbers of the Congressional Budget \n     Office'' because ``the Congressional Budget Office was \n     normally more conservative in what was going to happen and \n     closer to right than previous Presidents have been.''\n\n[[Page S 15545]]\n\n       (6) President Clinton further stated: ``Let's at least \n     argue about the same set of numbers, so the American people \n     will think we're shooting straight with them.''\n       (7) The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the \n     President's revised budget would achieve savings of $128 \n     billion in Medicare through 2002 and $295 billion through \n     2005.\n       (8) The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the \n     President's revised budget would achieve savings of $54 \n     billion in federal Medicaid spending through 2002 and $105 \n     billion through 2005.\n       (9) The President has proposed savings of $64 billion in \n     ``non-health entitlements by 2002 by reforming welfare, farm \n     and other programs.''\n       (10) The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the \n     President's revised budget includes proposals that would \n     reduce federal revenues by $97 billion over seven years and \n     $166 billion over ten years.\n       (11) These proposed tax reductions are more than offset by \n     the President's proposed Medicare savings.\n       (12) The Congressional Budget Office has determined that \n     enactment of the President's proposal would result in \n     deficits in excess of $200 billion in each of fiscal years \n     1997 through 2005.\n       (13) President Clinton stated on October 17, 1995, that, \n     ``Probably there are people . . . still mad at me at that \n     budget because you think I raised your taxes too much. It \n     might surprise you to know that I think I raised them too \n     much, too.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that Congress shall enact President Clinton's budget as \n     revised on June 13, 1995.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, we are now back to the original subject at hand before \nthe Wellstone amendment, which is a sense of the Senate which says the \nSenate should adopt the President's second budget, his budget which he \nproclaims balances the budget over a 10-year period of time.\n  I wanted to show in graphic terms what the President's balanced \nbudget does. The red line is what the Congressional Budget Office says \nare the deficit projections for the President's balanced budget. You \nsee over the next 7 years the President's budget, unlike the Republican \nbudget here in the Senate that will be up tomorrow. You see the \ndifference between what we are debating here today and will be debating \nthe rest of the week is a vision, a vision of fiscal responsibility for \nthis country. If you are to believe the President, what the President \nwants to do, he does not want to get to a balanced budget in 7 years or \n10 years or any other time after that.\n  You can see what the Congressional Budget Office says is the annual \nprojected deficit for the President's budget. It is about $200 billion, \ngive or take, over the next 7 years. And by the way, this line \ncontinues out for several years to come. In the reconciliation package \nwe are going to debate tomorrow, we take the budget deficit from here \nand take it down to zero--in fact, a slight surplus in the year 2002.\n  This right here is the credibility gap, the gap between what the \nPresident says he wants to do, which is balance the budget, to where \nthe President really is in 7 years, which is at a $200 billion plus \ndeficit. That is a $200 billion credibility gap that the President is \ntrying to pull over on the American public. And somehow or another, a \n$200 billion deficit qualifies as a balanced budget. I do not think in \nanybody's book a $200 billion deficit qualifies as a balanced budget.\n  So what we have been having today is a discussion on the President's \nbudget and our budget and the differences between the two, and \nhopefully we will have a vote later today on whether we will adopt the \nPresident's budget, whether this body wants to go in the direction of \nred ink as far as the eye can see, of reductions--remember, the \nPresident calls for hundreds of billions of dollars in reductions in \nspending, and even with all those reductions in spending he still has \n$200 billion in deficit because he does not do enough. He does not make \nthe changes that are necessary to get this budget in order.\n\n  Remember, just 3 years ago the Governor of Arkansas campaigned across \nAmerica about change, change, change, change. How many times have you \nheard during the campaign of 1992 the word ``change''? How many times \nhave you heard over the past year the word ``change''? Not very much. \nWhat you heard is there is too much change, according to the President. \nThere is too much disruption. There is too much. ``Oh, we cannot do \nthat.'' He has all of a sudden come from being the President of change \nto the President of the status quo. And my fellow colleagues, this is \nthe status quo, this is continued deficits for as far as the eye can \nsee. That is not change. That is not pro-family. It is not pro-family \nAmerica; it is not pro-growth; it is not pro-anything except pro-\ndeficits and pro-decline.\n  We have an opportunity to reject the status quo here in a few minutes \nand start tomorrow on a fresh, new change in America's future, a \nbalanced budget that we will get to later today.\n  Mr. KYL. Will the Senator from Pennsylvania yield for a couple of \nquestions?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I would be glad to.\n  Mr. KYL. The Senator from Pennsylvania is talking about the \nPresident's budget. Has anybody on the minority side offered the \nPresident's budget for a vote here?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The Senator from Arizona asks a very relevant question, \nbecause on Friday morning I took the floor and put forth this \nresolution, and laid it on the desk down here and said, ``If anyone on \nthe other side wishes to take up the President's budget and argue for \nhis budget, it is there. The sense of the Senate to approve the \nPresident's budget is there, if anybody wants to offer it on the other \nside of the aisle, to defend what the President wants to do, to talk \nabout how he gets to balance, what his numbers are he used, what his \nassumptions are he uses, to speak on behalf of the President, to defend \nyour President. Who?''\n  And I do not know if the Senator from Arizona knows this, but the \nDemocratic National Committee is running TV spots all over the country, \nsaying, ``There are values, there are values behind the President's \nbalanced budget plan.'' Now you have the Democratic National Committee \nrunning around the country with TV ads proclaiming that this budget is \na balanced budget, and yet you cannot find one Member of the U.S. \nSenate on the other side of the aisle defending it, to defend what the \nPresident has done in reaching his balance. I wonder why that is.\n  Mr. KYL. Would the Senator from Pennsylvania yield for another \nquestion.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Of course.\n  Mr. KYL. Just so we have this all right now, the Senator from \nPennsylvania is offering up the President's budget just to see who is \nwilling to support it. There has not been a Member of his party willing \nto offer it.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If I could interrupt the Senator from Arizona.\n  Not only have they been unwilling to offer it, but during the time we \nhave had the opportunity to debate this past Friday and here again \ntoday, not one Member of the other side of the aisle has even risen to \ndefend it, much less offer it, to even question any of the arguments \nthat we have put forward on this subject.\n  Mr. KYL. Perhaps we can go back in time.\n  Did we not vote on the President's budget earlier this year? As I \nrecall, the Senate is on record as opposing the first President's \nbudget 99-0.\n  Could the Senator from Pennsylvania enlighten us further on that?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That is correct. Earlier this year we had the \nopportunity to debate and discuss the President's budget. And I am not \ntoo sure how many Members on the Democratic side of the aisle defended \nit. I am not too sure very many did. There were admissions that the \nPresident's budget did not go very far. But I will give the President \ncredit for this on his first budget: On his first budget he did not \nclaim he balanced the budget. He admitted that he had $250 billion-plus \ndeficits as far as the eye can see. He admitted it was a bad budget.\n  What he has come back with is a ruse. You know, he and his buddy, \nRosy, Rosy Scenario, have gotten together to come up with a budget by \nunderestimating what the interest rates will be and overestimating \ngrowth. He and Rosy have figured out a way to balance this budget. \nWell, unfortunately, Rosy does not cut it. We need real reforms. People \nare looking for real changes, the changes that he campaigned on in 1992 \nthat he is not delivering with these budgets.\n  Mr. President, I----\n  \n[[Page S 15546]]\n\n  Mr. KYL. Excuse me, if the Senator would further yield. We have been \nhaving a conversation about this. It seems that there is one other \nlittle problem, that is, in actuality there is a second President's \nbudget in the same sense that he offered the budget earlier in the \nyear; and the Republicans, through the Budget Committee, and the House \nand the Senate, have actually produced a full budget, funding each of \nthe departments of the U.S. Congress, as well as developing all the \nrevenues necessary for doing that.\n  Actually, is it not the case that what the President is talking about \nnow as his balanced budget is really a concept only, that, A, is not a \nfull budget, B, will not be offered by anyone in his party, C, does not \never get into balance insofar as the Congressional Budget Office \nestimates are concerned, and, therefore, really the only thing that we \ndo have to vote on later on this week is the Republican budget combined \nwith the other features of what we call the reconciliation bill here?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The Senator from Arizona again is exactly correct. What \nthe President has trumpeted across this land and the Democratic \nNational Committee has begun to run ads suggesting, is that the \nPresident has a balanced budget. No, he does not. He does not have any \nspecifics.\n  In fact, the entire package the President submitted back in June of \nthis year was some 10 pages, 10 pages of broad outlines as to how you \nwould accomplish it; no specifics, no itemized reductions, no specific \nplans on how to reform Medicare, no specific plans on how to reform \nMedicaid, no specific plans on how he is going to adopt his tax cuts, \nno specific plans on how he is going to increase education spending, \nwhich he says he wants to do. All of it is sort of vague, general \nnumbers without the kind of detail that we are forced, and should be \nrequired, frankly, to produce here in a budget reconciliation package.\n  We have come forward with the specifics. And, as you know, when you \nput forward specifics, you have a lot more to shoot at. In fact, I \nthink the reconciliation package is a pretty sizable document, a pretty \nvoluminous measure. And so I am sure within these documents you have a \nlot to shoot at. When you have 10 or 15 pages of broad generalizations, \nyou do not have much to sink your teeth into.\n  So the President has been able to run around and talk about a \nbalanced budget, which he has never really produced in detail, No. 1, \nand, No. 2, does not balance, and then proceeds to take shots at a very \nwell thought out, detailed description by the Republicans in the House \nand the Senate as to how we are going to get to the budget. It is a \npretty neat place to be. You are sitting there taking potshots at folks \nwithout having to deliver leadership.\n  Unfortunately, we have a President who does not think he has to lead, \nthinks he can sit back here and take potshots at what others trying to \nsolve the problem want to do.\n  Mr. KYL. Will the Senator yield for another question? I hate to ask \nall these other questions about the President's budget.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I do not see anyone else seeking time.\n  Mr. KYL. The President talked about his companion, Rosy, Rosy \nScenario. I recall when the President first spoke to the Congress, he \ntalked very firmly about the need for us to work together, using a \ncommon set of assumptions. And he pointed out that, of course, that \ncommon set of assumptions came from using the numbers, the credible \nnumbers, the objective, bipartisan numbers of the Congressional Budget \nOffice, to analyze how much Government would actually cost and how much \nthe revenue would actually be for the various kinds of taxation that we \nhave in the country, and that instead of the President using the OMB, \nwhich is what he accused past administrations of using, and the \nCongress using the CBO, or the Congressional Budget Office, we ought to \nboth agree that the CBO had it right. They had it figured out; they \nused the right assumptions; and we ought to use the CBO numbers.\n  Now, I would ask the Senator from Pennsylvania, which numbers did the \nPresident use? And did that have an effect on the assumptions inherent \nin his so-called budget?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. As the Senator from Arizona knows very well, the \nPresident broke his promise. He broke his promise that he made to the \nCongress in 1993 when he came to the joint session of Congress in his \nfirst speech before the Congress, and he stood up and said that we will \nuse a common set of numbers, we will use the Congressional Budget \nOffice numbers so we are working with the same numbers, so there are \nnot going to be any games on wishing away the problems.\n  He offered this budget using OMB numbers, the Office of Management \nand Budget within the White House, not the Congressional Budget Office \nup here on the Hill that we are bound to use.\n  The Congressional Budget Office is more conservative. They have more \npessimistic assumptions. And if you look at the history of budgets and \nthe projections of balancing, I am sure there are a lot of folks who \nare listening here who remember Congress after Congress saying, ``We'll \nbalance the budget in a few years; we'll get to it; we'll get to it,'' \nand projecting rosy scenarios out of the White House.\n  The fact of the matter is, we want to take a conservative approach, \nand if we are wrong, what is the downside if we are wrong? We end up \nwith a surplus, such a horrible thing to have. If the Office of \nManagement and Budget is wrong and their projections are too rosy, what \nhappens? We end up with a pretty good size deficit, that is the \nproblem.\n  So I suggest it is better to err and be cautious, as we are here in \nthe Congressional Budget Office using these numbers, than it is to go \nout and wish away the problem like the President has done.\n  Mr. KYL. Will the Senator yield for another question? I was just \nhanded this statement and wonder if the Senator is aware of it.\n  June O'Neill is the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, and \nshe testified in August, and I am quoting now that ``the deficits under \nthe President's July budget would probably remain near $200 billion \nthrough the year 2005.''\n  The July budget is the budget the Senator from Pennsylvania is \ntalking about and referring to in his chart here.\n  So the red line that the Senator from Pennsylvania has demonstrated \non his chart, compared to the line of zero down below, does that \nrepresent what June O'Neill, Director of CBO, says is the budget \ndeficit remaining near $200 billion through the year 2005 under the \nPresident's figures?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That is correct, and that is why this amendment is \nhere. If the President was not out running around saying that he has a \nbalanced budget and he has a budget plan and the Democratic National \nCommittee--by the way, this Democratic National Committee spot was not \n3 months ago, 4 months ago, it was this weekend--this weekend. In the \nface of this, in the face of the knowledge that the Congressional \nBudget Office says this plan does not balance, does not deter the \nDemocratic National Committee from running around lying to the American \npublic that it does balance, and it does not.\n  You have the Democratic leader who, after the President introduced \nhis second budget that said balanced, when the Congressional Budget \nOffice came out and said it did not, the Democratic leader said the \nPresident should use CBO numbers.\n  Now you have the Democratic leader criticizing the President saying, \n``Use the right numbers, don't cook the numbers.'' And yet the \nDemocratic National Committee, in the middle of this Titanic struggle \nto balance the budget, is going out there trying to fool the American \npublic, suggesting the President has a balanced budget plan.\n  Mr. FORD. Will the Senator from Pennsylvania yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. FORD. The two Senators over there are just talking to each other. \nI do have a germane amendment, which yours is not, to this bill. I have \ndiscussed it with the floor manager of the legislation. I would like to \nget on. If you want a vote, let us have a vote. You can even move to \ntable your amendment. I just would like to get on to other things, \nbecause we have been through this rosy scenario, and we are very \nacquainted with ``Rosy'' because you have introduced her to us.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  \n[[Page S 15547]]\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Rosy is not unique among Democrats and Republicans in \nthe White House. She has been a constant partner of Presidents for a \nlong time. The unfortunate part is this is the first time that a \nCongress has come forward with a true balanced budget without Rosy, and \nwhat we are doing is very serious business and what the President----\n  Mr. FORD. If the----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Let me finish my statement. When the President is out \nthere using Rosy to cover up what is a truly deficient budget that does \nnot balance in the face of the tough decisions that this Congress is \nmaking now, it raises that specter of deceit that has been going on \nwith Presidents for a long, long time to a new level. That is why this \namendment is on the floor.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield again?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. FORD. Did the Senator hear the former chairman of the Budget \nCommittee this morning when he said your budget, by CBO figures, was \n$108 billion or $105 billion short in 2002?\n  So you are standing up here telling us that you are balancing the \nbudget and you have the direct opposite view from that of the former \nchairman of the Budget Committee, and he got his information from CBO.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If I can reclaim my time, I am sure the Senator from \nNew Mexico will present the letter from the Congressional Budget Office \nDirector which certifies the budget does balance in 7 years. I do not \nknow where the Senator from South Carolina got his information.\n  Mr. FORD. He did not get it out of his own office, he got it out of \nCBO.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I reclaim my time, and I encourage that we defeat this \namendment. I will be happy to take an up-or-down vote. If the Senator \nfrom Kentucky will allow an up-or-down vote, we can do that. If the \nSenator requires me to table, I will be happy to do that.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. HATCH. If I can make a suggestion, I suggest we have a vote up or \ndown on the Senator's amendment. I intend to support him. I think we \nshould do that right now.\n  I notice the distinguished Senator from Iowa is ready to speak on the \nunderlying bill. The distinguished Senator from Kentucky, the minority \nwhip, has an amendment he would like to bring up. So I am prepared to \ngo to a vote if we can.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment and the \nbudget that President Clinton has submitted.\n  The President says he supports a balanced budget and that he has \nsubmitted a balanced budget to the Congress for consideration, but the \nagency he praised as the best authority on budget numbers, the CBO, \nsays otherwise. June O'Neill, the Director of CBO, testified in August \nthat ``the deficits under the President's July budget would probably \nremain near $200 billion through 2005.''\n  So, the President's budget does not balance. Not in 7 years, 8 years, \n9, or 10 years. It doesn't balance.\n  The President claims the Congress is cutting Medicare to pay for tax \ncuts for the rich. We all know that's not true either, just as we know \nthe President didn't propose to cut Medicare when he proposed tax cuts \nin his revised budget.\n  CBO estimates that the President's revised budget would reduce the \ngrowth in Medicare by $105 billion by 2005. The President's numbers put \nnet Medicare savings at $124 billion. So, President Clinton finds \nsavings in Medicare as well.\n  His budget also proposes tax cuts that would cut the growth of tax \nrevenues by $166 billion by 2005. The President's tax cuts are more \nthan offset by Medicare spending cuts. Yet we all know that cuts have \nnothing to do with Medicare. Whether we raise taxes, lower taxes or \nleave taxes the same, the fact is that Medicare will go bankrupt unless \nspending growth is slowed and the program is reformed.\n  Last week, the President said that he could support a balanced budget \nin 7 years, just as we are proposing. We should vote down this budget \ntoday and give the President another chance to produce a budget that \nCBO will certify gets us to balance. We want to work with the \nPresident, but we don't want--and we shouldn't--go back on the promise \nwe made to the American people to balance the budget by the year 2002.\n  Let us vote down this budget today and consider an alternative that \nkeeps the promises we have made. Let us balance the budget and give tax \nrelief to hard-working American families.\n  Mr. President, I think it is time for us to have a vote, and I simply \nwould like to frame what the vote is, in about 30 seconds here.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania has offered the President's budget. We \nare going to be voting later this week on the Republican budget. \nMembers will have an opportunity to decide: Do they want a budget that, \naccording to June O'Neill, the Director of the Congressional Budget \nOffice, shows deficits of $200 billion through the year 2005, or do \nthey want a balanced budget offered by the Republicans which will be \nvoted on later this week?\n  I suggest that we have the vote, that it be up or down, and that we \ndefeat the budget that has been offered by the Senator from \nPennsylvania, since none of the Members of the Democratic Party were \nwilling to offer the President's budget.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I also suggest we have this vote up or \ndown, and I agree this amendment should be defeated. We should not be \nvoting for the President's budget, which has $200 billion in deficits, \nad infinitum. It is not realistic about getting spending under control, \nand I think, once and for all, that we can vote on this issue.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, one additional comment. The Senator from \nKentucky and I just had a conversation. I want to give the Senator from \nKentucky and the Democrats credit for not defending the President's \nbudget. He is absolutely right, he is not defending the President's \nbudget because the President is not using the right numbers, so I give \ncredit to the other side for not standing up and defending this budget. \nI think they are showing character in not doing so. I think, hopefully, \nthat is a message that will be sent to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we do have a bill before us, a very \nimportant bill. We have been talking about amendments to that bill that \nare unrelated to the underlying bill. I am going to speak about the \nunderlying bill. I want to tell people who are watching that this \nsometimes happens in the U.S. Senate; that you get a relatively \nnoncontroversial bill before the Senate, and then people want to offer \namendments. I do not have any fault with either the process, or I do \nnot have any fault with the amendment on which we are going to be \nvoting. In fact, I cheer what the Senator from Pennsylvania is doing. \nBut I do want to state my view on this underlying bill which creates \nand extends some temporary judgeships, and then I also want to make a \nstatement on how we arrive at the number of judgeships we ought to have \nand the necessity for a review of that process.\n  As far as the underlying bill is concerned, Mr. President, I want to \nclearly state that I support the bill, even though I am going to raise \nsome questions about the process, even though I might raise a question \nabout one of the judges that is being temporarily extended, the \ncreation of which is being temporarily extended.\n  I want to state for the record that there is at least one of these \npositions that is being extended, some questions from judges who \noperate in this judicial district as to whether or not it even ought to \nbe extended.\n  I want to say at the outset that the Sixth Circuit Judicial Council \nhas asked that one of the temporary judgeships not be renewed. The \nletter I have from Mr. Wiggins, circuit executive for the sixth \ndistrict, who speaks about the temporary judgeship for the western \ndistrict of Michigan, says at a \n\n[[Page S 15548]]\nmeeting of the Sixth Circuit Judicial Council held on May 4, 1994: The \ncouncil approved the request of the western district of Michigan that \nno action be taken to extend the temporary judgeship for the western \ndistrict of Michigan.\n  With this bill, we are extending then some judgeships which judges \nthemselves have raised questions about whether or not they are needed, \nwhether or not they even want them.\n  It is, of course, this sort of mindset that has caused me to look \nvery closely at the spending habits and the allocation of judges in the \nFederal judiciary.\n  Congress has made difficult budget choices, as you know, this year--\nin fact, the next 3 days--on what we call the reconciliation process. \nWe are going to be voting on these particular tough decisions that we \nhave to make to get us to a balanced budget. In that process, we in the \nCongress have downsized our own staffs, the staffs of our committees. \nWe have downsized in the executive branch, as well.\n  I believe it is time that we look at the downsizing of the Federal \njudiciary. That is why I have begun a series of hearings on the proper \nallocation of Federal judges. As some in this body know, last week I \nchaired a hearing before the Court Subcommittee that I chair on the \nappropriate number of judges for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. \nCircuit.\n  That hearing addressed an issue which this body has not considered \nsince the 19th century--the process of eliminating judgeships. The last \ntime we eliminated a judgeship as a Congress was in 1868 when there \nwere 10 members of the Supreme Court temporarily because of what \nPresident Lincoln wanted to do. It was reduced by one judgeship. That \nis the last time I have been told that is the case.\n  Here we are looking at whether or not we need 12 judges on the \ncircuit for Washington, DC. The caseload of the Washington, D.C. \ncircuit has actually declined slightly over the past few years. The \nnumber of agency cases in the D.C. circuit is about the same now as it \nwas in 1983--that was a year before Congress created a 12th judgeship \nin the D.C. circuit.\n  It costs a little under $1 million--$800,000, to be exact--when we \ncreate and keep filled a circuit court judgeship. By the way, that \nfigure, $800,000, comes from the judicial conference. In other words, \nthat is the official judiciary's estimate. It is not my estimate.\n  The administration claims despite the declining caseload, despite the \nexpense to the American taxpayers, that 12th seat must be filled. I am \nnot convinced that this is so. Mr. President, $1 million per year, per \njudgeship is a lot. I do not think it should be spent unwisely.\n  Mr. President, with respect to the D.C. circuit, the administration \nbasically says that the D.C. circuit is too slow in rendering decisions \nand that a 12th judge would speed things up. But this is not \nnecessarily so.\n  I agree with a large number of well-respected Federal judges who have \nraised serious concerns about the runaway growth of the Federal branch. \nSome judges, including Judge Silberman on the D.C. circuit and Judge \nWilkinson of the First Circuit Court of Appeals, have raised serious \nobjections to an excessively large Federal judiciary. These circuit \njudges have concluded, based on the experience of the ninth circuit, \nthat courts of appeal which are too large actually decrease the quality \nof judicial decisionmaking and increase the possibility of a \nconflicting panel decision which must be reconciled through full court \nrehearings.\n  At my hearing that I held last week in my subcommittee, Judge \nSilberman testified that 12 judges is just too many for the D.C. \ncircuit. In those very brief periods when the D.C. circuit has actually \nhad 12 judges--and that was just for a brief period of time, quite \nfrankly, Mr. President, between 1984 and now, when it was created, I \nthink a period of not more than 18 months--there just was not enough \nwork to go around. That is what Judge Silberman said.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article from a newspaper about the \nhearing I recently chaired which appears in the paper be printed in the \nRecord at the end of my remarks. Furthermore, I ask unanimous consent \nto have printed the letter I read from the sixth judicial council.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibits 1 and 2.)\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Furthermore, when there are too many judges--and I go \nback to what Judge Silberman is saying and what Judge Wilkinson is \nsaying--there are too many opportunities for Federal intervention.\n  We should not forget, just as Government regulatory agencies swelled \nin number and size since President Roosevelt and President Johnson set \nAmerica on a path to big Government and Government control of the \neconomy, the Federal courts have also increased in size. The size of \nthe Federal judiciary is an indicator, in the view of many people, \nincluding myself, of the degree of unnecessary Federal intervention in \nState and local affairs.\n  To some degree, I must admit, this is our fault. Whenever we in the \nCongress try to create a Federal solution to a State and local problem, \nwe give the Federal judiciary more work to do. So we have to, of \ncourse, shoulder some blame for this, and it would not take a lot of \nresearch that every Senator, including this one, has done some things, \npromoted some legislation to increase the workloads of the Federal \njudiciary.\n  Is that right? No, it is not right. It is a fact. We have an \nopportunity now to review some of this. We have a bill before the \nSenate that extends temporary judgeships that were created 5 years ago \nfor another short period of time, to get us over a hurdle.\n  We are going do that, obviously, but it calls for the consideration \nof how we do this, how often we do it, and whether we do it in too \nwilly-nilly of a fashion.\n  Like most of my colleagues on this side of the aisle, I do not \nnecessarily support Federal solutions to local problems. With the \nRepublican victory last November, I am confident that some common sense \nwill be restored to the way that we do business up here in Washington.\n  Mr. President, all of what I have described is expensive. When we ask \nfor more Government, more committees, more employees on the Hill, more \nbureaucrats downtown, and even more judges, it is all very expensive. \nSo it is time we in Congress step up to the plate on the issue of the \nFederal judiciary and its size and we make some tough budgetary \nchoices.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             When It Comes to Judges, Many Say Less Is More\n\n                          (By Frank J. Murray)\n\n       The U.S. Senate may be about to abolish an appeals court \n     judgeship because there's not enough work to justify the job.\n       This has happened only once before, in 1868, when Congress \n     cut the U.S. Supreme Court from 10 justices to nine.\n       But the mood to cut judgeships is growing.\n       At issue is whether to cut the 12-judge U.S. Court of \n     Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, the nation's second most \n     important court. Three of the nine current Supreme Court \n     justices were elevated from that court.\n       Yesterday, Judge Randall R. Rader of the Federal Circuit \n     told The Washington Times that 12-judge appeals court also \n     could be better off if its current vacant slot were \n     abolished.\n       ``I think circuit courts work better in smaller numbers. I \n     think that the Federal Circuit would work as well with 11 \n     [judges], perhaps more efficiently,'' Judge Rader said.\n       In the Eastern District of Louisiana, Chief Judge Morey L. \n     Sear is asking the Senate not to fill two vacancies on the \n     U.S. District Court bench.\n       And Judge Laurence H. Silberman of the D.C. Circuit \n     advocates cutting one judge from that court.\n       Sen. Charles E. Grassley, Iowa Republican and chairman of \n     the Senate Judiciary oversight subcommittee, says he has \n     found support for reducing the number of judges on the D.C. \n     Circuit and elsewhere during soundings of sentiment among \n     appeals judges nationwide.\n       Chief Circuit Judge Harry T. Edwards, who opposes the \n     reduction, acknowledges that Judge Silberman speaks for a \n     significant faction of the court, although its 11 judges have \n     taken no vote.\n       Chief Judge Edwards says any decision not to leave the \n     question to the U.S. Judicial Conference could suggest ``some \n     agenda that has nothing to do with the quality of justice.''\n       In opening a committee hearing last week, Mr. Grassley said \n     his choices fall between filling the vacancy and cutting the \n     bench by as many as three positions.\n       Each circuit judgeship costs about $800,000 a year, \n     including salaries for a support staff of five. Such \n     judgeships must be eliminated when vacant because the \n     Constitution guarantees incumbent judges the jobs and their \n     salary levels for life.\n       ``We think the [D.C. Circuit] seat should be filled,'' says \n     White House spokeswoman \n\n[[Page S 15549]]\n     Ginny Terzano. ``It's not a political issue. It's a question of whether \n     this seat should exist or not, and the administration thinks \n     it should.''\n       In separate interviews, Judges Edwards and Silberman says \n     they respect each other's opinions on an issue laden with \n     political overtones.\n       ``If the question to me is, are we better off with 12 \n     judges--do we serve the public better and do our jobs \n     better?--my answer is yes,'' Judge Edwards says. But he \n     concedes he can't effectively challenge those who rely on a \n     formula allotting the circuit just 9\\1/2\\ judges because of \n     declining workload.\n       ``I can't say there's any magic number and produce that \n     number to prove the point,'' Chief Judge Edwards says. ``I \n     admitted it is a difficult assessment in those terms.'' \n     Although the number of cases accepted for review fell over a \n     10-year period, the backlog of 2,000 is up 70 percent.\n       ``I do think the 12 judges is excessive and therefore a \n     diversion of judicial resources,'' Judge Silberman told the \n     Judiciary Committee. He says 11 is the right number and nine \n     is too few.\n       The resolution of the dispute could determine whether Mr. \n     Clinton eventually undoes what Ronald Reagan wrought. The \n     D.C. Circuit has five Reagan nominees, two Bush appointees, \n     two Clinton nominees and two Carter appointees--including \n     Chief Judge Edwards. Judge Silberman was appointed by \n     President Reagan.\n       ``I am in favor of the abolition of the 12th judgeship no \n     matter who is president or who controls the Senate. We simply \n     do not need a 12th judgeship, and there is a cost in the \n     quality of our decisionmaking,'' Judge Silberman says. He \n     says he expressed this view privately months before Mr. \n     Garland's nomination and wrote a Sept. 26 letter spelling out \n     his position at Mr. Grassley's invitation.\n       ``The fact that I am in some measure of disagreement with \n     the chief judge on this issue has not affected my enormous \n     respect and affection for him,'' Judge Silberman says. Says \n     Chief Judge Edwards: ``Everyone else who's testified has \n     supported the 12th judge. I don't care to say anything on \n     that. Our relationship is good. I'll leave it that way.''\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                                             U.S. Court of Appeals\n\n\n                                        For the Sixth Circuit,\n\n                                      Cincinnati, OH, May 5, 1994.\n     Re temporary judgeship in Western District of Michigan.\n\n     David L. Cook,\n     Chief, Statistics Division Administrative Office of the U.S. \n         Courts, Federal Judiciary Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Cook: At a meeting of the Sixth Circuit Judicial \n     Council held on May 4, 1994, the Council approved the request \n     of the Western District of Michigan that no action be taken \n     to extend the temporary judgeship for the Western District of \n     Michigan.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 James A. Wiggins,\n                                                Circuit Executive.\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise to support the effort that the \nSenator from Pennsylvania has put to the Senate but would encourage my \ncolleagues to vote against the resolution.\n  The resolution calls for the adoption, as I understand it, of the \nPresident's budget as submitted June 13 of this year. When the vote is \ncalled, I hope that my colleagues would vote against the resolution.\n  Again, I want to support the effort that the Senator from \nPennsylvania is making. What he is really giving us is an opportunity \nto discuss--and I suspect maybe some do not want to discuss it--the \nPresident's budget, because there is the impression that has been \ncreated that with this proposal that the President made in June, that \nthere is an alternative to what Republicans have proposed.\n  In the next few days we will be voting on the reconciliation package. \nThat, combined with other actions of the Senate--the appropriations \nbill, the passage of the budget resolution earlier this year--will lead \nus to a balanced budget, according to CBO.\n  There is a proposal, again, that will come to the floor of the Senate \ntomorrow, and we should have a vote on final passage before we conclude \nour work this week, that will, in fact, over a period of 7 years, \nbalance the budget. If my memory is correct, that will be the first \ntime that the budget will have been balanced since 1969.\n  I again want to take the opportunity here to talk about the \nPresident's budget, but I cannot help but think that there are times \nmaybe for a little levity.\n  Over the weekend, through some clandestine activity, we were able to \ncome up with an instrument that allows us to understand how the \nPresident comes to conclusions about certain tax policies.\n  This instrument is the key. This is spun, apparently, and where it \nstops is an indication of what the President's policy with respect to \ntaxes should be.\n  Again, just to quote some of the various options here that the \nPresident has to pick from, in January 1992 the President said, ``I \nwant to make it very clear that this middle-class tax cut is central * \n* *'' to what he is trying to accomplish. Then, in March 1992, just a \nfew months later, I am quoting the President again, he says, ``but to \nsay that this middle-class tax is the center of anybody's economic \npackage is just wrong.''\n  Then, on June 8, the President went on to say, ``I would emphasize to \nyou that the press and my opponents always made more of the middle-\nclass tax cut than I did.'' We all are familiar with the President's \ncomments with respect to taxes raised in 1993. He has been quoted \nrather extensively, I think, now, over the last week or so, in essence \nadmitting that he went too far in raising taxes.\n  What is ironic about that, in the same breath he really said it was \nnot his fault, that the Congress--the fact that he had to work within \nthe Democratic Party--he was forced to raise taxes and he now admits it \nwas a mistake and in essence he apologized for having raised those \ntaxes.\n  Interestingly enough, you could use this instrument for just about \nany policy decisions in the White House that you wanted. You could take \nthe issue of budget resolutions. If you go to candidate Clinton in \n1992, I believe he said on the ``Larry King Show'' that he believed \nthat a budget could be balanced in a 5-year period.\n  Then, the first budget that the President submitted to the Congress \ndid not call for a balanced budget at all. That was in 1993, even after \nraising taxes to the point I think many have said was the largest \nsingle tax increase in the history of the country. Certainly a large \none. So here we are in the President's first year, presenting to the \nCongress a budget that in fact does not call for balance.\n  Then, earlier this year the President proposed to the Congress his \nbudget for fiscal year 1996. Interestingly enough, there was no effort \nto balance the budget in that particular proposal. In fact, I think \nthis is the one that was voted on. It was voted down 99 to zero. There \nwas no support whatsoever in the Senate for the President's first \nproposal this year. That called for balancing the budget in a 10-year \nperiod. When it was reestimated by CBO, it was indicated we would see \ndeficits out, well, forever--of $200 billion-plus per year.\n  The President has been quoted, too, as saying he now favors a program \nthat would balance the budget in 7 years--at least that was the \nimplication. I should be careful about that. That was the implication--\nthat the President in fact supported the concept of balancing the \nbudget in 7 years.\n  So I thought it was an interesting find over the weekend to have \nfound this instrument that really has turned out to be the key to the \nPresident's policy decisionmaking process. That has been, I think, very \nhelpful.\n  Also, since we have the opportunity to talk about the President's \nbudget, it has been some time since we have had an opportunity to focus \non this. The Joint Economic Committee, as the Chair recognizes, held a \nhearing to review the President's supposed balanced budget proposal \nover 10 years. Mind you, over 10 years. He claimed to have balanced the \nbudget in 10 years.\n  This chart indicates, again according to CBO, what would be necessary \nin order to balance the budget over a 7-year period. We would have to \nreduce Federal expenditures, that is the anticipated Federal \nexpenditures, over that 7-year period by $1.257 trillion. In fact, that \nis the proposal that the Republicans have put before the Senate, both \nas a budget resolution and now the combination of appropriations bills \nand reconciliation bill. So we are going to meet this goal.\n  The President's proposal does not come anywhere near that. As you \nbegin to review--not my analysis of the President's budget, but the \nCongressional Budget Office's analysis of the President's budget--and \nyou might be asking yourself why does the Senator keep referring to the \nCongressional Budget Office, known as CBO?\n  The reason I do is because I remember, I think as most of the Members \nof the Senate do, that in January 1993, when we were all assembled at a \njoint \n\n[[Page S 15550]]\nsession of the Congress to hear the President's State of the Union \nMessage, he really challenged the Congress. Maybe that is really not \nthe way to say it. I think what he was saying to the Congress is he \nrecognized in the past, that previous administrations and previous \nCongresses, frankly, had used smoke and mirrors to put budget \nresolutions together. When things got tough and tough decisions were \ngoing to have to be made, the Congress somehow or another decided they \nwould accept rosier economic assumptions. Because by accepting rosier \neconomic assumptions, fewer cuts had to be made.\n  This is what the President said, back in January 1993. He said that \nhe would use ``the independent numbers of the Congressional Budget \nOffice, so we could argue about priorities with the same set of \nnumbers. I did this so no one could say I was estimating my way out of \nthis difficulty.''\n  Guess what, here is another flip-flop. If I had that other chart back \nup maybe we could spin the wheel one more time and see if the President \nwould conclude he should respond to this kind of question. The \nPresident has decided not to use the Congressional Budget Office \nnumbers. He has decided to use OMB. As a result of using OMB, guess \nwhat, they are using rosier economic assumptions--economic assumptions \nabout the level of economic growth; economic assumptions about interest \nrates; economic assumptions about inflation and so forth.\n  The end result was that the President has, in fact, estimated his way \nout of the problem. This portion of the reduction does in fact come \nabout as a result of changing economic assumptions and using lower \ninterest rates, assuming there will be lower interest rates in the \nfuture.\n  I say to my colleagues as we have an opportunity to both vote on this \nresolution and on reconciliation, it is obvious. It does not get to \nzero. Over half of the deficit reduction the President has proposed \ncomes from estimating his way out of the problem, using higher growth \nnumbers, lower interest rates, and so forth. That program just will not \ndo it. This is exactly what created the problem we are in today. It is \nbecause, in the past, every administration and every Congress decided \nto blink.\n  All I am saying is you cannot get there with the plan the President \nhas proposed and that is why I encourage Members to vote against the \nresolution that is on the floor.\n  Sometimes people get lost with charts in this discussion of economics \nand statistics and numbers. If you think about it, in essence what CBO \nhas said is that deficits are growing at this rate. This line \nrepresents the deficits out in the future if we do not do anything. \nHere is what we would have to do--that is this line here represents \nzero. We have to get rid of this gap. We have to fill that gap, rather, \nin order to solve the deficit problem.\n  The President has figured he will address the problem with over half \nof that gap being filled by phony economic assumptions. That has \nhappened year after year after year. That is why we have seen the debt \nbuild up year after year.\n  Mr. President, I want to address maybe two other areas related to \nthis. The first is, what does this mean to individuals? What is \nimportant about doing this? Clearly one could make the economic \nargument that this is important because it is going to get us to a \nbalanced budget. Plenty of other people have made those arguments and I \nhave heard my colleagues on the other side of the floor refer to what \nour proposal might do to people in the country.\n  I ask them to think about what is going to happen to those \nindividuals if we do not do something. Take Medicare, briefly. What if \nwe do not act on Medicare? How are they going to answer the people 7 \nyears from now when there is no money in the trust fund to make those \nbenefit payments? What are they going to say to their moms, dads, and \ngrandparents? What are they going to say to those individuals who are \nsuffering from all types of diseases that come as a result of aging? \nAre they just going to say we did not have the courage back in 1995 to \nsolve the problem; we felt it would be better to do whatever Congress \nhas done before that? That is, flinch; fuzzy up the issue; change the \neconomic assumptions; avoid the tough decisions? That is what they are \nsaying.\n  Oh, they will not admit that. But that is exactly what they are \nsaying. What about those people, those young families in America where \nmom and dad get up at 4:30, 5 o'clock in the morning and commute to \nwork, and by the time they get back home in the evening it is already \ndark? They feel, and I think accurately so, that the Federal Government \nis sucking money away from them to pay for programs that have been \nproven to fail. It would be another thing if, in fact, programs were \nworking. But almost everyone in America today understands that they \nhave failed.\n  They have failed, and it is fundamentally wrong to say to those hard-\nworking men and women of this Nation trying to raise their families, \ntrying to provide the necessary dollars for education, for food, for \nhealth care, and so forth, ``Oh, no. We are going to take more of your \nmoney away from you and we are going to give it to those guys in \nWashington, DC, to continue to spend on programs that have proven to be \na failure.''\n  What about the young couple where the father works all week, in fact \nhas two jobs? He comes home for the weekend, and he takes care of the \nchildren, and his wife works for the weekend to make just a little bit \nmore money so they can make ends meet. What about them? What about \nthose individuals that we have been taking money away from to transfer \nit to someone else that they feel, frankly, is not worthy of it, \nbecause they hear the stories about the programs that have failed.\n  In fact, that has happened as we have gone from this dream that was \ncreated in the early 1960's to the nightmare of the programs that have \nbeen developed over the years, and the poverty that people are living \nin today, and the dependency that people are living in today as a \nresult of those programs.\n  So I ask my colleagues to think about those men and women who are \nworking hard day-in and day-out. What about them? What about their \nfuture? What about their opportunity? They will not have one--not at \nthe level that we have experienced over the years, if we continue the \nkind of Federal spending and the Federal programs that have been going \non for these last 25 years or so.\n  The last point I would make is I think that the decision we are \nmaking here, the decision to reject the President's alternative which \ndoes not get us anywhere near a balanced budget and the reconciliation \npackage that we will have an opportunity to vote on in just a few days, \nI think the opportunity is much greater than the simple reaching of a \nbalanced budget. We have a Nation that for generations and for \ncenturies has been dedicated to the principles of freedom, \nindependence, justice, democracy, human rights, free markets, free \nenterprise, and capitalism. And I believe that our country is the only \none in the world today that has the interest or the concern or the \ndesire to see that those principles are exported around the world. But \nif we do not get our fiscal house in order, we will not have an \nopportunity to do that. America will not be the center of influence in \nthe 21st century, and America will not have the opportunity to expand \nand pursue those ideas around the world.\n  So this is much larger than just this simple debate today about \nwhether we are going to support the President's plan or whether we are \ngoing to support our plan. We are talking about America's future.\n  The President has failed to provide us with leadership. He has failed \nto provide us with a plan and, therefore, he has failed to provide us \nwith an alternative. There is no choice. Reject this resolution that \nhas been proposed, and in a few days vote for the reconciliation \npackage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest that we are prepared to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). Is there further debate?\n  Mr. FORD. Is this is on the second degree?\n  Mr. HATCH. Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered on the \nsecond-degree amendment. \n\n[[Page S 15551]]\n\n  If there is no further debate, the question is on agreeing to the \namendment of the Senator from Utah. On this question, the yeas and nays \nhave been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was rejected.\n  Mr. FORD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] \nis recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, we just witnessed on the Senate floor \nthe President's revised balanced budget getting no votes; his plan to \nbalance the budget over 10 years getting no votes on the U.S. Senate \nfloor, no support on either side of the aisle. Nobody on the other side \nof the aisle, and rightfully so, I might add, defended his balanced \nbudget.\n  All I suggest to the Democratic National Committee, which is running \na television ad saying that the President has a balanced budget, that \nit is now, I think, apparent that the President does not have a \nbalanced budget and that nobody believes he has a balanced budget. So \nquit running ads on national television saying he does have a balanced \nbudget.\n  There is no support for phony numbers in the U.S. Senate from either \nside of the aisle, and I commend my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle for standing up and sending a very clear message down \nPennsylvania Avenue that we are tired of the President running around \ncampaigning and not coming back here to work on a serious balanced \nbudget resolution and reconciliation.\n  We have the opportunity, as a result of the 1994 elections and the \nmovements in this House and Senate, to pass a balanced budget. No more \nphony-baloney politics, but real deficit reduction, real balanced \nbudgets.\n  Mr. President, 0 to 96; 0 to 96, I think that is a pretty clear \nmessage to the President and his TV commercial that the Democratic \nNational Committee has out which says--as they read the text, there is \nan image of the President sitting at his desk working on a balanced \nbudget plan. I suggest that the President actually do go to his desk \nand actually do start working on a balanced budget plan and not try to \npull the wool over the American public's eyes on a budget that does not \nbalance, on a plan that does not do what he is claiming it does.\n  I am hopeful that the message will be sent to the President and to \nthe Democratic National Committee that these kinds of ruses that are \ntrying to be pulled on the American public have no place in a serious \ndialog about solving the great fiscal problems of this country.\n  I want to commend both sides of the aisle for delivering that message \nloud and clear this afternoon to the President of the United States \nthat his budget is phony, his budget does not work; that he needs to \nget serious about balancing this budget; that he needs to come to the \nHill and sit down and work on a bipartisan basis to solve this problem; \nand that the campaigning has to end and being President and presiding \nhas to begin today.\n  We are ready to go. We are going to start tomorrow. We are going to \npass a budget. We are going to pass a reconciliation package, and I \nhope at that time that the President will hear the call, will hear 0 to \n96 on his phony plan and come here and get serious about the business \nat hand.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, has the Senator from Pennsylvania \nwithdrawn the first-degree amendment that he offered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's first-degree is still pending.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am tempted to offer a second-degree \namendment. I expected the Senator from Pennsylvania would----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If the Senator from North Dakota will yield for an \nexplanation. I intended to withdraw the amendment. The Senator from \nMississippi wanted to speak briefly, and then I was going to withdraw \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reclaiming my time, I sought recognition expecting that \nyou would have withdrawn the amendment, but you did not. I am tempted \nto offer a second-degree amendment, which I was intending to do. But \nlet me just make a comment that the Senator from Pennsylvania has a \nknack----\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield for just a second?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. HATCH. I suggest that the Senator from Pennsylvania withdraw his \namendment and that will solve that problem, and then, of course, \nwhatever remarks the distinguished Senator would like to make; is that \nOK?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have the floor. Let me just make my \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from Pennsylvania has a knack for winning \ndebates that we are not having. This is the third that he has won with \nthis amendment offering President Clinton's budget. I did not vote for \nthat. The Senator from Pennsylvania is correct that the President did \nnot propose a budget that calls for a balanced budget.\n  I want to ask the Senator from Pennsylvania a question. The Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania offered this, I guess, because he wanted to make the \npoint that we must have a balanced budget on the floor of the Senate. \nAnd I think in further of that point, he would say the reconciliation \nbill that he is going to vote for later this week does, in fact, \nprovide a balanced budget.\n  I ask the Senator from Pennsylvania if he has seen the letter of \nOctober 20 from the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, and I \nwill read to the Senator from Pennsylvania the last sentence of the \nfirst paragraph. Just to refresh the memory of the Senator from \nPennsylvania, he will recall that the majority party brought a big \nchart to the floor, and it had one of these giant gold seals on it with \nribbons and things. It says, ``This certifies that this budget is in \nbalance,'' and it was attached to a letter from the Director of the \nCongressional Budget Office.\n  I looked at that big gold seal that had been printed up in some \nconfetti factory someplace and did not really mean anything but it was \ncolorful, I looked at that and said, ``Gee, how can you certify that \nthis is in balance?''\n  That is a curious thing, because I know that in the year 2002, the \nonly way you could have done that would have been to have taken the \nSocial Security trust funds and use them and then claim they were in \nbalance. Of course, that would not be an honest \n\n[[Page S 15552]]\nway to use the Social Security trust funds.\n  So I wrote to the Director of the Congressional Budget Office the \nnext day, October 19, and said, ``Could you tell me, if you don't use \nthe Social Security trust funds, what is the budget balance in the year \n2002?''\n  She wrote a letter back on the 19th of October and then a second \nletter correcting an error in the letter of the 19th. The second letter \nis the 20th and it says: ``Excluding an estimated off-budget surplus of \n$115 billion in 2002 from the calculation, the CBO would project an on-\nbudget deficit of $105 billion in 2002.''\n  Is the Senator from Pennsylvania familiar with this letter that says \nthe CBO would project an on-budget deficit of $105 billion in 2002?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania was critical, I think properly so, of \nthe budget that he submitted in his amendment. Would he also be \ncritical of a proposal brought to the floor of the Senate that contains \na deficit of $105 billion in the year 2002, or is this the one he is \nprepared to vote for?\n  I will be happy to yield for a question or for a response without \nyielding my right to the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, we have a certification from the \nCongressional Budget Office that says that the budget comes into \nbalance by the year 2002.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is under the false assumption because \nwe have trust funds they are not part of the Federal Government. They \nare part of the Federal Government like the highway trust fund is, like \nthe aviation trust fund is. Just like we have a number of trust funds \nin this budget.\n  To suggest that they are not part of the Federal Government and \nshould not be considered just does not look at reality. The reality is \nthis is all part of the Federal Government. The Social Security \nAdministration is a Federal Agency run by the Federal Government. To \nsuggest somehow they should not be included in a Federal budget, I \nthink, flies in the face of fact.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me ask an additional question because the Senator is \nattempting to respond to my original questioning saying this is \nincome--income to the Federal Government.\n  Let me ask the Senator to put himself in a business seat, running a \nbusiness, and someone says, ``How can you possibly take the trust funds \nfrom our pension program and use them as income on your operating \nstatement? That is dishonest.''\n  The Senator would say, ``Well, what do you mean dishonest? That is \npart of my income.''\n  Do you think the Senator would stay in his desk very long or would \nthey haul you to the penitentiary?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I suggest no one is taking that money and using it \nwithout replacing it with an interest-bearing note required by law. \nThere is no raiding of any pension fund going on here.\n  To suggest otherwise is a deliberate attempt to scare people, when, \nin fact, the Senator from North Dakota knows very well that money is \nonly as secure as the solvency of this Government.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I think we are getting close to an answer----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. We are trying to get this Government solvent to pay \nback----\n  Mr. DORGAN. I think we are getting close to an answer, which is \ninteresting because my theory is that there are some who think double-\nentry bookkeeping or double-entry accounting means you can use the same \nmoney twice. I think that is what we are seeing.\n  I think the Senator has said, well, it is not that we have taken the \nmoney out of the trust fund. There still exists an asset in the trust \nfund. If there still exists an asset in the trust fund, it cannot be \nover here. It is over here in the trust fund or it is over here in the \nbudget as income.\n  Now, if it is over here in the budget as income, it is not in the \ntrust fund. If it says, the Senator from Pennsylvania says it is in the \ntrust fund, then you have a problem. Then you have to tear up that \nlittle gold certificate you brought to the floor that says you have a \nbalanced budget, because your own Director of the CBO, June O'Neil, \nsays, sorry, pal, $105 billion deficit in the year 2002.\n  The question is, where is it? It cannot be in two places. Is it over \nin the trust fund or is it used as revenue over here in your operating \nbudget? Which, I ask the Senator from Pennsylvania, is it? Where does \nit exist?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. It is, as the Senator from North Dakota knows very \nwell, what we are looking at as accounting practices to determine what \nthe overall assets and liabilities are for Government; what you are \ndoing is trying to play games.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator is not responding to my question.\n  I am asking you, is it in the trust fund or used as income over the \noperating revenue side? It cannot be in both places.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The money is a credit toward the trust fund. That trust \nfund surplus, like the aviation fund surplus, like the highway trust \nfund surplus, is part of the overall budget and is used for accounting \npurposes--for accounting purposes--to offset other deficiencies in \nother areas of the budget, for accounting purposes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Now I understand.\n  Now, you propose that it is a credit in the trust fund. It is a \ncredit. Now, what that means is that the trust fund is owed money you \nhave used somewhere else.\n  That is why, you see, this does not add up. The only reason I am \ndoing this, you brought to the floor something that says the \nadministration's budget is a fraud because it does not propose to \nbalance the budget. I agree with you. It did not balance the budget. I \nagree.\n  I am asking if the Director of your CBO writes a letter to us and \nsays, if you do not use the Social Security trust fund--and believe me, \nyou cannot do that because it is not the right way--you have a $105 \nbillion deficit in the year 2002.\n  Why is that important? It is important because you say you will \ntrigger a tax cut in balancing the budget and come up with a letter \ndated 10/18 saying, guess what? We have gold paper and a new ribbon and \na letter saying we balance the budget.\n  Then I asked the question, if you balance the budget according to the \nlaw as written by Senator Hollings--incidentally, that says you cannot \nuse the trust fund. What do you have? Could you have a balanced budget? \nThe answer is no, I am sorry, you have a $105 billion deficit in the \nyear 2002.\n  I only do this to point out the contradiction of what you have just \ndone. You do not have a balanced budget, either.\n  What I want to see us do is find a way that all of us could sift \nthrough all of this and figure out what represents wise choices. Where \ndo you cut spending, where do you find revenue, where do you invest, \nwhere do you put together the pieces of this puzzle that really address \nthe fiscal policy problem that we have?\n  This amendment we just had was not a tough vote for me because I have \nsaid before I do not support what President Clinton sent to us. But \nlast night I offered an opportunity to vote on a simple proposition: At \nleast restrict or limit the tax cut to those people whose earnings or \nincome is less than a quarter of a million dollars a year.\n  Do you know what you save by that restriction? If you say the tax cut \nonly goes to those with incomes of $250,000 a year or less, you save \n$50 billion by limiting the tax cut, over 7 years--$50 billion.\n  Now, I said, use that to reduce the cut we will make in Medicare. It \nis kind of an interesting juxtaposition. A lot of people in this \ncountry are doing very well, some making $1 million a year, some $10 \nmillion a year. God bless them. But frankly, they do not need a tax \ncut.\n  We are going to very low-income people and saying, guess what? News \nfor you--increase your cuts and reduce your health care.\n  It is all about choices, which the Senator was alluding to on the \nrequirement to vote for this amendment. I have no objection.\n  My only point is the argument made in favor of offering this, that \nthe budget was not in balance as offered by the President, is exactly \nthe same position you find yourself in, certified by the Director of \nthe Congressional Budget Office. Is that not kind of a contradiction?\n  I am happy to yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Where does the Senator from North Dakota come up \n\n[[Page S 15553]]\n  with a $50 billion figure for those making over $250,000? I would love \nto see the estimate.\n  Mr. DORGAN. It is a reckoning by the Department of Treasury. Over 7 \nyears, the amount of the tax break that will go to those earning over a \nquarter million dollars a year, over the 7-year period, totals about \n$50 billion.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If the Senator will yield, the Senator from New Mexico \nand the Senator from Delaware have on numerous occasions come to the \nfloor and discussed the tax cut and suggested that 90 percent of the \nbenefits of the tax cut go to people under $100,000.\n  If that is correct, that means only $23 billion, roughly, $24 \nbillion, roughly, goes to people over $100,000. I do not know how you \ncome up with a figure of $50 billion for those over $250,000.\n  Mr. DORGAN. There is room for plenty of surprises on the floor of the \nSenate, but there is no room for surprise as significant as the one you \nhave just offered or you say is offered by the Senator from Delaware, \nthat 90 percent of this tax cut is going to go to people whose incomes \nare below $100,000.\n  That is not just a surprise, that is so far from the truth that it \nhardly warrants a response.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That is why we will have debate tomorrow.\n  Mr. DORGAN. We are going to, but we will find going through the \ndetails of this that not only does it not hit the bull's eye, the arrow \ndoes not hit the target. It is not anywhere near it.\n  The fact is, about half of this tax cut in the aggregate, added all \nup, about half of it--this comes from the Office of Treasury, the U.S. \nTreasury Department--about half of that goes to persons whose incomes, \nfamilies whose incomes are over $100,000 a year.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Is the Office of the Treasury the official estimator of the tax \nprovisions in the U.S. Congress?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I say to the Senator from Pennsylvania, it is difficult \nfor us to get estimates on a very timely basis out of the Joint Tax \nCommittee.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The Joint Tax Committee is the official estimator?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes, and I am happy to give information from them except \nI would not get it the way your side has done it. What happened, you \ngive us a bunch of tables and tell us the impact of the tax but do not \ncount the change in the earned income tax credit, by the way. Do not \ncount that. Then give us the table and tell us what we are doing.\n  So they get the tables, and I say, what is this? These are not \ntables. They do not mean anything. They are not accurate.\n  So the information I have received from the Department of the \nTreasury shows that about half of the tax breaks will go to families \nwith incomes over $100,000. That is a debate we will have later.\n  I guarantee you this: There is not any way, there is not any way that \nwe will find that 90 percent of the tax breaks go to families under \n$100,000. That will not happen.\n  I will also say, the Joint Tax Committee has said the GOP plan \nincreases taxes on about 51 percent of the Americans, if you consider \nthe earned-income tax credit changes. So that is the other side of this \ndebate. We will have a long and tortured debate in the days ahead.\n  The Senator from Utah and Senator from Delaware, I think, are seeing \ntheir patience worn thin by this. But I did just want to respond to the \nproposition that the President's budget was not in balance. He is \ncorrect about that. But my point is, your budget is not in balance \neither. It is a fair piece out of balance.\n  I will not offer my second amendment. I should say to my friend, \nhowever, I am very tempted because my second-degree amendment would \njust ask us to vote on the same proposition we voted on last night \nexcept to say, ``Would you agree at least then to limit the earnings to \nthose below a half a million dollars? If you will not agree to $100,000 \nor $250,000, would you agree at least to limit the tax cut to those \nwhose income is under a half a million dollars? And I am sorely tempted \nto offer that as second-degree amendment, but I will not do that \nbecause I know the Senator intends to withdraw his amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. I know this is an important debate, and I do not want to \ninterject myself, but I want to move this bill.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, there were so many things that were said in \nthe exchange a few moments ago between the Senator from North Dakota \nand the Senator from Pennsylvania that I want to comment on that and I \nhardly know where to begin. But I cannot leave many of those statements \non the Record without some comment.\n  The Democratic National Committee continues to run a spot that says \nthis about the President's budget:\n\n       These are the values behind the President's balanced budget \n     plan, values Republicans ignore.\n\n  He continues to talk about the fact that he has a balanced budget. We \nall know that is not true.\n  With regard to Social Security, I should note, by the way, that the \nPresident's budget treats Social Security the same way that the budget \nwe are going to vote on later on this week treats that matter. The \nPresident does not have a balanced budget in 10 years, 9 years, or 8 \nyears, for that matter. Now the Senate has spoken I think more than \nonce, but also in the vote we just had, 96 to zero, repudiating the \nPresident's budget.\n  That having been done, I think it is time for us to really get \nserious about doing this job and balancing the budget. It is not easy. \nIt is never easy. But we have a historic opportunity this time to \nactually make the commitment to balance the budget in 7 years.\n  I thought some of the President's comments during the past week had \nbeen positive, and what he had to say about tax increases. He said, you \nknow, that he probably raised them too much. And he himself got around \nto saying yes, we can probably balance a budget in 7 years. Now there \nhas been a lot of give and take on that. But we are getting closer \ntogether I thought.\n  But my question here this afternoon is when is the President going to \nget serious about talking to the Congress and working with the Congress \nin getting this job done? Everybody says we are going to have to come \nto some accommodation. Everybody says we need a balanced budget. What I \nwant to know is when is that going to happen? I do not see any movement \nin that direction from the President, or from his representatives. It \nis just not occurring. The communication is just not occurring.\n  So the Congress has an obligation to go forward and fulfill the \ncommitment that we made in our budget resolution earlier this year. \nThat is what we are going to do in the next 2 or 2\\1/2\\ days. We are \ngoing to pass a reconciliation bill that keeps our commitments to a \nbalanced budget in 7 years, that does reform Medicare. And I want to \nemphasize on Medicare once again that our Medicare reforms would allow \nfor Medicare spending to increase 6 percent over that 7-year period, 6 \npercent each year which is double what inflation will allow. So we are \ngoing to have a significant increase every year over the previous year \nof what can be spent for Medicare. We are going to have genuine reform \nthat saves and preserves the program. We are going to have Medicaid \nreform, and we are going to have tax cuts.\n  I know that it is a very easy thing to do, I guess, here on the floor \nof the Senate--to attack the tax cut, as the Senator from North Dakota \ndid a while ago. But when you go down the list and start asking \nSenators which one of these tax cuts do you oppose, then their attitude \nchanges. Who among us does not want to get rid of the marriage penalty? \nFor 20 years--at least 10 years--I have been hearing that we need to \nget rid of this marriage penalty that penalizes people where they have \nto pay more taxes when they get married. Maybe that goes to upper \nincome, lower, or middle income. But the question is, is the marriage \npenalty wrong? The answer is that it absolutely is. We ought to \neliminate it.\n  On spousal IRA's, who among us wants to argue that a spouse working \nin a home should not be able to have an IRA like everybody else? That \nspouse is prohibited. That is what is in this bill. We want to \nencourage savings. IRA's, Individual Retirement Accounts, will do that.\n  Capital gains tax rate cuts will provide growth in the economy and \ncreate jobs.\n  Here is an interesting tidbit that is ignored around here. Even in \nspite of \n\n[[Page S 15554]]\nthis very small $245 billion tax cut, revenue to the Federal Government \nwill go up $3.3 trillion over the next 7 years. We are not exactly \nstarving the Federal Government for revenue. That is $3.3 trillion on \ntop of all the revenue that is already coming into the Federal \nGovernment.\n  So to allow some of the people that are working and paying the taxes \nto keep a little bit of their tax money for families with children, to \nbe able to get a little tax credit to help them pay for the needs of \ntheir children makes good sense to me.\n  With regard to the balanced budget and the so-called cuts, or the \ncontrolling of spending that we are doing in our budget resolution, I \npoint out once again that in spite of the controls on spending which we \ninclude, spending will still go up $2.6 trillion over the next 7 years; \nnot exactly putting the Federal Government on a diet when it still will \ngo up $2.6 trillion. The truth of the matter is we probably should be \ncutting spending a lot more, but we have an orderly, planned package. \nThis is a fair package, a balanced package in the cuts and controls in \nspending, and also in the tax cuts.\n  I continue to hear also some remarks that maybe we ought to let the \nTreasury decide what the tax numbers are, or the Joint Commission on \nTaxation. You know, I think it ought to be the Congressional Budget \nOffice, not the Office of Management and Budget. And the President said \non February 17, 1993, that the Congressional Budget Office was normally \nmore conservative, and what was going to happen was closer to right \nthan previous Presidents have been.\n  We should use the Congressional Budget Office. We should not use \nsmoke and mirrors this time in getting to a balanced budget. We should \nnot use rosy economic assumptions. We should not assume that medical \ninflation is coming down dramatically and use that to try to cover up \nwhat the truth is about the budget deficit numbers. We ought to go \nahead and face up to the tough votes on cutting and controlling \nspending.\n  Also, it is continued to be suggested that, well, maybe we should \nchange the Consumer Price Index.\n  Look, anything we do to change those numbers is just going to allow \nus to find a way to duck the tough choices of controlling spending and \nallowing the people who pay the taxes to keep a little of their revenue \nto look after their own families and make their own decisions.\n  I am glad we put the decision to rest. The President's budget did not \nreally exist in the first place. We just had a vote of 96 to nothing to \nsay we are not going to consider that. And so now let us move on to \ntomorrow and Thursday and taking up, considering a real budget \nresolution and reconciliation package that will provide a true balance \nover the next 7 years.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. I move the bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. What is the pending business, Mr. President?\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2946, as Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). There is no specific order to \nmoving the bill. The question is on the amendment of the Senator from \nPennsylvania, at this time. The Senator from Utah has the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, could I yield to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Kentucky?\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I would like to have the floor in my own \nright. I do not think the Senator from Pennsylvania has withdrawn his \namendment yet. There is a pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Right.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I withdraw my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill add the following new section:\n\n     SEC. 2. ADDITIONAL FEDERAL DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE WESTERN \n                   DISTRICT OF KENTUCKY.\n\n       (a) In General.--The President shall appoint, by and with \n     the advice and consent of the Senate, 1 additional district \n     judge for the western district of Kentucky.\n       (b) Eastern District.--The district judgeship for the \n     eastern and western districts of Kentucky (as in effect \n     before the date of the enactment of this Act) shall be a \n     district judgeship for the eastern district of Kentucky only, \n     and the incumbent of such judgeship shall hold his office \n     under section 133 of title 28, United States Code, as amended \n     by this section.\n       (c) Tables.--In order that the table contained in section \n     133 of title 28, United States Code, shall reflect the change \n     in the total number of permanent district judgeships \n     authorized under this section, such table is amended by \n     amending the item relating to Kentucky to read as follows:\n\n``Kentucky:\n    ``Eastern........................................................5 \n    ``Western......................................................5''.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an amendment to \ncorrect a longstanding problem in my State of Kentucky. There is an old \nexpression that goes, ``justice delayed is justice denied.'' Well many \nin Kentucky are being denied justice and if it were not for an \nextremely hardworking and dedicated judiciary, many more would feel the \nsame.\n  The situation is nothing short of critical. For several reasons \nKentucky is in a unique situation. It has what is known as a ``swing'' \njudgeship. That means a judge is shared between two districts. In this \ncase it is the eastern and western districts. Being largely a rural \nState, the communities that hold court are usually a long way from each \nother and the only means of travel is by car over bad roads that wind \nthrough the mountains.\n  This situation is far more troubling than many of my colleagues from \nother areas of the country may realize. Long trips by judges after \nhours or before court take up a significant amount of time--time a \njudge would normally spend hearing cases. In fact, without the \ndifficult travel requirements, I probably would not be troubling the \nSenate with this amendment. Unfortunately, I must--the problem is just \ntoo great.\n  Juries also travel great distances. This results in jurors who would \nrather deliberate late into the evening--sometimes into the early \nmorning--in order to avoid travel home and back for additional days of \ndeliberations. This poses still further hardships on the judges who are \nthen forced to stay up late and then travel to court in the next \njurisdiction the very next day.\n  Furthermore, new gun control legislation has dramatically affected \ncases in Kentucky. Many times a more routine drug bust or other arrest \nturns into a time consuming and difficult case because of the presence \nof the firearm. The practical effect of this has been a large increase \nin long cases that tie up the judges, keeping them from getting to \nother matters on their dockets. Civil cases in many instances have been \nheld to a stand still.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to speak in support of the \neffort by my senior colleague to relieve the burdensome situation \nwithin the Federal judiciary in Kentucky. I commend him for his \nleadership on this issue.\n  We have two districts in Kentucky's Federal court. And we have one \njudge who splits her time between the eastern and western districts. In \norder to fulfill her responsibilities, she often logs hundreds of miles \neach week. She has two principle offices and must attend administrative \nmeetings for both districts. This is an inefficient use of her time and \nrepresents valuable time away from managing her caseload. And, this \nsituation is no reflection on the current judge who occupies this \nposition. These are the identical circumstances that existed with the \nprior occupant of this position.\n  I realize it may not be feasible to create a single additional \nFederal judge at this particular time. I am aware of the complicated \nbalancing act that must \n\n[[Page S 15555]]\noccur any time the number of Federal judges is evaluated.\n  Nevertheless, I join with my senior colleague in drawing the Senate's \nattention to our particular circumstances in Kentucky. When the Senate \nJudiciary Committee considers additional Federal judges, I hope the \nmembers of the committee look at the swing judge in Kentucky. And, I \nurge the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts to examine this \nunique situation.\n  I thank Senator Ford for his leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I am not going to take any additional time \non this because I know the chairman of the Judiciary Committee is \nitching to get away from here, and I do not blame him. It was about 3 \nhours ago, I think. But what I have is a split judgeship, one in the \neastern part of Kentucky, one in the west. The youngest judge is \nassigned to the east and the west. So we have some going to the \nmountains and some going to the flatlands of west Kentucky, and this \none judge spends 5 and 6 hours on the road. If the jury is out until 2 \no'clock in the morning, then makes their judgment, comes in, the judge \nis back in the car and has to drive another 5 or 6 hours. It is \nabsolutely a horrendous situation.\n  Mine is not the only State. Missouri has split judges, Oklahoma has \nsplit judges. But we just have one. And when you traverse the State \nfrom Pikeville in the far east to Paducah in the far west, it is some \n600 miles. So it gets to be a tremendous burden.\n  What I am asking in this amendment is to allow Kentucky to have an \nadditional judge. That additional judge, then, would mean that we would \nhave a full-time judge in eastern Kentucky and not divided with the \nwest. We would also, then, have a full-time judge in the west. And we \nwould see that the court docket was reduced tremendously.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will yield, we understand the Senator's \nproblem and we are concerned about it. As of right now, there is a real \nquestion as to whether we can justify another judge in that State. But \nI am willing to talk with the Senator and try to work this out, if we \ncan, over the immediate future and see if there is some possible way we \ncan solve it. If there is not, we will be straight up with the Senator \nand let him know, but I am willing to try to see what we can do.\n  We would like to pass this bill because it is a temporary judgeship \nbill that, really, nobody has any objections to, and that literally \nwill solve a lot of very important problems for the courts. We would \nlike to do it without amendment if we can.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I understand what the distinguished Senator \nfrom Utah is saying. But, if I did not bring notice----\n  Mr. HATCH. I understand.\n  Mr. FORD. To this body and to the Judiciary Committee, through this \nmethod, which is the only one I have, then I think I would be remiss in \nrepresenting my State.\n  Mr. HATCH. We understand.\n  Mr. FORD. There is a lot more to dispensing justice than the number \nof cases. What we are doing now is, the youngest judge, a female judge, \nis on the road day and night. And that is justice delayed. She is \nabsolutely working her heart out, getting a driver, dictating, writing \nwhile she is on the road, trying to accommodate the lawyers in the \ncases and the courts in which she is assigned.\n  So it is fine for you to say you will work with me. The commission \nsent a report, in which it gave us an extra judge in Kentucky, which \nwould have solved our problem. I understand the commission withdrew \ntheir suggested increases. Now we are in limbo and I do not know where \nwe are.\n  I will not accept ``we will try sometime in the future, next year.'' \nI would like to try sooner than that, if I could. Because the judge is \nbeing overworked by travel, by court cases.\n  We have an excellent judiciary in Kentucky. They are working hard to \neliminate the burden of cases. But, under the circumstances, we are not \nable to do that and it is not the number of cases per judge that \ncreates the problem for us.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will yield, I do not think Kentucky could \nhave better advocates than the two Senators that currently represent \nKentucky. I understand the issue. All I can say is, in good faith, we \nwill try to work with the Senator and try to resolve it. But I would \nlike to not have to go to a vote on this amendment, because I would \nhave to oppose it under these circumstances and I would prefer not to \ndo that if we can somehow or other find our way clear to working out \nthis problem.\n  As far as I am concerned, the Senator is a leader in this body. I \nhave every desire to try to accommodate him if we can.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I will, in just a moment, withdraw it. It is \nnot very often I come before my colleagues and ask for something other \nthan what I think is----\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield before he withdraws?\n  Mr. FORD. I will be glad to.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Kentucky makes a \nvery valid point. I, for one, think there is justification for Kentucky \nhaving another judgeship.\n  Frankly, one of the things the Senator from Utah and I talked about \nearlier in the process--not today, but in the year--was this notion of \nwhether or not we need an additional judgeship bill, period, \nnationwide. And the answer is we do.\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes, we do.\n  Mr. BIDEN. So we do need additional judges, in my view.\n  I am not referencing any particular Senator when I say this. And I \nmean this literally: Not referencing any particular Senator. But we are \ngetting into the field, the time and space, where it is going to be \nhard to get judges moving through here at all.\n  As some will remember, when President Bush was in his last year, last \ndays in the Presidency, I, along with the Senator from Utah--we pushed \nthrough literally another 17 or 18 judges in the last 4 or 5 days of \nthe session. I hope that spirit exists here.\n  But in fairness, both President Bush and President Clinton suffered \nfrom the same problem. They took too darned long in getting a lot of \ntheir nominees up here for us. But we are where we are now. I cannot \nspeak and do not intend to speak for the Senator from Utah. I expect \nthat had things moved more quickly we may have been in a position to be \npushing the judgeship bill overall. My guess is that the political \nreality would be that we are not likely to get that done until the next \nelection settles, whether or not we will get it done.\n  That is a long way of saying I think on the merits the Senator from \nKentucky is correct about the need in Kentucky. I would add in addition \nto that that the Senators from several other States are in very \ndifficult shape. For example, in the southern district of Florida, they \ncould use a handful more judges just to get their docket up and running \nto be able to handle civil cases because they have so many criminal \ncases; in southern California, in Texas, in New York. So there are a \nlot of places we need extra judges.\n  I compliment the Senator from Kentucky for making the case for his \nState. The whole purpose of my speaking these 5 minutes or so is to \nmake the point for the Record. On the record, for the Record, the \nSenator from Kentucky has a case. I believe he is correct. I will tell \nhim I will do all I can immediately to try to get him an additional \njudge. But he knows the system as well as I do, and, quite frankly, \nbetter than anyone that I know. I would not want him to bet the \nmortgage on--he probably does not have a mortgage anymore--but I would \nnot want him to bet the farm or the house on us getting this done very \nquickly. But I support him, and I think he is substantively correct.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank my friend from Delaware, and I also thank my friend \nfrom Utah.\n  Mr. President, I am reluctant to do this but I understand where we \nare coming from. We will revisit this question, and if we do not vote, \nif I do not get it the first time, it may be the second time and it may \nbe the third time. I am going to be persistent.\n  So, therefore, Mr. President, I withdraw my amendment.\n  So, the amendment (No. 2946) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today the Senate will consider legislation \nto extend the temporary judgeships created \n\n[[Page S 15556]]\nby the 1990 Federal Judgeship Act from 5 years or more from the date of \nenactment of the act to 5 years or more from the confirmation date of \nthe judge named to fill the temporary judgeship created in that act.\n  Of the 13 temporary Federal judgeships created by the 1990 act, only \nMichigan will be exempt from today's extension. This is because the \nMichigan Western District judges do not want to preserve this seat \nbecause they don't believe it can be justified by their caseload. I ask \nunanimous consent to insert in the Record the attached Grand Rapids \nPress article on this subject.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Grand Rapids Press, Oct. 14, 1995]\n\n       In Strange Move, Judges Say They Don't Want New Colleague\n\n                          (By Arn Shackelford)\n\n       West Michigan federal judges have shocked members of the \n     area's Republican delegation by maintaining they don't need \n     any more judges.\n       The judges last month wrote to U.S. Sen. Spencer Abraham, \n     R-Michigan, requesting that the federal Western District of \n     Michigan be excluded from a bill that likely would bring \n     another federal jurist to the area.\n       ``We were surprised to hear they were saying no,'' said Lee \n     Liberman Otis, Abraham's chief judicial counsel. ``It's very \n     unusual for people in the federal government--or anywhere \n     else--to say, `We don't need extra people to help us with our \n     work.' ''\n       The bill, which is sponsored by U.S. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-\n     Utah, and likely will be passed this year, would extend the \n     Federal Judgeship Act of 1990. The act, under which U.S. \n     District Judge Gordon Quist was appointed, created \n     ``temporary'' judgeship for five years, or through December.\n       Quist's judgeship doesn't evaporate that month, but if one \n     of the district's five active judges takes senior status, \n     retires or dies before that time, that vacancy would not be \n     filled by a new judge.\n       Under the Hatch bill, the period during which another judge \n     could be appointed will be extended to five years from \n     whenever temporary judges were sworn in. That would be Aug. \n     28, 1997, in Quist's case.\n       ``But the judges in this district decided we did not need \n     to have the position renewed,'' said U.S. District Chief \n     Judge Richard A. Enslen. ``We think we can get along with \n     four judges and four magistrates.''\n       The federal Western District of Michigan--which includes \n     all counties in the western half of the state and the entire \n     Upper Peninsula--now has five active judges, four magistrates \n     and two senior judges.\n       The active judges, who carry a load of about 225 civil \n     cases and 50 criminal cases, include Robert Holmes Bell, \n     Enslen, Benjamin F. Gibson, David McKeague and Quist. The \n     magistrates, who handle most arraignments, misdemeanor cases \n     and motions are Hugh W. Brenneman Jr., Joseph G. Scoville, \n     both based in Grand Rapids; Doyle A. Rowland in Kalamazoo; \n     and Timothy P. Greeley in Marquette.\n       But the senior judges, Douglas W. Hillman and Wendell A. \n     Miles, also are hard at work in the district and handle at \n     least a quarter of the civil cases the others do.\n       Federal judges, who are paid $133,600 annually, can take \n     senior status when they reach 65 and have enough years of \n     service to total 80. Even though they continue on full salary \n     until they die, they can leave the bench as soon as they move \n     to the new status.\n       Neither Hillman nor Miles has chosen to do so. And Gibson, \n     who announced earlier this year that he will take senior \n     status next August, said that he, too, will continue to work \n     on cases in this district.\n       ``One of the reasons we're in good shape is because we do \n     have the two senior judges still working,'' Enslen said. \n     ``That's a good deal for taxpayers. The best bargain in \n     America is a (federal) judge who reaches retirement age and \n     doesn't walk away.''\n       As once was the case, lawsuits aren't piled up waiting to \n     be heard for long periods in this district, the judges say. \n     In addition to help from the senior judges, fewer cases are \n     being filed now than in the past, and the court also reduced \n     some of what was a backlog by implementing ``differential \n     case management.'' That process assigns lawsuits to different \n     time tracks, limits what attorneys may do, and moves cases \n     along quickly.\n       Still, if West Michigan isn't excluded from the Hatch bill, \n     a new judge could be appointed to fill the vacancy Gibson's \n     move to senior status will create. And if Enslen decided to \n     move to senior status before August 1997, the district would \n     be slated for two new judges.\n       Otis, who said West Michigan likely would be excluded from \n     the bill, said the district was the only one to make such a \n     request.\n       ``Most of the other areas are saying, `Yes; we want this \n     extended,' '' she said. ``This is very good of your judges. \n     They could use their extra time playing golf.''\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I am delighted to support S. 1328. I just \nwant to address one aspect of this legislation: why the bill does not \nextend the temporary district judgeship in western Michigan.\n  That judgeship is not being extended because the judges of the \nwestern district contacted the offices of members of the Judiciary \nCommittee, including mine, and requested that it not be extended. I \nwill admit that I was surprised to receive this request. It is, I \nbelieve, the only request I have received on behalf of any government \nentity to give it fewer resources. Indeed, I was so surprised I thought \nI should see if there was some hidden agenda behind it.\n  Remarkably enough, however, there proved to be none. Rather, the \njudges in the western district were simply saying the following:\n  ``We believe the government should be run for the benefit of the \ngoverned. We are volunteering to work longer hours and take fewer \nvacations with no gain to ourselves in order to live up to that \nobligation. We also appreciate the efforts of our senior judges, who in \nmany cases are continuing to carry very full dockets despite being \nunder no obligation to do so.''\n  ``For these reasons, we do not need this judgeship. Not filling it \nwill thereby save the taxpayers millions of dollars. To be sure, given \nthe size of the deficit, that will not make that much of a dent. But we \nbelieve it is our responsibility to do our part in reducing the size of \nthe government, and the burden it places on taxpaying American \ncitizens.''\n  While there is much talk of shared sacrifice, there are not very many \noffers to take on a greater share of it. I simply want to express my \nthanks, and the thanks of my fellow Michiganders, to the western \ndistrict judges, for making this unusual request, to which my \ncolleagues and I are glad to accede.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of S. 1328, a \nbill to amend the commencement dates of temporary judgeships that were \ncreated under section 203(c) of the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990.\n  This legislation created 13 temporary judgeships in districts \nthroughout the United States, one of which is in the northern district \nof Alabama, and the act provided that the first vacancy in the office \nof a district judge in those 13 districts occurring after December l, \nl995 would not be filled.\n  The reason this legislation is necessary is because delays occurred \nin the nominations and confirmations of the 13 judgeships created by \nthe 1990 act. Thus, many districts have had a relatively short time in \nwhich to utilize the services of these temporary judgeships. For \ninstance, in the northern district of Alabama, our new judge, the \nHonorable Sharon Lovelace Blackburn, was not confirmed until May 28, \nl991. She has served with remarkable distinction and is a very hard \nworking and dedicated U.S. district judge.\n  What is important to remember, as we seek to pass this legislation, \nis that the delays in filling these temporary judgeships frustrates the \nintent of Congress back in 1990 to reduce the backlog of cases pending \nin these 13 districts.\n  The bill before this body today provides that the first district \njudge vacancy occurring 5 or more years after the confirmation date of \nthe judge appointed to fill the temporary judgeship will not be filled. \nThus, each of these 13 districts, with the exception of the western \ndistrict of Michigan which requested to be excluded from coverage under \nthis bill, will benefit from an extra judge for a minimum of 5 years \nregardless of how long the judge's confirmation took. I urge my \ncolleagues' support for S. 1328.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as far as I am concerned the bill is ready \nfor a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill is before the Senate and open to \namendment. If there be no amendment to be proposed, the question is on \nthe engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading was read the \nthird time, and passed as follows:\n\n                                S. 1328\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. COMMENCEMENT DATE OF TEMPORARY JUDGESHIPS.\n\n       Section 203(c) of the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990 \n     (Public Law 101-650; 104 Stat. 5101; 28 U.S.C. 133 note) is \n     amended by striking out the last sentence and inserting in \n     lieu thereof ``The first vacancy in the office of district \n     judge in each of the judicial \n\n[[Page S 15557]]\n     districts named in this subsection, except the western district of \n     Michigan, occurring 5 years or more after the confirmation \n     date of the judge named to fill a temporary judgeship created \n     by this Act, shall not be filled. The first vacancy in the \n     office of district judge in the western district of Michigan, \n     occurring after December 1, 1995, shall not be filled.''.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \nbill was passed.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, I want to announce \nthat there will be no further votes tonight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/24/senate-section/article/S15538-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I hear all this talk about the budget every \nday and everybody says the same thing. We could probably just have a \ntape recording of what we said yesterday, and we get the same thing \nagain today.\n  Senators act like this is the first budget that has ever been brought \nbefore the House or the Senate submitted by a President that has been \nvoted on that did not get any votes.\n  The distinguished Senator from Mississippi talked about 96 to nothing \nor 99 to nothing. Remember Ronald Reagan's 425 to nothing in the House. \nI believe that is correct. I see him shaking his head. So there have \nbeen a lot of budgets that have been dead on arrival. Even the \nRepublicans have voted against a Republican President's budget. So this \nis not new. Senators act like this is the first time for it to ever \nhappen, this is the worst fellow that has ever been up there.\n  If turning budgets down makes a bad President, then we have had some \nRepublicans up there who had their budgets turned down, so they were \nnot very good Presidents that we are now bragging about.\n  One statement has been made here that we ought to quit this smoke and \nmirrors, and we ought to sit down and we ought to do it rather than \nbeating up on the President. You have responsibility; I have \nresponsibility; we all have responsibility to try to get it worked out. \nWe take CBO figures. We take CBO figures and we get letters from the \nDirector of CBO which state the Republican budget is not in balance by \n$105 billion.\n  We did not select that chairman. The majority selected that chairman. \nThat chairman sent us the letter, and we now have it, which says the \nbudget that is being proposed is $105 billion short.\n  So what I wish to do, Mr. President, is not stop the Pell grants for \nmy State. I do not want to reduce or eliminate the help for 55,000 \nhigher education students in my State. We are in a global market. We \nare in global competition. Education is the great equalizer. But oh, \nno, we are increasing, you hear from the other side, Pell grants by \n$100. That may be true, but you are eliminating--if you are not \neligible for $600, you are eliminated from the rolls. So in Kentucky we \nlose 6,000 Pell grants next year alone--next year alone.\n  So it just is a little bit disconcerting to me to hear all of these \nthings, and the public ought to be quite confused, quite confused \nbecause you get a CBO letter with a gold seal on it that says the \nbudget is balanced, and the next day you get one that says it is not--\nfrom the same office, signed by the same person as it relates to \nwhether Social Security is in the trust fund and loaned or it is in the \ngeneral fund. It cannot be both places. You can say what you want to \nand argue all day. I do not believe you can find a jury that would say \nin this particular case that it is both. You can borrow from it and \nspend it, but the assets are over in Social Security. It cannot be used \ntwice. And so we do not have it.\n  So the point I am trying to make here, Mr. President, is that we can \ntake care of Medicare without cutting it $270 billion; $89 billion is \nenough. We do not need to put the middle-income people in a problem, \nand the middle-income people, $35,000 to $70,000, is where I would say \nthey are as it relates to Medicaid and nursing homes because you are \ngoing to run out of money. That is going to fall on the shoulders of \nthe sons and daughters of the $35,000 to $70,000 income families at \nsome point when their parents are in a nursing home on Medicaid and the \nphone rings about the latter part of July, 1st of August saying, ``Come \nand get dad; come and get mom; we are out of money.''\n  And you change the rules in this bill on regulations on nursing \nhomes. You change the rules as they relate to regulations on nursing \nhomes. Let States do it. The reason the Federal Government is in the \nbusiness of regulating nursing homes is because the States had it. And \nthe statement has been made, OK, just sedate the elderly; you can \nhandle them easier; then you have fewer employees, you will need fewer \nemployees.\n  Well, that is just one giant indication that we are headed back to \nthe same place we were when we had to take over the regulation of the \nnursing homes.\n  One of the things that we see coming down the pike is hiding the sale \nof power marketing administrations in the House bill on page about 470-\nsomething where it is now the Secretary of Energy, Interior and Army \ncannot sell PMA's, but in the House bill you repeal those three and \nthen you instruct those three Secretaries to have a report on how to \nsell PMA's by the end of next year. And now you have put it in the \nappropriations bill, and those that are opposed to the sale of PMA's, \nyou better go look at the appropriations bill, Interior bill, and see \nwhat they have done there and refuse to sign the conference report \nuntil the PMA sale is in that appropriations bill.\n  I see the Senator looking at his watch. I will quit any time he wants \nme to.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I would have looked at my watch sooner.\n  Mr. FORD. I would not have quit sooner, though.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/24/senate-section/article/S15557-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15557-S15558]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FOUR CHANGES TO BE MADE\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. I want to talk a little bit about the business that we \nare approaching this week. It seems to me it is the most important \nopportunity that we have had in 25 years, and the Senator and the \nprevious speakers talked about the reasons why we cannot make these \nchanges and the reasons why this is wrong and the reasons why it has to \nbe some other way. The real test is that we have been talking that way \nfor 25 years, and the results speak for themselves.\n  We find all kinds of reasons why we cannot balance the budget. So \nwhat has the result been? A $5 trillion debt. It has resulted in the \ninterest on the debt being the largest single line item in the budget. \nBut we have been talking that same talk for 25 years: Cannot do it.\n  I wish to talk a little bit about why we should do it and why we have \nthe greatest opportunity we have had in a very long time to do the \nsame, to complete at least four things that I think most of us, \nparticularly most of us that are new here, apparently came here to do, \nand it is the first time there has been a chance to do that, and I wish \nto talk about the benefits of doing it.\n  They are four changes that need to be made and four changes that can \nbe made in the next couple of weeks, fundamental changes, not messing \naround the edges, not talking about change but never doing it. All of \nus have watched this Government for a long time. Most of us have \nwatched this Congress talk about it; we want change. The fact is, it \nhas not changed. The fact is, the debt has continued to grow. So we \nhave a chance to make some fundamental changes, to not only turn around \nthe arithmetic but to turn around the morality and the fiscal \nresponsibility of making this Government sound within. Maybe more \nimportantly than that, shaping the Government in the way that you would \nlike to \n\n[[Page S 15558]]\nsee it be shaped when we go into a new century, that you would like to \nsee it be shaped when you turn it over to your kids or your grandkids.\n  Do we want a Government that is $5 trillion, $6 trillion, $7 trillion \nin debt? I do not think so. Despite all of the rhetoric, despite all \nthe talk every year, the same thing has gone on, and I guess that is \nhow you really measure it--by results, not by talk, not by whether it \nis CBO or whether it is OMB, but what are the results. And the results \nare that the debt has gone up each year.\n  So we have a chance to make fundamental change, fundamental change in \nat least four areas. One of them is to balance the budget, a change you \nwould not think we would even need to make, a change to make income and \noutgo the same. Can you imagine that? That is the way it has to be with \nfamilies, the way it has to be with businesses. But we have not done \nthat. We have spent more than we have taken in, and we put it on the \ncredit card.\n  Someone asked recently in a letter to a column called Ask Marilyn, \nand they talked about the problem with a credit card.\n  Let me quote from it.\n\n       Let's suppose you have an income of $125,760 that comes not \n     from work but from the contributions of all your friends and \n     relatives who work. You're not satisfied with what $125,760 \n     can buy this year, so you prepare for yourself a budget of \n     $146,060 and charge the $20,300 difference to your credit \n     card, on which you're already carrying an unpaid balance of \n     $452,248--boosting that to $472,548, on which you pay \n     interest daily.\n\n  Multiply that little scenario by 10 million, and you have the \nnational budget.\n  The second thing we can do is strengthen and save Medicare. We can do \nthat. We can do that. Reform welfare, we can pass that here. We can \nreform welfare for the very first time. We can reduce the burden to \ntaxpayers.\n  Now, why is this the right thing to do? It is because that is what we \nsaid we would do when we came. That is what we told voters we would do \nwhen we came. That was in the contract for America. The President said \nhe was going to do those four things when he ran. But he did not do it. \nSo, that is what we need to do. These are key issues and these are \nattainable goals.\n  There is great opposition to change always, mostly from people who \nhave put the programs that are now in place in place, from people who \ntalk about the failure of the present program and use as an example \nwhat is wrong now and the reason why we cannot change based on programs \nthat are already in place and have been put in place by the folks that \nare opposing change. That is where we are.\n  So, we need to make changes if we expect some different results. But \nguess what? Folks want to continue to do the same thing and anticipate \nthat the results will be different. It will never happen.\n  What are good things to be gained? Of course, we balance the budget. \nWe will do something about that interest that is going on. The largest \nline item can go to something else, can be used for tax deductions, can \nbe used for many things, put more money into the private sector because \nit will not take it out of the private sector to fulfill this. It would \nchange the interest rates, reduce the interest rates. But maybe most of \nall it shows some responsibility in fiscal responsibility in terms of \nour future and the future of our kids.\n  Welfare: We need to change the pattern of welfare. Everybody believes \nwe ought to have welfare programs to help the people who need help, but \nthen to help them back in, help them back in to the private economy. We \nneed to move it to the States. The States are the laboratories that \ndevelop effective distribution systems.\n  Medicare: We all want Medicare to continue to serve the elderly. It \nwill not unless we make changes. There is no question that you have to \nmake a change; there is some question, I suppose, how you do it. But it \nwill go broke if we do not do something. We need to have choices. Why \nshould not the elderly have choices? We have been able to contain some, \nthe increased costs in health care costs--not in Medicare, not in \nMedicaid. It continues to go up at 10 percent. We can do that.\n  Tax reductions: We ought to leave more money into the pockets of \nfamilies. We ought to leave more money in businesses to be reinvested \nin jobs for the economy. We have a chance to do these things and a \nchance to do them in the next 2 or 3 weeks. Mr. President, I hope that \nmy associates will take that opportunity and cause that to happen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this week we will have an opportunity to \nsave our children's future. Time and time again there are individuals \nthat have come to the floor of the Senate to speak to this deliberative \nbody about the rights of the children. But the truth of the matter is, \nwe have been spending the inheritance of our children, not just their \ninheritance, but also we have been spending their yet unearned wages at \nan alarming rate. We need to begin consideration of a budget \nreconciliation bill which indeed will save our children from having \ntheir resources consumed in advance of their having earned them.\n  Our current national debt is $5 trillion. Children born this year \nwill have to pay interest of about $200,000 over their lifetime. That \nis just interest--not principal. When we think about the children, I \nthink we ought to think carefully about what we do to the children when \nwe displace the costs of our consumption to the next generation, to the \nchildren born and yet unborn. For decades now the Federal Government \nhas spent beyond its means and lived beyond its resources. It has done \nso at the expense of the next generation.\n  During the debate over the current plans to limit the size and growth \nin spending, I have been reminded of the philosopher's words, ``They \nsought to heal by incantations a cancer which requires the surgeon's \nknife.'' We cannot react to the countries' fiscal crisis by saying a \nfew rosy words. We cannot make a few incantations and heal the problem \nwe have in terms of the finances and resources of this country. We need \nto take the surgeon's knife.\n  It is important to note that the surgeon's knife is an instrument of \ntherapy, not an instrument of destruction. It is an instrument which \nwill provide for better health. I believe we will do that, and we will \nmake responsible--yes--difficult choices. We take the knife to the \ncancer and we take the knife where it is necessary to pare back the \nincrease that would otherwise happen too frequently, with the kind of \nwasteful increase we have had in the past.\n  We have to stop an ever-increasing spiral of debt, a spiral which is \na spiral of abuse against the next generation. In the past few months, \nwe have made some difficult choices surrounded by the familiar \nincantations of those still clinging to the discredited and \nirresponsible philosophy of spending without consequence or budgeting \nwithout accountability.\n  Mr. President, I believe in the purpose for which we were sent to \nWashington. The people were demanding and expecting that we would \nbalance the budget and they are expecting that we will end business as \nusual. They are expecting us to listen to them. We must continue. We \nhave made progress, but we must continue on this historic journey \ntoward meeting their demand--we represent them. We must fulfill their \nexpectation by passing a balanced budget reconciliation bill that puts \nus on a path to fiscal responsibility.\n  Now, there are those who came here in this session of the Congress \nwho decided that two rules have to be changed; therefore, we cannot \ncall the budget balanced. They say now, we must use different figures, \ndifferent procedures than we would have used in the past. I think it is \ntime for us to balance the budget according to the rules and to get \nthat behind us. There are other things we might do in the future to \nimprove our fiscal health.\n  Let us take this directive from the American people. Let us balance \nthe budget. We could put our heads in the sand rather than to face this \nNation's fiscal realities. We could produce a plan, I suppose, that \nwould allow minor changes. We could only tinker with the operations so \nthat we stave off the Medicare bankruptcy for several months or a \ncouple of years. We need \n\n[[Page S 15559]]\nto set our system on a sound footing for long-term growth and \ndevelopment. Congress could continue the ingrained habit of treating \ntaxpayers' funds as the key to the candy store. We could wait until the \nyear 2015 to address our problems like the national debt. In 2015, at \nthe rate of current spending, the Government would only be able to \nspend on four entitlement programs and interest on the national debt--\nthat would take the entirety of the budget.\n  Then there would be no money for defense for the country, no law \nenforcement, no food safety, no highways. It would all be just for the \nentitlements and interest. We cannot do that. We must act now. We must \nprotect the children. We must protect their opportunities.\n  We live in a global economy where productivity and competitiveness \nare the hallmarks. We will succeed, we will sink or swim based on \nwhether or not we are productive and competitive. We cannot swim with a \ndebt load on the back of each citizen in the next century so great that \nthey cannot compete in the world marketplace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/24/senate-section/article/S15558-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  Some people say, ``Well, instead of controlling spending, we could \nalways raise taxes.'' The largest tax increase in history was pushed \nthrough in 1993. Now the President says he raised taxes too much. I \nthink we all felt that he raised taxes too much.\n  I know we could find a lot of things that we want to do instead of \nbalance the budget--people did not send us here for that. They sent us \nhere to balance the budget, and it is time that we do it, because the \nGovernment sets a standard.\n  Over the last 30 years, tragically, we have been setting a standard \nof irresponsibility, a standard of undisciplined spending. We are like \nthe parents who never set a standard for their children. The children \nare witnessing this Government spend, spend, and spend without \naccountability. It is time that we meet the challenge of bringing \nresponsibility and accountability back to Government. It is time we \nstopped saying an incessant ``yes.'' It is time we have the tough \ncharacter to say ``no'' to protect the children--to take a responsible \npath.\n  During the 104th Congress we passed a budget resolution to balance \nthe budget in 7 years. We voted to phase out or consolidate numerous \noutdated programs, commissions, agencies, initiatives. We voted to \nreform the failed welfare system by giving the people the power to \neliminate poverty and hopelessness in their own backyards.\n  Mr. President, rather than trying to gain short-term political \nadvantage by shamelessly frightening elderly Americans with empty \nrhetoric and misinformation, we instead are moving to protect, \npreserve, and strengthen Medicare for the long haul. We are working to \nbring efficiencies, normally only found in the marketplace of late, \ninto the Medicare system to give people a sense of choice and, in doing \nso, yes, to restrain some of the growth--but still make it possible for \npeople to have good health care.\n  We all know that in the next 7 years of reform, the amount spent per \ncapita in the Medicare system under these reform plans goes from $4,800 \nper year to $6,700 per year, and that kind of an increase per capita is \na substantial one. It will allow us to attend to the current health \nneeds, without continuing to jeopardize the future of the fund.\n  Mr. President, we want to let the American people keep more of what \nthey earn. American families deserve it. American families have seen \ntheir tax burden grow from as little as 2 percent in 1950 to nearly 50 \npercent today. We want to give families the opportunity and \nresponsibility of spending their own money so they can help themselves \nrather than have the Government always taking their resources and \ndeploying it in a governmental scheme which seldom meets the need and \nfrequently undermines and erodes the values for which families stand.\n  It is important for families to decide what is in their best \ninterest, rather than having a governmental bureaucracy always deciding \nwhat is in their best interest.\n  When the families of American people express their belief that \nGovernment is out of control, as they did in last November's election, \nthey are correct. For too long this body has assembled to satisfy the \nappetites of narrow interests at the public's expense. The American \npeople are fed up with a Congress that spends the yet unearned wages of \nthe next generation.\n  The resounding mandate from the electorate is to dramatically reduce \nGovernment spending, to shrink the size of the Federal Government, to \nstop the Government from interfering with the ability of individuals to \nmake decisions for themselves, for their families, their property, and \ntheir lives.\n  That means that the attitude of ``Washington knows best'' must come \nto an end. It means that the Congress must exercise the same kind of \nfiscal responsibility and restraint in making its difficult decisions \nthat every family in this country has exercised when budgeting around \ntheir kitchen tables. We say that we will not buy the things that we \ncannot afford. We do not spend the money we do not have, and that is a \nvirtue that ought to be imposed upon the Government.\n  In conclusion, over the next couple of weeks, all Senators, both \nDemocrats and Republicans, will have the opportunity during the debate \non the budget reconciliation bill, and other measures, to send a \nmessage to the American people. Let us make it a message of \nresponsibility and integrity and accountability. Let us say that we \nhave heard them; that they have sent us here to do a job, not \nnecessarily an easy job, it is not a job that requires no courage, or a \njob that requires no judgment. They have sent us here to do a tough \njob, but it is a job, the toughness of which they face on a daily basis \nin their own lives and businesses.\n  Let us do that job. We have a duty to America and the next generation \nto tackle the tough decisions and not to hide our heads in the \npolitical sands. So let us come together to a point of reconciliation. \nLet us come to a point of decision on a bill that will set us on a \nsteady path, a responsible path of accountability, of integrity and \nresponsibility, a path of a balanced budget. It is within our grasp in \nthe next 2 days.

Mr. President, I rise to report to the entire U.S. \nSenate and, in fact, I am talking to my colleagues--hopefully, \neverybody is listening, probably not--about just how low, frankly, some \nare willing to stoop.\n  As we all know, we will soon see a gigantic budget bill with the \nimpossible name of ``reconciliation'' on the floor. Under the special \nrules, the Senate will have very little time to discuss, let alone try \nto alter, this mammoth Government bill. That is why I stand here today. \nI want to take the time to shine a piercing light on one of the \ndarkest, most hidden and most underhanded parts of the mammoth budget \nbill about to land on everybody's desk.\n  Using that familiar label of tax relief, the provision is an attempt \nto line the pockets of a select group of companies, some of which I \nshall name in a few moments, at the expense of something as critical as \nhealth benefits for the most vulnerable, the oldest, the weakest, and \nthe most deserving group \n\n[[Page S 15560]]\nof Americans you could find: Our coal miners, retired, old.\n  It is a provision based, in my judgment, upon greed. It is a \nprovision stuck quietly into the package--it is, in fact, the second to \nlast part of the finance package--in a back room before it surfaced in \nthe open just last week. It was stuck in by the majority leader.\n  It is a provision that has brought a shudder into the hearts and \nminds of 92,000 very old, sometimes very sick, retired miners, their \nwidows, and their orphans. Mr. President, almost 30,000 of them live in \nWest Virginia. Obviously, I would tend to care about that a lot. On the \nother hand, 8,000 live in Virginia; 6,500 in Ohio; 20,000 in \nPennsylvania; 12,000 in Kentucky; close to 2,000 in Indiana; and, in \nfact, they are in every State in this country, with the exception of \nHawaii, and also in the District of Columbia.\n  Mr. President, these are 92,000 people who were promised by employers \nfor decades--it was not an open question, it was a done deal--promised \nby their employers that they could count on health care when they made \ntheir last exit from the mines, when their lungs had sacrificed enough \nand they could not go on, they simply could not; when they had been \nunderground digging out the fuel that made this country the world's \nmost powerful economic engine, when they got too old, too sick or even \nlost a spouse or a parent to the dangerous work of, particularly \nunderground, coal mining, when they could hope for some rest finally in \ntheir retirement years, 92,000 of these people are still living across \nthis country and still have a right to believe in the principle that \npromises made should be promises kept.\n  Instead, with no hearings, with no visible authorship, no \nannouncement, a special favor for the companies--a small group of which \nwill get the majority of the benefits of this provision, and I will \nname them in a few moments--this special deal for these companies which \nwant to break their promises--was slipped into the reconciliation bill.\n  It is the most extraordinary and duplicitous act I can remember in \nthe 10 years I have been in the Senate.\n  A favor that gets these companies off the hook, a favor that risks \nthe collapse of the fund that ensures the promised health care benefits \nto the retirees in my State and in virtually every other State--\nliterally every other State but Hawaii--in America.\n  This provision is outrageous. It is shameful. It is another example \nof what we read about in the Wall Street Journal today. I assume and \nhope there will be more of this. It is an article on Members of the \nSenate who are getting special breaks, and it lists a bunch of Senators \nand the deals they cut for special friends or special interests--\nhowever you want to phrase it. It is not very elegant, however one \nphrases it.\n  Mr. President, even though average Americans did not get their say in \nwhat would happen to their Medicaid benefits or their student loans or \nto the tax credit that rewards working over welfare, a select group of \ncompanies with lobbyists wall to wall sure got their say in this \npackage.\n  A bill allegedly meant to balance the budget is tipping the scales of \nfairness and justice when it comes to health care for 92,000 very old \nretirees.\n  I strongly appeal to my Republican colleagues. I ask them to stop \nthis corporate payoff before more damage is done to people who have \ndone nothing in their life to deserve it.\n  It is obvious that the hope is to keep this cruel little provision \nunder wraps, stick it on page 166 of a Finance Committee document. Hide \nit in the bill about to come to the floor. Do not talk about it, do not \nacknowledge who is responsible for this giveaway to companies.\n  I am here to talk about it. I will not stop talking about it for as \nlong as it hangs around. I am not going to let the U.S. Senate become a \nbazaar again for greedy interests, and in particular in the case of \nretired old coal miners.\n  If one has not seen them, if one does not know them, one does not \nunderstand the emotion involved in this. They cannot hire lobbyists. \nThey cannot prevail in a fight like this, unless they have a majority \nof us on their side.\n  What exactly does the provision do? It hands over the money that is \nkeeping the miners' health trust fund solvent to a select group of \ncompanies that cannot bear keeping their promise to their own retirees \nto whom they promised health benefits, with whom there was an \nagreement. It is one more reminder that special interests count a whole \nlot more in this particular Congress--not the working people who toiled \nin the mine, miles underground in crawl spaces, crouched in the icy \nwater until their backs ached and their lungs spoiled, as they dug to \nprovide the power for our Nation's growth and prosperity.\n  Those workers--fathers, friends, brothers, and uncles--do not count \nwhen they are stacked up against the interests of big corporations who \nwant to wriggle out of any responsibility for their own retirees to \nwhom they have made this commitment of health benefits so long as they \nshall live.\n  I want to share just a little bit of history with the Senate. Almost \n50 years ago, Madam President, the President of the United States, \nHarry S. Truman--this is important, because it gives it context--ended \na national coal strike by seizing the coal mines. That action \nestablished an unprecedented relationship between the Federal \nGovernment, miners, and operators in the coal industry. In that 1946 \nstrike right after the Second World War, health care was a central \nissue. It is not hard to understand why. Pensions are important, health \ncare is everything--both for miners and for their families. Back then, \npeople died of mining illnesses and injuries in staggering numbers. \nThere were no safety precautions. That did not take place until we \npassed the 1969 Coal Safety Act. All to dig out coal for the rest of \nthe country to grow on and become what it is today which is, of course, \na great, incredible, America.\n  Since that 1946 strike, coal miners have traded--sacrificed--other \nbenefits like pensions to preserve the decent health care benefits \nwhich they depend on because illness and injury are so intertwined with \nthe nature of coal mining.\n  This leads up to the health program under attack in the \nreconciliation bill about to come to the floor. In the 1950's, a grand \ncompact involving the President and others was reached between labor \nand management in the coal industry--an extraordinary sort of event.\n  In return for health and pension security, it was decided, labor \nagreed to mechanize the coal mines, thereby throwing out of work within \na few years 400,000 people in the Appalachians. But in return for the \nmechanization was the promise of lifetime pensions and health benefits. \nIt was a good deal all around.\n  Much later on the health care promised to retirees faced jeopardy, \nand because of the impending crisis--this is much later on--I, as a \nMember of the Senate, worked night and day for months and months on end \nto find a way to shore up the health fund and extend its solvency.\n  I cared passionately about working this out. That led to the passage \nof the 1992 Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act, simply known as \nthe Coal Act.\n  Coal miners helped to create the might of modern industrial America. \nNobody would dispute that. They fueled our progress. In 1992, when we \npassed the Coal Act, unanimously, without a vote, and through \nbipartisan negotiations, in a solution which was suggested by President \nBush and his White House, and the law, of course, was signed by \nPresident Bush, we told those miners that their tremendous \ncontributions and sacrifices mattered, and the promises made to them \nwould be kept.\n  Action had to be taken. That became clear in the late 1980's. That is \nbecause the dwindling base of contributors resulting from bankruptcies \nand the failure of some companies to keep paying into the fund, just \nwalking away from their responsibilities, put the miners' health trust \nfund in jeopardy.\n  When a strike broke out in 1989, then-Secretary of Labor Elizabeth \nDole appointed a mediator to assist in a settlement. When the \nsettlement was reached, she announced the appointment of a commission \nto recommend a long-term solution to the health crisis in this fund. \nThat commission became known as the Dole Commission.\n  Secretary Dole explained that during negotiations of the settlement \nof this strike which involved at that time one \n\n[[Page S 15561]]\nsingle company, ``It became clear,'' she said in the unanimous report, \n``to all parties involved that the issue of health care benefits for \nretirees affects the entire industry.''\n  She went on to say, ``A comprehensive industrywide solution is \ndesperately needed.''\n  Secretary Dole's Coal Commission submitted its final report in \nNovember of 1990. The Commission observed that health benefits are an \nemotional subject in the coal industry, not only because coal miners \nhave been promised and guaranteed health care benefits for life, but \nalso because coal miners in their labor contracts have traded lower \npensions over the years for better health care benefits.\n  In fact, in the solution that we reached in 1992, the miners \ncontributed something like $210 million from their pension funds to the \nsolution to protect their health benefits.\n  Something else that the Coal Commission said:\n\n       Retired coal miners have legitimate expectations of health \n     care benefits for life. That was the promise they received \n     during their working lives. That is how they planned their \n     retirement years. That commitment should be honored.\n\n  Close quote, the Dole Commission.\n  The Dole commission also considered the fairest way to ensure that \nthe health fund did not collapse. The base upon which it was funded was \ngetting more narrow. Therefore, there had to be a broader solution. \nThey recommended that companies that employed miners--current \nsignatories, so to speak, and former signatories alike--share the costs \nof providing benefits to miners whose employers went out of business. \nAnd, in the words of the Dole commission, the best way to finance the \nhealth benefits promised miners was the ``imposition of a statutory \nobligation to contribute on current and past signatories, mechanisms to \nprevent future dumping of retiree health obligations.''\n  (Ms. SNOWE assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. It was hard. And at that time we ran up against, to \nbe quite honest, Madam President, President Bush's so-called ``read my \nlips'' problem. What the Dole commission was talking about was a tax on \ncoal companies. The President said, ``This is not acceptable.'' So he \ncame in with the solution that became the Coal Act, upon which \neverything is based today and which is being undermined in the \nreconciliation bill about to come before us.\n  Collective bargaining cannot work when companies are not around to \nbargain with because they are bankrupt, perhaps, or have walked away \nfrom their responsibilities, sometimes through legal loopholes which \ncreated dozens of conflicting court decisions. Moreover, the orphaned \nretirees whose last employers were gone faced the prospect that when \nthe collective bargaining agreement expired in 1993, no one would have \nbeen responsible for their health care. And that was the fact. The \nBituminous Coal Operators Association was going to just cease to exist, \nand there would be nobody to pay for any of the health benefits. \nWhereas this small group, 25 percent of the coal industry, was paying \nfor 100 percent of the retirees of all coal companies, and that \npatently was not fair.\n  So, the Miners Health Program, with the shrinking funding base and \nspiraling costs, made continuation of the old program unworkable, hence \nthe task Congress and the administration faced in 1992, when we did \npass, unanimously, the Coal Act. That was the best that we could do to \nassign responsibility for funding the health program, recognizing that \nthere was not then nor is there now any perfect solution.\n  So, in 1992, Congress met its national responsibility to protect \nminers' health benefits. I was proud to offer that legislation--again, \nthe Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act, or the Coal Act. It was \nattached to the Energy Policy Act of 1992. I worked on that legislation \nwith an outstanding group of Members whose invaluable contributions \nwere essential to securing passage of the act, my esteemed colleagues \nSenator Byrd, Senator Ford, and Senator Specter. Senator Wallop was \nabsolutely crucial. The Senator from Wyoming at that time was \nabsolutely crucial in the passage of that act, and others from the \nFinance Committee and the Energy Committee. The Coal Act would not have \nbecome law without their work and without strong bipartisan \ncooperation, which is what has me so perplexed now.\n  We did our work, and miners' benefits were saved and that makes me \nproud. Now those miners, today, on average are 73 years old. Most \nworked in the mines for 20, 30, or 40 years or more. People have no \nidea what that means unless they have been around coal mining. Every \nday they rode a rail car a mile underground, stooped in crawl spaces 4-\nfeet high with ice water up to their knees, and made their mines \nproductive and made their employers rich, for the most part. For them, \nthe legacy of that work is black lung.\n  People say they can get by on black lung. Black lung is a totally \ndifferent subject, and only about 4 percent of miners are granted black \nlung, even though I firmly believe that anybody who has been in the \nmines for 8, 9, or 10 years, by definition has black lung. They have \nblack lung, asthma, cancer, back pain, chronic respiratory disease. \nTheir health benefits remain a matter of life and death to them, Madam \nPresident. The most serious of subjects in the most dangerous \nprofession. And now, in this new amazing Congress, a sneak attack has \nbeen made on the health care security that was finally restored in 1992 \nfor miners and their widows and orphans. And, Madam President, it is \nnot a secret attack any longer.\n  The companies that would profit, which would get 60 percent of the \nbenefit of all of this, have been hiding behind little coal companies \nso as to make it look like little coal companies were going to take all \nthe hurt. The ones who are going to get 60 percent or more of the \nbenefits of the finance provision are Allied Signal, North American \nCoal, LTV, Pittston, A.T. Massey, and Berwind Coal Co. Those six have \nmanipulated, through dozens, scores of lawyers, to the point where they \ncould put into the reconciliation bill something that will yield them a \n$33 million windfall.\n  The provision in this bill is a gift for these big companies looking \nfor a way to walk away from their promise made to these miners nearly \n50 years ago. These companies have spent millions to unravel the Coal \nAct, to renege on their promises. So far they have not succeeded in \nrobbing miners of a single day of health coverage, but they have not \nstopped trying. I thought this was all put to bed, it was all history. \nAs I said, people did not want to do it in the Finance Committee. I do \nnot think any Republican members in the Finance Committee really wanted \nto do it. It was just put in there. I think it was put in there by the \nmajority leader, and their patrons slipped just what they were asking \nfor in the reconciliation bill approved by the Finance Committee and \nnow part of the package about to come to the floor.\n  The day after the Finance Committee reported out their handiwork that \ndemolishes the health security of over 92,000 miners and their widows \nfor the sake of a few of the biggest and most profitable companies in \nthis country--I will not give you their profit levels, but they are \nextraordinary--I went back to West Virginia. I would say to my esteemed \ncolleague from Minnesota, I am almost finished. I went back to tell \nminers and their wives what happened.\n  The miners I met with were tight-lipped. This was this past weekend. \nThey were tight-lipped, as miners tend to be under all circumstances, \nespecially older miners who have seen it all--strikes, cave-ins, \nshutdowns, layoffs. They have learned to accept a lot in life.\n  I remember, once I had a friend who fought in the Second World War in \nthe Battle of the Bulge. He and I served in the Peace Corps together \nand I tried to get him to talk about it. He would not talk about it. He \nwould not talk about it. Miners tend to be like that.\n  They have seen their coworkers killed, mangled, dismembered. They \nhave lost limbs, they have lost their breath, but they have kept their \nfaith and they have kept their health care benefits, but they do not \nhave a lot to pass on to their families.\n  Until the Senate Finance Committee action, you know, then they had \ntheir health cards and knew their health \n\n[[Page S 15562]]\nbenefits were going to be safe and secure. I had to tell them about a \ndocument that appeared on Monday, that was debated by the Finance \nCommittee on a Wednesday, that was approved by its Republican members \non Thursday, full of tax breaks for every conceivable special interest. \nBut on page 165 and 166--those are the pages I care about--the very end \nof the package containing the Cracker Jack prize for all of the \ncompanies that want to renege on their promise to their retirees.\n  One miner, who worked for decades in the mines, told me starkly, he \nsaid, ``I am worried to death.'' He said, ``Now it seems like the \ncompany is the one running the whole show.''\n  He is right.\n  ``They want to do away with us when we were the ones who worked and \nbuilt everything else.''\n  He is right.\n  Bude Jarvis, one of the miners, asked me, ``What's going to happen to \nme if I lose my benefits?'' And he answered his own question, ``They'll \nprobably just put me in the grave before my time.''\n  Another miner, worried about his diabetic wife--diabetes is common--\nhe said, ``If I had to buy her medicine, I don't know what would \nhappen. I could not afford to.''\n  Today retired miners' health benefits pay for prescription drugs. \nThat is one of the beauties. They are on Medicare but Medicare does not \npay for any of that stuff.\n  These are people who will have taken a dozen different kinds of pills \nby lunch because of their ailments. So when it comes right down to it, \nthis provision is about one thing. Old coal miners and their widows \nbeing ground up in the legislative process like hamburger while the \nlobbyists cut them up.\n  All the jockeying, the lobbying, the lawyering, and the loophole \nmaking behind this provision, who pays, who does not, who profits, by \nhow much--it is so much legal mumbo jumbo to a retired miner. He does \nnot get into those things, nor does his widow.\n  When a retired coal miner who has worked for half a century \nunderground in the most dangerous profession in the world by far--by \nfar, Madam President--cannot count on the health care that he was \npromised decades ago by this Federal Government, and by the companies \nthat richly profited from his labors, then we have made the word of \nthis body worthless--worthless--and will have made contracts worthless. \nIf the Senate and society do not say that the contract that guaranteed \nminers--guaranteed miners and their widows--benefits is worth keeping, \nthen how can we trust any contract? A contract is not anything to an \naverage American if he needs a bevy of lawyers to make it count. That \nis supposed to be a problem in countries which are struggling to work \ntheir way out of dictatorships and Communist economies. A contract is \nnot worth anything if it is only good until some special interest with \npolitical connections can take away what you were promised while \nelected representatives, including perhaps your own, turn their backs.\n  Promises made should be promises kept, whether you are a coal miner, \nor a teacher, or a computer technician, or a nurse, or a politician, or \na plumber. Promises made should be promises kept.\n  The Senate still has a chance to reject this giveaway to select \ncompanies trying to profit at the expense of 92,000 retirees, widows, \nand their orphans. They are dying at the rate of 6,000 a year. Ninety-\ntwo thousand are dying. When we passed the bill, there were 120,000. \nNow it is 92,000. They are dying.\n  We know the budget reconciliation bill will pass with virtually every \nRepublican vote. I hope I am wrong on that. We know that the process is \nstacked so that the bill cannot be filibustered. But my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle can stand up for the people in their own \nStates and the principle of keeping promises.\n  And I close with this. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nwho heard the call of Secretary Dole's Coal Commission for a fair \nsolution and helped me pass the bill to rescue the health fund can heed \nthat call once more. To anyone who says America's crisis is about \nvalues, this is the chance to turn those words into deeds. This \nprovision that mocks the basic value of keeping promises and attacks \nthe health care of 92,000 retirees should go, Madam President. It \nshould go. And, if it does not, those of us on the other side, in West \nVirginia and across the country, will not give up. We will not, and we \ncannot, as I am sure the Presiding Officer understands, be still.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer. I thank my distinguished colleague \nfrom Minnesota who must think that I took considerable advantage.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much, Madam President.\n  Madam President, we are beginning a truly historic week. With a vote \napproaching on budget reconciliation, Congress is ready to set this \nNation on course toward a balanced budget. We are also ready to offer \nworking-class Americans relief from a Federal tax burden that is \ncrushing them and their families.\n  The legislation we will approve this week is nothing short of \nrevolutionary. The desperate attempts of my colleagues across the aisle \nto discredit the revolution are nothing short of pitiful.\n  For several weeks now, we have had to listen to baseless statements \nmade on the floor of this Senate about the budget reconciliation \npackage, the kind of statements that in Minnesota we call fish stories.\n  Now, I hate to waste a lot of time in answering such ridiculous \ncharges, but in Washington, things that get repeated three times \nsomehow become fact, especially in the minds of the liberal press, who \nwill carry these charges as fact.\n  My colleague, the junior Senator from California, was on the floor \nlast Friday, getting in the last words before the weekend, and claimed \nSpeaker Gingrich had made a deal with people making over $350,000 a \nyear to give them a huge tax break but they had to settle for $5,500 \nback instead.\n  The good Senator should first of all be held accountable for making \nsuch a ridiculous, baseless charge.\n  ``Where's the beef?'' Where is the proof to back up such outlandish \naccusations?\n  What she failed to say is that the Republican tax relief plan has \nbeen scored with nearly 75 percent of our $245 billion in tax cuts \ngoing to working-class families with incomes under $75,000.\n  So why would she pick out the figure of 350,000? The answer is class \nwarfare. It is an old trick our opponents have perfected in 1995: if \nyou are not right, try divide and conquer. Scare people into believing \nthings that are not true, or at best half-truths.\n  The good Senator from California also spoke about Medicare and \ntrustees' report warning the Medicare Program would be bankrupt by \n2002.\n  She was right when she said nearly every year, the Medicare trustees \nissue a report naming a date when the system faces default.\n  But again, she failed to mention that this year, the trustees urged \nCongress to act quickly to save the system and stave off bankruptcy--to \nlessen the impact it will have on the hard-working families who pay the \ntaxes to support it. And besides, that is no excuse to do nothing.\n  My colleague said the Medicare system has been faced with the same \nproblem many times, that Democrats have made some tough decisions, but \nhave extended the life of Medicare each time.\n  But again, she did not tell the American people that the seven times \nthe Democrats faced those ``tough'' questions, their answer was to \nraise taxes on working Americans.\n  Seven times they raised taxes in the last 30 years to keep the \nprogram going. Doubling, tripling, quadrupling your withholding taxes * \n* * and then doubling it again and again. Rather than finding a way to \nsave Medicare, improve it, and hold down the costs, they would advocate \na tax increase.\n  That new tax, of course, would have to amount to $388 billion over \nthe next 7 years, $388 billion in new payroll taxes--to feed this huge \nGovernment machine * * * a machine we cannot control now * * * a \nbureaucracy that is so out of control there is no efficiency, only \nbillions in waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  But hey, it is only the taxpayers' money, not mine. Put it on the \ntaxpayers' credit card, they say.\n  Funny, the Democrats never seem to have a problem in raising taxes, \ntaking money from you and me * * * but ask \n\n[[Page S 15563]]\nthem to support a tax cut, and they will rush to the floor in a flood \nof protest. They just cannot stand the pain of not being able to give \naway more of your dollars. They want to raise your taxes so they can be \ncompassionate and give it away.\n  But Mr. President, that is not compassion. That behavior is greedy \nand power grabbing.\n  For over 40 years, the Democrats have been inviting people to dinner, \nand using the American taxpayer as the credit card to pay for it.\n  I also heard the Democrats say they have the resolve to balance the \nbudget, but would do it in a ``more reasonable'' way, with ``more \ncompassion.''\n  The last 40 years, however, tell us how they would do it: Raise \ntaxes, give away more money, raise taxes, give away more money.\n  Again, watch out for that word ``compassion''--it means they want \nmore of your hard-earned dollars so they can spend it.\n  The President says he has the resolve to balance the budget, but he \ndoes not have a balanced budget to offer.\n  The outlines he has put on the table have never come close to \nbalancing the budget. They leave $200 billion-a-year-plus deficits as \nfar as the eye can see.\n  And what about the so-called balanced budget plan the senior Senator \nfrom North Dakota has proposed, the one my Democrat colleagues say is \nthe answer.\n  Again, their answer is always more taxes, and my colleague's budget \nis no different.\n  I have a chart here just to compare 1993, 1994, and 1995--the \nDemocrat budget and answer, and the Republican budget and answer. You \ncan see in each year--1993, a $251 billion tax increase by President \nClinton, the largest in history; Democrats in 1994 continue more taxes; \nin 1995, under the plan of the Senator from North Dakota, he would want \nto raise taxes another $228 billion rather than giving back $245 \nbillion in tax cuts.\n  His budget would supposedly balance without inflicting pain on \nmillions of Americans, unless, of course, you include those who get up \nand go to work every day, the taxpayers of this country. There \napparently is no pain in working longer hours to pay more in taxes.\n  The budget offered by the Senator from North Dakota would pick your \npockets to the tune of over $500 billion-plus, in additional taxes over \nthe next 7 years. Imagine, rather than supporting a tax cut of $245 \nbillion, their plan would be to raise another $228 billion from \nAmerican taxpayers.\n  If the growth of the Federal budget is not reduced and spending \ncontinues to increase, you need more dollars to feed the spending fire, \nand that is where you, the taxpayers, come in again.\n  The Republicans have a plan that will balance the budget--eliminate \nthe deficit--by the year 2002.\n  Now, they say our plan will cost students more to go to school, cost \nfamilies more for everything from food to clothing to shelter, the \nelderly will pay more for Medicare, nursing homes, et cetera.\n  But let me ask you a simple question: if we cannot afford it as \nindividuals, as families, as a society, how can we afford for the \nGovernment to do it for us?\n  The money has to come from somewhere.\n  The Government creates no wealth--it only reallocates it, \nredistributes it. If we do not have the money to pay the bills that \nneed to be paid, how can we afford the taxes Washington wants in order \nto do it for us--to be compassionate?\n  The Senate Democrats do not hold a monopoly on compassion. Liberal or \nconservative, Republican or Democrat, I think most of us came to this \nChamber out of deep compassion for our fellow Americans.\n  We want nothing more than for every American to have the opportunity \nto be successful, no matter what that means to each individual. As \nEdward Deming, the Father of the Japanese industrial revolution would \nsay. We need a ``Win-win'' solution. We do not want losers in society, \nor those left out. We want winners. We are all better off with more \nwinners.\n  But somehow, according to the senior Senator from California, if you \nmake $350,000 a year, you do not deserve it, because you have somehow \ngotten it illegally or unfairly.\n  Or if nothing else, it is just not right that you have it.\n  And if you do, the Government should step in and take it away--\nwhatever amount it deems ``fair''--and give it to those the Government \nthinks deserve it.\n  There are individuals in this country that need our help and we are \nspending nearly $1.6 trillion this year to try and meet those needs the \nbest we can, without destroying the very fabric of our society--our \nfamilies and our job creators--to do it.\n  But the rhetoric that spending is being reduced so the money can be \nfunneled into huge tax cuts for the wealthy is a sham.\n  The whole argument is being presented in this manner to drive your \nattention from the facts to the fiction, the shell game, the con man, \nthe snake oil salesman, the Democratic opposition.\n  President Clinton himself is guilty of this budgetary double-speak.\n  The President raised taxes in 1993 by $251 billion.\n  Of course, we all know that last week, he told a crowd of fat cat \ncontributors at a $1,000 a plate fundraiser he knew they were mad and \nhe admitted he raised taxes too much, but said it was the Republicans' \nfault because they would not help him stop the Democrats from spending \nmore money.\n  He had to raise taxes, he said. But the next day, back in Washington, \nhe blamed that statement on being tired, reiterating his point that \n``no Democrat in his right mind would ever propose cutting taxes, or \nsaying they had raised them enough.''\n  They do not want the taxpayers to keep more of their own money. They \ndo not trust you to spend it wisely.\n  Who knows, you might ``waste it'' on food, clothing, shelter, a \nvacation, or by saving it for your child's education.\n  ``Send it to Washington and we'll be compassionate with your hard-\nearned money,'' they say. ``Let us take care of you.''\n  The kind of care offered by the Democrats is suffocating the American \npeople.\n  To stop the suffocation, we are ready to cut their taxes, and I need \nto remind my colleagues across the aisle that tax relief is not \ndessert.\n  Congress has been eating the taxpayers' dessert for the past 40 \nyears. And the American people have been left only gruel to eat.\n  Finally, when the opponents of change resort to class warfare, when \nthey resort to statements like, ``champagne bottles are being chilled \nin penthouses all across the country--except in those where someone has \na conscience,'' well, that is nothing but the desperate cry of a dying \nliberal agenda.\n  I cannot afford champagne, but that is OK because I do not like it \nanyway. When I get back to Minnesota this weekend, I am going to put \nsome beer in the cooler.\n  And like millions of Americans across this country, we are going to \ncelebrate a small victory over this powerful Government machine, \nbecause the people know they will be able to keep $245 billion of their \nown money, to spend the way they want, rather than giving it to those \nwho claim to be compassionate.\n  And we are going to say this is only the first in a long line of \nvictories to come.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 10 minutes' time has expired.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, what is the legislative status at this \npoint?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Statements are limited to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to proceed for \nsuch time as I might consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any objection? The Chair hears none, \nand it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/24/senate-section/article/S15559-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15563-S15568]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FOLLOWING THE BUDGET DEBATE\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I listened with interest to the comments \nof my friend from Minnesota, and I guess in a way as I listened to him \nI sort of felt sorry for Americans who try to follow this debate. It is \ngoing to be difficult because the rhetoric flies fast \n\n[[Page S 15564]]\nand furiously, and a lot of people evidently are going to have \ndifficulty trying to figure out what is really true and what is not \ntrue.\n  The Senator from Minnesota talked about the amount of taxes that were \nraised in 1993 and what a terrible thing it is the Democrats have \nperpetrated on the country. But the truth is--the truth, which often \ngets hidden in these debates--yes, taxes were raised in 1993, but only \non 1 percent, the upper 1 percent of Americans, and that for 98 or 99 \npercent of most Americans taxes went down. The burden of the average \nworking person went down in the United States.\n  So when our Republican friends come to the floor and start lamenting \nthe 1993 bill that gave this country a continued economic growth--I \nmight add 7.5 million jobs added to the economy of this country in the \nlast 3 or 3\\1/2\\ years compared with about 2.5 million during the \nentire 4 years of the Bush administration--that 1993 bill raised taxes \nonly on the very wealthiest 1 percent of Americans, and yet our friends \nkeep coming to the floor in defense of that 1 percent. And that is \nreally what divides our parties at this point in time.\n  Certainly, we are not divided by a desire to have a balanced budget \nbecause the vast majority of Democrats voted for a balanced budget this \nyear. I voted for a balanced budget that will take place in 7 years. We \ndid cut Medicare. We did cut Medicaid. But we did not turn around when \nthe country has an extraordinary deficit problem and give back to \npeople individually what amounts to a very small amount of money. I \nbelieve it is something like $1.69 a week that most people in America \nwill get with this famous $500 tax credit that everybody is going to \nget, which incidentally does not go to everybody. The truth is that \nwhile our Republican friends talk about a $500 tax credit for every \nfamily in America, not every family in America will get that $500 \ncredit because it is only a credit against income tax. The biggest tax \nthat most Americans pay is the payroll tax. And for workers at the low \nend of the income scale, they are not going to get the benefit of that \n$500 income credit because it does not show up in their income tax. So \nit does not go to every family in America--another one of the \ndeceptions in the rhetoric that people hear.\n  We have heard a lot about how we are going to put taxes back in the \npockets of Americans, but the CBO itself, which we keep hearing quoted \nby our Republican friends, will tell you that the Republican plan \nraises taxes on 49.5 percent of Americans. If you are earning $30,000 \nor less, you have a tax increase in the Republican reconciliation bill. \nFor 17 million American families, a tax increase, an average tax \nincrease of $352; for about 7 million families, if you have a family of \ntwo, it is about a $400 increase; for 4 million some families with one \nchild it is again about a $410 increase, and for a family with no \nchildren, it is about a $300 increase. That is just the reality, a tax \nincrease for $30,000 and less; a tax break for $350,000 and of over \n$5,600 a year.\n\n  Now, the last time I looked, I really did not think that somebody \nearning over $350,000 a year really needed that $5,000 tax break this \nnext year if it is at the expense of somebody earning $30,000 or less.\n  Now, somehow in this country a fundamental notion of fairness has \nbeen distorted, and somehow, unfortunately, not enough Americans get \nthe facts or the truth of what is happening. Mr. President, today I \nstood up with Senator John McCain of Arizona, Senator Fred Thompson of \nTennessee, Senator Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, and we offered some $60 \nbillion of cuts that could be made in the budget that are based on \nfairness and common sense.\n  One of them, for example, is this now infamous program called the \nMarket Promotion Program. Now, we had a vote on that, and we lost. It \ndoes not mean we should not offer it and offer it and offer it until we \nfinally win, as we did on the wool and mohair subsidy; as we finally \nwon on the ALMR, the advanced liquid metal reactor; as we finally won \non the supercollider, which the Senator from Arkansas and others fought \nso long to get rid of; as we finally won on the mink subsidy.\n  Sometimes it takes time for people to understand the full measure of \ncommon sense the American people are asking us to exercise. But the \nfact is, the Market Promotion Program--how do you turn to the average \nAmerican and say, ``We're going to ask you to pay more in your premiums \nin Medicare, we're going to cut working families off of Medicaid, we're \ngoing to cut school lunches and take away science research that \nproduces more jobs for the future, but we're going to continue to let \nthe Gallo Wine Co. get a subsidy from the Federal Government to sell \nits wine abroad, we're going to continue to let Japanese-made \nunderwear, that happens to be made with American cotton, be advertised \nabroad, we're going to continue to allow major companies like McDonalds \nto be able to sell their products even though they make money''? They \nall make money. We are going to tell a senior citizen on a fixed \nincome, ``You pay more, but we're going to help these companies that \nare making millions of dollars to sell their products.'' It does not \nmake sense.\n  I am not saying that in an ideal world I would not love to help our \ncompanies sell abroad, but we are living in a very tough world now \nwhere the average family in America, on a daily basis, is being asked \nto make tough decisions. ``Can I buy clothing for my family? Can I \nafford to take a vacation? Can I send my kid to even the parochial \nschool where there may be a $4,000 or $5,000 tuition, let alone to a \nprivate school''?\n  There is not a parent in America who does not feel the implosion of \nthe school system around them, who is struggling to get their kid the \nbest education possible. And these folks know that on a daily basis \nthey are making decisions that are based on what they can afford and \nwhat they must get for their survival and for their kids' future.\n  We ought to be making the same decisions here in Washington. What do \nwe need? What must we provide for the American people? Must we provide \na market promotion program when we are cutting people from a hot lunch \nthat might be the only meal they get a day that is hot? Must we provide \nthe Gallo Co. with an additional subsidy to sell wine at a time when we \nare asking senior citizens on a fixed income to tighten their belt and \npick up more of the cost of absolutely predictable medical costs or in \na time when we are telling certain people that they have to sell their \nhome and go into poverty in order to qualify for the health care that \nthey may need? It just does not make sense.\n  You know, we woke up this morning to the umpteenth statistic of \nviolence in the city of Washington. A young diplomat's son, sitting on \nthe doorsteps of his home on Massachusetts Avenue, blown away, dead. \nThat is an act of repetition that occurs in this city every day. And it \noccurs in New York, in Boston, Los Angeles, Detroit, Miami, you name \nthe city. And it does not have to be a big city. All over this country \ntoday the acts of random violence are increased. And where are the \npolice? Where are the police? That is something we must do in America, \nis put more police on the streets.\n  But instead we are going to build B-2 bombers. Even though the \nPentagon does not want the B-2 bombers, even though the Pentagon never \nsubmitted a request for the B-2 bombers, even though Boris Yeltsin and \nPresident Clinton are meeting, talking about the cooperation of former \nSoviet troops now Russian troops in Bosnia. We are building B-2 \nbombers. For what threat? For what reason? The military did not even \nask for an additional $6 or $7 billion. But this budget provides it, \nand provides it even while they are asking all these folks below \n$30,000 and all these other folks to tighten their belt.\n  Mr. President, it does not make sense. And in the next hours, as we \ndebate this, and in next days as Americans come to confront the \nrealities of this budget, America is going to understand it does not \nmake sense.\n  Now, I keep hearing my colleagues say, ``Well, what do you guys want \nto do? You just want to continue the deficit? You just want to spend \nmore money? You just want to build up the debt of this country?'' The \nanswer is no. We voted this year for a balanced budget in 7 years, but \nwe did not do it at the expense of asking education costs to rise, we \ndid not do it at the expense of trying to make life miserable for those \nfor whom it is already hard enough to find a job and break out of \npoverty. We did it by fairly deciding \n\n[[Page S 15565]]\nthat you should not give this enormous tax cut to those who least need \nit at a time when you are complaining about a deficit and the debt of \nthis Nation.\n  The Wall Street Journal the other day had an article that showed that \neven under CBO's own analysis, this ``reconciliation package,'' as it \nis known, will add to the debt of this country over the next 7 years, \nadd to the debt service of the country, and that it will, indeed, raise \ntaxes on people.\n  Jack Kemp came before the Small Business Committee just last week, \nand he said, ``I hope you guys''--referring to those in the committee--\n``will not cut the earned-income tax credit, because if you do, that is \na tax increase.''\n  Ronald Reagan called the earned-income tax credit the greatest \nantipoverty program, profamily program in this country. What is \nhappening in the next hours is that $43 billion will be cut from the \nearned-income tax credit which will make it harder for people at the \nlow end of the income scale to do what so many people on the other side \nof the aisle talk about, going to work, making work pay, living out the \nvalues of work, and being able to break out of poverty.\n  Here we are taking this extraordinary program that Republicans and \nDemocrats together voted to support in the past years, and cutting it. \nMr. President, in the next few hours, in the next 2 days of debate and \n1 day of just rapid-fire voting, because of the situation the Senate \nfinds itself in, we are going to be debating on what I call the \nantivision, the counter reform 1995 reconciliation act.\n  I know one thing in the midst of this debate, Mr. President. The \nAmerican people want to put this country back on track. They want, and \nthey deserve, a balanced budget. They want, and they deserve, a \nreduction in the deficit. But they also want us to exercise common \nsense in a way that is fair and that talks and thinks about the future \nof this country.\n  What began in January of 1995 as an effort to work on a bipartisan \nbasis to achieve change, Mr. President, has regrettably turned into a \nvery partisan war of rhetoric and, I think, even some deception. Why do \nI say ``deception?'' Because under the guise of saving the Medicare \nProgram, we have colleagues who have basically misled the public by \ncalling for a massive change to Medicare that will increase the out-of-\npocket costs to seniors. It will result in hundreds of thousands of \nhealth care jobs lost. And it will also change the fundamental \nrelationship of seniors to their health care delivery system, while at \nthe same time telling them they are going to get more money.\n  Mr. President, what is the deception in that? Let me be very frank, \nvery straightforward. The deception is that all seniors know, because \nthey also listen to the trustees, that the trustees did not describe a \n$270 billion problem.\n  The trustees described a $90-billion problem. I agree there is a $90-\nbillion problem. But everybody understands that the real deception here \nis the effort to take a $90-billion problem and turn it into a $270-\nbillion solution so that you can give a tax cut to the folks who least \nneed it.\n  I might add that one of the great acts in turning the table topsy-\nturvy was last year with Harry and Louise. Remember how everybody \nargued about, ``Gosh, we don't want the Government telling you what to \ndo, and we don't want people to have choice taken away.''\n  And here, all of a sudden, is a formulation for Medicare that is the \nGovernment telling people what to do and narrowing their choices by \nrequiring that they go into a certain kind of managed care as the only \nmeans of providing the savings that they are providing.\n  What is equally egregious is, we keep hearing people say, ``We're not \ncutting Medicare; we're just slowing the rate of growth. It is still \ngoing to grow. There is still going to be a fixed amount of money \nadditionally that everybody is going to get each year.''\n  So with that sort of great statement, that bond, that verbal bond, \neverybody is supposed to feel good: ``Wow, I'm going to get an \nadditional $2,000 over the next 7 years.''\n  But the difference is, Mr. President, and everybody knows it, when \nyou have a fixed amount of budget available and the costs of Medicare \nare going up at a fairly steady rate, even if you diminish that rate to \nwhat most people would accept as a reasonable rate of increase, the \npopulation is growing, the population of seniors in America is growing \nat a predictable rate.\n  So you take this fixed pot of money, say to everybody, that fixed pot \nof money, even growing a little bit, is going to have to take care of \nthe same costs as it did the year before, even though the costs are \nincreasing, and it is going to have to do it for a larger population.\n  Ask anybody in elementary math, any school in America and even with \nthe problems we have in math in America, I believe they will understand \nthat with a fixed amount of money, a growing population, increased \ncosts, you have a problem in delivering the same level of care. That is \nwhy they want to take the standards off the nursing homes, because if \nyou take the standards off the nursing homes, people can deliver \nnursing care without a registered nurse. We can have a turning back to \nthe time when people were strapped in wheel chairs and where they were \njust, basically, drugged out as a means of taking care of people. We \ncan step back, and that may be the antivision that a lot of our friends \nare expressing here. It is certainly a form of deception.\n  Mr. President, at a time when this country is desperately in need of \nserious tax simplification, a tax simplification that really cuts tax \nrates for all Americans and American businesses, the Republicans are \nincreasing taxes on the middle class and increasing the number of \nloopholes for business, contrary to the very reform effort that we \ntried to put in place in 1986.\n  The Republican antivision, counterreform, tax-and-spend legislation \nsends a clear and unequivocal message to middle-income Americans across \nthis Nation, which is: ``You're really not that important.''\n  How else can you explain to people who earn $30,000 a year, who \ncomprise just about 50 percent of the people in this country, why it is \nthat their taxes are going to go up? Nowhere in the legislation that \nwill come to the floor tomorrow is there a demonstrated commitment to \nthe 2 million Americans who work slightly at or above the minimum wage. \nNowhere is there a clear commitment to continued environmental cleanup \nand the progress that we have made over the last 25 years, and for the \nworking mothers of this country who cut the strings of welfare \ndependence and sought and secured employment.\n  This legislation is saying to them that it is going to remain silent \nand even absent from helping them by proposing an increase in the \nminimum wage that has gone down now to a 40-year low level. For middle-\nclass families that have an aging parent living in a nursing home, we \nmay now find that those young people who once thought that their \nmothers and fathers were taken care of are now going to help them with \nthe costs of care. And having already bankrupted the elderly nursing \nhome resident because of the requirements we have, we are going to \nplace additional burdens on their children.\n  In contrast to that, the wealthiest Americans will reap a substantial \nbonus from this legislation. The richest 12 percent--and I do not want \nto get into a class distinction here, but fair is fair and we have to \nmeasure the notion of fairness.\n  The fact is that at the upper level of the income scale, the upper 12 \npercent are going to receive a whopping 48 percent of the tax benefits, \nand people with annual incomes greater than $200,000 are going to find \ntheir taxes decreased by over $3,400, and the 13 million families that \nearn more than $100,000 annually are going to enjoy a new tax break of \n$1,138. I do not know how you explain that when the other people are \npaying more taxes. I do not know anybody who can argue that that is a \nsensible idea of tax equity or tax fairness.\n  In the end, if you look at the various breaks that are continued and \nloopholes that are created, there is, in this reconciliation bill a new \ndefinition of welfare reform for those who are at the upper end of the \nscale, and I think it is part of a deception, or a counterreform, if \nyou will, that literally turns back the clock to the time before we \nlearned \n\n[[Page S 15566]]\nin this country that you needed to have a Government that was willing \nto respond and make a difference in people's lives.\n  It strips away those protections that were developed through harsh \nand bitter experiences, through the Depression years and through the \nlong years prior to the Depression where we began to understand what \nabject poverty and racism did to the Nation. We learned that you needed \na response. All we hear about is the failure of that response, even \nthough, in fact, most people who dispassionately and apolitically \nanalyze it will tell you that it is not that so many of those things \nhave failed, it is rather that they have not been permitted to be \ncompleted or to go to fruition.\n  Maybe this is what the real Contract With America is all about, Mr. \nPresident, creating a lesser America for those who are struggling at \nthe middle and lower end of the scale and then increasing privilege for \nthe few.\n  The statistics on what has happened to income in the last 13 years \ndramatize this. From 1940 to 1950, 1950 to 1960, 1960 to 1970, 1970 to \n1980, everybody in this country saw their income grow together. If you \nwere at the lowest end of the income scale, the lowest 20 percent of \nAmericans during that period of time, your income went up in the area \nof 138 percent every 10 years. If you were in the upper end of the \nincome scale, your income went up in the area of 98 percent. That is \nnot a bad balance. But from 1980 to 1993, the income of the lowest 20 \npercent of workers went down.\n  Over a 13-year period, the income of the lowest 20 percent of \nAmericans went down in the area of 17 percent. The next 20 percent, \ntheir income went down in the area of 4 percent. The middle two stayed \nthe same, but the top quintile of America went up in the area of 105 \npercent. That really is the story of what has happened in this country \nin the last 13 years.\n\n  Not very long ago, Speaker Gingrich talked about creating an \n``opportunity society,'' as he called it--a society where problems \nwould be turned into opportunities, where Americans of all ages, \nethnic, or racial backgrounds would be afforded equal opportunity.\n  Well, Mr. President, that rhetoric should be measured against the \nreconciliation bill we will debate in the next hours--a reconciliation \nbill where we see spending on middle income and average Americans \ndecrease, where we see an increase of taxes on the middle class, an \nopportunity society that has really been left to the ``haves,'' and for \nthose who have not, the opportunity is clearly going to continue to \nescape their grasp.\n  Ironically, the choices made in this budget make some very, very \nstrange and even bewildering opportunities. I do not think anybody \nwants the opportunity to drink dirty water. But for the first time in 5 \nor 6 years, the Federal share of helping Boston clean up its harbor and \nrelieve the rates--what are now the highest rates of water in the \ncountry--is going to be diminished--diminished even from what President \nBush was willing to give it.\n  I do not know anybody who wants the opportunity to go to school \nwithout books or even be able to go to a decent school at all. But the \nchapter 1 education assistance and the Goals 2000 is going to be \nstripped away. I do not know anybody who thinks it is an opportunity to \neat contaminated meat, but we saw that proposed in the course of this \nlast few months. And even the taking of unsafe medicines--is that an \nopportunity?\n  So how do our Republican colleagues come to the floor and tell the \nAmerican people that opportunity means cutting cops on the streets, \nwhen children are being shot in cold blood on some of the streets of \nAmerica. How do they say it is an opportunity when they raise $43 \nbillion in taxes on low-income working Americans, who are struggling to \nmake ends meet on what Ronald Reagan called the best antipoverty, \nprofamily program in America and give a $245 billion tax break to the \nwealthiest Americans while increasing the national debt in the process?\n  How is it an opportunity for students when we cut $11 billion from \nstudent loans and then increase the amount of taxes their parents are \ngoing to have to pay? In fact, Mr. President, over the course of the \nnext 7 years, this reconciliation bill is going to now end the direct \nloan program for maybe 50 percent of the schools in this country that \nhave entered into that program in the last few years. It is going to \nraise the burden on the average American borrowing money in order to \nsend their kids to school and put that money through the tax benefit in \nthe hands of the banks and the lenders even though it has been one of \nthe most successful door openings to the information age that we ever \ncould have anticipated.\n  What kind of opportunity is it when this budget cuts $182 billion \nfrom Medicaid, but leaves intact an $11 billion international space \nprogram? What kind of opportunity do seniors get when our Republicans \ncolleagues have chosen to cut $270 billion from Medicare and give the \nDefense Department a $6 billion bonus--money that it did not even \nrequest?\n  What do I tell the people of Massachusetts when, if these Medicare \ncuts hold, we lose 129,000 health service jobs, when the State loses 4 \npercent across the board in general fund spending and has to make up \nfor the $1.3 billion loss in Federal aid. When seniors in Massachusetts \nhave to pay $1,000 more per year for Medicare and the interest on \nstudent loans for 4 years of college goes up $3,000? What do you say \nabout opportunity in the face of the largest income earners in America \ngetting a tax break?\n  I was here in 1986, Mr. President, when we voted for the biggest tax \ndecrease in the history of the country. We took the rates down to 28 \npercent and, for a few people in the bubble, 33 percent. We have been \ngiving tax breaks to all Americans across the board. But in the face of \nthese other reductions, it is unconscionable to suggest that that \nrepresents a definition of opportunity.\n  Mr. President, I really think there is a reform agenda which we could \nhave embraced in a bipartisan way, and I reemphasize that there are \nmany of us on both sides of the aisle that I know could have found a \ncommon middle ground here, if politics and ideology and hot-button \npushing did not put such a premium on the agenda of the House and on \nsome who were elected in 1994.\n  It seems to me that what we are seeing here is a program that, not \nintentionally--although, in some I am not sure--turns out to be \nanticommunity, even antipeople, certainly anticommon sense, in the \ncontext of the real agenda of this country. When those who espouse that \nagenda choose not to fund a successful program like YouthBuild in \nBoston--when they strip youth employment opportunities and educational \nfunds that can keep kids in school or give kids structure in their \nlives--that disempowers communities and prevents people from helping \nthemselves.\n  We hear an awful lot of talk in the U.S. Senate about values, and we \nhear a lot of talk about family; but the truth is, Mr. President, that \n36 percent of all the children in America today are born out of \nwedlock. The truth is that you can go into any community in America \ntoday and find kids who talk with a level of anger and alienation \nunlike anything any of us have ever known historically. The truth is \nthat these are kids who do not have contact with church or school or \nparents. That is why they are in trouble.\n  Now, we can talk about values all we want. But if somebody does not \nhave some contact with that child, ages 9 to 16, where are the values \ngoing to come from? Most of us would come to the floor and extol the \nvirtues of the Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Brownies, boys and girls clubs, \nYWCA's, YMCA's. But the truth is that, for the vast majority of the \nchildren in this country, they are just not available. Who is going to \nprovide the structure? Or are we going to wait until we are forced to \nspend $50,000 a year to incarcerate that new felon?\n  I keep hearing my colleagues perpetuate one of the great \nmisstatements and myths of American politics today. They sweep every \none of these efforts to reach children under the same rug. They brand \nit all with one great sweeping brush and say, ``The liberal programs of \nthe past failed.''\n  But the truth is, Mr. President, that I can show you thousands of \nyoung people across this country who are working at jobs today, who are \ngraduating from college today because one of these \n\n[[Page S 15567]]\nentities intervened in their life, whether it was a City Year, \nYouthBuild, or a host of other entities. I know a young man who \ngraduated--I do not know him not personally, but I know of him--and I \nhave seen his curricula and history, in the context of YouthBuild, \nextolled for having graduated from Rutgers this past year. He came out \nof the streets through a YouthBuild program and saved his opportunity. \nI know a young woman currently working as a project manager on the \nBoston third harbor tunnel project in Boston. She came out of gangs and \ndrug use and a prison record, or at least a court-associated record. By \nvirtue of this program that entered her life where there was no parent, \nwhere there was no affirmation, she got it from the friends that joined \nher in this effort to save their lives.\n\n  Much of that is being done away with, with this effort by the \nRepublicans.\n  There are many of these efforts that are enormously successful across \nthe country, Mr. President, and we should not have to fight for basic \nsupport to have a successful program to give some of these kids a \nchance.\n  I think that what we need is a positive vision for a truly \nprogressive revolution in this country that reforms the Government, and \nnot just a negative vision that is guaranteed to take us back to darker \ntimes. The right choice is to empower communities to come together to \ndo what needs to be done and to help them do it.\n  I am not in favor, nor am I coming to the floor, to advocate that we \nshould stay with the old programs that have failed. I am not even \ncoming to the floor to advocate this ought to all come from Washington. \nIt should not, Mr. President.\n  I am not even advocating Government programs. I am advocating a new \npartnership between the Federal capacity to help distribute some \nresources and do it in an administratively cheap way that gets that \nmoney to those nongovernmental entities, to the nonprofit entities by \nthe thousands that are out there, struggling to make a difference in \nthe lives of young people.\n  But we do not do that, not in this piece of legislation, even with \nthis extraordinary opportunity to really create a blueprint for the \nfuture of this country.\n  I think we ought to be encouraging partnerships for community \nprogress all across the country between the Government and the private \nsector and churches and schools and community groups. We should rely on \nthe community groups and on those local entities and on the local \npeople to help define those efforts.\n  One thing I know, Mr. President, when you have only 82 kids in a \nYouthBuild program in Boston and 400 kids on the waiting list, it is \nunconscionable to be continuing some of these other subsidies in giving \ntax breaks when we could be saving some of those 400 kids and providing \nthe same kind of self-help program that truly embodies the notion of \ngiving people values.\n  Mr. President, the people in this country are really sick and tired \nof the lack of common sense that emanates from Washington. They are \ntired of the gamesmanship. They are tired of the rhetoric that comes \noff of this floor. It is hard.\n  I must say I listened to C-SPAN a couple nights ago and I said, \n``God, I really hope I do not sound like that,'' because the words just \nsort of bounce around. They sometimes have no real connection to the \nlives of the people that we were sent here to represent. There is more \nfinger pointing and more gamesmanship.\n  Sadly, we have arrived at a point where we have this extraordinarily \nimportant budget, and truly it can be said that there has been no real \noutreach, no real effort to try to find a bipartisan approach.\n  We are implementing the Contract With America. We are implementing an \nagenda that was set in a campaign document, a document that does not \neven mention the word ``children.'' The word ``children'' does not \nappear in this contract. The words ``health care'' do not appear in \nthis contract. ``Environment'' does not appear in the contract except \nunder the concept of regulatory reform.\n  Most importantly, those things that really matter to people, which is \nhow am I going to get a job? How am I going to raise my income for the \nadditional work I am putting in on a daily basis? That is the primary \nthing that most Americans are concerned about.\n  People want to know whether or not they will have their kids be able \nto have an adequate enough education to be able to get that kind of \njob. They want to know whether or not they will be able to go home at \nnight and literally not be so exhausted and burned out and frazzled \nthat they can spend some time with a child, truly imparting values, and \nthat they can have time for something we used to call quality of life.\n  I think the people of this country want us to move inexorably to a \nstronger, richer, safer, better, and saner America for everyone--\neveryone--on a fair basis.\n  They want to fix what is wrong. They want to keep what is right. \nThere is a lot that is right.\n  Unfortunately, in this budget we are not going to have the \nopportunity to really present those choices to the American people. I \nam convinced that most Americans very quickly will understand what is \nfair and what is real and what is not.\n  The American people believe unquestionably in their hearts that we \nhave not been wrong to do what both Republicans and Democrats joined \ntogether in doing in the last years. Republicans joined with Democrats \nto guarantee that those who work at the low end of the scale of America \nhave a reasonable wage. That we did together.\n  They joined together to guarantee that we would put 100,000 cops on \nthe streets of America. And yet here we are with a proposal that blocks \nit all into a grant, makes those cops compete with floodlights for \nprisons, computers for the precinct, new cruisers, all the other \nthings--except that we so desperately need cops on every street in this \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, the budget debate that we will embark on in the next \nhours really should not be so honed in political ideology or 30-second \nsound bites. I think it really ought to be a much more thoughtful \ndiscussion to the American who is listening and who wants to really \nconsider how we will build the future of this country.\n  It ought to be a debate based on facts, not on distortions and side \nbars and fictions but really on the facts. The implacable and \nirrefutable facts about where we are heading in terms of income and \njobs, violence, education, environmental cleanup, and the other things \nthat make up the quality of life.\n  Mr. President, I think it is a discussion that should not be limited \nin this arbitrary 20-hour way of jamming all of the legislative effort \nand the 1,000 pages that most people have not even had time to read.\n  The tax provisions contained in this legislation certainly require a \ngreat deal more time and exposure in order to really flesh out their \nfairness and also their long-term impact on the economy of this \ncountry.\n  Maybe it is time we changed our rules, Mr. President, by voting to \nrecommit the legislation of the Budget Committee to ensure that a tax-\nwriting committee has had sufficient time to explore and debate all the \nissues not addressed, including real tax reform and simplification.\n  This legislation leaves us with many, many questions, Mr. President. \nWhy is it that we could not have used this as a great opportunity to \ntry to make a stronger set of choices for the American people? Why \ncould we not have lowered the tax rates for lower-income Americans and \nbeen fairer in the distribution at the upper end? Why could we not have \nused this as a means of debating how we will break people out of that \nlower end cycle, rather than sending them back into it by doing away \nwith the earned income tax credit.\n  Why could we not have used this to have a stronger real fix for the \nproblem of the inequity of the delivery of health care in the country \nand the problem of the distribution of resources and the increasing \nnumbers of Americans who have no coverage at all? Why could we not have \nspent the time on the floor really expressing the stronger vision of \nwhere it is that we are headed.\n  I know my colleagues will come to the floor and they will say the \nSenator has it all wrong. What we are going to do here is we are going \nto balance the budget. We are going to end this cycle of spending. \n\n[[Page S 15568]]\n\n  I agree, Mr. President. Balancing the budget is good for America, and \nreducing this deficit is good for America. That is not the issue. That \nis not what is at stake here because we are going to do that.\n  The question is, how are we going to do it? Are we going to do it \nfixated only on the fiscal deficit, or are we also going to think about \nthe spiritual, moral, cultural deficit in this country? Are we also \ngoing to think about the investment deficit in this country?\n  You do not get from here to there in America on an old FAA computer \nsystem and call it safe. You do not get from here to there in America \non trains that are predestined to crash because we do not invest enough \nin safety measures for our country. You do not get from here to there \nin America on roads that were not built in the National Highway System \nwith the commitment of Federal participation. There are hundreds of \nexamples, where responsible action at the Federal level has improved \nthe capacity of this country to provide for its people and to help \npeople provide for themselves.\n\n  I am absolutely one who accepts the notion that we have to rethink \nhow we deliver services. I am prepared to shrink the size of \nWashington. In fact we have been doing that. We will soon have around \n200,000 fewer bureaucrats. It is the smallest Government we had since \nJack Kennedy was President of the United States. You would not know \nthat from listening to our colleagues. We have had 3 straight years of \ndeficit reduction. And now we will move on to balance the budget, which \nis what we ought to do.\n  But Americans are going to ask whether, as we did this, we did it \nsensibly; whether it is fair; whether we had a vision for what we want \nthe future to be. Americans are going to ask whether or not this \ndocument represents an antivision, or a vision. I am confident that, \nbecause it represents an antivision, the President of the United States \nwill ultimately veto it, because it is not bipartisan, because it is \nnot reflective of the higher plane of vision of what this country ought \nto be and what we want it to be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues who \nearlier discussed what is truly a historic budget reconciliation that \nwill be coming to the floor in the morning. This is legislation that \nwill balance the Federal budget in 7 years, and that is the issue \nbefore us; that will reform welfare, and that is the issue before us; \nthat will save Medicare from bankruptcy, because that is the issue \nbefore us; and which will provide much needed tax relief to American \nfamilies.\n  The Social Security and Medicare programs were reviewed in a \ndocument. The trustees, there were six in all, three of whom were on \nthe Clinton administration's Cabinet, made it very clear that the issue \nbefore us in Medicare is to save it from bankruptcy, to save the entire \nprogram--not just a part of it, not just one trust fund, but the entire \nprogram.\n  On the first page of the report of the trustees--and, again, the \ntrustees, three of whom are from Clinton's Cabinet--it says very \nclearly, ``The Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will be able to \npay benefits for only about 7 years and is severely out of financial \nbalance in the long range. The trustees believe that prompt, effective \nand decisive action is necessary.'' And that action we have in this \nreconciliation package.\n  On page 13 of this same report it spells it out very clearly that, \n``both the hospital insurance trust fund and the supplementary medical \ninsurance trust fund show alarming financial results.'' That is part A \nand part B; not just part A, as we so often hear from the other side of \nthe aisle.\n  I continue reading from page 13, ``The HI trust fund continues to be \nseverely out of financial balance and is projected to be exhausted in 7 \nyears. The SMI trust fund [which is part B, the physician part] shows a \nrate of growth of cost which is clearly unsustainable.''\n  Again, reading the exact words, these words are from Sanford Ross and \nDavid Walker, the two public trustees, ``The Medicare program is \nclearly unsustainable in its present form.'' Not just the part A trust \nfund but the Medicare program. Again, we hear from the other side of \nthe aisle we can put another Band-Aid on this program. We can do what \nwe have done in the past and ratchet down a little more on the \nhospitals, because it is not a crisis. It is not all that urgent. ``We \nhave seen it before over the last 10 years,'' the other side of the \naisle says. Yet the trustees say, ``We strongly recommend that the \ncrisis presented by the financial condition of the Medicare trust funds \n[both funds] be urgently addressed on a comprehensive basis.''\n  These are the trustees' words. I point that out because, again, we \nhear every day and several times a day, ``Let us just put another $100 \nbillion into the program and that will take care of it for another \ncouple of years.'' No, the trustees say we need to address part A, and \npart B, hospitals and doctors, the program overall, and not just one \naspect of that program.\n  So, we make the case. The trustees have made the case that Medicare \nis going bankrupt if we do nothing. The American people did not know \nthat 1 year ago, or even 8 months ago. Now our senior citizens \nrecognize that. Our individuals with disabilities recognize that. And \nthey recognize that we are going to have to change the system, bring it \nup to date, to 1995 standards. It is a good program. As a physician I \nhave seen that it has cared for millions and millions of our senior \ncitizens in an effective way. But, as the trustees said, it cannot be \nsustained. It needs to be modernized.\n  We pointed out again and again that we are going to increase spending \nin the Medicare program. Just a few moments ago we heard, when you \nadjust it on a per beneficiary, or per capita, or per person basis we \nare really not increasing it. That is not true. On a per capita, per \nperson, per senior citizen, we are spending $4,800 a year this year and \nthat is going to increase next year and that is going to increase the \nyear after that, and increase the year after that to, by the year 2002, \njust 6\\1/2\\ years from now, we are going to be spending $6,700, almost \n$2,000 more than we are spending today. And that is not a cut.\n  It is going bankrupt if we do nothing. We have heard no alternative, \nreasonable alternative that addresses the overall program from the \nother side of the aisle.\n  Second, we are going to increase spending, not cut.\n  And, third is something that I am most excited about, again because \nof my past experience as a physician, as one who has taken care of \nthousands of senior citizens. When I close my eyes I do see faces, \nindividual faces of mothers, of grandmothers, of fathers, of \ngrandfathers, of individuals with disabilities. We cannot just throw \nmore money at the problem, more Band-Aids. We have to strengthen the \nsystem.\n  We have not given enough attention publicly to what we are doing in \nstrengthening this system, in improving it, in giving our seniors and \nindividuals more options that meet their individual needs. That is \nwhere we are giving them the right to choose, empowering them to choose \na plan which might better meet their needs but at the same time \nallowing them to keep exactly what they have today if they wish.\n  Let me refer to this chart, just to explain what I mean by that, how \nwe are strengthening the program. Just focus on the top part of this \npart. Today we have fee for service, traditional fee for service, where \nyou choose your own physician, you pay your physician in a very direct \nfashion for the services delivered, and about 91 percent of the 37 \nmillion people on Medicare today are in a fee for service system.\n  About 9 percent of those 37 million people are in an HMO. It is a \nvery limited model. It is a very closed model today, but that is an \noption for 1 out of 10 of our citizens. On the other hand, in the State \nof Tennessee there are no HMO's in the Medicare system. Everybody, the \nnumber actually in Tennessee of all those 37 million people, for the \nmost part are in just this fee-for-service system.\n  We are going to hear the plan laid out a little more over the next \nfew days. But what does it do for our senior citizens? As I said, our \nsenior citizens can stay in fee for service, keep their same physician \ntoday, not be forced \n\n[[Page S 15569]]\nout of that system at all. Or they can stay in an HMO, if they happen \nto be there and are pleased with that. But look what we are actually \nopening up to those senior citizens: A wonderful array of plans that \ncan better meet their individual needs.\n  If you need a lot of prescription drugs, you are not going to want to \nbe in a fee-for-service system where prescription drugs are not \ncovered. You might want to pick one of these other plans. You do not \nhave to, but you can, for the first time in 30 years in the history of \nthis program.\n  Medical savings accounts; for the first time a senior citizen can \npick a medical savings account or indemnity plan or a preferred \nprovider organization or a point of service plan, or a union-sponsored \nplan. For the first time, our senior citizens are going to be able to \nopt for the plan that better meets their needs.\n  Medical savings accounts--let me just take a few minutes and talk \nabout medical savings accounts, because it is an example of an option \nthat our seniors today have no access to, that, once this bill passes, \nthey will be able to choose if they would like. The use by health \nconsumers of MSA's will change provider behavior--the physician, the \nhospital--as well as consumer behavior. Why? Because it, if one chooses \nthat, will decrease the role of third-party payers.\n  It will also increase an individual's awareness of the health care \ncosts. Today, there is really very little incentive for patients to be \ncost-conscious consumers of health care. On average, every time a \npatient in America receives a dollar's worth of care, 79 cents is paid \nby a third party--by an insurance company, or by the Federal \nGovernment. Only 21 cents is paid by that patient.\n  The result is that we have the potential--and I believe grossly--of \nover-consuming medical services today. Everyone wants it. It is a human \ntendency. You want it for your mother, your spouse, and your children. \nEverybody wants the latest, the hottest, the most sophisticated, and, \nyes, usually the most expensive in whatever medical service it is. It \nmight be the most deluxe hospital room, or it might be getting an MRI \nscan for a headache, or it might be the latest in nuclear medical \nimaging. We want the very best. This does play a role in increasing the \ncost of health care.\n  Medical savings accounts--which are savings accounts that an \nindividual puts money into and can draw upon for care--will help \nintroduce incentives, marketplace incentives, for most cost-conscious \nbehavior.\n  MSA's, medical savings accounts, give individuals more choice in the \nhealth care market. Our senior citizen cannot join an MSA today in \nMedicare. It will help stem rising health care costs without decreasing \navailability or the quality of patient care. It empowers individuals to \nmake prudent, cost-conscious decisions about their health care, about \ntheir health care needs, and how to meet those needs. And it will \nencourage hospitals and physicians to compete for patients on the basis \nof cost, yes, but also outcomes and quality of care.\n  There is another important aspect of medical savings accounts, and it \nis really overlooked almost always by policymakers in Washington; that \nis, the effect that empowerment of individuals--37 million individuals \npotentially, although I do not think it will be that--but that \nempowerment actually changes provider behavior. It changes physician \nbehavior. Doctors, like patients, are accustomed to a system that is \nnot subject to market forces. Since insured patients do not have any \nincentives to shop around or ask outcome questions or compare medical \nservices, whether it is based on price or outcome, physicians are not \nrewarded for providing cost-conscious care.\n  Throughout much of my practice as a heart surgeon and a heart \ntransplant surgeon, I would perform a heart operation, submit the bill, \nand the bill was paid with no questions asked by the patient.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will suspend, under the rules \nof morning business we are operating in, Senators are limited to 10 \nminutes unless the Senator asks unanimous consent.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to continue for \n5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, traditionally no questions have been asked. \nOne day an individual came to see me. He actually needed a heart \ntransplant. He came with a list of transplant centers. He said, ``These \nare outcomes that I have heard about. What are your outcomes?'' He \nasked, ``What are your infection rates, and how much do you charge for \nheart transplants?''\n  To be honest, nobody had ever come in and asked, ``How much do you \ncharge for a heart transplant?'' What I did was actually turn around \nand go back to my transplant team, and say, ``Let us see exactly what \nwe charge. Let us be able to answer that question why we charge what we \ncharge as well as look at the outcome data and how our results were \ncompared to other people,'' not only with my own practice and my own \ntransplant team, but the other transplant teams in my center.\n  I brought them together, and sure enough, we looked at quality \nstandards. We got those out to the community. And, yes, we lowered our \nprices for how much we would charge for transplantation. Just because \nof one empowered patient who came forward and asked the right \nquestions, I think we improved quality, we improved care, and we gave \nmore cost-effective care.\n  Because someone else usually pays the bills, many patients forget \nthat they are consumers. They do not ask providers to be accountable. \nIf one individual can make such a difference, just imagine what impact \nwe can make when we empower thousands of individuals similarly.\n  Because I strongly believe that empowerment of individuals will help \nreform--not totally reform the system but help reform, the delivery of \nhealth care--I recently introduced a bill, S. 1249, which provides for \nestablishment of a little bit different type of MSA. Under this bill, \njust to use an example, an employer would deposit up to $2,500 in a \ntax-free savings account for an employee and would also purchase a \ncatastrophic-type health insurance policy to cover the cost of \nextraordinary medical expenses. Routine expenses, like eye glasses, \nannual checkups, possibly prescriptions and dental work would be paid \nby the employee using that medical savings account. If you did not use \nall those funds, that medical savings account would accumulate from \nyear to year. Self-employed and uninsured individuals would also be \nable to establish an MSA link with a low-cost insurance plan under this \nbill.\n  Unlike the other MSA proposals introduced in Congress, my bill allows \nfor greater flexibility in benefit design. S. 1249, unlike some of the \nother more restrictive MSA's, allows managed care companies to offer a \nlow-cost plan based on higher cost sharing rather than just a large, \nrigid deductible. Restricting plan participation to the size of the \ndeductible may work fine in today's market, but as we learn more and \nmore about how individuals purchase health care services under an MSA, \nthe market may need greater flexibility which can be accomplished under \nour plan.\n  Indeed, many insurance plans today have modified their benefit and \ncost-sharing design over time to alter consumer behavior. Some critics \nof MSA's are concerned that individuals may forego preventive care to \nsave money. I personally believe that greater control over your health \ncare dollars will encourage more preventive care in this environment.\n  In my MSA proposal, we would allow a plan to possibly stretch the \neffect of cost-conscious purchasing by requiring a 50 percent copayment \nfor the first $5,000 of services in a year as opposed to the \ntraditional high deductible plan. My bill would allow this flexibility.\n  Mr. President, in closing, we, in America, are fortunate to have the \nabsolute highest quality health in the world. When leaders of the world \nbecome seriously ill, they do not go to Great Britain or Canada to seek \ntreatment. They come to the United States. While there are those who \nwould like to stifle our technological advances and allow bureaucrats \nto tell us how much and what kind of health care we can receive, the \nAmerican people have loudly and clearly rejected this notion. \n\n[[Page S 15570]]\n\n  No one can predict what will happen in medicine over the next 50 \nyears. Over the last 50 years, there have been tremendous changes. The \ntechnological advances are simply mind-boggling. The challenge for us \nin health care is to maintain the highest quality of health care in the \nworld and at the same time to continue to make it available to all \nAmericans, but this can be done only if we change that basic framework \nthrough which medical services are consumed.\n  A medical savings account, again, is not the answer to these \nproblems. But it is an alternative. It is an option which will go a \nlong way to empower individual consumers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/24/senate-section/article/S15568-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING HARRY KIZIRIAN\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, today the Senate will act on H.R. 1606, \nlegislation to designate the U.S. Post Office Building located at 24 \nCorliss Street, Providence, RI, as ``The Harry Kizirian Post Office \nBuilding.'' I was pleased to join my colleague, Senator John Chafee, in \ncosponsoring the Senate version of the bill, S. 786.\n  It is a fitting tribute for Congress to name this particular \nstructure after Harry Kizirian because it was the first post office in \nthe United States to use a fully automated sorting system, under \nHarry's supervision. Harry Kizirian himself is a Rhode Island landmark \nbecause of his extraordinary contributions to the United States, to \nRhode Island, and to Providence.\n  When Harry was just 15 years old, his father died, and he went to \nwork part-time as a postal clerk to help support his widowed mother. He \nthen worked his way up through the leadership positions in the Postal \nService. After being nominated by former Senator John O. Pastore, Harry \nwas confirmed by the Senate in 1961 as postmaster of Providence, RI, a \npost he held for more than 25 years.\n  World War II interrupted Harry's career for a short time. He enlisted \nin the U.S. Marine Corps after he graduated from Mount Pleasant High \nSchool and subsequently became Rhode Island's most decorated marine.\n  He fought in Okinawa and was shot in battle. He earned the Navy \nCross, the Bronze Star with a ``V'', the Purple Heart with a gold star \nand, finally, the Rhode Island Cross.\n  After the war, Harry returned to Rhode Island and to his job at the \nPost Office. In addition to his military service and his work in the \nPostal Service, he had served on numerous committees and boards in \nRhode Island.\n  Harry served on the board of directors of Butler Hospital, Big \nBrothers of Rhode Island, the Providence Human Relations Commission, \nRhode Island Blue Cross, and Rhode Island Heart and Lung Associations.\n  He was also a member of the Community Advisory Board of Rhode Island \nCollege, the Providence Heritage Commission, the Commission on Rhode \nIsland Medal Honor Recipients, DAV, and the Marine Corps League.\n  Harry Kizirian's name has become synonymous with the qualities he \nexemplifies--dedication, loyalty, leadership, and hard work. I am \ndelighted to honor him, not only for his lifetime of service to the \nPostal Service, but also for his involvement with and commitment to his \ncommunity. Congratulations, Harry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/24/senate-section/article/S15570-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15570-S15572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      U.S. WORKERS NEED MORE PROTECTION UNDER OUR IMMIGRATION LAWS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, legal immigration within the limits and \nrules of our immigration laws has served America well throughout our \nhistory, and is one of the most important elements of our national \nstrength and character.\n  Clearly, Congress and the American people today are rightly concerned \nabout illegal immigration. There is broad bipartisan support for \neffective measures to crack down on this festering problem. But we must \nbe careful to ensure that attitudes toward illegal immigrants do not \ncreate a backlash against legal immigrants.\n  In general, the current laws and policies on legal immigration work \nwell, and we must be hesitant to change them, especially those that \ngive high priority to encouraging family reunification and enabling \nU.S. citizens to bring their spouses, children, parents and siblings to \nthis country.\n  But one area of legal immigration that needs reform is in the rules \nprotecting American workers. It has become clear that protections for \nU.S. workers under current law have not kept pace with changes in the \nAmerican labor market and the world labor market.\n  This problem is particularly serious in our laws permitting the entry \nof temporary foreign workers--the so-called nonimmigrants. Hearings \nconducted earlier this month by the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration, \nunder the able chairmanship of Senator Simpson, have revealed the depth \nof this problem.\n  U.S. companies are increasingly out-sourcing activities previously \nperformed by permanent employees. More firms are resorting more often \nto the use of temporary workers or independent contractors as a way of \nincreasing profits and reducing wages and benefits, even though the \nresult is less in-house expertise for the firms.\n  Often, the workers brought in from outside are U.S. citizens. But \nincreasingly, U.S. firms are also turning to temporary foreign workers. \nYet, this little known aspect of our immigration laws includes few \nprotections for U.S. workers.\n  Current laws governing permanent immigrant workers require employers \nto try to recruit U.S. workers first. The Department of Labor must \ncertify that efforts for such recruitment have been carried out before \nan employer can sponsor an immigrant worker. This process has some \nshortcomings, but it is intended to guarantee that immigrant workers do \nnot displace American workers.\n  A serious problem is that our laws governing temporary foreign \nworkers contain no such requirement. They are based on the outdated \nview that because they enter only temporarily, few protections for U.S. \nworkers are required. Current law does not require employers to try to \nrecruit U.S. workers first, and the Department of Labor has little \nauthority to investigate and remedy abuses that arise, such as the \nunderpayment of wages or the use of inadequate working conditions.\n  As a result, a U.S. firm can lay off permanent U.S. workers and fill \ntheir jobs with temporary foreign workers--either by hiring them \ndirectly or by using outside contractors.\n  In one case, a major U.S. computer firm laid off many of its U.S. \ncomputer programmers, then entered into a joint venture with an Indian \ncomputer firm that supplied replacement programmers--most of whom were \ntemporary workers from India.\n  While reforms are needed in this area, we must be careful not to \nthrow the baby out with the bath water. Many temporary workers who come \nhere provide unique skills that help the United States to stay \ncompetitive in the global marketplace. For example, such workers can \nbring unique knowledge and expertise to university research programs \ndeveloping new medical advances and new technologies.\n  As Congress takes up far-reaching reforms in legal immigration, it is \nvitally important that we recognize these basic distinctions. Stronger \nprotections for American workers are needed. But they are not \ninconsistent with preserving an appropriate role for foreign workers \nwith unique skills.\n  In our subcommittee hearings earlier this month, Secretary of Labor \nRobert Reich proposed three important changes to our immigration laws \non temporary foreign workers. I believe these should receive serious \nconsideration by Congress.\n  Secretary Reich proposed, first, that these employers should be \nrequired to make good faith efforts to recruit U.S. workers first--\nbefore seeking the entry of a foreign worker. Second, he proposed that \nemployers who lay off U.S. workers should be precluded from seeking \nforeign workers in that field for at least 6 months. Third, he proposed \nthat the length of time that temporary foreign workers may remain in \nthe United States be reduced from 6 years under current law to no more \nthan 3 years, in order to reduce the overall number of temporary \nforeign workers in the country at a given time.\n  In addition to these three thoughtful proposals by Secretary Reich, \nthe bipartisan Commission on Immigration Reform, chaired by former \nCongresswoman Barbara Jordan, has recommended that employers who \nrequest \n\n[[Page S 15571]]\nimmigrants also be required to contribute to the training of American \nworkers. As the Commission stated in its report last June,\n\n       To demonstrate the bona fide need for a foreign worker and \n     to increase the competitiveness of U.S. workers, an employer \n     should be required to pay a substantial fee, that is, make a \n     substantial financial investment into a certified private \n     sector initiative dedicated to increasing the competitiveness \n     of U.S. workers.\n\n  Each of these proposals is worth serious consideration by Congress--\nboth for permanent immigrant workers and for temporary foreign workers. \nAs Congress moves forward in the coming months on far-reaching \nimmigration reform legislation, it is essential that we enact stronger \nsafeguards against unscrupulous resorting to foreign workers at the \nexpense of American workers, and I look forward to working closely with \nmy colleagues in the Senate and the House to achieve this important \ngoal.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a recent article from the \nWashington Post--``White-Collar Visas: Importing Needed Skills or Cheap \nLabor?''--be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 21, 1995]\n\n      White-Collar Visas: Importing Needed Skills or Cheap Labor?\n\n                         (By William Branigin)\n\n       A large New York insurance company lays off 250 computer \n     programmers in three states and replaces them with lower-wage \n     temporary workers from India. A Michigan firm sends underpaid \n     physical therapists from Poland to work at health care \n     facilities in Texas. A company in California advertises that \n     it can supply employers with ``technical workers'' from the \n     Philippines at low pay.\n       Even the White House resorts to cheap technical help, using \n     a company that imports most of its workers from India to \n     upgrade the president's correspondence-tracking computer \n     system.\n       As Congress considers major changes in immigration law, the \n     Department of Labor and a number of professional associations \n     and private citizens are citing cases such as these in urging \n     an overhaul of a little-known immigration program designed to \n     meet shortages of highly skilled workers in certain \n     ``specialty occupations.'' The debate highlights much broader \n     dilemmas that the nation faces as it tries to decide how many \n     foreigners to admit and what qualifications to demand of \n     them.\n       Each year, tens of thousands of such workers from around \n     the world are brought into the United States under the H-1B \n     visa program, which admits computer programmers, engineers, \n     scientists, health care workers and fashion models under \n     ``nonimmigrant'' status.\n       Businesses say they need the program to obtain quick, \n     temporary professional help that cannot be found in the U.S. \n     work force. They say the visa category enables them to \n     hire people with ``unique'' skills--the ``best and \n     brightest'' that the world has to offer--and to compete in \n     an increasingly tough global market.\n       Advocates of this and other employment-based visa programs \n     cite numerous cases in which foreign professionals with \n     special expertise have made valuable contributions to \n     American science and technology and have helped create jobs \n     in the American economy. But the Labor Department says the H-\n     1B program also has been widely exploited to bring in \n     thousands of foreign professionals and technicians whose \n     chief attraction is that they are willing to work for much \n     lower salaries than their U.S. counterparts. Many are \n     imported by job-contracting firms known as ``body shops,'' \n     which recruit the foreign professionals and hire them out to \n     major U.S. companies at a profit.\n       In many cases, ``employment-based immigration is used not \n     to obtain unique skills, but cheap, compliant labor,'' said \n     Lawrence Richards, a former IBM computer programmer who \n     formed the Software Professionals' Political Action Committee \n     last year after colleagues were laid off and replaced by \n     lower-paid programmers from India.\n       Richards and other critics of the H-1B visa program \n     described the imported professionals as ``techno-braceros,'' \n     the high-tech equivalent of migrant farm workers.\n       They charged that the program is driving down wages in \n     certain sectors, displacing American workers and bringing in \n     foreigners who often are effectively ``indentured'' to their \n     employers. In the long run, they predicted, it will \n     accelerate the flight of high-tech jobs overseas, discourage \n     American students from studying for those occupations and \n     produce the very shortages it was designed to alleviate.\n       In addition, some immigrants have used the program to set \n     up lucrative job-contracting concerns that discriminate \n     against Americans in hiring, sometimes even as they receive \n     federal assistance for minority-owned businesses.\n       To remedy what he says is a situation ``fraught with \n     abuse,'' Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich is seeking major \n     reforms under immigration legislation now being debated in \n     both chambers of Congress.\n       ``We have seen numerous instances in which American \n     businesses have brought in foreign skilled workers after \n     having laid off skilled American workers, simply because they \n     can get the foreign workers more cheaply,'' Reich said in an \n     interview. The program ``has become a major means of \n     circumventing the costs of paying skilled American workers or \n     the costs of training them,'' he added.\n       ``There is abuse of the current nonimmigrant system, but it \n     is by no means overwhelming,'' argued Austin T. Fragomen, an \n     immigration lawyer who represents major U.S. corporations, \n     ``To the extent there is abuse, [it] occurs among small, \n     relatively unknown companies'' and should be ``controlled \n     through more effective enforcement,'' he said in written \n     Senate testimony last month.\n       ``It is minimally widespread,'' said Charles A. \n     Billingsley, of the Information Technology Association of \n     America, a pro-immigration group. ``Are U.S. workers being \n     put out of work by foreign workers? Probably. But the \n     occurrence is minuscule.'' In any case, he said, H-1B visa \n     holders account for only `` a fraction of the U.S. work \n     force.''\n       Such arguments are not much comfort to John Morris, who \n     owns a computer consulting firm in Houston. He said he lost \n     his largest customer, a major oil company, when he refused to \n     supply it with cheap foreign programmers.\n       ``Greed is the reason they're doing this,'' Morris said. \n     ``Anybody who says it ain't greed is smoking rope.''\n       He said he also has turned down a Chinese company's offer \n     to provide programmers for placement at $500 a month in jobs \n     that usually would pay $5,000 a month.\n       ``The Chinese are desperate to get in here,'' Morris said. \n     ``This is economic warfare.''\n       In 1990, Congress passed an immigration act that raised a \n     cap on permanent employment-based immigration from 54,000 to \n     140,000 a year in response to fears of an imminent shortage \n     of scientists, engineers and other highly skilled \n     professionals. A separate provision created the H--1B visa \n     category, which lets in as many as 65,000 professionals a \n     year for stays of up to six years. These workers are supposed \n     to be paid ``prevailing wages'' and not used to break \n     strikes.\n       The H-1B provision requires no test of the U.S. labor \n     market for the availability of qualified American workers, \n     and it does not bar businesses from replacing U.S. workers \n     with ``temporary'' nonimmigrants.\n       In practice, critics say, ``prevailing wages'' have been \n     defined too broadly to prevent many job contractors from \n     significantly undercutting the salaries usually paid to \n     Americans. Moreover, the anticipated shortages did not \n     materialize, in part because defense industry cuts after the \n     end of the Cold War added to the ranks of an estimated 2.3 \n     million Americans who have been laid off so far this decade.\n       In Senate testimony last month, Reich called on Congress to \n     prohibit employers from hiring nonimmigrant workers in place \n     of Americans who were laid off. He said companies should be \n     required to show they had tried to ``recruit and retain U.S. \n     workers' in the occupations for which nonimmigrants were \n     sought. He also recommended that the permitted stay of these \n     workers be reduced to three years.\n       ``Hiring foreign over domestic workers should be the rare \n     exception, not the rule,'' Reich said.\n       The labor secretary noted that although nonimmigrant \n     workers are admitted on a ``temporary'' basis, many stay for \n     years, sometimes illegally. More than half of foreigners \n     granted permanent resident status in fiscal 1994 originally \n     came in as nonimmigrant students or ``temporary'' workers, \n     Reich said.\n       In response to ``abuse'' of the nonimmigrant programs, over \n     the past three years the Labor Department has charged 33 \n     employers with wage violations involving more than 400 \n     workers in physical therapy and computer-related occupations.\n       In one case, the department found that an Indian-owned firm \n     in Michigan called Syntel Inc. had ``willfully underpaid'' \n     its Indian computer programmers, who came to the United \n     States under H-1B visas and made up more than 80 percent of \n     the company's work force.\n       In November last year, American International Group, a \n     large Manhattan-based insurer, paid off 250 American \n     programmers in New York, New Jersey and New Hampshire and \n     transferred the work to Syntel. Syntel assigned some of the \n     work to about 200 Indians it had brought in, reportedly at \n     about half the American's salaries, and gave the rest to much \n     to much lower-paid employees at its home office in Bombay. \n     During their last weeks of employment, the laid-off U.S. \n     workers were even required to train their replacements, Reich \n     said.\n       ``It was clear that Syntel did not bring in any special \n     skills that we did not have,'' said Linda Kilcrease, one of \n     the full-time programmers who lost their jobs.\n       Another Michigan company, Rehab One, was found by the Labor \n     Department to have underpaid physical therapists it brought \n     in from Poland. The workers, who came in with H-1B visas, \n     were assigned to U.S. health care facilities, primarily in \n     Texas, and were paid as little as $500 a month, the \n     department found.\n\n[[Page S 15572]]\n\n       In New Jersey, a major shipping company, Sea-Land Services, \n     laid off 325 computer programmers this year and replaced them \n     with Filipinos supplied by Manila-based Software Ventures \n     International. The Americans. who were paid about $50,000 a \n     year on average, also had to train the lower-paid Filipinos, \n     most of whom eventually returned to Manila to carry out the \n     work even more cheaply there.\n       ``I was outraged,'' said Jessie Lindsay, one of the former \n     Sea-Land programmers. ``There were highly paid technical jobs \n     leaving the country. . . . What's the point of getting an \n     education and technical training if companies can get away \n     with hiring at slave wages?''\n       Mastech Corp., of Oakdale, Pa., a company owned by two \n     Indian immigrants that has won millions of dollars in \n     consulting contracts with the federal government, has brought \n     in about 900 of its 1,300 workers from India under the H-1B \n     program. From 1991 until Sept. 30, one of its contracts, \n     obtained under a set-aside program for minority-owned \n     businesses, involved ``computer system integration, \n     installation, maintenance and operational support for the \n     White House correspondence system,'' the presidential press \n     office said.\n       ``We have been lumped in with some other companies that \n     allegedly underpay their foreign workers,'' a Mastech \n     executive said. ``We are not a low-paying company.''\n       One of the latest controversies over the H-1B program \n     erupted last month after it was reported that the National \n     Association of Securities Dealers had laid off 30 contract \n     computer programmers and hired an Indian firm, Tata \n     Consultancy Services, to do the work. The government-\n     chartered association, based in Rockville, Md., owns, \n     operates and regulates the Nasdaq Stock Market. Tata, which \n     has a regional office in Silver Spring, is part of a huge \n     Indian conglomerate that company officials say produces \n     everything from tea to computer software.\n       An NASD spokesman, Marc Beauchamp, said Tata would employ \n     about 40 people on the project, half of them working here on \n     H-1B visas and half at Tata's home office in Bombay. He \n     denied that any full-time NASD employees were fired and said \n     that ``fewer than 20 outside contractors could possibly be \n     affected'' by the move.\n       The Indians essentially would be maintaining ``outmoded \n     technology'' so that regular NASD programmers could ``focus \n     on new technologies'' and perform ``more challenging work,'' \n     Beauchamp said. ``We found it made no business sense to hire \n     programmers that we would have to pay more than, or as much \n     as, the people we have on staff,'' he said.\n       Neither NASD nor Tata would disclose details of the \n     contract. However, Tata insisted that it follows all U.S. \n     regulations and wage requirements.\n       ``We are not a body shop,'' said A. Sruthi Sagar, the \n     firm's personnel manager. ``We are not in the business of \n     providing cheap labor to the United States.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/24/senate-section/article/S15570-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       TRANSFER OF BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT LANDS TO THE STATES\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an issue that I \nfirmly believe in, more localized control of our public lands. I am \nhere today to set the facts straight so that the people of Montana get \nthe real story and can make their decision on two pieces of legislation \nbefore this body.\n  Several months ago I cosponsored a bill, S. 1031, that will allow the \nGovernors of States with Bureau of Land Management lands to request \nthese lands be transferred to the States in which they are located. \nThis bill brings control of public lands to the local government and \nout of the stone cold buildings in this town. I signed on to this bill \nas a way of addressing an issue that I have fought long and hard for \nlocal control and oversight of public lands by the people that live in \nand around those lands.\n  This bill will provide for the Secretary of the Interior to offer to \ntransfer BLM lands to the States in which they are located. The \nGovernor of the State will then have 2 years in which to make the \ndecision on the future of this land. A Governor can either accept the \ntitle transfer of these lands or they may reject this offer. If \naccepted, then within the following 10 years the Secretary will \ntransfer these lands to the States.\n  What this effectively does, Mr. President, is place control and \noversight of these lands into the hands of those closest to the land. \nThis puts the decisions on the use of this land into the local hands, \nand out of the hands of people that live thousands of miles away. It \nwill provide a better opportunity for all Montanans to have a voice in \nthe future of the public lands in the State.\n  There have been many incidents in Montana where people, outside the \nState, have affected the Federal land policy of land within Montana. \nPeople living in downtown New York City have placed a stamp on an \nenvelope and appealed decisions that effect the people in Montana. This \ngoes against every promise the West ever offered to those who live \nthere. Throughout my tenure in the Senate I have stood strong on one \nbasic philosophy; the people of Montana know what is best for Montana. \nThe best decisions are made at the local level. We do not need a \nFederal land manager in Washington to tell us how to manage our lands. \nThe land managers in the State have a better understanding of the needs \nand the future of the lands in Montana.\n  One of the basic misconceptions that have been expounded on by the \nopponents of this bill is that the sportsmen and other Montanans will \nlose access to the lands. This is far from the truth. Our State lands \nare open to the public, more open than the Federal Government makes \ntheir land.\n  I must assure my fellow Montanans that I would never do anything to \ndeprive them of their rights to hunt or fish or have access to our \nlands. As a founding member of the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus I \nhave fought hard for the sportsmen across the country. The goal of the \ncaucus is to provide more opportunities for all the sportsmen \nthroughout the state and the nation, and I am proud to serve as the \nSenate cochair.\n  As I look at this legislation I would like to ask a couple of \nquestions about the future of public lands. In Montana I wonder who \namong us would like to have the future of our public lands, our access \nto those lands and use of them, determined by Federal land managers in \nWashington? How many of us would prefer to have our neighbors and \nfriends, those people who live in our state determine when and where we \ncan use and have access to the lands?\n  I would like to return debate of this bill to the topic from which it \nhas been built. Local control over local lands and access to lands by \nthe people in the State where the lands are located. Multiple use of \nthe lands by people who understand the concept of multiple use.\n  This is not a bill that sells land to private interests or closes \nland off to the residents of a State. It is a bill which allows each \nand every State that has lands the opportunity to determine the future \nof their lands.\n  I end by restating one belief that I have always held near and dear \nwhen talking about Montana. I stand firm in the fact that Montanans \nmake the best decisions about the future of Montana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/24/senate-section/article/S15572-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, on that evening in 1972 when I first was \nelected to the Senate, I made a commitment to myself that I would never \nfail to see a young person, or a group of young people, who wanted to \nsee me.\n  It has proved enormously beneficial to me because I have been \ninspired by the estimated 60,000 young people with whom I have visited \nduring the nearly 23 years I have been in the Senate.\n  Most of them have been concerned that the total Federal debt which is \n$27 billion shy of $5 trillion, which we will pass this year. Of \ncourse, Congress is responsible of creating this monstrosity for which \nthe coming generations will have to pay.\n  The young people and I almost always discuss the fact that under the \nU.S. Constitution, no President can spend a dime of Federal money that \nhas not first been authorized and appropriated by both the House and \nSenate of the United States.\n  That is why I began making these daily reports to the Senate on \nFebruary 22, 1992. I wanted to make a matter of daily record of the \nprecise size of the Federal debt which as of yesterday, Monday, October \n23, stood at $4,973,904,347,350.96 or $18,881.03 for every man, woman, \nand child in America on a per capita basis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/24/senate-section/article/S15572-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15572-S15573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FOOD QUALITY PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join as a cosponsor of \nS. 1166, the Food Quality Protection Act, introduced by Senator Lugar.\n  This legislation addresses three major issues: the need to ensure \nthat \n\n[[Page S 15573]]\n\ntolerances of pesticides in food safeguard the health of infants and \nchildren; the need to encourage the registration of minor use \npesticides; and the need to repeal the Delaney clause and replace it \nwith a negligible risk standard for pesticide residues in both raw and \nprocessed foods.\n  The Delaney clause was enacted in 1958 as part of the Federal Food, \nDrug, and Cosmetic Act to prohibit any residue of a food additive that \nhas been found to cause cancer, no matter the amount of the risk to \nhuman health. In the intervening years, our ability to detect residues \nhas improved, to the point where we can now detect minute amounts, even \nparts per trillion.\n  Many including the Environmental Protection Agency agree the Delaney \nclause zero risk standard should be replaced with a de minimis \nstandard. In fact, for a number of years, EPA has used a de minimis \nstandard for regulating pesticide residues on food.\n  However, as a result of the court decision in Les versus Reilly and a \nconsent decree in California versus Browner, the Environmental \nProtection Agency will have to strictly enforce the Delaney clause the \nend of this year. Strict enforcement of the Delaney clause will result \nin the cancellation of tolerances of over 100 chemicals used in \nCalifornia agriculture, even if they pose only a negligible risk of one \nin a million additional risk of cancer in a lifetime. In order for \nagriculture to retain use of these chemicals, it is imperative that the \nDelaney clause be replaced with a negligible risk standards that \nprotects human health, including the health of infants and children.\n  S. 1166 replaces the Delaney zero risk standard with a negligible \nrisk standard. EPA has been defining negligible risk as one additional \ncancer for every one million people exposed.\n  The issue of food safety is extraordinarily important both to \nCalifornia agriculture and to the health of 32 million Californians. \nAbout 20 percent of the agricultural chemicals sold in the United \nStates--about 500 billion pounds of chemicals--are used in the State \nannually. California has its own pesticide regulation program and in \nmany cases has stricter standards for pesticides than the national \nstandards.\n  A concern that I have about S. 1166 is that it provides for national \nuniformity and preempts California's more stringent standards. I \nbelieve that States should be able to set tougher standards, and will \nmove an amendment to do so.\n  I will work to improve the bill as it goes forward, and to get a bill \nenacted. It is vital that we reform the Delaney clause this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/24/senate-section/article/S15572-3", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                         enrolled bills signed\n\n  At 6:07 pm., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 1254.

Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, \n     except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have \n     been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or \n     any place subject to their jurisdiction.\n       ``Section 2. Congress shall have power to enforce this \n     article by appropriate legislation.''; and\n       Whereas, Amendment XIII officially became part of the \n     United States Constitution on December 6, 1865, when the \n     General Assembly of the State of Georgia furnished that \n     amendment's pivotal twenty-seventh ratification, there being \n     at the time thirty-six states in the Union; and\n       Whereas, it is common for state legislatures to continue to \n     act upon amendments to the U.S. Constitution well after those \n     amendments have already received a sufficient number of \n     ratifications in order to become part of that document; and\n       Whereas, with specific regard to Amendment XIII, subsequent \n     to the Georgia General Assembly's approval, that amendment \n     was then post-ratified by the legislatures of eight other \n     states which were part of the Union during that era, \n     including that of Delaware in February of 1901, some \n     thirty-five years after Amendment XIII had already been \n     adopted, and that of Kentucky in March of 1976, well over \n     a full century after Amendment XIII had been established \n     as part of our nation's highest law; and\n       Whereas, with respect to Amendment XIII, Mississippi, until \n     now, has been the only state which was part of the Union well \n     before and long after Amendment XIII was proposed and \n     ratified whose legislature has denied approval of that \n     important amendment to the U.S. Constitution; and\n       Whereas, the people of present-day Mississippi strongly \n     condemn the unconscionable practice of slavery and firmly \n     believe that it is fitting and proper that official action be \n     taken now to finally place upon Amendment XIII the special \n     approval of the State of Mississippi: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Mississippi State Senate, the House of \n     Representatives concurring therein, That Amendment XIII to \n     the Constitution of the United States, quoted above and \n     transmitted by resolution of the Thirty-Eighth Congress be, \n     and the same hereby is, post-ratified by the Legislature of \n     the State of Mississippi; be it further\n       Resolved, That Chapter CVIII, General Laws of 1865, in \n     which the Mississippi Legislature, on December 4, 1865, \n     refused to ratify Amendment XIII, is hereby specifically \n     rescinded; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of State of the State of \n     Mississippi transmit properly-attested copies of this \n     concurrent resolution to the Archivist of the United States, \n     pursuant to Pub.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to revise \ncertain authorities relating to management and contracting in the \nprovision of health care services; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n\n\nthe veterans health care management and contracting flexibility act of \n                                  1995\n\n Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, it is a great pleasure for me, as \nchairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, to introduce today \nthe Veterans Health Care Management and Contracting Flexibility Act of \n1995. This legislation, Mr. President, would free the Department of \nVeterans Affairs [VA] from a number of statutory restrictions which \nunnecessarily limit its authority to contract for health care-related \nservices. It would also ease and clarify current reporting requirements \nwhich excessively impede VA's ability to manage its own affairs.\n  What this bill would accomplish is best understood by considering, \nfirst, the health care environment within which all health care \nproviders--including VA--must operate today, and then the state of the \nlaw under which VA attempts to so operate. If there is any certainty \ntoday with respect to health care, it is this: those who pay for health \ncare--whether those payers be State or Federal Government agencies, \ninsurance carriers or health maintenance organizations, or better \ninformed consumers drawing, perhaps some day, from health savings \naccounts or simply from their own bank accounts--will no longer \ntolerate the unrestrained cost inflation that they have been forced to \nput up with in the past. All health care providers, therefore, are \nnow--and will continue to be--under unprecedented pressure to rein in \ncosts and find operating efficiencies so that they can compete in an \nincreasingly cost sensitive environment.\n  In light of these realities, all now agree that health care providers \nmust restrain the growth of--or affirmatively cut--costs. One sure way \nof doing that is to share certain resources--including, but not \nnecessarily limited to, high tech medical resources--lest there be \nwasteful duplications in expenditures and effort within local markets. \nFor example, it has become increasingly common for one hospital or \npractice group to sell, for example, Magnetic Resonance Imaging [MRI] \nservices to another, while buying other diagnostic services from the \nsame purchaser.\n  Like any health care provider, VA medical centers ought to be able to \nshare, buy and swap all sorts of services with other community \nproviders. But they cannot fully capitalize on such opportunities under \ncurrent law.\n  Presently, VA can only share or purchase ``medical'' services. It \ncannot share or purchase other critical services, for example, risk \nassessment services, that all health care providers must either buy or \nprovide ``in house.'' Even within the narrow authority allowing only \n``medical'' services to be shared or purchased, there is an unnecessary \nrestriction. VA cannot purchase or share any medical resource; it can \nonly purchase or share ``specialized'' medical resources.\n  And that is not all, Mr. President; there is further restriction \nimposed upon VA. VA medical centers are not free to purchase from, or \nshare with, any and all health care providers they might find in the \nlocal community. They can only ``partner up'' with--and, here, I quote \nfrom statute--``health-care facilities (including organ banks, blood \nbanks, or similar institutions), research centers, or medical \nschools.'' 38 U.S.C. Sec. 8153. This restrictive legal rubric does not \nextend to VA authority to enter into sensible sharing arrangements with \nother potential partners such as HMOs, insurance carriers or other \n``health plans,'' or with individual physicians or other individual \nservice providers.\n  One provision of my bill, Mr. President, would cut through this legal \nthicket by expanding significantly VA's current sharing authority. In \nsummary, VA would be authorized to share, purchase or swap any \nresources with any local provider. VA could enter into contracts for \nany and all ``health care resources,'' a term which is considerably \nbroader than the ``specialized medical resource'' limitation under \nwhich VA now operates. That term would include such resources, but \nwould also include nonspecialized ``hospital care,'' ``any other \nhealth-care service,'' and any other ``health-care support or \nadministration resource.''\n  Further, VA would be authorized to buy from, or share with, any \n``non-Departmental health care provider''--a term which would include \nthe ``health-care facilities'' and ``research centers and medical \nschools'' with which VA may not contract, but which would also include \nother ``organizations, institutions, or other entities or individuals \nthat furnish health-care resources,'' and also ``health care plans and \ninsurers.''\n\n  Thus, Mr. President, my bill seeks to open up to VA an entire new \nworld of potential sharing partners and sharing opportunities. While VA \nwould not have totally unfettered authority to buy and sell services--\nfor example, VA would be required to ensure that any such arrangements \nnot diminish services made available to its veteran patients--it is my \nintention that VA be freed from restrictions which were applied when VA \ntried to do everything itself ``in-house.'' There was a time, perhaps, \nwhen VA could afford to try to be everything to everyone, but it cannot \ndo so now. No modern provider can afford that mentality today.\n  I note for the Record, Mr. President, that VA has requested the \nexpanded legal authority that I propose today. But it has done so in \nthe context of a much larger bill, S. 1345, that I introduced at VA's \nrequest on October 19, 1995. The main thrust of S. 1345 is so-called \n``eligibility reform,'' that is, a broad scale revision of current \nstatutes defining who shall be eligible for what VA medical services. \nThat issue, Mr. President, is an extremely thorny one inasmuch as, \nlying at its very center, are very difficult judgements about who shall \nhave priority over whom in securing VA health care in a period of \nlimited resources. The Committee on Veterans' Affairs intends to take \nthis critical issue up, but it will take time to sort out conflicting \nclaims to priority to such limited resources. I think we ought to \nproceed now to streamline the statutes that restrict VA's sharing \nauthority--an action which, in my view, can be taken now, and will made \nsense whether or not we are able to accomplish ``eligibility reform.''\n  My bill would do more, Mr. President. As I have pointed out, VA now \nhas authority--though authority that is, in my view, too narrow--to \ncontract for ``specialized medical resources.'' Even so, however, VA \nmedical centers are statutorily barred from ``contracting out'' the \nvery same services. 38 U.S.C. Sec. 8110(c). In addition, they may not \ncontract out activities that are ``incident to direct patient care.'' \nId. Finally, VA medical centers may contract out other ``activities'' \nat VA \n\n[[Page S 15576]]\nmedical centers, for example, grounds' maintenance services--but only \nif VA leaps through a series of substantive and procedural hoops that \nplainly impede the contracting process.\n  Under my reading of the law, it is apparently acceptable, under 38 \nU.S.C. Sec. 8153, for a VA medical center to contract for supplemental \n``specialized'' medical services--let us say anesthesiology services--\nso long as the medical center does not contract out all such services. \nThis distinction, Mr. President, makes no sense to me--and, as I will \ndiscuss in a moment, apparently makes no sense to the Congress any \nlonger. Further, it makes no sense to me that VA cannot contract out \nservices that are ``incident to direct care''--assuming one can \nidentify the legal boundaries of activities that are merely \n``incidental.'' To my way of thinking, if ``direct care'' activities \nought to be shared and purchased without significant restriction--as VA \nespouses in recommending modifications to 38 U.S.C. Sec. 8153--they \nought to be subject to purchase wholly by the medical center through \nthe ``contracting out'' process. And if ``direct care'' activities \nought to be subject to contracting, then, clearly, services that are \n``incidental'' to such activities should be too.\n  Of course, Mr. President, what is true for direct care services--\nservices which go to the core of what VA does--is also true for other \nactivities at VA medical centers: all such activities ought to be \nsubject to contracting if contracting makes economic sense. We can \nafford no other standard. Unnecessary impediments to contracting--such \nas those set up by 38 U.S.C. Sec. 8110(c)--ought to be swept away.\n  As I noted a moment ago, the Congress has apparently come to that \nconclusion already. In the 104th Congress, we suspended application of \nrestrictive aspects of section 8110(c) through fiscal year 1999. See 38 \nU.S.C. Sec. 8110(c)(7). Mr. President, it is clear to us all that VA \nwill not be under less budgetary pressure in the year 2000 than it is \nnow. We ought not to indulge the fiction that VA will be able to afford \nto hold all activities ``in house'' then, if it cannot afford to do so \nnow. In short, we should have repealed section 8110(c) last year--and \nwe ought to do so now.\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, I note another restrictive provision of law \nthat ought to be swept away--or at least narrowed--now. Under current \nlaw, VA is precluded from putting into effect certain field facility \n``administrative reorganizations''--essentially, those which will \nresult in a force reduction of 15 percent or more at any particular \nsite--unless it has first given the Congress 90-days notice computed to \ncount only those days when both Chambers of Congress are in session. 38 \nU.S.C. Sec. 510.\n  Two difficulties arising from this provision of law came into focus \nearlier this year when VA's Under Secretary for Health, Doctor Ken \nKizer, submitted a proposal to reorganize VA's 172 medical centers into \n22 ``Veterans Integrated Service Networks'' [VISNs]. While Doctor Kizer \nhad briefed Congress extensively on his sensible reorganization model \nduring its development, he still had to wait more than 3 months after \nthe announcement of the reorganization before he could, by law, take \nany ``action to carry out such administrative reorganization.'' 38 \nU.S.C. Sec. 510(b). Worse, since the statute specifies that the 90-day \n``notice and wait'' period runs only when both bodies of Congress are \nin session, Id., he--and we--were unable to determine when the 90-day \nnotice would expire since no one was able to know when either body of \nthe Congress might recess.\n  Such obstructionism by the Congress is, in my view, most unfortunate \nand unseemly. I really think that we ought to grant more trust to the \nsenior officials we confirm than is reflected in this statute. Yet, I \nremain sensitive to the Members' needs to know if a field office \nreorganization will adversely affect a significant number of their \nconstituents. Therefore, I do not propose today that this provision of \nlaw be totally repealed. I do propose, however, that we reduce the \n``notice and wait'' period to 45 calendar days. That period, I believe, \nis sufficient to allow Senators and House Members an opportunity to \nassess the impact of a given reorganization on their constituents.\n  To recap, Mr. President, my bill would expand VA's authority to \nshare, purchase and swap resources, as is necessary to meet the \nchallenges of 21st century medicine. And it would remove an excessive \nrestriction on VA's right to organize and station its employees \nefficiently. These measures are dictated by common sense and are, in \nthe main, supported by VA. I request the support of this body.\n  I request unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1359\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to ensure personal privacy with respect to medical \nrecords and health care-related information, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n            the medical records confidentiality act of 1995\n\n Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Medical \nRecords Confidentiality Act of 1995. This legislation is one of the \nmany small steps that are needed to reform our health care system. I am \npleased that a number of my Republican and Democratic colleagues have \njoined me in cosponsoring this legislation.\n\n[[Page S 15577]]\n\n  I can think of few other areas in our lives that are more personal \nand private than is our medical history. Each of us has a relationship \nwith our doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and other health care \nprofessionals that is unique and privileged. They may know things about \nus that we choose not to tell our spouses, children, siblings, parents, \nor our closest friends. While our medical records may contain nothing \nout of the ordinary, to us these records should be strictly personal.\n  S. 1360 aims, first, to provide Americans with greater control over \ntheir medical records in terms of confidentiality, access, and \nsecurity, and second, to provide the health care system with a Federal \nstandard for handling identifiable health information.\n  Most Americans believe their medical records are protected in terms \nof confidentiality under Federal law. Most Americans are mistaken. \nProtecting the confidentiality of our medical records is an expectation \nthat is yet to be guaranteed as a right. This legislation is an \nopportunity for Congress to act in a bipartisan manner to resolve an \nimportant problem within our health care system. Today over 80 percent \nof our medical records are paper based; however, in the not too distant \nfuture all of our medical records will be electronic based.\n  In my opinion and in the opinion of a number of outside groups such \nas the Center for Democracy and Technology, American Health Information \nManagement Association, International Business Machines Corporation, \nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association, and the American Hospital \nAssociation, it is time to put into place the safeguards and security \nmeasures needed to protect the integrity and confidentiality of our \nmedical records.\n  Patients should be assured that the treatment they receive is \na matter between themselves and their doctor, regardless if it's a \nyearly physical, psychiatric evaluation, plastic surgery, or cancer \ntreatment. The majority of patients agree that treatment and billing \nare the two appropriate uses of medical records. This legislation \nprovides patients the right to limit disclosure of medical records for \npurposes other than treatment and billing and requires separate \nauthorization forms for treatment, billing and other kinds of \ndisclosures. It also requires providers to keep a record of those to \nwhom they disclose information.\n\n  In the hospital, most patients are unaware that their records are \naccessible to almost any health care provider walking into their room \nor almost any hospital employee with a computer who can gain access to \nthe hospital's computer system. There are a number of doctors and \nnurses who refuse to be treated in the hospital where they practice \nmedicine because they know that with a stroke of a keyboard their \ncolleagues will know why they are in the hospital and know they are \nbeing treated.\n  One of the most important issues this legislation addresses is that \nof access to personal medical records. It is difficult for most of us \nto understand that in many instances individuals may have great \ndifficulty gaining access to their own medical records. There are no \nFederal laws regarding access to medical records and only a few States \nallow patients the right to review and copy their medical records. In \nmany instances, if the medical record is incorrect the patient never \nhas the opportunity to address those errors. This legislation would \nallow individuals not only access to their records but also the \nopportunity to address any errors.\n  This legislation will enable organizations and entities involved in \nproviding health care, or who act as contractors or agents to \nproviders, to abide by one standard for confidentiality. Our health \ncare system grows more complex and sophisticated with each year. Having \none standard will simplify the business of health care, reduce the cost \nof complying with 50 state standards and allow the continuation of \nresearch that will improve the efficiency of our health care system.\n  Currently, the only protection of medical records is under state \nlaws. At this time there are 34 States with 34 different laws to \nprotect these records. Only 28 States provide patients with access to \ntheir medical records. My own State of Utah does not have a \ncomprehensive law to protect medical records or provide access. Given \nthe transient nature of our society and that fact that more than 50 \npercent of the population live on a State boarder, it is vital that \nwe provide a national standard for the protection of medical records.\n\n  It is unfair to both the patients and the providers of medical \nservices not to clearly and concisely outline the rights of the patient \nand define the standards of disclosure. The effort to provide Federal \nprotection of medical records has continued for the last 20 years. Many \nof the outside groups that have provided assistance to me and my staff \nhave been involved for many of these years. Those groups that have \nprovided assistance include patient right advocates, health care \nproviders, electronic data services, insurance companies, health \nresearchers, States, health record managers--to name just a few. I am \ngrateful to them for their assistance and expertise; without their \nefforts we would not be here today.\n  I want to express my appreciation to the two leaders, Senators Dole \nand Daschle for their support as cosponsors. I am very pleased to have \nChairwoman Kassebaum and the ranking minority member, Senator Kennedy \nof Labor and Human Resources Committee as cosponsors. I want to express \nmy appreciation to Senator Leahy for his efforts on this legislation. \nHe has been a supporter of this legislation for a number of years and I \nappreciate his cosponsorship I am also pleased to add Senators Hatch, \nFrist, Jeffords, Stevens, Gregg, Simon, Kohl, and Feingold as original \ncosponsors. I hope the Senate will act swiftly to hold hearings and to \nmove this legislation through the committee process to the Senate floor \nfor final consideration. I would urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation and would welcome their cosponsorship.\n Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator \nBennett, the distinguished majority leader, Senators Hatch, Kennedy, \nFrist, Leahy, Simon, and others in introducing the Medical Records \nConfidentiality Act of 1995.\n  We have spent a great deal of time and energy these last several \nmonths--and will spend even more time during the coming weeks--debating \nchanges to the Medicare and Medicaid programs. As we debate these \nchanges, the private health care system continues to literally \ntransform itself overnight.\n  While health providers still wrestle with multiple paper forms and \nbulky files, increasingly health information and data is digitally \ntransmitted to multiple databases by high-speed computers over fiber-\noptic networks. Many Americans believe their private medical records \nare safely stored in doctors' offices and hospitals. Yet, the evolving \nhealth care delivery system and the technological infrastructure \nnecessary to support it has left gaping holes in the patchwork of \ncurrent State privacy laws and threatened the confidentiality of \nprivate medical information.\n  Let me give just one example that highlights both the promise and the \nperil of medical information. Recent advances have allowed researchers \nto identify a growing number of genetic characteristics that place \nindividuals at higher-than-average risk for developing disease. While \ngenetic research provides tremendous opportunities to help us better \ntreat and manage illness, disclosure of genetic information also may \nplace individuals at a greater risk of discrimination in obtaining \nhealth coverage for themselves and their families.\n  The Medical Records Confidentiality Act takes a balanced approach to \nencouraging the continued development of a world-class health \ninformation infrastructure while, at the same time, assuring Americans \nthat their sensitive medical records are protected. The legislation is \ndesigned to provide all patients with Federal safeguards for their \nmedical records, whether in paper or electronic form, and to provide \ndoctors, hospitals, insurance companies, managed care companies, and \nother entities that have access to medical records with clear Federal \nrules governing when and to whom they may disclose health information.\n  Mr. President, I applaud Senator Bennett for taking on such a complex \nand important issue. I look forward to working with him, and with my \ncolleagues on the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, to see \n\n\n[[Page S 15578]]\nthat this very important piece of legislation is enacted during the \n104th Congress.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I join in introducing the Medical \nRecords Confidentiality Act of 1995, with Senator Bennett, our \ndistinguished colleague from Utah.\n  For the past several years, I have been engaged in efforts to make \nsure that Americans' expectations of privacy for their medical records \nare fulfilled. That is the purpose of this bill.\n  I do not want advancing technology to lead to a loss of personal \nprivacy and do not want the fear that confidentiality is being \ncompromised to stifle technological or scientific development.\n  The distinguished Republican majority leader put his finger on this \nproblem last year when he remarked that a compromise of privacy that \nsends information about health and treatment to a national data bank \nwithout a person's approval would be something that none of us would \naccept. We should proceed without further delay to enact meaningful \nprotection for our medical records and personal and confidential health \ncare information.\n  I have long felt that health care reform will only be supported by \nthe American people if they are assured that the personal privacy of \ntheir health care information is protected. Indeed, without confidence \nthat one's personal privacy will be protected, many will be discouraged \nfrom seeking help from our health care system or taking advantage of \nthe accessibility that we are working so hard to protect.\n  The American public cares deeply about protecting their privacy. This \nhas been demonstrated recently in the American Civil Liberties Union \nFoundation's benchmark survey on privacy entitled ``Live and Let Live'' \nwherein three out of four people expressed particular concern about \ncomputerized medical records held in databases used without the \nindividual's consent. A public opinion poll sponsored by Equifax and \nconducted by Louis Harris indicated that 85 percent of those surveyed \nagreed that protecting the confidentiality of medical records is \nextremely important in national health care reform. I can assure you \nthat if that poll had been taken in Vermont, it would have come in at \n100 percent or close to it.\n  Two years ago, I began a series of hearings before the Technology and \nthe Law Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee. I explored the \nemerging smart card technology and opportunities being presented to \ndeliver better and more efficient health care services, especially in \nrural areas. Technology can expedite care in medical emergencies and \neliminate paperwork burdens. But it will only be accepted if it is used \nin a secure system protecting confidentiality of sensitive medical \nconditions and personal privacy. Fortunately, improved technology \noffers the promise of security and confidentiality and can allow levels \nof access limited to information necessary to the function of the \nperson in the health care treatment and payment system.\n  In January 1994, we continued our hearings before that Judiciary \nSubcommittee and heard testimony from the Clinton administration, \nhealth care providers and privacy advocates about the need to improve \nupon privacy protections for medical records and personal health care \ninformation.\n  In testimony I found among the most moving I have experienced in more \nthan 20 years in the Senate, the subcommittee heard first hand from \nRepresentative Nydia Velazquez, our House colleague who had sensitive \nmedical information leaked about her. She and her parents woke up to \nfind disclosure of her attempted suicide smeared across the front pages \nof the New York tabloids. If any of us have reason to doubt how hurtful \na loss of medical privacy can be, we need only talk to our House \ncolleague.\n  Unfortunately, this is not the only horrific story of a loss of \npersonal privacy. I have talked with the widow of Arthur Ashe about her \nfamily's trauma when her husband was forced to confirm publicly that he \ncarried the AIDS virus and how the family had to live its ordeal in the \nglare of the media spotlight.\n  We have also heard testimony from Jeffrey Rothfeder who described in \nhis book ``Privacy for Sale'' how a freelance artist was denied health \ncoverage by a number of insurance companies because someone had \nerroneously written in his health records that he was HIV-positive.\n  The unauthorized disclosure and misuse of personal medical \ninformation have affected insurance coverage, employment opportunities, \ncredit, reputation, and a host of services for thousands of Americans. \nLet us not miss this opportunity to set the matter right through \ncomprehensive Federal privacy protection legislation.\n  As I began focusing on privacy and security needs, I was shocked to \nlearn how catch-as-catch-can is the patchwork of State laws protecting \nprivacy of personally identifiable medical records. A few years ago we \npassed legislation protecting records of our videotape rentals, but we \nhave yet to provide even that level of privacy protection for our \npersonal and sensitive health care data.\n  Just yesterday the Commerce Department released a report on Privacy \nand the NII. In addition to financial and other information discussed \nin that report, there is nothing more personal than our health care \ninformation. We must act to apply the principles of notice and consent \nto this sensitive, personal information.\n  Now is the time to accept the challenge and legislate so that the \nAmerican people can have some assurance that their medical histories \nwill not be the subject of public curiosity, commercial advantage or \nharmful disclosure. There can be no doubt that the increased \ncomputerization of medical information has raised the stakes in privacy \nprotection, but my concern is not limited to electronic files.\n  As policymakers, we must remember that the right to privacy is one of \nour most cherished freedoms--it is the right to be left alone and to \nchoose what we will reveal of ourselves and what we will keep from \nothers. Privacy is not a partisan issue and should not be made a \npolitical issue. It is too important.\n  I am encouraged by the fact that the Clinton administration clearly \nunderstands that health security must include assurances that personal \nhealth information will be kept private, confidential and secure from \nunauthorized disclosure. Early on the administration's health care \nreform proposals provided that privacy and security guidelines would be \nrequired for computerized medical records. The administration's Privacy \nWorking Group of its NII task force has been concerned with the \nformulation of principles to protect our privacy. In these regards, the \nPresident is to be commended.\n  The difficulties I had with the initial provisions of the Health \nSecurity Act, were the delay in Congress' consideration of \ncomprehensive privacy legislation for several more years and the lack \nof a criminal penalty for unauthorized disclosure of someone's medical \nrecords.\n  Accordingly, back in May 1994, I introduced a bill to provide a \ncomprehensive framework for protecting the privacy of our medical \nrecords from the outset rather than on a delayed basis. That bill was \nthe Health Care Privacy Protection Act of 1994, S. 2129. I was \ndelighted to receive support from a number of diverse quarters. We were \nable to incorporate provisions drawn from last year's Health Care \nPrivacy Protection bill into those reported by the Labor and Human \nResources Committee and the Finance Committee. These provisions were, \nlikewise, incorporated in Senator Dole's bill and Senator Mitchell's \nbills, indicating that the leadership in both parties acknowledges the \nfundamental importance of privacy.\n  Although Congress failed in its attempt to enact meaningful health \ncare reform last Congress, we can and should proceed with privacy \nprotection--whether or not a comprehensive health care reform package \nis resurrected this year. I am proud to say that the Medical Records \nConfidentiality Act that Senator Bennett and I are introducing today, \nderives from the work we have been doing over the last several years. I \nam delighted to have contributed to this measure and look forward to \nour bipartisan coalition working for enactment of these important \nprivacy protections.\n  Our bill establishes in law the principle that a person's health \ninformation is to be protected and to be kept confidential. It creates \nboth criminal \n\n[[Page S 15579]]\nand civil remedies for invasions of privacy for a person's health care \ninformation and medical records and administrative remedies, such as \ndebarment for health care providers who abuse others' privacy.\n  This legislation would provide patients with a comprehensive set of \nrights of inspection and an opportunity to correct their own records, \nas well as information accounting for disclosures of those records.\n  The bill creates a set of rules and norms to govern the disclosure of \npersonal health information and narrows the sharing of personal details \nwithin the health care system to the minimum necessary to provide care, \nallow for payment and to facilitate effective oversight. Special \nattention is paid to emergency medical situations, public health \nrequirements, and research.\n  We have sought to accommodate legitimate oversight concerns so that \nwe do not create unnecessary impediments to health care fraud \ninvestigations. Effective health care oversight is essential if our \nhealth care system is to function and fulfill its intended goals. \nOtherwise, we risk establishing a publicly sanctioned playground for \nthe unscrupulous. Health care is too important a public investment to \nbe the subject of undetected fraud or abuse.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues both here in the Senate \nand in the House as we continue to refine this legislation. I want to \nthank all of those who have been working with us on the issue of health \ninformation privacy and, in particular, wish to commend the Vermont \nHealth Information Consortium, the Center for Democracy and Technology, \nthe American Health Information Management Association, the American \nAssociation of Retired Persons, the AIDS Action Council, the Bazelon \nCenter for Mental Health Law, the Legal Action Center, IBM Corp. and \nthe Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association for their tireless efforts \nin working to achieve a significant consensus on this important matter.\n  With Senator Bennett's leadership and the longstanding commitment to \npersonal privacy shared by Chairman Kassebaum and Senator Kennedy, I \nhave every confidence that the Senate will proceed to pass strong \nprivacy protection for medical records. With continuing help from the \nadministration, health care providers and privacy advocates we can \nenact provisions to protect the privacy of the medical records of the \nAmerican people and make this part of health care security a reality \nfor all Americans.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN (for himself, Mr. Cochran and Mr. Simpson):\n  S.J.

I \nintroduce these Joint-resolutions on behalf of my distinguished \ncolleagues, Senators Cochran and Simpson, with whom I have the \nprivilege to serve on the Smithsonian's Board of Regents.\n  Howard Baker, whose reputation is well known among the Members of \nthis body, is a superb public servant. After spending 18 illustrious \nyears in the Senate, during which time he served 4 years as Majority \nLeader, Senator Baker went on to become President Reagan's most trusted \nadvisor. He has since returned to private practice, as the senior \npartner in the law firm of Baker, Donelson, Bearman & Caldwell, but has \nremained an active leader in the political and business communities. \nHis commitment to both communities is marked by his membership on the \nCouncil on Foreign Relations and the Washington Institute of Foreign \nAffairs and his positions on the boards of Federal Express, United \nTechnologies, and Penzoil. He has most deservedly received the Nation's \nhighest civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, as well as \nthe Jefferson Award for Greatest Public Service Performed by an Elected \nor Appointed Official.\n  As the distinguished statesman and gifted strategist that he is, \nHoward Baker would bring to the Smithsonian a voice that can talk to \nCongress at a time when that is what is most urgently needed. The \nInstitution would benefit immensely from his political and fiscal \nwisdom, and I urge my colleagues to support his appointment.\n  Just as Senator Baker would add his expertise on matters political \nand economic, Ms. Anne D'Harnoncourt would bring to the Smithsonian \nvast experience in the management and oversight of a large museum. \nHaving served with her for some 15 years on the Board of the Hirshorn \nMuseum, I can think of no person better suited to serve on the Board of \nRegents.\n  Ms. D'Harnoncourt has served as an Assistant Curator for the Art \nInstitute of Chicago, a Curator for the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and \nis currently the George D. Widener Director of the Philadelphia Museum \nof Art. She has a broad base of expertise in the Arts, and is among the \nmost actively involved in that community. As the Smithsonian continues \nto broaden its mission within the Sciences, Ms. D'Harnoncourt surely \nwould help the Institution remain focused on its long-standing \ncommitment to the Arts. Her knowledge and experience would be of \ninestimable value to the Board of Regents, and I eagerly urge her \nappointment.\n  Finally, Louis V. Gerstner, Jr., a gifted leader in the business and \neducational communities. Mr. Gerstner was named chairman and chief \nexecutive officer of International Business Machines Corporation on \nApril 1, 1993, prior to which he served for 4 years as chairman and \nchief executive officer of RJR Nabisco Inc. He received his B.A. from \nDartmouth College in 1963, his M.B.A. from Harvard Business School in \n1965, and was awarded an honorary doctorate of Business Administration \nfrom Boston College in 1994.\n  Mr. Gerstner has long been an advocate of improving the quality of \npublic education in America. He is the co-author of ``Re-Inventing \nEducation: Entrepreneurship in America's Public Schools'' (Dutton, \n1994), which documents public school reforms designed to enable our \nchildren to handle the demands of today's complex global economy. At \nIBM he has re-directed a majority of the company's substantial \nphilanthropic resources to support public school reform. His dedication \nto re-inventing both education and management makes him an ideal \ncandidate to serve on the Smithsonian's Board of Regents.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will agree that this profoundly \ntalented triumvirate is most deserving of these appointments, and I \nurge Senators to support all three resolutions.\n Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators \nMoynihan and Simpson in introducing joint resolutions providing for the \nappointment of Howard H. Baker, Jr., Anne d'Harnoncourt, and Louis V. \nGerstner, Jr., as Citizen Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.\n  Howard Baker is a distinguished public servant well known in this \nbody. He was a Senator from Tennessee from 1967 to 1985, serving as \nMinority Leader from 1977 to 1981 and as Majority Leader from 1981 to \n1985. He was Chief of Staff to President Reagan in 1987 and 1988 before \nreturning to the private practice of law. He has received the Nation's \nhighest civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, as well as \nthe Jefferson Award for Greatest Public Service Performed by an Elected \nor Appointed Official.\n  Anne d'Harnoncourt is currently the George D. Widener Director of the \nPhiladelphia Museum of Art, having previously served that museum as \nCurator of Twentieth Century Art and as Assistant Curator of Twentieth \nCentury Art at the Art Institute of Chicago. A Fellow of the American \nAcademy of Arts and Sciences, she is a member of numerous advisory \ncommittees and boards, including the Board of Directors of The Henry \nLuce Foundation and the Board of Overseers of the \n\n[[Page S 15580]]\nGraduate School of Fine Arts of the University of Pennsylvania.\n  Louis V. Gerstner, Jr., is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of \nInternational Business Machines Corp. He previously served as chairman \nand chief executive officer of RJR Nabisco and as president of American \nExpress Company. He is a director of The New York Times Company, \nBristol-Myers Squibb Company, the Japan Society, and Lincoln Center for \nthe Performing Arts. A lifetime advocate of the importance of quality \neducation, he has redirected a majority of IBM's substantial \nphilanthropic resources in the United States to the support of public \nschool reform.\n  I urge Senators to support the resolutions of appointment of these \noutstanding Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. President, this past August, Indonesia, a \nlongtime Asian friend and ally of the United States marked 50 years of \nindependence. Over those 50 years, the United States has been able to \ncount on this strong ally for support in a wide range of areas, \nincluding its anti-Communist commitment, its support during the Vietnam \nwar, its backing for United States and United Nations operations in \ncountries such as Somalia and Cambodia, and its role in advancing trade \nliberalization in the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC].\n  Over the past 25 years, under the direction of President Soeharto, \nthis nation of 13,000 islands and 198 million people has achieved some \nof the most impressive economic growth the world has seen. Let me give \nyou some numbers to emphasize this point: a 7-percent average annual \ngrowth in the GDP since 1967, an increase in the per capita GNP from \nless than $70 in 1967 to almost $900 today, a life expectancy rate that \nhas risen from 41 in 1967 to 61 in 1992, and a dramatic decrease in \nboth the infant mortality rate and illiteracy rate.\n  The Government of Indonesia is continuing to move ahead with \naggressive and impressive projects to develop further the nation's \nquality of life, its infrastructure, and its capabilities and \ncompetitiveness for the next millennium. Over the next 5 years, these \nprojects include: increasing the telephone penetration in the country \nby 8 million lines; increasing power generation by 11,000 megawatts; \nimplementing a $13 billion basic transportation infrastructure program \nthat will touch almost every sector, including, ports, airports, \nrailways, roadways and a rail system through the city of Jakarta; and a \nwater and sanitation plan to bring clean water to a larger portion of \nthe population.\n  In all, the country is looking at approximately $53 billion in new \nworks and heavy maintenance, engineering and support systems \ndevelopment over the next 5 years.\n  I think my colleagues would agree with me that this is an impressive \nprogram of development.\n  As these projects move forward, the Government of Indonesia is also \nworking to make the country an easier place to do business by \nstreamlining investment regulations and removing import license \nrequirements; thus making it easier for foreign firms to participate in \nthis booming market's economy.\n  And for anyone who questions whether the changes and opportunities \ncreated in this environment have benefited U.S. business, the answer is \nyes. In fact U.S. firms have reacted emphatically with exports from the \nU.S. rising 113 percent--from $2.3 billion in 1989 to $4.9 billion in \n1994. For the U.S. economy that means that more than 95,000 jobs are \nsupported by exports to Indonesia. And the United States Government has \nparticipated in supporting United States industries' interest in \nIndonesia by naming this emerging Asian tiger one of the 10 big \nemerging markets [BEM] for economic growth and by opening one of the \nfirst overseas U.S. Export Assistance Centers in Jakarta.\n\n  As Indonesia has gained a growing presence in the economic arena, \nPresident Soeharto has also brought the country into a more active role \nin the international community. As chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement \n[NAM], Mr. Soeharto has been a moderating voice in the developing world \non the benefits of an active dialog between developed and lesser \ndeveloped countries. Indonesia has also taken a leading role in \npromoting peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region. From its role \nin helping to settle the Cambodian conflict, where Indonesians made up \none of the largest U.N. peacekeeping contingencies, to its efforts to \nestablish an Asia dialog to settle the Spratly Islands territorial \ndispute, President Soeharto's efforts have been instrumental in helping \npromote harmony in a rapidly evolving region.\n  In recognition of his tireless efforts to bring economic prosperity \nto Indonesia while also engaging the country in a prominent \ninternational political role, President and Mrs. Soeharto are being \nhonored later this week in Washington at a dinner hosted by CARE. It is \nan honor they richly deserve.\n  The strong relationship between the United States and Indonesia is \nindeed a benefit for both our countries. We both have prospered and \ncontinue to prosper from our close ties and common interests.\n  I think I also speak for many of my colleagues when I say that the \nachievements and growth of Indonesia over the past 25 years are truly \nimpressive by any standards. I congratulate President Soeharto and the \npeople of Indonesia on the many achievements they have made since \nindependence and wish them continued success for the next 50 years.\n  I am confident that the strong relationship between our two great \nnations will continue not only for the next 50 years but well \nbeyond.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/24/senate-section/article/S15582-3", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S 15583]]\n\n\n          THE AMERICAN JOBS AND MANUFACTURING PRESERVATION ACT\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise as an original cosponsor and \nstrong supporter of Senator Dorgan's bill, the ``American Jobs and \nManufacturing Preservation Act.''\n  Mr. President, many people in Washington talk about cutting corporate \nwelfare. But my colleague from North Dakota has actually written \nlegislation that will cut corporate welfare by $1.5 billion over the \nnext 5 years. I applaud his commitment to ending corporate welfare as \nwe know it.\n  Over the years, big business and other special interests have lobbied \nhard for tax subsidies for specific industries. And, unfortunately, \nthey have been successful on occasion. These wasteful special interest \ntax subsidies do not increase economic growth. To the contrary, \nwasteful special interest tax subsidies only add to our deficit, which \nputs a drag on our whole economy.\n  Like an old-fashioned pork sausage, it is amazing what is actually in \nour Internal Revenue Code. This bill repeals one of the most infamous \nexamples of ``corporate pork'' in our tax laws today--the tax deferral \non income of controlled foreign corporations .\n  Our tax laws allow U.S. firms to delay tax on income earned by their \nforeign subsidiaries until the profit is transferred to the United \nStates Many U.S. multinational corporations naturally drag their feet \nwhen transferring profits back to their corporate headquarters to take \nadvantage of this special tax break. But the millions of small business \nowners--who make up over 95 percent of businesses in my home State of \nVermont--do not have the luxury of paying their taxes later by parking \nprofits in a foreign subsidiary.\n  The American Jobs and Manufacturing Preservation Act closes this tax \nloophole by taking aim at past abuses. It would end the tax deferral \nwhere U.S. multinationals produce abroad and then ship those same \nproducts back to the United States As a result, the bill terminates the \ncurrent tax incentive for corporations to ship jobs overseas.\n  The Progressive Policy Institute, a middle-of-the-road think tank, \nalong with the liberal Center On Budget And Policy Priorities and the \nconservative Cato Institute, have all recommended that Congress repeal \nthe tax deferral on income of controlled foreign corporations. Budget \nexperts on the right, center, and left all agree that this tax deferral \nis a pork-barrel tax loophole just as wasteful as pork-barrel programs.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the American Jobs and \nManufacturing Preservation Act. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/24/senate-section/article/S15583-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CONGRATULATING DR.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Dr. \nSam Williams, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Williams \nInternational, on his winning the 1995 Medal of Technology. This medal \nis given by the U.S. Department of Commerce in recognition of Dr. \nWilliams' unequaled achievements as a gifted inventor, tenacious \nentrepreneur, risk-taker and engineering genius in making the United \nStates of America No. 1 in small gas turbine engine technology and \ncompetitiveness, and for his leadership and vision in revitalizing the \nU.S. general aviation business, jet and trainer jet aircraft industry.\n  I can think of no one who deserves this recognition more than Dr. \nWilliams. He pioneered the design and development of small gas turbine \nengines at a time when most companies were preoccupied with developing \nlarger engines. He blazed a new trail by developing engines for small, \nlower cost aircraft, missiles, and unmanned vehicles such as the Tacit \nRainbow and TSSAM.\n  And Dr. Williams did not stop there. He led the design and \ndevelopment of the FJ44 turbofan engine; an engine that makes possible \na new class of lightweight business jet aircraft and new low-cost \nmilitary and civil trainers.\n  Dr. Williams has contributed greatly to America's technological \nadvancements, to our defense and to our provision of good jobs to our \ncitizens. He has brought numerous high paying, long lasting jobs to the \nDetroit metropolitan area and his continued success promises continued \nadvancement for America's technology and her workers. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/24/senate-section/article/S15583-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15583-S15584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             UNITED STATES POLICY ON HUMAN RIGHTS IN CHINA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this week President Clinton will be \nmeeting in New York with Chinese President Jiang Zemin. We can recall \nthat about this time last year, in Indonesia, President Clinton also \nmet with Jiang Zemin; going into that meeting the President declared: \n``the United States, perhaps more than any other country in the world, \nconsistently and regularly raises human rights issues.'' I expect that \nin the reports coming out of this latest meeting we will hear that \nPresident Clinton once again took issue with the Chinese leadership for \nthe egregious abuse of human rights in China.\n  I only wish, Mr. President, that a result of these exchanges would be \nan improvement in China's human rights record. Unfortunately, there has \nbeen little change in Chinese behavior in this regard.\n  We can begin by reading the administration's own State Department \nHuman Rights Report, which acknowledges that in 1994 ``widespread and \nwell-documented'' human rights abuses continued unabated and that in \nmany respects the situation ``has deteriorated.'' We can recall the \nhighly publicized case of American human rights activist Harry Wu, \nimprisoned by the Chinese Government only months after the November \n1994 Clinton-Jiang Zemin meeting. Wu, subsequently expelled by the \nChinese Government, has worked for years to document and expose \nhorrific practices such as the harvest of body parts from executed \nprisoners for use in transplants.\n  If Wu--a citizen of the world's only remaining superpower and a \ncountry whose riches, technological expertise and markets are needed by \nthe Chinese Government--could be treated with such impunity, how can it \nbe for the Chinese human rights proponent who is laboring in relative \nanonymity? In the past year Human Rights Watch/Asia reports that \nseveral activists have disappeared, others sent into internal exile, \nand still others detained while their houses were ransacked for the \nsimple crime of speaking out in favor of political openness. \nFurthermore, two prominent dissidents who were released just prior to \nthe 1994 decision on MFN, Wei Jeisheing and Chen Zemin, are back in \ncustody: at least, we assume Wei Jeisheing is in custody--he has been \nmissing since April of this year.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the lack of progress on human rights is \nattributed to the fact that U.S. actions have been inconsistent with \nthe spoken principle. Rather than seek to impose a cost on China for \nits abuse, rewards are bestowed on the leadership. I refer, of course, \nof the renewal in June of most-favored-nation [MFN] status for China. \nThe President's announcement continued what I believe to be an ill-\nconsidered abandonment of a policy linking MFN status--or other \neconomic benefit--for China to an improvement of its human rights \nsituation. The administration argued that U.S. business investment and \noverall improved economic ties would lead the Chinese in the right \ndirection on human rights. In fact, the Chinese leadership appears to \nhave taken the exact opposite lesson: that the United States puts \ncorporate interests, market access, and profits before fundamental \nrights.\n  Mr. President, we have in MFN a weapon that the Chinese fear. \nWhenever it appears that its status is in question, they cancel high-\nlevel official contacts. They threaten to limit the access of American \ncorporations lusting after a potentially huge market. Why are the \nChinese so visceral in their reaction? The $20 billion trade surplus \nChina has with us, a surplus it uses to continue financing its economic \ndevelopment, might have something to do with it.\n  It is clear that the Chinese care deeply about this trade \nrelationship and the benefits it brings to their economy. We have \nleverage, and we should use it to oppose egregious human rights abuses, \n\n\n[[Page S 15584]]\nsuch as slave labor, torture, and disappearances of Chinese citizens.\n  President Clinton did this effectively earlier this year when, in \nresponse to flagrant Chinese piracy violations against United States \ncompanies, President Clinton threatened to slap $1.1 billion worth of \ntrade sanctions on China. Rather than face economic retaliation, the \nChinese immediately promised to make statutory changes to address this \nproblem. I am proud that the United States was willing to stand up for \nour software industry; it should do the same for human beings.\n  This is one of the reasons I introduced legislation in July to revoke \nMFN status from China because of its human rights record. We have had \nstrong bipartisan support for linking MFN and human rights in the past. \nTaking that action will get Chinese attention in a concrete manner, in \na way that words have not and cannot, and I renew my call to have such \na resolution passed and supported by the administration.\n  Alternatively, I would welcome another strategy the administration \ncould put forth for how human rights can be more effectively protected \nand promoted in China. Clearly, raising the issue has not been \nsuccessful.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The economy of Cuba has experienced a decline of \n     approximately 60 percent in the last 5 years as a result of--\n       (A) the reduction in subsidies from the former Soviet \n     Union;\n       (B) 36 years of Communist tyranny and economic \n     mismanagement by the Castro government;\n       (C) the precipitous decline in trade between Cuba and the \n     countries of the former Soviet bloc; and\n       (D) the policy of the Russian Government and the countries \n     of the former Soviet bloc to conduct economic relations with \n     Cuba predominantly on commercial terms.\n       (2) At the same time, the welfare and health of the Cuban \n     people have substantially deteriorated as a result of Cuba's \n     economic decline and the refusal of the Castro regime to \n     permit free and fair democratic elections in Cuba or to adopt \n     any economic or political reforms that would lead to \n     democracy, a market economy, or an economic recovery.\n       (3) The repression of the Cuban people, including a ban on \n     free and fair democratic elections and the continuing \n     violation of fundamental human rights, has isolated the Cuban \n     regime as the only nondemocratic government in the Western \n     Hemisphere.\n       (4) As long as no such economic or political reforms are \n     adopted by the Cuban Government, the economic condition of \n     the country and the welfare of the Cuban people will not \n     improve in any significant way.\n       (5) Fidel Castro has defined democratic pluralism as \n     ``pluralistic garbage'' and has made clear that he has no \n     intention of permitting free and fair democratic elections in \n     Cuba or otherwise tolerating the democratization of Cuban \n     society.\n       (6) The Castro government, in an attempt to retain absolute \n     political power, continues to utilize, as it has from its \n     inception, torture in various forms (including psychiatric \n     abuse), execution, exile, confiscation, political \n     imprisonment, and other forms of terror and repression as \n     most recently demonstrated by the massacre of more than 40 \n     Cuban men, women, and children attempting to flee Cuba.\n       (7) The Castro government holds hostage in Cuba innocent \n     Cubans whose relatives have escaped the country.\n       (8) The Castro government has threatened international \n     peace and security by engaging in acts of armed subversion \n     and terrorism, such as the training and supplying of groups \n     dedicated to international violence.\n       (9) Over the past 36 years, the Cuban Government has posed \n     a national security threat to the United States.\n       (10) The completion and any operation of a nuclear-powered \n     facility in Cuba, for energy generation or otherwise, poses \n     an unacceptable threat to the national security of the United \n     States.\n       (11) The unleashing on United States shores of thousands of \n     Cuban refugees fleeing Cuban oppression will be considered an \n     act of aggression.\n       (12) The Government of Cuba engages in illegal \n     international narcotics trade and harbors fugitives from \n     justice in the United States.\n       (13) The totalitarian nature of the Castro regime has \n     deprived the Cuban people of any peaceful means to improve \n     their condition and has led thousands of Cuban citizens to \n     risk or lose their lives in dangerous attempts to escape from \n     Cuba to freedom.\n       (14) Attempts to escape from Cuba and courageous acts of \n     defiance of the Castro regime by Cuban pro-democracy and \n     human rights groups have ensured the international \n     community's continued awareness of, and concern for, the \n     plight of Cuba.\n       (15) The Cuban people deserve to be assisted in a decisive \n     manner in order to end the tyranny that has oppressed them \n     for 36 years.\n       (16) Radio Marti and Television Marti have been effective \n     vehicles for providing the people of Cuba with news and \n     information and have helped to bolster the morale of the \n     Cubans living under tyranny.\n       (17) The consistent policy of the United States towards \n     Cuba since the beginning of the Castro regime, carried out by \n     both Democratic and Republican administrations, has sought to \n     keep faith with the people of Cuba, and has been effective in \n     isolating the totalitarian Castro regime.\n     \n[[Page S 15585]]\n\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to assist the Cuban people in regaining their freedom \n     and prosperity, as well as in joining the community of \n     democratic countries that are flourishing in the Western \n     Hemisphere;\n       (2) to strengthen international sanctions against the \n     Castro government;\n       (3) to provide for the continued national security of the \n     United States in the face of continuing threats from the \n     Castro government of terrorism, theft of property from United \n     States nationals, and the political manipulation of the \n     desire of Cubans to escape that results in mass migration to \n     the United States;\n       (4) to encourage the holding of free and fair democratic \n     elections in Cuba, conducted under the supervision of \n     internationally recognized observers;\n       (5) to provide a policy framework for United States support \n     to the Cuban people in response to the formation of a \n     transition government or a democratically elected government \n     in Cuba; and\n       (6) to protect American nationals against confiscatory \n     takings and the wrongful trafficking in property confiscated \n     by the Castro regime.\n\n     SEC. 4.

STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) the acts of the Castro government, including its \n     massive, systematic, and extraordinary violations of human \n     rights, are a threat to international peace;\n       (2) the President should advocate, and should instruct the \n     United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations \n     to propose and seek within the Security Council a \n     mandatory international embargo against the totalitarian \n     Government of Cuba pursuant to chapter VII of the Charter \n     of the United Nations, employing efforts similar to \n     consultations conducted by United States representatives \n     with respect to Haiti;\n       (3) any resumption of efforts by an independent state of \n     the former Soviet Union to make operational the nuclear \n     facility at Cienfuegos, Cuba, and the continuation of \n     intelligence activities from Cuba targeted at the United \n     States and its citizens will have a detrimental impact on \n     United States assistance to such state; and\n       (4) in view of the threat to the national security posed by \n     the operation of any nuclear facility, and the Castro \n     government's continuing blackmail to unleash another wave of \n     Cuban refugees fleeing from Castro's oppression, most of whom \n     find their way to United States shores further depleting \n     limited humanitarian and other resources of the United \n     States, the President should do all in his power to make it \n     clear to the Cuban Government that--\n       (A) the completion and operation of any nuclear power \n     facility, or\n       (B) any further political manipulation of the desire of \n     Cubans to escape that results in mass migration to the United \n     States,\n\n     will be considered an act of aggression which will be met \n     with an appropriate response in order to maintain the \n     security of the national borders of the United States and the \n     health and safety of the American people.\n\n     SEC. 102.

SALARY ADJUSTMENTS FOR THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE \n                   UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 202(a) of title 39, United States \n     Code, is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(1)'' after ``(a)'';\n       (2) by striking out the fifth and sixth sentences; and\n       (3) by adding at the end thereof the following new \n     paragraph:\n       ``(2)(A) Each Governor shall receive--\n       ``(i) a salary of $30,000 a year as adjusted by \n     subparagraph (C);\n       ``(ii) $300 a day for not more than 42 days each year, for \n     each day such Governor--\n       ``(I) attends a meeting of the Board of Governors; or\n       ``(II) performs the official business of the Board as \n     approved by the Chairman; and\n       ``(iii) reimbursement for travel and reasonable expenses \n     incurred in attending meetings and performing the official \n     business of the Board.\n       ``(B) Nothing in subparagraph (A) shall be construed to \n     limit the number of days of meetings each year to 42 days.\n       ``(C) Effective on the first day of the first applicable \n     pay period beginning on or after the date on which an \n     adjustment takes effect under section 5303 of title 5 in the \n     rates of pay under the General Schedule, the salary of each \n     Governor shall be adjusted by the percentage equal to the \n     percentage adjustment in such General Schedule rates of \n     pay.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall take effect on the first day of the first applicable \n     pay period beginning on or after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act.\n       Amend the title so as to read: ``An Act to designate the \n     United States Post Office building located at 24 Corliss \n     Street Providence, Rhode Island, as the ``Harry Kizirian Post \n     Office Building'', to amend chapter 2 of title 39, United \n     States Code, to adjust the salary of the board of Governors \n     of the United States Postal Service, and for other \n     purposes.''\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the amendment I offer today, on behalf of \nmyself and Senators Simon and Pryor, would rectify a situation which \nhas gone unattended for far too long. This amendment would, for the \nfirst time in 25 years, adjust the rate of pay for the members of the \nBoard of Governors of the U.S. Postal Service.\n  In 1970, as part of the Postal Reorganization Act, Congress created \nan 11-member Board of Governors whose duties are to direct and control \nthe expenditures and review the practices and policies of the postal \nservice. Nine of the members are private citizens who are nominated by \nthe President and confirmed by the Senate to 9-year terms. They, in \nturn, name the Postmaster General and the Deputy Postmaster General who \nalso serve on the board.\n  The Board of Governors oversees and directs the operations of a $54 \nbillion corporation which ranks 12th on the Fortune 500 list. The board \nmeets monthly, usually for 2 or 3 days.\n  The salary of the nine confirmed members of the Board was set in 1971 \nat $10,000 annually. The salary of the Postmaster General was set at \n$60,000. Today, the Postmaster General's salary is $148,000 but the \nGovernors' salary has remained unchanged at $10,000. If the Governors' \nsalary had increased by the rate of inflation, they would currently be \npaid $37,600.\n  The Governors receive an additional $300 per day for their monthly \nmeetings and reasonable travel expenses. Of course, they spend more \ntime in preparation for these meetings for which they are not paid this \ndaily meeting rate. In addition, members represent the Board on other \noccasions--such as testimony before Congress--for which they do not \nreceive the daily rate.\n  How does this compare with other boards within the Federal \nGovernment? Not well. For example, board members for Fannie Mae, Sallie \nMae, and Freddie Mac all receive at least double the annual Postal \nService Board salary. And, that doesn't take into account the much \nhigher daily meeting rates they receive.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to reprint in the Record at \nthis point a chart comparing the compensation of the Postal Service \nBoard of Governors with Fannie Mae, Sallie Mae, and Freddie Mac.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                                                    COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS                                                                                   \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n           Organization                        Board of Directors                              Retainer                                          Additional compensation                        \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUSPS.............................  9 Governors (nominated by the President,   $10,000..................................  $300 a day for not more than 42 days a year of meetings.               \n                                    confirmed by the Senate) serving 9 year                                              Reimbursed for travel and reasonable expenses.                         \n                                    terms.                                                                                                                                                      \nFannie Mae.......................  18 (13 elected annually by the common      $23,000..................................  $1,000 annually for personally attending each Board or Board committee \n                                    stockholders & 5 appointed annually by                                                meeting.

Mr. President, as we all know, the Senate is about to \nembark on a massive reordering of national priorities under the rubric \nof the reconciliation process. In the short space of the 20 hours \nprescribed by statute, we will decide the fate of Medicare, Medicaid, \nwelfare programs, education assistance, and a host of other Federal \nprograms and agencies.\n  We surely did not anticipate such abbreviated consideration of a \nsweeping reconfiguration of government when we enacted the \nCongressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which \nestablished the reconciliation process. It is regrettable that we must \ndo so now, and I suggest that in doing so we exceed the spirit if not \nthe letter of the act.\n  But we are now confronted with the determination of the majority to \nproceed nonetheless, and in anticipation of the time constraints, I \nwould like to state my continuing reservations about the bill. I have \nalready expressed my distress and concern about the decimation of hard-\nwon Federal education programs and the emasculation of the Medicare and \nMedicaid programs.\n  What remains to be said is that this mammoth bill embodies priorities \nin many other areas which are diametrically opposed to my own. It \noverturns decades of progress in social policy and it imposes a \nregressive tax plan that is both misguided and untimely. It bears \nunfairly on children, on poor people and on the elderly and the \ndisabled. And it would undo environmental gains and open pristine \nwilderness areas to commercial exploitation.\n  It would do all this in a headlong pursuit of a goal which I believe \nhas been blindly accepted, namely the mantra that the budget must be \nbalanced by a date certain. To my mind, this is an unrealistic \nobjective that results not from careful and rational assessment, but \nfrom well-orchestrated sloganeering in the guise of the so-called \ncontract devised by the House majority leadership. And that, I would \nsubmit, has led to false expectations in the electorate as well as \namong some legislators themselves.\n  Far more preferable, in my view, would be a measured and continuing \neffort to reduce deficit spending, while at the same time preserving \nthe essential gains in social policy of the last half century.\n  It is unrealistic to assume, I submit, that some $900 billion can be \ncut from Federal spending levels provided under present law between \n1996 and 2002 without imposing unacceptable hardship on many segments \nof the population. Here, the arbitrary goal has dictated the cuts; \nagain, the more rational course would be to to decide what can and \nshould be reduced and then arrive at a figure.\n  And it is equally unrealistic--and absurd on the face of it--that tax \ncuts of $245 billion could be proposed at the very time the stated \nobjective is to reduce deficits. Inevitably, such as proposal suggests \nthat spending cuts have been inflated to accommodate the tax cuts. It \nseems appalling to me that the proposed tax cuts will actually add to \nthe deficit in some years, meaning that the Treasury will actually have \nto borrow funds to make up for the lack of revenue. Overall, these \nunwise tax cuts will add some $93 billion to the national debt, \naccording to the Wall Street Journal.\n\n  Here again, a far wiser course would be one of moderation. While I \nreject \n\n[[Page S 15592]]\nmost of the proposed tax cuts as untimely at best and pandering at \nworst, I would agree that there is one area of tax relief that could be \nreasonably undertaken at this time, and that is reduction in the \ncapital gains tax rate. The provisions of the bill allowing individuals \nto exclude 50 percent of capital gains from taxation, while dropping \nthe corporate capital gains rate from 35 to 28 percent, would cost the \nTreasury some $40 billion in revenue foregone over 7 years.\n  As I see it, this would be a worthwhile expenditure. It would help \nrelease some $1.5 trillion in locked-up capital gains to pursue \ninvestment opportunities that create jobs and growth in the U.S. \neconomy. By one estimate, this would result in a rise in gross domestic \nproduct of 1.4 percent and result in $12 million in increased Federal \ntax revenues.\n  And I might note that the individual beneficiaries of capital gains \ntax relief are by no means limited to wealthy stockholders. A recently \nupdated U.S. Treasury study shows that nearly one-half of all capital \ngains are realized by taxpayers with wage and salary incomes of less \nthan $50,000. And these would include every homeowner who has benefited \nfrom an increase in the value of his house over recent years.\n  Notwithstanding my support for this one tax provision, I must \nreiterate my view that the overall tax package is untimely and \ninappropriate. Together with the other major flaws of the bill, there \nis compelling reason to vote against the bill, and good cause for the \nPresident to veto the measure, as he has promised to do, in the \nlikelihood that Congress approves it.\n  Our task will not end there. Assuming the probability that the \nPresident's veto cannot be overridden, the real work will have to begin \nto devise a compromise that can be enacted. My hope is that reason, \ncompassion, and responsibility will prevail and that the many excesses \nof this bill will be recast into a more moderate measure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/24/senate-section/article/S15591-4", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15592-S15594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON?\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I will try to confine my remarks to 10 minutes, not \nsimply to spare the distinguished occupant of the Chair from further \nduty but to try and consolidate the message so that it has meaning and \nis clearly understood.\n  Mr. President, I look at what is proposed in terms of this budget \nreconciliation, and I truly believe that the American people are being \ndeceived; that there is kind of a sneak attack on senior citizens and \nthe impoverished in our society; that they do not yet know what is \nplanned for them for their future.\n  The question that arises is a very fundamental one, and that is, \nWhose side are you on? Whose side are we on in this body when we pass \nlegislation? Are we on the side of the people who have worked hard, who \ntry to put away a few bucks, who have tried to protect their security \nin their old age, who worry about what happens to them in their golden \nyears?\n  Are we on the side of those who are making lots of money, who will \nget a benefit, the benefits of a tax cut that is being proposed as a \nresult of the exorbitant request that is being made of the senior \ncitizen population of our country or of those who are dependent on \nMedicaid? It is a backdoor attack.\n  I do not mean to insult my friends on the other side of the aisle. I \nam describing what I think is their approach to decimate a program that \nhas been of value. All one has to do is look at the human dimension as \nwe discuss these programs. Forget about the accountant's approach for \njust a moment, forget about the fact that we are strapped, that we have \nto figure out ways out of our dilemma in terms of our budget deficit. \nJust think first about the people who are affected, think of those who \nworked hard, who put away small sums of money by paying their insurance \npremiums over the years, who believe deeply that a Government contract, \na contract with their Government was something of value that could not \nbe diminished.\n  We know one thing, Mr. President. That is, that that program, the \nMedicare Program, has worked incredibly well. All you have to do is \nlook at the life expectancy in our population today and look at the \nquality of life that people can enjoy even as they age if their health \nis good, if they take care of themselves at the appropriate time, if \nthey get the right kind of medication, if they get the right kind of \nphysician attention or health care provider attention. The program has \nworked.\n  In Russia today, the former Soviet Union, the life expectancy for a \nmale on average is 57 years. Fifty-seven years in this country is \nbeginning to look like the prime of life. I know guys who are becoming \nfathers for the first time at 57 years of age. It is not something I \nrecommend. I have no opinion on it. I am simply stating a fact. Fifty-\nseven is young. Age 72, 73 is a time when lots of people can do things \nthat they did when they were much younger. I invite people to go skiing \nwith me sometime to see. I do not like to tell anybody, but my next \nbirthday is going to be my 72d birthday. I served in World War II. I \nworked hard all my life before I came to the Senate and, I think, since \nI have come to the Senate, because I believe so deeply in those things \nthat this Government of ours can and should do for its citizens.\n  We are looking at a $270 billion cut in Medicare opportunity for our \nsenior citizens, a $180 billion cut in Medicaid. Mr. President, those \nwho are dependent on Medicaid are either impoverished or disabled. The \nsenior citizen who runs out of funds, who needs nursing home care, \nwhich is becoming an evermore present condition in our society, and who \nhas to spend their time in a nursing home depends on Medicaid for care.\n  Seventy-one percent of the funds applied for Medicaid are for senior \ncitizens and the disabled, 71 percent. For the disabled, Mr. President \nwe have seen people who are totally dependent on Medicaid support for \nthe sustenance of their lives.\n  We had a young man in his 20's appear at the Budget Committee the \nother day breathing from a device on his wheelchair. And as he spoke, \nhe was obviously straining for breath, straining for volume in his \nvoice. He said, ``If they cut out Medicaid the way they are planning, \nif they reduce it the way they are planning, I will lose my ability to \ncontinue my life.'' He is a college student. And that is what is going \nto happen. This is just not an accounting exercise.\n  Mr. President, I want us to see a balanced budget in our society, in \nour country. Frankly, I am not upset whether it takes 7 years or 10 \nyears. I think if we get on the right kind of a down slope, we will be \ndoing the right thing. We have other ways of getting to a balanced \nbudget than slashing programs that the elderly depend on for their \nhealth and well-being. We do not have to spend as much on defense as we \nare spending. We do not have to spend as much giving away mining claims \nto the folks out West who get benefits from the Federal Government that \nare beyond comprehension for most people. We do not have to continue to \nsupport wealthy corporate farms or corporate ranches. That is not \nnecessary. But we do have to support those people who depend upon us \nfor their very existence. And those are the senior citizens and those \nwho live as a result of having assistance from Medicaid.\n  Mr. President, again, the question is simply put, whose side are you \non? And when we examine the sum of money, the sums that are being asked \nfor reductions in health care programs, $270 billion is in the Medicare \ncut, a $245 billion tax break, much of it for the wealthiest in our \nsociety.\n  The House proposed that if you had an income of $350,000 a year, you \nwould get a $20,000 tax break. How does that square? Mr. President, it \ndoes not square. We do not believe that it is necessary to lop $270 \nbillion off Medicaid to save the program as the proponents are \nsuggesting. This is the case where the medicine is far worse than the \ncure because it could kill you. The medicine can kill you when we start \nworrying elderly people about whether or not they are going to be able \nto continue to have health care, whether or not they are going to have \nto depend on their kids, having the kids worry about whether or not mom \nor pop or grandma or grandpop is going to have to come to them begging \nfor them to take over. That is what is going to happen if we go ahead \nwith the program as proposed.\n  (Mr. ASHCROFT assumed the chair.)\n  \n[[Page S 15593]]\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter \nI have be printed in the Record. It comes from the chief actuary for \nthe Health Care Financing Administration. It says that we need $89 \nbillion to continue Medicare and its viability until the year 2006. The \ncut proposed by the Republican majority is to take care of things until \n2002. They say it needs $270 billion. Let me correct the record, Mr. \nPresident, because I think there is an arithmetic error here. For $89 \nbillion we can take care of the program until the year 2002, $89 \nbillion versus $270 billion.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                             Health Care Financing Administration,\n\n\n                                            The Administrator,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 3, 1995.\n     Hon. Thomas Daschle, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: This is in response to your request \n     for information about the effect of the Medicare savings in \n     the President's balanced budget initiative on the exhaustion \n     date of the Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund.\n       Attached is a memorandum that I have received from the \n     Chief Actuary of the Health Care Financing Administration \n     (HCFA). The memo indicates that the year-by-year savings in \n     the President's plan, which would total $89 billion in Part A \n     over the period 1996-2002, would extend the life of the HI \n     Trust Fund from 2002 to the fourth quarter of calendar year \n     2006 (the first quarter of fiscal year 2007). This estimate \n     is based on the 1995 Annual Report of the Board of Trustees \n     of the Federal Hospital Insurance Fund intermediate \n     assumption baseline.\n       Please let me know if I can provide any further \n     information.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Bruce C. Vladeck.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I also want to include in the Record an article that \nappeared in the New York Times a couple weeks ago. It talks about the \narrangement made between the House Republican leadership and the AMA \nand about how, by reducing the reductions that the doctors and the \nhealth providers may have to take, that, in fact, they were able to get \nthe doctors, the AMA, aboard for their health plan.\n  Mr. President, while they were doing that for the doctors, they were \nnot talking to the seniors who are alarmed by the prospects that their \nhealth care options are going to be substantially reduced. And I ask \nunanimous consent that this article from the New York Times be printed \nin the Record as well.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Doctors' Group Backs Plan of Republicans on Medicare\n\n                            (By Robert Pear)\n\n       Washington, Oct. 10.--After receiving assurances that \n     Medicare payments to doctors would be cut less than \n     originally planned, the American Medical Association tonight \n     expressed support for a House Republican plan to redesign the \n     medical plan for the elderly.\n       Leaders of the association issued a statement after meeting \n     with House Speaker Newt Gingrich saying, ``A.M.A. endorses \n     House G.O.P. plan to transform Medicare.''\n       Republicans in the House and Senate alike want to cut \n     projected spending on Medicare by $270 billion, or 14 \n     percent, in the next seven years. Of that amount, $26.4 \n     billion would have come from strict new limits on Medicare \n     payments for doctors' services.\n       Kirk B. Johnson, senior vice president of the association, \n     said tonight that the doctors would receive billions of \n     dollars more than the Republicans had planned. But he and Mr. \n     Gingrich refused to give details, nor would they specify \n     which other groups might receive less money to make up the \n     difference.\n       Mr. Gingrich had been wooing the doctors all summer in the \n     hope of winning their endorsement for the Republicans' \n     Medicare plan. But just last week--a few days after details \n     of the Republican plan were disclosed--spokesmen for the \n     American Medical Association complained that the Republican \n     plan would not only slow the growth of Medicare payments to \n     doctors, but actually reduce payments for many services.\n       In response to such complaints, House Republicans made \n     unspecified financial concessions to the doctors, and their \n     support tonight was apparently one result. Mr Gingrich, \n     thrilled with the endorsement, said it showed that the \n     Republicans were willing to listen to suggestions from \n     various interest groups.\n       The president of the association, Dr. Lonnie R. Bristow, \n     said, ``This legislation will expand choices for Medicare \n     beneficiaries, allowing them to open medical savings accounts \n     in conjunction with high-deductible insurance policies, \n     enroll in private sector coverage plans or remain in the \n     traditional Medicare program.''\n       For the association, he said, the Republican plan \n     ``represents the end of a decade-long quest to put Medicare \n     on a fiscally sound basis, as well as the beginning of a new \n     journey toward delivery of appropriate quality care in a more \n     fiscally prudent environment.''\n       Dr. Bristow praised elements of the Republican plan that \n     would exempt doctors from antitrust laws in certain \n     situations and limit payment of damages to some victims of \n     medical malpractice.\n       In the debate over President Clinton's health plan last \n     year, the association endorsed the goal of universal health \n     insurance coverage, but criticized many details of the \n     Clinton plan.\n       The medical association sways votes on Capitol Hill. It has \n     shrewd lobbyists and a political action committee that \n     donates tens of thousands of dollars to congressional \n     candidates. In the battle over President Clinton's health \n     plan, the association endorsed the goal of health insurance \n     coverage for all Americans, but criticized many details of \n     his plan and wavered in its support for his proposal that all \n     employers be required to buy health insurance for their \n     employees. The association's failure to endorse Mr. Clinton's \n     plan was politically damaging to the White House.\n       Elsewhere on Capitol Hill, Republican efforts to revamp \n     Medicare gained momentum today as House Republicans voted \n     down a series of Democratic proposals that would have \n     established consumer protections for Medicare beneficiaries \n     who join private health plans.\n       Democrats repeatedly failed in their efforts to set \n     detailed Federal standards for such private health plans, \n     which would serve millions of elderly people under the \n     Republican plan. Democrats said the standards were needed to \n     protect those who enrolled in the plans. Republicans said \n     they would stifle growth of the health care market.\n       The House Ways and Means Committee appeared today to be \n     moving on schedule toward approving the Republicans' plan to \n     cut projected spending on Medicare by $270 billion, or 14 \n     percent, in the next seven years. The committee is expected \n     to approve the legislation on Wednesday, with the full House \n     likely to vote on a Medicare bill next week. The Senate \n     Finance Committee has approved similar legislation.\n       Democrats noted that the Ways and Means Committee worked on \n     the legislation for 14 hours on Monday, and they complained \n     that the panel was moving too fast. ``What is the hurry?'' \n     Representative Sam M. Gibbons, Democrat of Florida, asked \n     today. Republicans said they were moving quickly to save \n     Medicare from bankruptcy.\n       The heart of the Republican measure is a proposal to open \n     Medicare to hundreds of private health plans, so elderly \n     people would have a much wider range of health insurance \n     options. Democrats today offered numerous amendments to \n     remedy what they see as severe weaknesses in the Republicans \n     plan, but the proposals were rejected, generally on party-\n     line votes.\n       By a vote of 22 to 13, the Ways and Means Committee \n     defeated a proposal by Representative Pete Stark, Democrat of \n     California, to set detailed Federal standards for private \n     health plans enrolling Medicare beneficiaries. He would, for \n     example, have required such plans to serve all parts of a \n     metropolitan area, not just the affluent neighborhoods. Bruce \n     C. Vladeck, who supervises Medicare as administrator of the \n     Federal Health Care Financing Administration, said that under \n     the Republican bill ``health plans could gerrymander their \n     service areas so that minorities and low-income people will \n     not be offered the same choices as everyone else.''\n       Consumers Union and the American Association of Retired \n     Persons supported Mr. Stark's proposal, but Republicans \n     rejected it, saying such Federal regulation would frustrate \n     the development of a private health insurance market for the \n     elderly. Representative Bill Thomas, Republican of \n     California, said the Democrats would establish ``an \n     entangling bureaucratic structure.''\n       Today's debate was bitterly partisan and acrimonious, full \n     of snide remarks. Lucia DiVenere, a lobbyist with the \n     National Association for Home Care, said: ``What you see \n     here, in microcosm, are two totally different approaches to \n     Government, two philosophies completely at odds with each \n     other. It's all black or white. There is no gray area.''\n       Mr. Stark said the elderly needed the Government to protect \n     them because the Republicans were ``forcing Medicare \n     beneficiaries into the arms of private for-profit insurance \n     companies.'' Republicans replied that the Democrats' \n     proposals for more Federal regulation would perpetuate the \n     heavy hand of Government. Representative Nancy L. Johnson, \n     Republican of Connecticut, said the Democrats' proposals were \n     evidence of ``old thinking, the view that Government can \n     serve seniors better than the private sector'' can.\n       To help control Medicare costs, the Republicans would limit \n     the growth of Federal payments to health maintenance \n     organizations and other private health plans. Democrats today \n     proposed to eliminate these limits, saying they would force \n     H.M.O.'s to cut services or increase premiums. ``Let's not \n     tie Medicare payment levels to arbitrary budget caps,'' said \n     Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan.\n       The Democrats' basic theme is that some of the Republicans \n     policy proposals would \n\n[[Page S 15594]]\n     make sense if the Republicans were not simultaneously squeezing $270 \n     billion out of Medicare.\n       The Republicans describe the various private health \n     insurance options as ``Medicare Plus.'' But Mr. Gibbons told \n     them: ``You ought to call it Medicare Minus. What you're \n     doing is herding all the seniors together and forcing them to \n     accept managed care.''\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair.\n  I would just like to read from the article for a couple seconds.\n\n       After receiving assurances that Medicare payments to \n     doctors would be cut less than originally planned, the \n     American Medical Association tonight expressed support for a \n     House Republican plan to redesign the medical plan for the \n     elderly. * * *\n  Republicans in the House and Senate alike want to cut projected \nspending on Medicare by $270 billion . . . in the next seven years. Of \nthat amount, $26.4 billion would have come from strict new limits on \nMedicare payments for doctors' services.\n\n  Obviously, that was obviated or the AMA in this case would not have \ncome along.\n  Mr. President, what this budget does is painful. It doubles the \npremiums for part B from $46 a month to $93 a month. It doubles part B \ndeductibles from $100 to $210. It hurts seniors who want to stay in fee \nfor service. It will mean a cut of $6 billion in the State of New \nJersey that would cause us to lose the services of 40 out of 110 \nhospitals in our State, when combined with the Medicaid cuts.\n  In short, this proposal, as it is outlined, would result in disaster \nfor our senior citizen population.\n  The arithmetic is very simply displayed on this chart. ``The GOP's \nNew Medicare Plan: The Untold,'' I call it the sneak attack, ``The \nUntold Story.'' Mr. President, $270 billion worth of proposed cuts, $89 \nbillion is needed for the trust fund. It leaves $181 billion, and where \nis it going? It is going for tax breaks for the well-off.\n  And so, when we finally vote on this reconciliation bill, one I voted \nagainst in committee--I am on the Budget Committee--and one that I \ncontinue to view as harmful to the very structure of our society, \nbreaking promises with people to whom we have had arrangements, I know \none thing: That I am going to be on the side of the senior citizen. I \nam going to be on the side of the students in this country who are \ndepending on our Government for help in getting their education. I am \ngoing to be on the side of those who need Medicaid for their support, \nand I am going to vote ``no'' on this budget reconciliation bill.\n  The one thing I hope will come out in the debate these next couple of \ndays is that the American people will fully realize what it is that is \nbeing proposed; that the notion that these cuts have to be made to save \nthe program are patently false, they are untrue and that what we have \nto do is put our thinking caps together, sit down and take the time \nnecessary to redesign a program that will fit the bill, that will not \ncontinue to exacerbate the budget deficit situation.\n  So, Mr. President, as we close the debate this evening, I hope that \nour colleagues in the Senate will continue to examine this proposal \nthat is in front of us and reject it when the time comes and to think \nabout the folks back home and those who are depending on it.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/24/senate-section/article/S15592-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
